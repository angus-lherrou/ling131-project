sun goddess who created the Japanese island\nThe emperor God do you mean the the amber who's considered a God\nUsed to be yes but not anymore right now he is a symbol of the state and then the people but again Japanese don't exclusively claim one religion over another so these are just stories and miss that are passed down and children just learn what you're supposed to do when you go to a single shrine\nIs kind of like it gives your society some basic parameters some cultural ideals it's sort of like a a classroom for ethics\nYes you could say that and it's the idea of sacred ... making things\nClean and purifying getting rid of evil spirits and so there are many holidays that celebrate something\nA sheet though and there's regional festivals harvest festivals or ... rice planting festivals that are related to ... though so it's kind of blended into the daily life\nI was struck by a I was just confused at holiday time 'cause I was in Japan over Christmas one year and and

Japan what's the respect for women in public in the workplace and so on and then the domestic world these days or just in general\nYeah so I think things are changing quite a bit the marriage rate has gone down and so has the birth rate because a lot of women\nPreferred to develop their career or start their own business or go abroad to study or even go overseas to start a business [laughter] so it's not quite as traditional as you might imagine and I think people do respect women and um there are many opportunities\nIn terms of employment in a large company they often have two tracks that women can choose from one is to go the managerial route where you're committed to\nWorking long hours for the company going on business trips and working just like the men are expected to but the other track is for women who value their own free time and don't expect to have a life long career than there are more like secretaries or support staff\nAnd sometimes then they quit when they get

is is pretty much said we're going to demand a little more respect\nI don't know if I put it in terms of demand respect but they're going ahead and doing what they want to do that on their own and not not necessarily thinking that you have to go to university and then get a job in a big company why not start your own company or right start some kind of news service or go overseas\nOur phone number
