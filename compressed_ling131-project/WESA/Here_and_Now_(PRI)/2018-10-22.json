I Can't even remember a time before the smartphone existed and that's a time when social life is very important where teams are forming their identity\nWhen what\nReally shapes on a lot of times is the time that they spend with their friends and how they spend time with their friends has fundamentally shifted to go on line social media and texting and away from hanging out with each other in person\nDo you see people in this generation who shunned this way of life who who decided that they don't want to be on their phones all the time even though they've never known any other way\nWell there is certainly awareness or that a lot of times they're spending too much time on their phones they well in their own words often describe themselves as addicted\nBut Ninety five percent of teens I'm outta smartphone now and it it is become it has become normative to spend hours and hours a day on the phone to always respond to your friends text instantly to want to be the first to post a like a ... and so it's a real cultural norm that shifted\nAnother thing that is different about this generation we we've been hearing that the generations are becoming more diverse in this country but Generation Z or our Gen is actually even more diverse than the millennial generation\nYeah absolutely so they are the most diverse generation in American history\nAnd that's reflected in these big um service that I work with whether asked about um their experiences with um people from different backgrounds so say high school students of course because the high schools they go to a more diverse much more likely to um have friends of other races and ethnicities to hang out with people from different backgrounds\nThat's definitely more common among ige and then it was just say ten years ago with the millennials\nWe mentioned nine eleven how do you think U.S foreign policy has shaped this generation\nWell\nThat's hard to tell from the the data that we have because um you know foreign policy arguably it's changed the most in the last few years with the Trump Administration and we don't have that survey data yet\nBut the U.S has been at war for the entire lives of many of these people\n[noise] true um but because there's not a draft that hasn't had a direct effect on the majority of the country\nHowever companies marketing to this generation in a different way than they have to the millennials for example\nYeah they they do have to market to this generation differently because there's this such that big a generational shift I think a lot of them are picking up on the same trends that show up in these big surveys such as I Jen is really interested in safe\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet the Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nA conversation and what they say in um you know they're in their attitudes and in their behaviors is very interested in physical safety and what they call emotional safety\nAnd I think that's something companies are starting to pick up on and um I think is well that there's a lot more awareness around stress and anxiety that um companies are realizing as another theme um with this group\nSo we're just a a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections do you think that many of these potential voters will actually vote Generation Z people\n[noise] I Wish I could say yes I'm\nBy statistics from past elections and what they say about their attitudes toward getting involved in politics and government in voting are not encouraging so in these big surveys Eighteen year olds are now less likely to say they're interested in government or social issues\nOr politics Dan ... say Twenty years ago what do you think so um well because there's so many other things to do\nThere's always the possibility of a you know something new to say on I'm On social media or new game to play or a new series to watch on Netflix and you know I think some ... some of the interviews that I did a lot of teens\nYou know say well you know we have all these other things to do while we pay attention to the news I only do that if I have to do that for a class was very common response that I heard\n... interesting I mean I've had many conversations with people who are in this generation and I always find that yes they they are definitely more reliant on their phones their mobile devices the Internet in general um but they're also often really smart I I'm quite impressed sometimes when I speak with them\nSo absolutely they're definitely smart I mean they've they've had access to all of this information and um they're they're quick thinkers on there's actually data showing that IQ has has gone up ... over the generations so I think yeah smarts is is definitely not the issue\nSo obviously a generation Z is going to have to deal with some of these problems on their own as they get older and and and even right now what can those of us in the other generations due

HBO documentary stolen daughters kidnapped by Boko Haram\nIt airs on HBO tonight and joining us now is writer producer Karen Edwards welcome\nHigh and producer Sasha Achilles with us as Well hi Sasha I think he said the girls that we first meet in your documentary of the ones who were released by Boko Haram and living in a compound apart from their families\nAnd their captivity was the one thing the government didn't want you to ask about wasn't it\nYeah it was a part of the condition of the access we host the ... the access with the government's consent it was the only way to do it\nBut they were adamant that we shouldn't speak to the details about what happened to them during the three is that they were held by Boko Haram why am partly a I mean they you know the government's his cane that they control the narrative but also we the girls were released in may we\nStarted filming with them in the government's safe house in early July so it was they had only been out of captivity [noise] for about six weeks so it was quite well they um\n... still processing what had happened to them so that was part of it it wasn't for us when our counselors to push them into reliving and telling his what had happened that we tried to give them the ... in the space to if they wish to\nBuddy ... any time we were alone with the girls the government minders and security shopping down quite quickly so to vote I think the government also wanted to manage how\nThe rest of the world on Nigeria see that goes time in captivity because they were held a three is the full ... down and they were really\nWell what do we know about their time in captivity and what would what it was like\nWell they they um low they was free to speak to his they did give us that diaries discreetly\nIt and they kind of make it clear that life wasn't good that they\nWere forced to marry if not they would have the\nWhat they call ... in the full ... treatment [noise] ah and in the film what we do is the uh the ... who had taken would actually just the tip of the ice but there are thousands of delve in Nigeria have taken by Boko Haram\nWho are free to speak and they do tell us walked the Boko Haram treatment is so through that\nTestimony we get a sense of what happened to the to the book goes as\nWell so it's actually let me bring you in because uh you know the idea that they were forced to marry there's one girl in your film who was married had a kid\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nCalled to tell the emotions that she's dealing with with this kid she's I still love love my son he's he's my baby but he's even though he's a Boko Haram baby\n[noise] yeah so what we were told by a a lot of the goals that we interviewed who and all and the film and that you kind of had two options in the forest either you marry a ... or you become a slave\nAnd if you're a slave than you know life is not taught us so it's a question of kind of survival and in a way even if you end up marrying a soul to the Gulf felt like they you know we're right\nAnd and we're supposed to be that why I say she as she says I was two months pregnant when I ran away and when we fast that had like she she did tell us I don't love\nMy baby as much as I Love the two little boys my baby of reminds me of what happened to me\nNow you mentioned the boys we we we see these two boys in the film who actually were kidnapped as well uh and ended up being made into child soldiers\nYeah I'd say one of the untold stories is the number of boys and men who have ... have either been kidnapped or killed during this will\nSay about ... than kidnapping children but also older men and uh some of them are forced to pick up arms and fights\nAnd then when the military engage with the car um and and they tried to take back territory they will kill an arrest or people who look like soldiers and so a lot of men have been killed in this fight in the process of trying to eradicate Boko Haram\nIt's kind of amazing watching\nHow terrible the situation is and and as you report so many people have not been kidnapped but they're just fled their towns out of fear of vogue around they're living in these tent camps um that this isn't getting more attention\nGlobally yeah it's a functioning I think all the focus has been on Syria and yet the famine in the north east of Nigeria\nIs just terrible it's a very widespread and high level and they all will running two towns in these they call them id become a intently displaced people\nAnd that's why they have to run to cause Boko Haram you know they've done just could not then the and destroyed villages and it's just not safe to live up there anymore even though places like my degree which is kind of\nA one of the the main towns it's incredibly dangerous but who says safety by numbers on the Web the food aid is going to see how if you want food and you won't live that's why you have to them\nAnd their their outcomes but then a lot of the I Love the timing displaced people end up living within the community so\nDespite the fact that the ... there is some fair towards people who have escaped Boko Haram but they've also been incredibly welcoming to the numbers displaced people who have come tomato Goree\nWell let's talk about that the the people who have managed to escape from captivity by Boko Haram they try to go back into society and everybody thinks that they're somebody that they should be suspicious of\nI mean I'm made a gory event a kind of normal front

networks new experiment in advertising Fox replaced most of the three to four minute commercial breaks in prime time with nine sixty second breaks in a pair of five and a half minute blocks of branded content\nHere's a promo for a block of branded content that ran after Family Guy\n... more or less Fox afterward only rarely do we fought for skin they listen to ... take on prime time with a five minute we can recap you've got to say whether you\nThe Sunday Edition sponsored by Google makes over a\nHearing now media analyst John Carroll joins us now John that we just heard there that ad sounds like pretty much any commercial that I Would hear on TV so what what's going on with ranking behind this\nRight that's an ad for an ad basically it's promo for a block of brand the content of the overall thinking here Fox believes and many people do that\nAudiences are allergic to advertising so they're trying to do two things they're trying to reduce the number of traditional spots and also trying to reform at some of the advertising into branded content which is marketing package as entertainment or new ...\nAll right let's take this first change Fox is calling it the night and these nine second sixty second breast sorry to be nine sixty second breaks jazz pods jazz pots what's that mean\nThe jazz is just a and Z which means should traditionally the first and last commercials in a regular commercial pilot so what they're doing is they're basically putting these in sixty second units which are actually eighty second you're does have got a promo when there but they've got a countdown clock to make it a to ease the pain of watching it\nAnd then also the goal of this branded content because people don't like watching the ads that they're trying to ease the pain\nRight so brand new concept is really adds an sheets\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... say Pittsburgh's NPR News they found a free press\nAnd there were these spooky vignettes sponsored by Skittles and M. and m's and ah and other Mars candy ... brands and and basically it's due to a website with more of that kind of content\nIt's OK Fox says the new format reduces commercial time in primetime by fifty percent but then when you start to add in that brand new content that you just talked about over all the marketing starts to float back up again so what's what's the financial model for this\nSort of financial model is to charge more for the jazz pod so they could be double or triple the standard rate for a Sunday night at a they're hoping that that will make up for the reduction in in volume advertisers like this they're not sure yet they have they they believe that having fewer ads on the air\nIs worth something they're not sure how much it's worth\nSo this is still pretty tentative right now\nOkay so traditional TV spots might be decreasing on Fox but advertising is not going away as if we ever really thought it\nWould rise right as they say the sports broadcast you can't stop advertising you can only hope to contain\nA John Carroll here and now media analyst thanks very much thank you so is Fox re thinks the future of advertising Americans are also rethinking their relationship with the automobile\nRide sharing and now car sharing have disrupted the taxi and rental car industry is\nThere are also pushing some people to reconsider car ownership altogether and that is the goal of our next guest Sam ... is founder and CEO of a company called get around it allows you to rent your own personal car to other drivers\nAnd he joins us now from San Francisco for our latest installment of view from the top conversations with business leaders\nSamuel company wants to build up a rental market for under utilized cars and that's because for most of us are cars just sit unused for most of the day in a parking lot\nYeah well I mean if you look at the dynamic for example here in the United states we have almost turned fifty million passenger vehicles and they sit around for pretty much twenty four hours a day\nAnd so get around really allows us to address this problem of car overpopulation by using the cars we already own source that are buying a car you can rent one from someone living nearby\nSo what's your goal I mean do you hope that someday there will that old cars will be shared\nYeah we fundamentally believe that that has to happen needs to happen and that you know where we are today with personal car ownership that the entire ecosystem needs to be disrupted and and that will move to a world where personal private ownership is actually no longer the majority of the minority and that every car will be assured car\nOkay so let's talk about the specifics how get around works are right now it's available and what Seventy cities around the country correct you get an app you see what cars are around you and then what\nYeah so you don't arrive you can look at the cars around you you can find that when you like to rent for anywhere from an hour or two you know multiple days you picked our car we run a real quick check instantly to make sure that you know your driver's license is valid and then instantly you have a car you locate it from the phone\nA lock the doors and try and you can rent some pretty nice cars by the way yes you can you know you can get anything from a previous to attack us led to a Porsche people share all sorts of ...\nWell let's talk about the competition because there is a lot of it there's Toro which has one point seven million monthly active users car to go as something like eight hundred thousand there's your company and then there's the old man of the group Zipcar which has been around probably the longest do you think the markets too crowded\nNo we think this is a mass of opportunity this disrupting a trillion dollar market which has car ownership and so the main competitor here is people\nDreaming on WGN applauded by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation in the town on a master's program [noise]\nAny dot edu flash I I I\nMet her as might also be something like ... or lift um costs automotive recently did a survey that said\nThat those companies sought customer's increase by Seventy seven percent since two thousand and Fifteen but car sharing only increased by Seventeen percent what do you what do you think about that I mean are people really eager to rent their car from a stranger when they could just jumping to lift\nHere so I don't know the methodology on the clock study um I I certainly know what we've seen in it's been much much higher than Seventeen percent increase in businesses twenty Fifteen\nSo you know I think that the way we think about that and what we hear from our customers\nIs that people are looking at moving away from ownership but they can't rely purely on ride sharing um they can't rely on car sharing\nThey need a combination of you know public transit car sharing and Roger to really allow them to live car free in fact we have a very public partnership with over a where they've heard the same thing from the user base and so that's why we came together as two companies to offer a more complete set of solutions to the marketplace\nSo you believe people really do want to live without a car\nI think if you offered them mobility and equivalent level as you get today from ownership that's absolutely true you know\nThis summer you got a big injection of cash three hundred million dollars from softbank the Japanese from what's your plan for the money\nIt's pretty straightforward I mean we plan to continue doubling down on expanding into new cities are both the United states and her nationally and then you know we've been very fortunate to partners some some great companies like to ... versus continue investing those partnerships and expanding our or Russia or partners\nWill speaking of labor and Toyota neither company is also that are looking into self driving cars right so what kind of opportunity do you have if cars are driving themselves\nIs a great question and it's something that we've since day one than\nSort of very aware of in fact it was a ton of cars that drove us to the idea of getting around which is if you're going to drive itself would you really park at twenty two or twenty three hours a day you'd probably the other people use it and this maybe you'd start with friends and family are colleagues but eventually strangers just makes sense\nSo we really see the rise of autonomy as it begins to become a more prevalent as something that makes our marketplace more fluid allows those carts be used by more people different cases and in fact as autonomy comes around it actually opens a lot more opportunity as to what can be done\nThrough a you know a marketplace get around or checking people or owners of vehicles with um you know companies and individuals that need access to\nI'm just thinking how that would work let's go Fifteen twenty fifty years down the road I told him if he had colds are here and they're here to stay [noise] would I just call a vehicle from somebody's parking space that isn't being used to have it come to me then drop it off and then they would go somewhere else\nYeah I think you can imagine that but I mean in the world were fifty years out and autonomy as sort of a mainstream technology I think you think you're actually in a world where", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "22"}
