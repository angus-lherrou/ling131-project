have this ability\nWe found some very small differences in the way that their brains function and I think that sort of direction that the research may be going in future\n[noise] is it a matter of having a very very good memory or is it a completely different function of the brain altogether\nWe think it's a different function as it's quite an interesting question that because\nPeople have done research on a world champion soup and memorize those who passed can count hundreds of ... something like this\nAnd when they tested they face recognition ability they found that they would not very good at pool on the other hand super recognizes seems to have average IQ they seem to be average at recognizing other types of objects recognizing sort of streams and numbers and words and things like that\nSo it does seem as though it's a unique skill that these specific to faces\nWould there be an evolutionary reason why humans might develop a skill like this\nNot in fact was the opposite because as you could imagine and ... and sort of pre history people lived in very very small communities needing to know a large number of faces wouldn't serve being very necessary so so that sort of\nStrange
