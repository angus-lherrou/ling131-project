E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program\nAt CMU dot edu flash I I I\nDid think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest\nThat a black boys in school in particular are more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls are experiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girl and having space to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing\nThe stereotypes that we see of black women are imposed on them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior explain that sure well if I\nAm a young African American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person and a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is\nI don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white\nBut that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated because their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school\nAnd if you are in a school like that\nThe honor students are black\nBut if you are in a predominantly white school the honor group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower attracts if that's what your school looks like\nThen you are likely to think doing well in school being in that on his track is so called acting why it's such a vicious cycle because very often\nThe kids are in those lower ... maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a higher tractors a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is that sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in and in fact tracking often does result in re segregation we'd end\nRacially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about the kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings\nPerhaps because they are less well prepared and maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that because there's also data that suggests that black kids who test as well on placement exams are still less likely to be placed\nIn those upper attracts you know the the deliberate school so they looked at\nResearch it was probably yours in your book but to read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores that has still not be placed so what do we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like segregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us\nTo the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counseling for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four the notion of bussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city out to the suburbs very good schools but all white schools\nIt was kind of a failure at first talk a little bit about that and then what sure so most of the children who are traveling from Boston and to the suburban schools are black or Latino and often there's a sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet very Pittsburgh NPR News the sound of a free press\nOf the black kids in particular they often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing\nThere's also may not um echo but you had another anecdote about a young girl who was in a school a majority white and a teacher saying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to say how we're going to get\nTo the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we live in the city but she doesn't say that and to teach you get so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance\nThat she then ends up saying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which\nAdds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling exactly that teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really belong in that school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved\nAnd uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had wait a minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his own room [laughter]\nIt sounds like there isn't it but what the difference between this experience and the little red schoolhouse is that they did it for a year and then they evaluated how it worked and what they found was that the children who were having that experience\nImproved academically and also they became more engaged socially why what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids said they felt more supported\nThey had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them so if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus you could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and then the more focused in class or if something happened in class\nLet's say here's an example that one of the kids provided in this study\nUm they were watching a film eyes on the prize which is about the civil rights era and some of the white kids were laughing at something that happened in the film something that the black kids found upsetting\nAnd so the fact that their white peers were laughing as though it were funny and the black as we're feeling like this is horrible\nI'm was upsetting to them rather than a walking around agitated they were able to talk about it the brief it so to sort of speak in that um [noise] time together in ways that they found helpful by the way the title of your book again why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria\nNobody ever asked why why kids are in the cafeteria their bonding in in many ways\nAbsolutely and it's also important to
