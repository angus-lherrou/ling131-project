why someone who was profoundly troubled by the old agreement\nShould be happy with the new agreement so this is more in the nature of a publicity stunt than an international diplomatic act\nSo when

of North America to remain unified when we face very serious challenges from Asia\nHas been constrained this has been the most short sighted of strategies for the most negligible game\nDo you feel the same way about what's happening these heavy trade with China right now\nI didn't see there are major issues in the U.S China\nTrading relationship it seems to me the strategies we have used to go after them have been quite problematic they emboldened the strongest in most hostile to the United states elements within the Chinese government\nThey encourage the Chinese on a road to self sufficiency and independence from the United states which ultimately will reduce our leverage and influence\nThey fail to mobilize the moral and political force of the entire international community which surely the most effective way to influence\nChinese behavior I think that any conscientious American administration would be addressing issues about Chinese trade practices and in particular ones relating to intellectual property but I don't think\nThe strategy or the tactics has been well calculated to maximize long run American interests\nAnd what about President Trump's argument that us coffers are filling up because of these terrorists that were collecting a lot more money on everything that is being brought in from China\nThey're all kinds of ways of raising taxes if you want tariffs our taxes\nThey are taxes the fall principally on the goods that people buy and the inputs the companies need in order to compete\nThat's why their taxes that are particularly regressive and particularly inefficient and so there's something very odd about an administration that prides itself on its tax cutting\nFocusing on cutting the taxes for corporations and raising the taxes\nUh the

and\nRaising the taxes\nOn uh the ordinary goods the toys that parents by for their kids Christmas\nSo are you surprised then that Republicans who have long campaigned on being tax cutters and being against taxes are not speaking up about these tariffs\nI've stopped being surprised at Republican craven this in front of President Trump\nIs clear and you know I'm an economist not a politician or a political scientist\nBut it's quite clear that a Republican congressmen and senators are in great fear of a primary challenge sponsored and supported by President Trump\nAnd President Trump may not have a majority within America with him and beat his approval rating suggests that it's well under fifty percent but he does have a big majority within the Republican Party\nAnd he's prepared to ruthlessly use that to impose party discipline and therefore he is able to a\nRally Republican congressmen and senators who value their survival as political leaders more than their previous convictions\nTo stand by his side you know the book has moved somewhat out of fashion but John Kennedy wrote a great book called profiles in courage about senators who were guarded their\nCore beliefs

reversible error at any error in terms of tipping the economy into recession is likely to take a very long time to reverse\nI'm One who believes that we have a very different economy than we used to therefore I think the approach that's being pursued is okay and I would not be one or to criticize it certainly not one to criticize it on the grounds that we should have even more rapid increases in interest rates than we do I\nI have an interesting theory that I just heard from somebody in the banking industry at a major bank and and he was saying that the unemployment rate may actually be getting so low that they're going to be a lotta people hired for jobs that they shouldn't have been paid too much money and that's where inflation is going to come from what do you think about

years about early retirement a couple who sold their home traveling in staying in other people's homes to save money\nMillennials who work day and night to earn a million dollars and live off

podcasts and read it message boards sharing ideas like how's hacking you buy a home rent out all the rooms you crash on the couch\nOr work at a place with free food Scott ... and his wife Taylor are on fire they were earning a hundred and sixty thousand dollars a year living in a beach town driving a BMW and then\nLet's let Scott tell that he joined us from Bend Oregon Scott welcome\nI thanks for having me well nice to speak with you and I understand you heard a pod cast with one of the gurus of this movement Mr money must ask this is Pete adding the what was it that he said that made you and your wife so a roughly change your lives you move you\nStarted saving you were determined to to retire what what what did you hear\nInitially what was so intriguing to me was he sounded so optimistic and um for someone who's living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year which is how he was introduced on that I cast that was very interesting to me\nAt that time I was actually looking for my own million dollar idea to kind of get out of the stresses that I felt from our spend the lifestyle\nTalked about those stresses you are creative director at a creative agency and I imagine in the homes got nice\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nOh he was introduced on that podcast that was very interesting to me at that time I was actually looking for my own million dollar idea to kind of get out of the stresses that I felt from our spend the lifestyle\nTalked about those stresses you are creative director at a creative agency and I'm imagining the homes got nicer and the cars got nicer and the clubs you belong to that nice or is that what was there that kind of escalation going on\nThat's exactly right it was this unintentional lifestyle creep we originally moved into this little five hundred square foot apartment in this little beach town and our our costs are much lower than and you know as we got older and we had a baby um you know some of our knees were were changing but also our taste\nYou know we found ourselves eating out quite a bit we found ourselves are moving to a larger three bedroom apartment and you know we moved there when the recession was in full force but fast forward a couple of years and things were gaining steam and rents were going through the roof and you know I'll be honest the\nFinancial literacy wasn't in top shape at that time and so\nTo hear that someone was that happy living on twenty seven thousand dollars a year as well so intriguing to me in the beginning\nWell again the thing that happened is that your wife Taylor she looked at a retirement calculator\n[laughter] so uh once I started going down the rabbit hole and learning about some of these tactics and strategy is from from now my friends but at the time my my heroes I implemented the retirement capital or kind of understand our situation and when I first plug the numbers into what current spending was\nIt looked like we would probably be retiring in our eighties\nAnd uh and when I ran some models on what I thought we could live on reasonably based off of some major life changes uh I realized that we could probably retire in about ten years if we really stuck to it as well put her over the edge\nOkay so this is the sense that you could be unburden from the cost of your own lifestyle that you could get out of maybe a rat race you'd gotten into did you not like your job\nYou know it's funny I personally really like my job and it for me it's not about work for me it was about uh bring myself from this idea of mandatory labor\nYou know there's passions that I have that may not necessarily coincide with earning a lot of money or earning money at all and to have the time to pursue that felt like more like the type of life I'd want to live so when I realized that there was a potential for that I mean it was intoxicated\nOK so a couple of things first of all when you say this mandatory labor many of us just said you mean a job which is you know how the world turns around but what you and your wife did just to keep the story going his way it's a major part of this FIRE movement it's called arbitrage\nYou moves you had to move to a a less expensive towns here in Bend Oregon now but I just kind of call out something that I'm seeing from a lot of these people who are in the FIRE movement\nA lot you seem really creative so you are making a documentary about your FIRE movement and you're reading a book about your FIRE movement haven't you just replace your creative director job with film director author\nOr [laughter] you know it's funny I I've I've now met a lot of people in this fire community and the one thing that seems to stay very relevant true is that you know you don't meet a lot of people who are just straight up retired doing absolutely nothing right I haven't met anyone that's been like that\nWe should say there's different levels or this is according to our reading this lean fire where people are extremely frugal fat fire where people have a more typical standard of living but they save and invest ... to fire you work part time or like a Starbucks [laughter] so you can get\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nRate up retired doing absolutely nothing right I haven't met anyone that's been like that\nAnd we should say there's different levels or this is according to our reading there's lean fire where people are extremely frugal fat fire where people have a more typical standard of living but they save and invest brief to fire you work part time at like a Starbucks [laughter] so you can get health insurance\nBut the ... yeah yeah the interesting part talk about that because\nThis isn't like decades ago um when Scott and Helen Nearing two incredible people\nDecided to live off the land and kick the rat race and they wrote a book called simple living I Can't recommended enough that the whole goal was not to make too big a footprint seeing that this isn't really that a lot of this is people who are working very hard to play the investment game\nAnd have enough investments that they can live off their investments which is very different\nYou know then kind of a hippie getting out of the rat race\nOne of the the main draws for me was the ease at which the investment strategy takes place and when I found out about index funds these low cost index funds\nAnd how much money you could save by not having a financial advisor you're essentially betting on the stock market which in its history has always gone up now it goes through these big dips in dives\nAnd if you can ride those way that you can ride those lows and you'll end up on the right side of that so when I realized it was as easy as set it and forget it that was really really a a nice entry point for me\nWell in part of this in order to do this and there's a sort of a goal or in the FIRE movement of Seventy percent savings\nThe whole framework is really flexible if you increase your savings rate by ten percent you're ten percent better off\nMy wife and I made it to a Seventy percent savings rate and to be completely honest with you were absolutely miserable and we go to great lengths to get there the reason why we made the film and wrote the book is we're trying to share our story with people so that they can understand what it's like so that they can eliminate the excuses that stopping them\nFrom some of the changes you made to help save that money that even though you're miserable what were some of the things you were doing\n[laughter] yeah I mean one of the things that we did was we set a whole ah you know adventure up to to go and find a new place to live we wanted to make sure that\nOur quality of life wouldn't suffer you know there was a lot of different things that we implemented but part of that was since we're on the road for a year we we actually we went and spent some time living with our parents for a couple of months to save as much money as we possibly could get them a little bit of time with their new granddaughter\nAnd we thought that'd be a nice combo punch what we found was that are being in our mid thirties with a two year old living in the basement of our parents out maybe with a little extreme maybe a bad idea\nAnd then on top of that I think there was a lot of unknowns are leaving a community behind that we we invested in that we loved leaving our friends leaving what we knew um and I think we we kind of dealt with that stuff ah while we were living in the air and space and\nBy the way people have pointed out this isn't something you can do if you don't have parents you can move in with or if you have a huge student loan debt or if you don't you know if you don't work in an area where you can read a high salary and then turn around and invested in your future so it's it's not for everyone\nBut it just so here you are doing this and I've been hearing of people doing fire we'd like one million one point two million one point five million invested that seems that's a lot of money but you're potentially going to live Seventy more years [noise] I mean have you ever thought about that\nDreaming on W.

everything a voucher cheese she'll go beef so there was very great shortages London was filled with bombs science everything was blitzed and horrible\nWhat was interesting is that that generation mess they matured and became teenagers invented everything rock and roll photographers became one for a photographer you that was ... because there was nobody else that\nYou know they they don't have been in the army was just coming home so that wasn't anybody ahead of us so in a way that was a wonderful blank canvas and we got really lucky because they were saying oh you're just like not shall we had

Smith who a Ford says was there\nA it includes drinking and it is on a weekday which Kavanaugh sort of tried to downplay the extent to which\nUh he and his friends got together for beers on weekdays there all these ways in which a that event reinforces even if that wasn't the day on which\nAn incident had occurred it reinforces that such things did happen over the course of that summer\nWhich is something the cat and I went to great pains to deny\nKevin as your book has also become the focus of scrutiny this is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse reading from Kevin ... country\nHave you I don't know if it's ... or ... how do you pronounce that refers to flatulence we were sixteen okay [noise]\nAnd so when your friend mark judge said the same put the same thing as your book page back to you at the same meaning it was flatulence\nI don't know what he did but that's my recollection and we want to talk about flatulence such a sixteen year old page on 'em game\n... Philip bump that's not what this means\nWell it's sort of unclear one booth means in that context right I mean I I I'm not really a booth truth or if you will on this particular subject I mean there's you know in high school you have little terms that you use with your friends and and they can very pretty wisely\nBut it seems pretty clear that the broader effort the Kavanaugh was undertaking there was two each time there was a pretty obvious as a reference to drinking that was made in your book he tried to redirect away from the fact that they were talking about drinking heavily\nYou know he he said that the beach week Ralph club which is pretty obviously right a reference to him drinking Latin and vomiting was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of blue for his ... however it relates to drinking the fact is that the year because he makes very clear that drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nAnd just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says that moved refers to anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kavanaugh about another term and is your book devil's triangle here is devil's triangle\n\nIt was a function of him having a weak stomach so whatever the definition of booth is ... however it relates to drinking the fact is that the year because we make very clear that drinking was a big part of his high school experience\nWell and just by the way I mean of course it's crowd source but the Urban Dictionary says that moved refers to anal sex or this is Sheldon Whitehouse later talking with Kavanaugh about another term and is your book devil's triangle here is devil's triangle\n[noise]\nDrinking game as a play three glasses and a triangle\nAnd\nYour plate quarters you know okay so ...\nWhat about that one and again I'm going to refer to Urban Dictionary uh and it says now because of what's happened in the last few days that are just devil's triangle is made up game of quarters with three cups or engine to try and go the rules are unknown because the inventor of the game Brett Kavanaugh could not explain them under oath\n[laughter] right so uh this is again this this is a bit of flying it's not really clear what the intended usage was at the time they are all sorts of a a suggestion is about it but one thing that I Will notice I went back and I looked at Google has the tools allows you to search\nA books that they have ... I went back and look to contemporaneous news reports you know news ... likes to talk about flying high schoolers are using I saw no indication of either boo for devil's triangle the the way in which Kavanaugh alleges they were used were actually contemporaneous uses of those tariffs\nSo we're we're we're diving pretty deep into\n... in an area that sort of hard to evaluate a objectively and categorically a but it seems pretty clear that no one besides Brett Kavanaugh says the devil's triangle is the thing that he said it was which is sort of ironic given that the whole thing is meant to refute it's an allegation that he says only one person had me\nI Want to play one more clip from the hearing this is senator Amy club which are pressing Kavanaugh in his assertion that he never had memory lapses resulting from drinking\nOr you're saying there's never been a case where you drink so much that he didn't remember what happened then I'd be far apart and what happens\nIf you're asking about the blackout I don't know have you\nCan you answer the question judge and just to you that's not happening is that your answer\nYeah and I'm curious if you have I have no drinking in order to why okay thank you so Chad\n... who's a former classmate of Kavanaugh's says Kavanaugh has not told the truth about his drinking at Yale or is it plausible for him to tell senator club which are that he's never had memory loss from drinking\nA ... I I mean it is it plausible I suppose theoretically it's plausible but we have a lot of contemporaneous evidence from people that knew him at the time who said he drank a lot too when he drank there were often times in which he appeared to be incapacitated\nAh and there are lots of suggestions or from people who knew him then that it is hard to believe that he never would have been blackout drunk given how much he drunk and I'll heavily drank and of course this is the central central point if it was the case that he with some regularity and high school\nI got drunk to the point that he can't remember his actions that may influence the story that he says which is that he doesn't\nHe never did what Ford alleges it's quite possible he doesn't remember what doing what for legit so it's very important for him to establish that he never got blackout drunk because if he can establish that then that bolsters his defense of this event never happen\nWell and also you know this is a person who wants to be a a justice on the Supreme Court and\nThere are big questions here about whether he was telling the truth under oath to the senator's this is a Jeff Flake the senator the Republican senator from Arizona and Chris Coons a Democrat on sixty minutes over the weekend or talking with Scott Kelly of CBS\nSo it's very important for him to establish that he never got blackout drunk because if he can establish that then that bolsters his defense of this event never happens well\nAnd also you know this is a person who wants to be a a justice on the Supreme Court and\nThere are big questions here about whether he was telling the truth under oath to the senator's this is a Jeff Flake the Senate or the Republican senator from Arizona and Chris Coons a Democrat on sixty minutes over the weekend a talking with Scott Kelly and CBS if\nJudge Kavanaugh is shown to have lied to the committee nominations over Oh yes I", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "02"}
