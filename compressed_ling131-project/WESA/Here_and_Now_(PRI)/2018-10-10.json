executive director of the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander community alliance says the Asian Americans living here are people with roots in the Philippines China Korea Vietnam Japan and more that's been the case for decades the difference now is a greater number of those people were born in the United states\nI see it's probably about thirty to thirty five percent right now I'm Seventy percent of the community and foreign born ... cording to the sense that you see more and more diversity here in orange county and you'll see more of a rising second generation\nThat's important because the politics of the generations can be completely different Alex Kim is principal in CEO of three kings public affairs he's Korean American and a registered Republican who worked as a political consultant for Democrat James Honda former mayor of Los Angeles and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger the former governor of California\nThe first generation tends to vote Republican\nAnd my second generation friends\nAre more on the Democratic side why is that\nMaybe it's because of a little bit of rebellion\nA butt up at the same time it's similar to how Cuban Americans of Vietnamese Americans come from a country that came from a lot of trauma war types of financial distress the first generation tend to say why be what Republicans\nBecause they see the\nThe corruption of government the distrust in government and why the second generation going more democratic I think because of the American values the\nA lot of this current Americans that grew up in second generation uh tend to grow up in urban areas and I think that's part of the process or in urban areas into focus more progressive thinking\nThan more conservative with suburban ideal\nKim says one of the first issues on the minds of Asian American voters is immigration he and others are concerned about President Trump's policies family separation and chain migration\nIn the thought of limited because a lot of my relatives came here to chain migration so and the question of workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from that chain migration\nSo it seems like Korean Americans the first generation still are more majority loyal to Trump no matter what they believe they came here legally of a majority of them\nAnd they believe that what he's doing is fair for the country will definitely be the my friends I mean more democratic or\nLiberal Republicans are progressive Republican myself have have definitely some qualms about that ...\nMany of the first generation Asian immigrants here are small business owners running nail salons dry cleaners restaurants Kim says the Koreans often use Korean community banks because back in the day it was difficult for them to get loans from American banks\nThen there are Vietnamese American business owners like Tam and sunny new and we met them at a cafe sunny owns it in orange county neighborhood called little Saigon sunny

a cafe sunny owns it in orange county neighborhood called little Saigon sunny told us the politics here are shifting\nDefinitely changing I I think you know you look at generation one which is our parents um salmon I mean we're all one point fight and we we grew up we were were not born here in the U.S so we were in uh Vietnam\nBut we were raised\nIn America so we understand what it means to be an American but we also understand our parents were they came from so we can relate to vote sites and because we can relate to both sides we can see the differences and it's a stark difference what do you mean by that\nI'm not just from a political standpoint but how we do business so speaking just for our business and how we do things our parents always said hey you know where they came from a a country where you can't really trust the government so stay away from it so we came over here you see a lot of all this is the family\nCash only pay you know what you don't want to say what we have our own strategies that we don't want to\nShare best practice because that becomes very competitive as well and that's why first generations that are known\nTo be very fragmented right and um you don't want to collaborate we grew up in America and you know I worked in corporate America Lewis there's a lot of collaboration and that's how we actually through and\nAnd being an American or\nYou know and having it includes DVD I think that's one of the reasons why we have grown it because we do collaborate and we're showing\nUm our first Gen our parents said look we've worked closely with the city we're sharing a best practice we actually sharing best practices entrepreneur and they're getting better but because we're doing now we're able to work together and that's one of the big differences from generation one\nOutside the cafe in little Saigon our political science attached to a fence at a busy intersection nearly every candidate's name is Vietnamese the only Asian American running for Congress this year in orange county is fifty five year old young Kim a Korean American Republican worked for the lawmaker she's trying to replace ed Royce\nMy family tend to just catching

opposing tax increases in fighting for fiscal responsibility\nYoung Kim for Congress\nThere hasn't been a Korean American in Congress since Nineteen Ninety nine this year three are running in November says political consultant Alex can't\nWe have young Kim of course local year with Pearl Kim and also I'm Andy Kim and may not related not related but all the cameras are very popular name a current Americans and a quarter of us are Korean Kim's including myself\nAlex Kim says some Asian American voters will support a candidate like them regardless of party even though he's a Republican he's working with a Korean American Democrat running for office in Georgia\nAs a Republican than helping a Democrat because it's more not just about parties about also this\nConnection this this uh ethnic connection and having not a single Korean American in Congress right now I'd rather it doesn't matter if the Democrat Republican I Would like to see a Korean American on there to represent me\nWe've

Scott hey Jeremy\nAnd with me in the studio K PCC in Pasadena as Mary Plummer whose political correspondent\nFor K. PCC Hi Mary hey there so let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom a Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox Scott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate\nThis week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin Newsom said first\nThe California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poorest state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle\nThe vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget and here's Republican John Cox\nI have a vision of this state being affordable unlivable for people uh I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento uh the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nThe status quo isn't working for average working California's they can't afford to live here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agree that California is getting to be on affordable for a lot of people ah Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls is Cox have a chance well\nIt's tough the math is tough for him of the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party in California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent in the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when you have to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats\nAnd so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough\nPlace California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins a merry will be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know I'm Governor Brown has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and using indicated he'd pick a similar approach especially on issues like immigration health care environmental issues I knew some support sanctuary cities for example he backs California becoming a zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are a couple of areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has and one of those areas as early childhood and during the recession state funding for programs like infant and toddler care and pre school was severely cut and those have not been reached\nStreaming on W E n J imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program at\n... dot edu slashed I I I\nStayed and but there are a couple of areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has\nAnd one of those areas as early childhood and during the recession state funding for programs like in St toddler care and pre school was severely cut and those have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown news and has indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ads that he's running as well\nAs you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump or the the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nSo I think that what it's doing a terrible job running the state of California and you know\nI have property in California I Will say I don't do much about my property anymore but I have great property\nTaxes are way way out of whack\nSuch a move British and then if you don't have safety\nMeaning if you don't have this kind of wall\nThrough in California that do it [noise]\n[noise] Scott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump playing in the state as voters or prepare to go to the polls next month\nWell in like a lot of blue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes than Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters\nSo uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nAre their problem and these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he is not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates in persuading them to vote for for the Republican and he's congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nAffordability homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in the congressional races and you know there are just issued an affordability that I think a lot of these a new party preference voters\nAt which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nUh let's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat because in California the top two vote getters face each other in the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh\nHearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some have said this is a serious undertaking with serious allegations Scott ... ah [noise] maybe\n[laughter] certainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary uh you know I think it Kevin do we don't just hasn't been here her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E essay Pittsburgh NPR News ... the sound of a free friend\nOK shouldn't Scott ...\nAh [noise] maybe [laughter] certainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary uh you know I think it\nKevin de Leon just hasn't been her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media are paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nUh and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent Neva polls\nSo uh and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lot of Republicans may skip this race altogether\nAnd a vet I'm not sure it's going to help Feinstein because those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist than her opponent [noise]\nAh so it's possible certainly uh it's it's not entirely clear how this cabinet things playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was responding Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but boy you know I haven't seen Broadwell but\nOne thing one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of the people on both sides of the aisle during those Kevin hearings were pretty old she's eighty five years old\nHe's fifty one uh he's talked about that he's careful about it but he used to listen to him talking to us about the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to a to California and to the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nI you know I think it is presented specially for younger voters here in California\nAnd daily an argument there certainly resonating most with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know if we were you bind or rewind
