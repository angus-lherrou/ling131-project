here now and on this day when many people are morning we thought we'd offer novel about grief that also happens to be a finalist for the national Book Award for fiction\nBut cigarettes ... novel the friend is about suicide and talk to about the writing world with the author says is a sinking raft with too many people trying to get on\nAnd it's about a dog a harlequin great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together secret newness spoke with us last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise] my experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing\nAnd uh I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and flurry O'Connor and Kafka and you're quoting other moments of literature as is written another book dogs do us the honor of treating us like gods and we respond by treating them like things\nThat is a quote from ... from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these\nNot just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet very Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nBut when he first comes into the narrative apartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden what do we know about whether dogs grieve\n[noise] we do know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know that we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more in it\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to taking the dog but once she has him she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other he'll\nNow I remember I had to put a little dogs asleep ones and the person came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this ah so that they know where the dog is gone and I\nI don't what seems odd but I Am so glad to meet you can't you can't say for sure that that would happen well when the when the shot started an injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and peaked over the top as if to say\nIs anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating they ... and then he did more afterwards or\nAs I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs heads because we we kept and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have fought to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean there's whole chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say that something happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog\nBecause you presume it's like old yell or you presume okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog something's gonna happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life would be thinking there\nShe has a life outside the dog even though during that period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of that was a dog I mean he's he's her whole emotional life during this period\nSomebody asked her to party argue the woman who to love with a dog\nWith a giggle them but also if you are a writer and this narrator is\nA big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a talking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person\nWho in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain riders and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she's trying to tell a story about ... and ... and all of those writers do have a part in her life as people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow all along the way I I kept thinking I should Google this I should Google this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties and California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYes they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in ...\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet very Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nThey know to be calm and to sit still and and listen and to the child is having reading difficulties the dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who words die in their throat because of something powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not going to give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide\nOr it could be boats or maybe the friend is the narrator\nYeah and what about you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nWell my my with my married are really does this is something I definitely share with my narrative she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nWith this idea of dominating any animal and you don't dominate cats you do dominate other animals horses dogs\nYou know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that to our cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend now\nDogs can be unbearably poignant as you said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying\nAnd the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head as they do you ask her only solace is that\nShe is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen\nWake her up when she had gone Oh yes that's that's very moving\nWell and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and so they just have to ask you did about writers and writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tip for those who uh wanna wrestle the story to the ground\nPiece of advice that I really like is the simple don't\nFlinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among my students spoiled at least in a draft\nBecause they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have that ... is really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but when they get to writing it down they get scared and they flinch and they pull away from it", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "29"}
