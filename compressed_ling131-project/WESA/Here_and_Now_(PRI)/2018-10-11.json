in California's forty ninth district which includes parts of southern Orange County and northern San Diego county after narrowly winning his last re election Daryl I say is leaving the joined the Trump Administration as the head of the U.S trade and development agency\nHe's endorsed Republican Diane Harkey to replace him\nWell I'm running for Congress quite kind of the replacement that function and Washington DC I've worked in the legislature I've also worked on the board of equalization and very very minority conditions 'cause I'm a Republican and very very democratic state\nHer opponent is Democrat and first time candidate Mike LeBron\nWhat's happening uh with uh the Republican Party in what Trump is that consistent undermining of the Affordable CARE Act and I see it all those of you know my travel throughout this district I speak with so many people who are one medical emergency away for not being able to pay their rent\nIn the other two races incumbent Republicans are facing tough re elections in California's forty eighth district Dana Rohrabacher is fighting off Democrats were labeled him ... favorite congressman or a buck or has advocated stronger ties with Moscow and wants to put his muscles were just unbelievable\nYeah my constituents want us to work with Russia where we can and American people want us to work where we got rather than this unrelenting

young people are much more diverse um Eighteen year olds in orange county or fifty percent Latino so um those demographics are shifting\nBut we went for a Clinton because people didn't like Trump not because Republicans in orange county suddenly found love for Hillary Clinton and what do they think about Trump now\nSo a number of people who didn't like him have time around partially because they didn't have another choice I think one of the reasons that I'm Republicans in orange county didn't like Trump was because they didn't like Schwarzenegger ah\nAnd they had that experience of an outsider who said that he could clean up the capital and didn't understand the government and failed pretty spectacularly in getting what Republicans wanted so I think it was just that they had experienced that a lot of Republicans across the country hadn't half\nWhat it Orange County think of President Obama\nCertainly the Republicans didn't like him and spent eight years hating him pretty uh vehemently uh but um [noise] I you know it it wasn't because they loved Hillary so what are Republicans\nHoping to do in this upcoming election\nSo Republicans are hoping to hold on [noise]\nYou know it's going to come down to three things it's a Trump it's turnout and its taxes are there are a lot of people who are supportive of Trump and and now I guess I've got an ad the Kavanaugh factor of driving people to the polls for and against Kavanaugh but it's all going to come down to turn out\nFor the Democrats to get all four of those seats [noise] um it's going to have to be the perfect wave and I think polls are really over estimating\nThe Democrats' chances of getting all for\nWhat are the Democrats need to do this don't ever\nSo the Democrats need to turn out and they didn't need to turn out in a really big way\nUm I think the story of two thousand and Eighteen might not be the huge victory is that the polls are predicting but I think when we look back I think she thousand in Eighteen is when the Democrats realized\nThat uh they needed a farm team that when you look at the four Democrats that are on the ballot for Congress not one of them has held elected office before\nNot want the Republicans have all held elected office are are holding elective office so they've got experience they've got a ballot designation that people trust and right now Orange County I think\nAlmost every single city council is majority Republican so we haven't seen the Democrats have a big farm team to choose from\nWhen they have this opportunity [laughter]\nDemocrats may not have a farm team but President Obama field so confident about their prospects here that he visited last month for a campaign rally that was before the fight in Washington over the confirmation battle for now justice Brett Kavanaugh\nOutside of shopping center in Huntington Beach Orange County voter Laurie he'd told us She's been trying to oust Republican members of Congress here for years way before Kevin I was in the picture\nOpinion about him as a negative opinion is that in the same ... already my votes prior to [noise]\nMinds may not be changed but Jody ... says the cabinet confirmation is likely to motivate Democrats to turn out particularly\nWomen who are energized and galvanized them so I think turnout is going to be really hot because of that I don't know on the other side I don't

over immigration many California cities of taking matters into their own hands either by declaring themselves sanctuaries from immigration enforcement if you\nQuote unquote broke the law by coming to his country to work where there's a war of ... that's not something that I see that the city should be looking to arrest somebody four\nOr five voicing their support for immigration and Customs Enforcement or ice this is really about rule of law at about to local control this year a new state law took effect in California limiting how much local police can cooperate\nScreaming on WGN supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nI see that uh\nThe city should be looking to arrest somebody four or five voicing their support for immigration and Customs Enforcement or ice\nThis is really about rule of law and about to local control\nThis year a new state law took effect in California limiting how much local police can cooperate with federal immigration authorities the law sb fifty four is called the California values act it's also known as the sanctuary law and his drawing lawsuits from the Trump Administration in several cities in California\nBut the legal battle kicked off in the small town of Los Alameda which voted to opt out of the law in March and it's now being sued by the American civil liberties union list Alameda city manager for Edgar as the sanctuary state law goes too far\nWhen you look at this it's really the difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal from our perspective we wanted to go and take an action to say hey look we have the right to do this and that's when the ACLU came in and said we don't think you do have the right so now we have an outside group that's actually going and challenging asked on that issue\nHow do you respond to some of the opponents of this who say that by not having a sanctuary city or a sanctuary state policy that immigrants are going to be less likely to work with law enforcement on major crimes reporting things et cetera because they're afraid of deportation\nI you know what I I don't see it that way I think that um if you talk to people within a especially around a list I Want me to stay in the north Orange County area\nYou'll see a lot of the immigration population that may not be legal\nThankful for what we're doing because we feel that uh or they feel that basically by us not abiding by these sanctuary laws what happens is these people that are bad actors that are illegal that get put in jail and then are not released back to the federal government come back into their communities and continue to terrorize their community\nAnd so from their perspective they're very thankful I think a lot of this as if the politics and the soundbites versus the reality of what's going on in the ground\nEdgar met with President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and seen a phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think this has anything to do with racism um I probably the best example and the real life example I gave us my wife is from Iran\nShe came when the shah was overthrown she is a Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years and wait and turned to get into the United states and so you know that is\nThe way immigration should work and you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I actually I'm with my wife has an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or racist\nMore than a dozen cities in California have sided with Los Alamos made us in defying the state law marches Ito is assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or a chest die\nHe says the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking\nI feel that this has become a political issue and it really should be it should be a nonpartisan issue and so public safety issue features ... is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nAnd if they took a minute to actually learn what we did I think they would be where we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of a lot of these\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAges I is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nAnd if they took a minute to actually learn what we did I think they would be where we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of\nA lot of these immigrants that come across illegally are abused I'd met with a I've been on several interviews with women that were raped multiple times getting up here and are agents of the ones that help\nThese immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them or we're talking about criminal organizations that are doing this\nDetailed says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country is broken immigration system but other cities in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from Los Alamos and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a sanctuary city long before the state passed its sanctuary law\nDivvied ... is a city councilman there\nWe believe in the dignity of all people the city of sent on or about eighty percent\nLatino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in another country so\nAre the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary steady ensures that we send a message to all of our residents that they're going to be treated respectfully a with dignity and at the stadiums here to serve them\nWell we we spoke earlier with the city manager from Los Alamos who said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that did not about racism why um why I'm doing this\n[noise] um [noise] I don't hold back my laughter there if if it is a\nFrankly a pretty shallow a response there was no need for the city will selling me just to take the position that they did other than to send a political message or they're wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California's is not\nA welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that we've come far beyond that I Would hope\nAnd we believe in the dignity of every person who enters our city and that's what it means to be a century city and when President Trump says that you're giving safe harbor the criminals you say what\nThat he is a liar and has no idea uh about the laws and and the law of the land he often times talks about a violent criminals and\nI Do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable the city of San than I Believe that any violent criminal should be hounded ... held accountable they should be arrested they should serve their time\nHowever if you were only\nCrime quote unquote is leaving your country out of desperation looking to be able to uh survive being able to provide for your family that's not something that I see that uh the city should be looking to arrest somebody for\nSo what do people in law enforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Valentino\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is that's certainly what we do here that's not what my mandate is tomorrow officers um we responded behaviors responded criminal behavior\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station I have a free press\nThis is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Valentino\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is that's not certainly when we do here that's not what my mandate is to my officers um we responded behaviors respond to criminal behaviors irrespective of your status\nSo when representatives from I say it makes their job more difficult what do you say to them so\nFederal authorities um are you know that they have the mandate 'em to enforce federal law uh we do not\nAnd so it's like lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide police services to the folks live here um they have their mandate to enforce federal law in there and they do that so um the other pieces has to do with community trust and I know there's\nThere's a large part of the dialogue there on what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to call us for help if they're not calling the police who are they common right\nSo um the ideas um to reinforce the messaging that we're not interested in and what the residency status we're going to respond and it's just the folks to call for help\nSo that the chief of police in Santa Ana this is done Barnes the under sheriff of Orange County\nFormer FBI acting director Andrew McCabe says his book has been delayed because of an FBI
