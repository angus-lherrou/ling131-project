say on friday or calls were a little more than double from the week prior and we're continuing to see an increase call volume right what do people saying\nWe're hearing comments from survivors that similar to Dr Ford they're experiencing are we ... we had a caller tell us that they had their first flash back in three years after listening to Dr Ford's testimony we're hearing from male survivors that\nThe testimony validated their experience and they're still dealing with the impact\nAnd we had another male caller tell us that he's experiencing intimacy issues as a result of childhood sexual assault um so the symptoms and stress reactions that the trauma are still with folks even decades later\nWhen you say somebody at a flash back you know somebody might who hasn't had a physical flashback might think oh so they had a memory but you're talking about more than that yeah\nAbsolutely so a flashback is for a survivor or re experiencing of that traumatic event they feel as if\nThey are right back in that moment to they they feel their heart pounding they feel their thoughts race or they feel intense feelings of anxiety and it's like experiencing the trauma all over again and it's unexpected and a survivor can't necessarily tell what where when and how a flashback might be triggered\nAnd my friend talked about the laughter that suddenly this sort of demonic laughter floated back from his past\nHe also talked about being pin down and I had another friend telling me just imagine you regardless of who might have been somebody larger than Fifteen year old girl with

related to the response of the alleged offender but we know that survivor it's out of the capacity because of all the way the trauma is stored in the brain\nTo literally re presents themselves and re
