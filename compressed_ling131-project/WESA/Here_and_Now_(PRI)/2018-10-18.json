has her eyes on the sky once again today she is launching a new initiative called look up for one day today generous and wants people to upload photos of the sky and record their reactions to what they see me jealous and joins us now to talk about a welcome to hear now thank you\nSo you're asking people to download this app sky fee and upload photos tax videos audio recordings of themselves experiencing a the night sky what are you hoping that will do\nWhat we're asking them to share what happened when they look up at the sky daytime nighttime for twenty four hours around the globe\nYou know just the simple act of connecting through looking up going outside looking up\nWill help us to understand maybe a little bit more about each other so just a tiny bit more connected around the planet so you know some people will look up and this guy and they will feel loved they'll sell whole fill fill some people may feel afraid they may feel wonder are expensive and how they express that\nIs what we want to capture\nAnd we want to have a shared with people in real time so it's not just you're going to take these photos and you've got to put them up\nBut were vetted display them to the world in real time on a digital globe that people can spin and they can look at that can expand they can go to different folks around the world so I can no in\nHouston, Texas what someone\n... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nI have to say I love looking up at the night sky and in fact in the last couple of margins guy period yeah nice guy and a nice guy well but but in the sky period and and in the last couple of months we've been able to see for planets or every single night to Mars Saturn Jupiter and I'm Venus\nAnd I've I've taken great pride in telling people about that but the other feeling that I often have when I look up because I live in cities disappointment that I can see more because of there's the light pollution\nBut I I guess the thing is what do you say and and I and really it's the idea of for one day why don't we stop looking down\nBecause so many times when we walk around the world we're not looking out we're not connected we're looking down at our mobile devices were looking down at our feet\nLet's start looking up and be more expensive if we're in a city and we have light pollution at night we're still seeing something we're still seeing the buildings were say what people are we're even seeing our impact\nOn this planet and so we want to know what you what that makes you feel you know what we're trying to do and I know a because I'm an astronaut people said we're always talking about stars riding but it's really about our planet when I was up in space\nI saw the earth when it was day and I saw the earth when it was night and each time there's this thin shimmering layer of light that ... is our atmosphere is this planet that warmed us and called us and enveloped with all we need\nWhat we have to do is recognize that our home is on this planet and that while we are connected to the greater universe which I very much felt I felt like I Belong to this universe I also belong to this planet\nAnd we have to figure out how to share it we have to figure out that we're earthlings\nBut so it sounds like the the words you're not using here but you're implying is you want people to pay attention to climate change\n[noise] well I Want people to pay attention to climate change pollution but to war because here's the thing\nToday we had these incredible technologies to address so many problems we have so much knowledge but we don't use them\nAt least effectively because I don't think that we really see ourselves as connected that we really don't see that what I Do\nIn my country in my backyard has any impact on this planet so yes climate change but also a huge amount of plastic right the size of the state of Texas in the Indian Ocean the fact that we have enough energy\nAnd we grow enough food to feed everyone on this planet yet we waste it and at the same time whenever there's a hurricane when there's a disaster\nWe really care about each other but that carried only happens\nWhen we're come face to face that I can see someone simultaneously on the other side of the earth and so we want to do this in a fashion where people have an opportunity to look up to this guy something that's common to all of us look up and just say what do you feel when that happens\nI think a lot of a human about astronauts like you and think that you have a different view of space because you've been there but what I'm getting from you now as you also have a ... view of earth that's the only a handful of people have [noise] no I actually\nHave a view of earth that I think we all can have that view of earth is what happened when I was a little kid when I used to look up and and imagine that some\n... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nSame thing I was looking at and I wonder what this was like and so it felt really really comfortable it felt really good to me to know that we were connected that way\nWe were calling the ads that we have that's completely free we're calling it a sky feet at right is this guy selfie [laughter] and that's sort of like our connection between the sky you know humanity and the universe all in one\nOkay well we have you and and again people can go to our website here no doubt Oregon learned more about what what you want them to do in terms of this app sky fee but I just want to ask you a couple of questions that we have you because you were in space you're the principle of the one hundred years starship project which seeks to enable interstellar human space flight by Twenty one twelve\nOr do you think that we're going to need to leave the earth and the next hundred years\nSo that's I when I hear your starship is about making sure that capability for human interstellar flight exist within a hundred years and it's really about radical innovation pushing our knowledge pushing the uh the technologies and our capabilities in terms of energy in terms of uh the governor has in terms of\nYou know human biology and health and using something that's really difficult like interstellar flight to do it but here's the thing we will not if we don't figure out how to live on this planet\nWe can forget about anything else and even if we're able to get five hundred people on Mars what five hundred people are we going to send\nRight right who gets to decide\nI Would rather us understand and make sure that we're keeping this planet well then counting on a plan B now what's fascinating and what's incredible about space exploration is it is really changed fundamentally how we see ourselves we know so much more about our planet\nThrough being able to look back down at our planet from satellites we know more about the earth because we've been able to study Venus we've been able to study Mars and understand how planets form and what could happen to them yet at the same time the balance that we have\nIs taking that knowledge that we live on a planet we live on our own space ship\nAnd the only thing that's happening is we have to figure out ... as a crew how to live together that means that we don't foul our planet through\nPollution but we only do that if I understand that what I Do changes what happened to other people that we understand that we have to live on this planet in our behavior makes a difference\nThere are now are a number a small number but a number of African American women who have gone into space but you'll always be the first ... what does that mean to you\nSo it it was really interesting to me because not only was the first African American woman but I was the first woman of color in the entire world to go up in a space and it's a little girl growing up on the Southside of Chicago there is no way that I Would have imagined that by the time I got old enough to go into space that I Would be the first anything\nBecause I would've thought that we would have had lots and lots of other people going up", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "18"}
