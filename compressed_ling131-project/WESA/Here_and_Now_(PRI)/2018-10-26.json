Florida for several years he's a registered Republican he has a criminal history in Florida dating back to Nineteen Ninety One including\nA theft and fraud charges um and uh what's perhaps the most telling about him if uh the the media reports and the ... the pictures we've been seeing off his van are in fact his is just a a\nA a political manifesto written on the side of his white van and stickers ah where he uh has a lot of references to vice president uh parents and of course President Trump\nOr and also against George Soros\nI'm so I'm looking at his social media you can see that he's a very much involved in politics he tweeting about uh the governor's race against the Democratic candidate Andrew Gillum down\nTheir beliefs were said to have known about this man is he saying he had a criminal palette you know what it is that led to stories directly to him\nThere had been uh some focus on Florida as where these packages had been mailed from\nA very quickly and are experts have been talking about the amount of evidence that might have been left behind because these packages included tape and plastic bubble wrap that there could be fingerprints as well as possibly DNA I'm so authorities were were moving a very quickly on this and we're focusing on Florida\nAnd we can assume that they tracked from the the or possibly from surveillance cameras at at the post office where they found that some of these packages might have been sent from but it's early days\nDo you have any idea of just how he was arrested or was he with the vehicle that um that they took away at the time was he considered dangerous when they arrested him\nUm he was arrested at about eleven o'clock this morning in a parking lot of shopping center implantation Florida which is just outside of Fort Lauderdale\nUm you know there was some street shutdown around there are and there was this white van which was towed away covering stickers ah people on social media have been tweeting\nPictures

Fletcher is a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii joins us now in in chip you were on Easter Island in July when you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\nWell it was quite stunning [noise] um I had not followed hurricane a lock I knew it as headed north from us but it never occurred to me that that might be a\nHead into French forget shoals and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stunned\nMost people have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures of here and now dot org but to tell us about it and why it was important to you\nWell it's a beautiful place um my research team which consists of a\nUndergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant with the national fish and wildlife association\nIs loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system as small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis is low so it's easy for them to haul out of there is a\nSort of upper region to the island where sea turtles could um digs their nests and lay their eggs safely and they're only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being deceased island which was the largest one or that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nest there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this was very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island you can see a small little bit of sand still sticking up above\nThe waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turn to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands\nThat can be problematic because much of the ... area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses can they turn to the north to some of the other ... there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many\nHuh you knew this island was low line it was Sandy ... did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane to this much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those I figured\nThat this island under the threat of sea level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century um it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence\nI didn't expect with a location this far north that it's a very strong chance of being intercepted by hurricane\nBut of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes that that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actually is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are there are also in danger or the other\nStreaming on W.

GDP to be made in extra activism than there is in and sort of sustainability\nUm so actually what we need to really think be searching the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policies that shipped about the way we imagine politics the way the imagine economic\nIs not so much do we want growth do we want less growth it what did we actually want from ... usually when people say oh I Want high growth rates\nWhat they mean something like oh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity um but I actually know I can do in a fair comparison right we are very high growth rates in China we have very high growth states in India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is\nA lot of what we associate with growth\nUm can be achieved through other means distribution of means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we currently talking about\nIs this an academic exercise or do you really happen\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty now in fact there is like so much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change\nGets ... and he's like hilarious things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more beans and meet\nRight like as opposed to like how have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more ...\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News that the sound of a free press\nThings are actually much more important believe it or not that our individual consumption choice\nWhat kind of movement I mean like wanting to give give me one thing okay so I could sort of not going to eat red meat any more but you're not stead of that you become part of movement that would do what\nAnyone who is emphasizing any movement that is trying to move the needle\nTo give more power to popular sovereignty and last to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money is going to not necessarily cause all the changes that I Am saying but it is necessary but what kind of movement give us an example\nYou can think of to sort of a tendencies one is to sort of rise above sort of reinvigorated laughed or whether you associate that with\nA democratic socialist America or other movements um that is a very important part of the conversation\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nFrom WNYC Studios this afternoon from two to four Ninety point five W E s say inbox addiction as the daily newsletter that start your day with stories about Pittsburgh from the W E S a museum you can sign up at W.

this spring he's appeared on more than two hundred albums more than forty as a bandleader so why go solar this time around\nBoth that's been a challenge for me to play a loan from the first moment I picked up a guitar there's this social aspect with you know I've always been a shy person an awkward but with the guitar it was like this magic wand that seem to\nBring every one together and so all along the guitar has been about interacting with other people it's never been\nI Know there's you know there's the tradition or whatever with especially with with the singer songwriter the loan troop adore when it first thing you know [laughter] but it's something that sort of\nHanging out there in front of me that I Try to I'm just trying to get it together to be able to do that you know like when I was in school I had to take a speech club that like talk about a nightmare\nSituation if you could only have had an instrument with you yeah yeah I mean to be able to tell a thing as long as I've got that in my hands and everything is cool [laughter] so then why another solo album I mean what you're trying to kind of force yourself and dear\nTo another level you I don't want to make it sound like that either it's because over the years it's become just another aspect of what I Do I mean I the first time I tried to do a solo concert was it was in the early eighties I tried to play\nStreaming on double your right it's appointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on the master's program\nAt ... dot edu flash I I I\nWas a dress and I swore I'd never do it again but then I thought no I got to get to go to\nA year later I tried it again and then I and they kept getting better and after a certain point it was like wow I can actually do this and it started to feel like [noise] like music\nWell just seems like every time to talk about I think for\n\n\n\n\n\nSome time like this what comes for poor sounds backwards the inspiration\nFor the note because you say it's a tribute to the musician the platelets in your life and you don't usually it's just a\nA melody just a very simple [noise] you know what I'm saying I'm\nWriting it but then\nLike one thing that happened on this album there's this song that begins and ends because\nPretty stars and then make the shrine and that was something I\nQuote unquote row these signs that book in the album ... and then made to shrink at the end when I wrote it\nI recognize that it was a very very\nCommon in court when prior to the recording of this album I was playing at this club called the stone in New York and I was playing some of the music that I Would record it so I played that song and\nA guy at the club ... one night he said oh I Love that was really great version of Jessie J what what do you talk about I Know some people just to\nPlay you this recording and that was like oh my God that's the same exact almost exact same malady and then I checked it out and it\nWas like you know it's just an old traditional songs like I'd probably hurt the Kingston Trio play it when I was five years old or something like a month isn't making yeah and I'm I'm I could be in trouble now but I think it's a\nYou know it's like a public domain kind of thing and then there's so much music float around I don't know where it comes from whether I'm writing it or am I remembering it or what is it\n\n\n\nI'd love it if you talk about track for which is what do you want to listen to a ...\n... ... ...\nWhat you're hearing right now is just one court that I played on the guitar that

trying to stay in the state of not being sure what was going to happen you need is you're playing ... yeah\nWell the composing is you know happy now these are pieces they never feel like they're finished anyway but what I did to prepare for\nThe album was actually played six nights at the stone in New York every night I brought in a pile of music and I tried to play things that I wasn't familiar with\nEither old compositions of mine or new ones and I tried to keep myself just off balance for that whole wheat\nAnd that's what I wanted to continue on into the studio\nI didn't want to have it all figured out like mapped out what was going to happen I didn't know what instrument I was going to play I didn't really do anything when I went in there\nYou know for somebody who sounds like you would in your younger days hide behind your instrument that takes a lot of confidence to now go in and not know where you're going to end up and put yourself in a stranger unusually difficult uncomfortable place intentional\nWell but that's when the stuff really happens I mean that's the thing about music it's like when you're dreaming you jump off a cliff\nAnd you you just start flying
