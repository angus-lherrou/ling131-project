new things like not just the house but also some governors' mansions and state legislatures that we cannot predict that will turn out in Democrats' favor John\nWell first of all in the Republican side the more we if we could get Nancy Pelosi on all the stations all day long we're we're all for it because it seems to fire up our base at least quite a bit but\nI look historically we know that whether it's a Republican or Democrat president two years into their terms the other party does well I I think there is no reason to believe that history is not going to repeat itself\nThe question as to what level I Do think that the house majority is certainly in play I Would not be terribly shocked if the Democrats won the majority on the other hand I Do think the Democrats are going to lose seats in

bottles and thermometers is one thing but it seems a tad unethical to fiddle with details that relate directly to the kids' death\nI don't think it's unethical particularly because I wasn't alone in

to as a veteran actor in the company of easy for the first time thank you that's a wholesome\nAnd yeah I mean I I've never done a play before that I have an argument at the center of it to feel that going backwards and forwards every night is really special unlike some nights\nI'll feel the audience finding me particularly irritating it is a moment some of gyms quibble like make the audience go oh this guy's name ridiculous but actually like the ... in in in my head they all know ridiculous to told I find like five you up to go okay I have to I have to try and win this even more\nThought he'd do you feel that because there was a guy behind me last night I don't know if you guys could hear that he kept going yeah well I did when when you would make a point did did you feel that\nSometimes we do like any good play you know the events of the players\nTo be the biggest events of the characters on stages lives in a sense and I think it works best when the three of us are fighting for it with all our lives\nThe cherry explain your character because the character isn't in the book but there is an editor\nWell it's funny because Jim single engine to God who we've been seeing a lot of cars they've come to the show many times in fact last night when I said the first line of the play is Okay Jim single I heard people actually left\nAnd it was when I left the theater last night Jim single was standing there with thirty ... thirty of his relatives who've flown in from all over the country and and I when I opened the book that which they kindly gave for opening night Jim's comment was man we could use to\nUse your character ads\nFree ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nBut she's the one who has to make the decision and she's so desperately wants to publish it because she really thinks it will help at this moment in time\nBut at the same time she is a journalist and damage the damn it every night as I come down to the moment if the play where decision has to be made\nYou and your character have not made up their mind\nUntil the moment I reach for the phone wow it's who convinces me\nOther that's often you if you publish Eleanor every night now that guy that's got to be called a post show delivery\nBringing money [laughter] I Know what the single wrote in my book thanks for having John's back\nOh I was going to talk about that when your character John to God I was saying things like yeah there are thirty one strip clubs that thirty four is a better number so I like that number my head was exploding you can't do that it's bad for all journalism whether it's an essay or\nNews for me to say a piece of writing in the newspaper\nIs really different to the fact in fact oh my God we're having a play\nWhere there is a difference in our and artistic peace being written and that's it you know what would you say about the Greek history what would you say about in cold blood\nI Would say Daniel you're smiling Daniels character gym would say if it's thirty one strip clubs you can't make it thirty four 'cause you like the way that number's sounds you've obviously this is that your character is not a bad guy we're in real life are\nOwned by a guy anyway he's just he's a writer and aren't\nReal life he he has said that the real writer and said oh my God I'm like the devil spawn to some\nPeople just destroy them and they continue to do so um\nBut I don't think it's fair John does it work for the Washington Post who's not writing articles for writing articles ... New York times he's he's a looming eating the lives of people who normally would never be written about that falls in a long line of traditions why all of a sudden because we're in such a controversial time we're going to just stayed all these artists you can't do that anymore\nBut that brings us to present day and you're all aware that there's a moment in the play where your character John ... has a line and most of the lines are straight out of the real life interactions\nWith his own world effects to choose from the wrong stocks get in a way of the story\nAnd you have a says the wrong facts what does that mean exactly what\nYou gotta be aware that we have a presidential jokes person Kellyanne Conway you spoke of alternative facts are not very\nInteresting because there is a beautiful speech about the importance of facts and democracy and frequently gets applause\nThe argument is basically that if you were reading something or watching something and you find even one thing to be untrue in it the whole thing can photo policy you and your trust in your relationship without saying\nYou know there's one point in the play where it would debating about the length of time this person fell for it and that's one of those moments of the audience is kind of going by a con clearly you are going to father said no to different methods you go to Jim\nWants to publish this essay he is convinced that by making it true what you will also make it more beautiful inherently\nYeah but it is irritating and certain play what Jim single does start to feel like one headline said a little bit crazy\nI think Jim's fighting in the play is that he can't differentiate between the things that are really like you know that's the case of picking your battles he becomes more and more infringed as the argument between him and John gets more intense you'd\nDo both become the divided United States in a way and you know over this issue of facts and cherry again there you are in the

were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nThis this year and now we've talked a lot about what next week's elections mean for control of Congress but voters will also be casting ballots for the representatives at the state level so what's at stake in state house races around the country Tim storey is director of state services at the national conference of state legislatures I ten\nOh thank you for having me on and when you look right now at the state legislatures are Republicans control sixty seven out of the Ninety nine there isn't by the way that there are nine denies because one state\nThe brass guy does not have a house and Senate they only have one a chamber but the Democrats only control thirty two why our Republican so dominant at the state level\nWill will with the straight answer that they've been successful in previous elections they've earned candidates that have\nFared well and and you know they they they did quite well and the Obama presidential midterms um and really had a ... they've had three consecutive strong elections\nAnd four consecutive strong election so in the states if you factor in both legislatures and governors as well um it's more Republican than pretty much in American history a you know there were a few more seats in Nineteen twenty Nineteen twenty eight but in terms of chambers legislatures this is the most Republican dominance\nIn the state governments are in American history\nAnd what is the consequences of that what does that meant for Republicans to have that kind of control\n[noise] will they run on issues like ah lowering lowering taxes uh they certainly also run on issues like immigration reform some of the social issues around abortion rights and things like that\nI'm so they have a they have done exactly what they said they were going to do they have been very aggressive on implementing a issues around a abortion and and certainly on taxes and spending in terms of cutting taxes and uh and and lowering taxes\nAround the country so uh you know the the states have been active in policymaking on issues like education public safety health care\nAt a time when Washington has really been gridlock and we've had very little policy and coming from Washington on the federal level and so the Republicans have really put their premature on those policies in the states\nThey also get to at least every ten years draw maps for congressional districts which gives Republicans in edge if they've got the control of these state houses\nIs correct in in a handful of states there's some sort of a commissioner of a group that does it outside of the legislature but predominantly it's the legislatures the draw the U.S congressional lines and in most cases their own\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... say It's NPR news the sound of a free front\nPages and they had a very successful state election cycle in two thousand and ten\nWhich meant that they were in control of many state houses for the twenty ten cycle of redistricting and they took full advantage of that by the way the Democrats also take full advantage of redistricting when they are able to do so it's not a it's not one party necessarily doing that\nAnd um and so they drew lines were quite favorable and those have held up throughout the decade but yes the the twenty twenty census is right around the corner and this is kind of the first election to tease it up and of course the twenty twenty ... election itself will be the big for redistricting\nRight but this one uh about an eight to the people who are elected this year are going to play a role at least that many are going to play a role in drawing those maps in two years\nThat's all right Jeremy that there are over eight hundred legislative seats that will be filled in less than a week from now I'm by legislate tours legislative candidates\nWho will be directly involved and redistricting as well as thirty four governors who have for your terms we're going to be elected next Tuesday\nAnd you know ... that has a an effect that goes beyond just two years or policymaking in the next legislative sessions in two thousand and Twenty one but I'm a redistricting can have a lasting impact throughout the rest of the next decade\nSo what are things looking like this year or what are the Democrats' chances of taking back control of some of these state houses\nWell from the very beginning we knew that this would be that a democratic opportunity year they would have the wind at their backs that would be an uphill battle for Republicans\nOn for a variety of reasons Republicans control about fifty six percent of all legislative seats and as you pointed out um almost two thirds of all the legislative chambers and legislatures around the country\nSo they're sort of in a tough position where they're basically playing defense around the country and there's also this very strong historic trend about a strong of a trend in politics as you'll find anywhere which is\nIt since Nineteen hundred so going back twenty nine mid term election cycles the party and the White House loses seats in state legislatures and twenty seven of those twenty nine mid term elections\nSo the party out of the White House is almost always looking to make a ground to gain seats and legislators as well as in the U.S house and it looks like that's where it's going to head this time the Democrats are running more candidates and they've run in Thirty years\nUm they have raised a tremendous amount of money unprecedented amount of money that they're printing into legislative campaigns around the country so ah you know Republicans are not exactly mailing it in there fighting hard for the uh the majorities that they have in ... in states legislatures\nBut um but it's really the the Democrats who you know sort of have the momentum\n[noise] uh when we'd been traveling around the country talking about congressional races I I've been surprised other maybe I shouldn't have been that a lot of people don't know who their member of Congress is they do know that they're going to vote\nFor either a Democrat or Republican or in many cases but what about state legislators do most people know who they're voting for did they just end up voting party line\nWell sad to say most of them do not know who they're voting for me they might sort of here the names or if they're a target voter they're certainly getting inundated with mailers and in some cases TV ads even you know widely broadcast the TV ads and some of these legislative races\nBut you know despite the fact that legislatures budget over three trillion dollars in public money tax money every year and despite the fact that they're setting policy on education and\nAnd uh a criminal justice crime and punishment on health care on immigration on the environment um\nStreaming on W. E. N. appointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation in the town on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu flash I I I\n... percent so it's mostly low it's it's you know probably not much better for the U.S house um so you know we would encourage people these raises are extraordinarily important not just because of the outcome upcoming redistricting but also because of what states do\nAnd um and then to your point it then it does sort of turned into something of a referendum on the parties\nAnd one of the biggest issues for legislative candidates is is President Trump\nSo give us an example of a state house race uh that's really tight somewhere in the country and a sense of what's at stake\nWell there there are number of them and there are several state Senate swear just a ... a change of one seat will change control of the chamber in Maine and Minnesota\nIn Colorado and Minnesota there's one special election and it's for all the marbles whichever party wins that will control the Minnesota Senate in right now the Minnesota houses Republican um there's a race for governor so that that's all about so um [noise]\nYou know this one race which has had seen close to a million dollars in campaigning it's a heavily Republican district but if it goes one way or the other you know that party will control\nHow much do the parties get involved in these races that the parties in Washington did they jump in with their money and say we want this person to when we want that person to win\nMore than ever so particularly on the Democratic side the Democrats learned\nFrom getting show lack in two thousand ten and by the way that was Brock Obama's where we got shellacking down ballot in these legislative races and of course they paid the price because of the redistricting advantage Republicans had\nSo in this cycle protected on the Democratic side and they have really ramped up their fundraising and their distribution and the sophistication of how they spend that money how they do\nUm you know sort of a voter registration projects um get out the vote projects the proverbial ground game but also big time outside TV buys um you know things you would see in congressional races you now see\nFairly commonly in pivotal state legislative races and that is being supported heavily by national party operations and so it's not just the Democrats they just increased fairly substantially from where they were just a few years ago there now paying a lot more attention\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News

politics were not play just plain logic so when\nWe first started meeting we all came to the table with ideas of how things might be grouped and everything really had in a somewhat of an access or natural connection\nGame is offers the example of amendment ... which would ban offshore drilling and vaping at work\nBut if you look at it from a U.S make our environment more friendly and and and protect our state and protect our citizens\nI think these kind of see why they would have fit together I Can't say that personally I agreed with all of the group beams and my voting record would speak to that but for the most part I did and I thought that we put things together in a way that just it made sense\n... says there's another reason for grouping amendments in some places ballots are nearly twenty pages long this year so the commission want it to stop voter fatigue\nJust make the shorter an easier for people\nThere's just one rule the commission has to follow according to the floor of the constitution the title and the summary of the amendment need to be clearly understood by voters Timothy McClintock is a professor of constitutional law at the University of Florida\nThat it needs to clearly state chief purpose it needs to be comprehensible I saw the more you unfold different disparate subject that can really be a challenge there\nThe Florida Supreme Court already ruled that one bundled amendment was not clear enough for voters there was about charter schools and it didn't use the phrase charter schools so that was removed from the ballot three other amendments were in jeopardy of being tossed off the ballot until this month when the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that they would stay\nJustice Barbara party in the ... the questions were improperly bundled and they didn't give voters a clear choice of what they're voting on but the legal filing that was used to make that argument was the improper vehicle Justice Party into had two words for people looking at these questions on the ballot voters be where for\nHere and now I'm Danny Rivero in Miami\nWhether you're a voter in Florida or another state you may also have ballot measures to weigh in on on election day this year there are a hundred\nAnd fifty five statewide ballot measures in thirty seven states sixty four of them are citizen led initiatives there the example of direct democracy letting voters rather than legislatures decide policies and laws\nJoining us now is Josh all tick who's the project director for the ballot measures project at ballot PDF Josh welcome\nYeah it's good to be here thank you and how does a number of statewide ballot initiatives this year compared to other\nYears overall the total number of measures has been decreasing over the last decade or so there's been a trend towards fewer and fewer button twenty six twenty Eighteen there's been a resurgent specifically in citizen initiated measures measures they get on the ballot through a signature protection signed by registered voters\nAnd in those citizen initiated ballot measures if they get past do\nThey become law or is it something that than just gets refer to the legislature to make a decision about\nThose have gone to the ballot for final approval from the voters on there a couple of exceptions for example in Nevada there was a measure that has to get approved again and twenty twenty if it passes and twenty Eighteen um but these measures are going to the voters and voters have the last say on them\n[laughter] so what kind of issues are we talking about here I see that a lot of them have to do with\nElections and voting\nFree ... read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nOr things like redistricting systems are adding commissions are changing the requirements for redistricting\nMarijuana is another topic that's been on the ballot a lot you know in recent years has been a trend and it's sort of continuing this year uh other election policies related measures things like voting requirements voter id campaign finance an ethics is another big issue in North Dakota South Dakota Missouri\nHow difficult is it to get some of these initiatives onto the ballot\nProcess varies by state the number of signatures required is usually based on a percentage of voter turnout either for the president for um the governor for me to secretary of state and the total number varies from a little over Thirteen thousand as small state like North Dakota to over half a million in California this year\nThe costs on average was a million dollars a little over a million dollars and twenty eight for these initiatives\nSo does that mean that it is mostly big organizations who get behind these things and get them on the ballot or it could have just be Jane to voter\nThere are a few sort of really true grassroots volunteer efforts but for the most part if these things are crossing over a million dollars either have to have a rich individual and industry or a special group at a national interest group that's behind you to provide the funding to get these on about\nI can imagine that in some cases state legislators would be happy that something is put to the voters said they don't have to make the call themselves and in other cases they might not be happy because it ties their hands\nYet in general implicit in the initiative process it's a conflict between citizens or are registered voters and the legislature the the backers of these initiatives generally use the initiative process as\nA sort of a method of last resort if they're not getting what they want done in the legislature and they see an opportunity that voters might approve a policy that the legislature has either not acted on or has opposed um but there's always some exception to prove that rule and there are cases where\nPolitically connected people go to the initiative process and that could be for for a variety of reasons but for the most part the citizen initiative process is used when the policies are being approved in the legislature\nNow sometimes the voters decide on something and then the state uh either dragged its feet or decide that doesn't want to go through with it or in Maine last year sixty percent of voters approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid to cover tens of thousands more people but the governor there ... page has blocked implementation\nAnd there's an ongoing legal battle over it or how often does that kind of thing happen\nAs you see the initiative process habits resurgent so as you see more initiative you see the number of instances where that conflict I was talking about implicit boils to the surface\nThe response to twenty sixty initiatives was\nIn many cases to either repeal or I'm changing the initiatives if possible and some states allow that some don't or to pass restrictions on the process\nAnd then the sort of a third response we've seen is an effort to compromise and twenty Eighteen with an issue proponents instead of letting it go to the ballot and letting it would be to sort of hard battle trying to find some sort of deal they can make where initial prominence withdraw and the policies still gets at least some sort of advancement if it's not the full effort that they should probably want it\nTo say we can win [noise]\nOn November six the
