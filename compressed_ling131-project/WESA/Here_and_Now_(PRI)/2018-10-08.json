today in Yemen much like in Syria the fighting has turned into a proxy war involving other countries on opposite sides of the U.S back to the coalition led by Saudi Arabia is trying to oust rebels known as who these who'd these are backed by Iran\nDavid Miliband has seen all of this up close he's president and CEO of the international Rescue Committee David Miliband you were just in Yemen two weeks ago what did you see there I mean Yemen is the world's largest\nHumanitarian crisis this is a country of twenty eight million people a million people are being fed by the un world food program every day it's a country with three and a half million people are on the brink of famine and ... eighty three percent of the population are in extreme poverty and the temptation is to describe this is a tragedy\nIn science is an indictment because this is not a natural catastrophe it same mind made a trauma that is the results\nOf a war that has been waged over the last three and a half years I wouldn't either side winning\nAnd I want to ask you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen it feels very remote\nFree ... read it for the the Ninety five W yet they fit for NPR News station the sound of a free press\n... it's a man made a trauma that is the results of a war that has been waged over the last rain off you are neither side winning\nAnd they want to ask you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen it feels very remote it feels it's very complicated as well um could you describe in your own words what this is all about\nYeah I mean Yemen is a conflict goes to the hall of the trauma that he's going across the middle east at the moment the government of Yemen was toppled in two thousand and fourteen by who the to the who sees are a group from the north of the country socio economically deprived\nOr they rolled over the then government and capture Seventy percent of the country\nI'm what's happened since then is that a Saudi led coalition with us support and so you kind of the European support so it's not that far from home because the U.S is very strongly implicated in as\nA Saudi led coalition has been trying to pull the Yemeni control of the capital Sana'a enough Seventy percent of the country the truth is the Eighteen thousand bombing raids that have been led by the Saudi led coalition of not shifted\nThe front lines of Seventy to eighty percent of the humanitarian and commercial traffic\nGoes through the port of data which is currently choked really ah by the fighting only a trickle of eight and commercial traffic is getting through I'm what's happening in Yemen is the that conflict between who fees and the Saudi led coalition has both in the Iranians are supporting the who the Z\nBut either right then the other side from the Saudis the Nikkei\nExactly so I immediately you have a theological splits Sunni versus Shia you also have a split of in trout regional power struggle but in the chaos of the groups are emerging separatist groups in the south\nI'll tell you drove the Arabian Peninsula in the east ISIS growing as well in my case the case that I saw with my own eyes is this is a humanitarian catastrophe or the levels of malnutrition are absolutely shocking in that country that have children literally starving\nTo death but at the same time there was a political emergency too\nBecause the only sign that he's gaining from the current stalemate all the extremist of al Qaida and ISIS and it's a country now which is on the verge of melt down not just humanitarian melt down the political melt down and look what does that mean it means that\nThe humans are a meltdown is the three and a half million people are on the verge of famine forty thousand children are waiting for hospital places in Yemen\nOr there isn't the fuel to support the hospitals there isn't the fuel for the cause you can see half a mile cues of gas stations on the road you've got teachers and doctors and nurses were not being paid because public sector salaries and not being paid as a country which can't sustain itself or the moment as being ravaged by war\nThat is not to the benefit of any of the sides are waging it but in fact being exploited by extremists and I think that the onus\nOn the permanent members of the Security Council including the U.S in the u._k. is to recognize that this crisis is of no it's no one's benefit the war is not being one and the only way to address both the humanitarian on the political emergency is a cease fire a winning a whole stop digging\nAnd that's the message that needs to go to the Saudi led coalition\nSaid hold on right there for a second what is it that the Saudis the u._k. the U.S and the others want what's their goal\nThat goal is first of all to roll back the influence which they see as being allied to the Iranians secondly to reestablish what they call the

Saudi Arabia they want to be secure or from missiles being sent from Yemen into Saudi Arabia and there's no\nQuestion about the who sees have launched missiles into Saudi Arabia so there are legitimate security concerns\nBut what I saw was the price being paid by the Yemeni people far outweigh the costs that were being imposed a ... on the other side\nWe should say that the u._s. secretary of state Mike Pompeo has the coalition is taking steps to minimize civilian casualties\nNot obviously sticks in the ... because I met a ... who told me about missiles that had landed on a hospital next to a health care center that we were delivering\nAnd they all know about the fact that the Saudis bombed a coach of schoolchildren mobile forty of them killed in August is extra state your in the U.S interest that Mike Pompeo has indeed\nA certified as he is required to buy congressional legislation that everything is being done to protect civilians flight we know that seven and a half thousand civilians being directly killed them Monday indirect effects on far larger numbers\nAnd why would the U.S not want to protect civilians why would they in the u._k. and even Saudi Arabia I mean why would that not be a priority I I\nI'm not costing any at home and I'm a judgment what I'm saying is that the fact is that civilians of not being a protected them to come up to the war has breached the basic the most basic norms and international humanitarian law both on the Saudi led coalition side and on the side independent un\nInquiries have produced extensive documentation of terrible breaches of international humanitarian law in other words the targeting of civilians by both sides\nAnd this is a a crisis that now I came away saying that the willingness to wake up to what's going on in Yemen and the tragedy is at the U.N General assembly there was no all night session of the U.N Security Council on Yemen the u._k. holds the pen\nOn the Yemen filed with the pet

thieves approached the palace road entrance of the Gardner Museum\nThere have been a keg party nearby a few revelers were still on the streets and when the fate cops told the museum guard on duty that they were responding to a disturbance it seem plausible maybe some drunk kid had gotten up to some mischief\nAfter all earlier in the evening the guards around had been interrupted by a fire alarm

Nineteen eighty nine ... ...\n... thanks so much for having me here nice\nTo talk to you tell me first to focus of the book is the feminist five these are five young women in China who are at the core of your story um the theme that you present is the political is the personal give us examples of how among these five women\nAre the personal became the foundation of their activism and also who they are what they did\nRight so um these five women became known as the feminist five after they were jailed in twenty Fifteen\nFor planning to celebrate International Women's day um and it wasn't just those five women there were a lot of women in different cities across China who were planning to handout stickers about sexual harassment on subways and buses but before they even carried out their plan\nThe police and and all of these Chinese cities just carried out a sweeping around ever rats and focused on the five women the feminist five brought them to Beijing and detained them\nFor thirty seven days before there was a huge global outcry that resulted in their beliefs are being detained for what is it do well um well this is this is what was so outrageous about it because I'm the authorities were kind of feeling around for something to charge them with and and and the end it was something\nI can too disturbing the social order\nUm that the the reason why the arrest and jailing of these women just galvanize so many so many people in the feminist community inside China and globally is that it was just so outrageous because of all they wanted to do was to handout stickers raising awareness about sexual harassment\nOkay so I Want to find out why that was such a threat to the government to uh just doing something like you had to go stickers or making T shirts and handing them out against sexual harassment but first what gave what was the impetus for these particular women the\nFilm is fine um well I mean among the feminists are quite a few of them um had suffered abuse and their personal lives well growing up\nUm for example the mites herself spoke about quite severe um physical violence or at the hands of her father I'm from a very early age and her uncle\nUm some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse and and it wasn't just these five women are a lot of the women who um who are have been involved in a women's rights movement has personally being\nUm victims of sexual assault or a very severe domestic violence and that has given these women and ten cents a personal commitment to fight that\nOne of the of some of his five a month for instance had to have a master's degree to teach high school whereas men in China only need a bachelor's degree you know there will be some people who remember mostly don't use a famous adage women hold up half the sky or in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China or equal with us\nDreaming on W E s a supported by Carnegie Mellon university's integrated innovation Institute details on the master's program\nAt CMU dot edu flash I I I\nOne of the of some of those five oh one month for his who's had to have a master's degree to teach high school whereas men and joined only need a bachelor's degree you know there will be some people who remember mostly don't use a famous outage women hold up half the sky or in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China or equal\nWithout ever the case and if so what happened to that [noise]\nYes well I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about for women because I mean even even though women still had to assume the double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the ...\nThe fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either and the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the con find moments of of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really on the highest in the world and in the early communist era and that and and the propaganda rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do\nUm and so even today you see the legacy of that early communist era because\nChina's seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling dramatically with the onset of a market reforms\nUm but but now in the last couple of decades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as I'm with the dismantling of the planned economy so many women who have been laid off to men and the gender gap is is rising exponentially in so many ways\nAnd that's a big part of why this feminist movement has grown is because of\nThe dissatisfaction with\nWith this huge gender gap that women you know have to put themselves behind men and so many young women today feel that that's really profoundly unfair what what is the threat that the Chinese government feels\nYeah well I mean this is what is so fascinating because on the face of it I mean what these women are doing is actually in line with\nThe Chinese government's expressed belief and gender equality um that if you look at the bigger situation of China now the economic growth economic miracle of the past few decades is basically over so they're slowing economic growth\nThe workforce is shrinking and birth rates are falling and the population is aging drastically\nSo the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing a particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do\nBecause these young feminists are telling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you don't want to but I'm In many ways I Believe that that that sexism and massage and eat and the subjugation of women pushing women to return to these traditional roles of beautiful wife and mother\nUm all of that is at the core of\nWhat I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how is the Chinese government pushing the\nWell I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is a very aggressive propaganda um that that is telling\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say ... and ... is the sound of a free press\nAnd to return to the traditional roles of beautiful wife and mother um all of that is at the core of what I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how is the Chinese government pushing the\nWell I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is a very aggressive propaganda um that that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long\nThen their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media\nThat women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant\nUm they should seize on their so called best childbearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part of it but then there's also policies um said that the um [noise] much publicized so called one child policy recently ended\nSo China officially now has a to child policy it's speeding or encouraging are trying to push\n'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of it's really dramatic policy change on on a population the birth rate still fell last year and this poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government\nAs it looks to the future um and so there's this huge confrontation now between\n\n\nThis is the sound of a free press [noise]\nNineteen US Senators signed a letter to the education secretary Betsy DeVos citing NPR's reporting in saying quote it is urgent that these ...

centered on two girls whose love for each other and put them in danger and conservative Tehran, Iran\nHer latest book is called here to stay it takes on the issues of Islamophobia and cyber bullying at a private school near Boston the hero is a high school junior name be Shaun he's of Middle Eastern descent and his sudden stardom on the basketball court\nHas some ugly consequences Sarah Verizon as a child of parents who came to us from Iran I asked her what she and that student be John have in common\nWe went to a similar high schools um he doesn't go to my high school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly\nWhite an affluent um private school if you did I did which was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I played basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller so should um\nGive it up we both love comic books we both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs a little help\nHe is of mixed heritage his dad is Jordanian um his mother is a Persian but grew up here\nSo you place to be John directly on the basketball court um Dijon is a star player he's realized to be a star player really quickly and kind of rises in in social status very quickly but then things change what happens in a school\nSomeone doesn't like all the newfound attention he's getting and I'm One of his colleagues ... right right and he we don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photoshopped image of him to look like a\nTerrorists holding an AK forty seven was in the ... right right yes ... yeah and ah had sent it anonymously to the student body so the school trying to figure out who had sent to his mother and other parents are are very upset and want to figure out how to fix the culture of the school and make sure he's OK\nOther students are that are behind him and allies sort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for something and he just wants to be a kid\nAnd so he's basically saying you know look I don't really want to be um the poster boy for international politics right\n[laughter] and people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kind of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to I Know kid should really have to do do you have to deal with that I sort of did the thing where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared\nI didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all this rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and the sort of thing and then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab American which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim I grew up pretty secular but yeah technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating a Japanese person to a Korean person where it so it was just kind of I think\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet very Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nFor they called me Arab American which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim I grew up pretty secular but yeah technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating a Japanese person to a Korean person where it so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking not invasive questions but sort of like they'd never really thought of it before\nYou called us polite racism and this is something that the John faces as well with\nWhat's the difference between polite and impolite where he just I think most people get the impression that you know racism terrible anyway and there's no really fully polite racism but there's a difference between painting something on your house or throwing a rock and a window\nVersus a micro aggression or saying something that sort of\nA little barbed or and made to some sort of other someone so how does ... in the book realized that understand I think\nHe's he's had to deal with sort of it's in for that have sort of had to deal with stuff before it just never been as viral as he does in the book and he for the most part it's pretty cool and calm and collect\n'em and stands up for other people and his sphere and himself but there are other times when his internal monologue you can tell that he is really I'm hurting and I think that's important too especially for boys where\nThey might say like you know up or yeah how's school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to to have him have a pretty rich in her life\nSo he puts up with a polite racism and then you know you get into the idea of cyber bullying and then things become exacerbated and get even more painful\nWhen you were writing this how did you decide whether to make some of the characters that Caucasian character specifically in the book deplorable or not deplorable I mean what what in your own experience made you decide well maybe this person is uninformed and this person is racist for\nMe personally it was really difficult to write this book because I Do want to get away from books that are sort of like where the character has to deal with Islamophobia like the character to just have an adventure or you know be the hero and you know get to do stuff that other main characters\nGet to do which is like you don't want it just like the character doesn't why he chose your person you don't want to be the ... well no but for all\nKids like I just want them to be able to be like I Am the basketball hero and this is you know what I've achieved but I did want it sort of address this thing that really\nHas bothered me for quite some time and it's not that I think that there are certain people who can't combat racism or or get over it maybe after the book finishes\nBut for that time and space I Want to talk about things that I think young people are dealing with and maybe don't get a lot of media time\nWhat do you what's the pay for you is it just getting the book out there do you want to hear from people who recognize themselves on one side or the other in the book for better or worse\nI Am concerned with people who maybe feel that the book doesn't represent them fully but I it's just one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is a main character that maybe people\nNot expecting and really love\nFree ... free to pursue the truth

who maybe feel that the book doesn't represent them fully but I it's just one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is a main character that maybe people were not expecting and really love\nI just want this kid to really even though he's fictional and very fond of him I didn't like making hurt a lot of times but I Know that if maybe people read about him hurting they'll hurt real people last\nIf you were in I mean this is a young adult book if you were kind of work up a lesson plan for this and you wanted to conversation to be started among students what would be the theme of that conversation\nHuh I Would say what does it take to find one voice and prejudice times\nHow can you stand up for yourself and others when that's really difficult which is a great hope but we'll see how that pans out\nSarah ... thank you thank you so much appreciate it Sarah fires on the book is called here to stay to read an excerpt go to here and now dot org\n\n[noise]\nToday the ...
