throwing shade at President Trump in fact that's the title of his book shade a tale of two presidents Pete Souza joins us now to talk about a welcome back to hear now\nThanks for having me on jury and

News ... found a free press\nSaying in Bedminster New Jersey a beautiful community is that staying in New York City is much more expensive and disruptive meetings exclamation point you wrote stuck in meetings at sunny lands in rancho mirage California twenty sixteen and it's a picture of President Obama golfing\nRight I mean let's just let's I well I don't understand why the the ... the United states can't be honest I mean just say you're standing bed Bedminster because you want to play golf and but to just lie about golf I mean it makes no sense to me\nSo that was sort of just a you know tell me and she writes folk poke I guess\nWhat's the one that you're most proud of they like I Can't believe I thought of that\nOr do I have to correct myself up sometimes when I when I come up with just the right picture in the right comment I guess\n... you know a Trump is always saying you know it's a witch hunt and it's a witch hunt I don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points in all caps a in regards to the FBI and investigation um [laughter]\nAnd I and I found a a picture of a a a a young girl dressed as a which had a at a Halloween party\nAnd I just I think I wrote I'm a you know another kind of which I I have to admit that I correct myself up\nThere's another one uh where you've got a picture of President Obama giving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that he has more of an aggression and he said\nForty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history Fox News ... every other network and you Instagram forty eight million people watched the twenty tends to union address on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had to kind of look it up a and and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama as it was a two thousand ten states union was the largest and in history\nSeems like there's another theme in here which is that President Trump has gotten into a lot of high profile fights with world leaders and when that happened to show a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them\nA yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to [laughter] ... especially you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked it I cried myself up over was\nWhen he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong ... and ... and calling him little rocket man and rocket man and you know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff [laughter]\nAnd I posted a picture of President Obama with a Elton John right and I said there's only one rocket man\n[laughter] ... what is President Obama think of what you're doing\nUm you know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this in\nA coup boots with him or that he was going to have any input I just saw him a week or so ago and now that the book is actually printed um I told them that I was doing this book he just you know he he didn't say that much about it\nOr at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nOr no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to\nHave ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by\nFried ... read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press [noise]\nUm I told them that I was doing this book and you just you know he he didn't say that much about it [laughter]\nOr at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nOr no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to\nDo you have ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post amongst around\nNo these are all a pictures that were previously made public offering the administration so there are considered public domain so anybody can use then there's another guy that has a has a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine and but he's allowed to do that so\nSo what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama or do you would you want to do something else\n[noise] no I Want to do something else that's sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a search for what kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do new photography and I want to move away from 'em at least us politics for sure\nHow come [noise] um\nBecause I don't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with President Obama where I had a dynamic a a person to a photograph every day um someone that I had you know admired\nSomeone who gave me incredible
