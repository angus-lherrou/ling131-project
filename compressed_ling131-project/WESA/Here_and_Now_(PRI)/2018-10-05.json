W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nAnd it was below estimates are the economists in ah the Bloomberg survey had forecast about a hundred and eighty five thousand jobs so this is about fifty thousand below that but it's a very tough month\nTo get right because of Hurricane Florence um ... you know a lot of companies that might have been planning to hire would postpone it and a lot of companies were just you know it's more or less laying people off\nTemporarily because of the weather so they're actually about three hundred thousand people are away from work to do the bad weather\nSo it's you know most economists are kind of looking past that disappointment in the number of jobs added due to the weather um and it just assuming that the same trends we've seen of of pretty healthy job growth is still intact\nAnd what about that unemployment rate the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine\n[noise] absolutely yeah and uh you know a Larry Kudlow today saying he he wouldn't be surprised to see it go even further I mean it just goes to a show as you said this economic recovery is still ongoing um\nSince two thousand and ten a the the nation is out of jobs every single month Ninety six months straight um and it just does not show any signs of slowing down at the moment\nWhen we were just talking this week about the fact that companies are having a hard time finding seasonal workers for the holidays because the unemployment rate is so low people are able to get\nJobs I this is totally anecdotal but I was at a coffee shop this morning huge line not nearly enough people are are ... are we at the point now where the issue is that companies just can't find enough people that want the jobs\nI you know to to give you an addict do to my own I just noticed that a lot of my friends nannies are are quitting because the employment prospects for them or are good so what does it all sort of\nAdds up to this notion that the employment market is very strong now uh it's still not doing what a lot of people were afraid it would do is which is overheat the economy and cause wages to accelerate aggressively um that's not quite the case yet\nUm but it's by all accounts of very very strong job market\nWhat did we learn today about wages\nSo they continued to increase the year every year a gain in average hourly hourly earnings was about two point eight percent\nI'm so nice gain but again not so strong that it makes you worry about it overheating of the economy that would start to\nA turn things the other way cause corporate profit margins to to shrink and that sort of thing it's still sort of steady as she goes uh considering the trends we saw a first for many years now we're back back through the uh beginning of the recovery from the recession\nWas going to be interesting to see how the Federal Reserve takes this news and we're already up to a to into court two to two and a quarter percent interest rate on the federal funds rate will see Mike we're going to Bloomberg News thank you factor\nIn Tempe is touting those new jobs numbers on Twitter and this John economy also came out the his rally yesterday in Rochester, Minnesota where he threw his late into one of the most highly contested congressional aides in the country for an open seat in Minnesota's first\nThis is supposed to be eight Democrats thanks\n\nVery big surprise I may\nThe Republicans in ... when he's facing the Democrat Dan ... those are vying to fill a seat left open\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet the Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nDemocrats thanks\n\nVery big surprise gum and\nThat surprises that the Republican Jim ... wins he's facing the Democrat dance in both are vying to fill a seat left open by democratic representative Tim Walz who's running for governor\nSo that district is where we turn to this week's district profile cast and Richard is senior reporter for Minnesota Public radio she joined us from Rochester and cats are in uh Minnesota went for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen\nBut the first district went for President Trump so tell us more about the district itself\nWell it's kind of a funny district if you look at it in the long picture um it's been traditionally conservative and Republican it's very rural so there's a lot of you know smaller agricultural communities and the district outside of Rochester in Maine Kato which are sort of the city hubs\nThat being said during the Obama administration Tim Walz won his reelection pretty handily up until twenty six team when he was almost defeated by Republican Jim Hackett darn and of course the district went handily for president Donald Trump at the time\nRight well let's take a look at the two candidates the Democrat and the and worked in the Obama administration he's an Iraq War vet a member of the Democratic farmer labor party which is aligned with Democrats and in this recent ad he built himself as an independent voice\nIn the army you can put any differences aside and come together accomplishment great thing and that's exactly what to be honest\nI'm not taking over ... that means I only often leader corporation\nCatherine Richard tell us more about seeing [noise]\nWell I think the first thing that people should know is that he's a political newcomer you know he's never served in public office before um he hasn't lived in Minnesota since he was a teenager actually and his opponents are frequently point that out so he moved back to the district to run\n'em I think what you're hearing there is his willingness to work across the aisle which is really important in this district which you know in the best case for Democrats as a moderate district and you know so you hear him running a pretty moderate campaign and it's really an echo two of the types of campaigns that Tim Walz ran here\nWell none of the Republican Jim had adorned in his reason add he talked about growing up on a farm in Minnesota doing a lot of reading which of course he brings to his thoughts on Washington\nWashington wins or government are so certain Rosen a Trump can't pull in fact\nFor car with the health and rip out the regulations Obamacare and voted to serve room\nCatherine we hear him aligning himself with President Trump what's the thought on that\nWell he has been aligning himself with Trump's views before Trump was really even on the scene remember he's run for three times for the seat so he has been running on a very similar platform for far longer than Trump has been you know campaigning\nUm and I think that plays well with certain aspects of the district and it's playing very well this time because of the fact that the district favor Donald Trump in the last election\nI think that things to know about ... joined that are interesting or that his dad actually held the seat and so he moved to Washington DC when he was a teenager\nAnd lived there for a long time and actually worked there for a long time so just like his opponent Dan Finn he has lived outside of the district for quite awhile worked in various administrations worked on Capitol Hill and has more recently come back to the districts to run again these last three times\nSo those are the two candidates cats or I'm going to ask you about another thing that President Trump said last night that jumped out\nDreaming on W.
