W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nJeopardy champion and the marshals scholar tell us about him\nYeah you know he's kind of nerdy actually and he would\nSay that he's describing himself that way actually but um you know the thing with Cordray is he's he's very majored in what he says uh people here know and he served as a state lawmaker he served as state treasurer he served as a G and then as you said he served in the federal level\nHe's been out of state for a while but now he's back running for governor\nA and he is a coming in saying he wants to uphold the Affordable CARE Act he has a a comprehensive bond package for road repair and infrastructure improvements\nSo that's that's where he's running right\nOkay and Mike DeWine is the current ah a G of Ohio we've actually had him on the show before talking about the opioid crisis but a ... he apparently likes to pass out his wife's cookbook when he campaigns at state fairs tell us more about him\nOn some of those recipes are mighty could [laughter] anyway yeah Mike DeWine is pretty well known to people he has a big every year he has a big ice cream social down in his home town and a lot of people now and you know from that but he's he's very folksy\nMike DeWine was a former U.S senator he's also served at the state level he was a with our governor\nOur former governor Voinovich a back in the nineties\nUm and served with him or so but he has been very staunch up against the Affordable CARE Act in fact on his first day in office he went in with some other states and filed\nAgainst a a filed a lawsuit against the Affordable CARE Act he comes out now he's saying you know I like this idea\nOf having protection for um you know these pre existing conditions\nBut he still says there are problems with the Affordable CARE Act that need to be fixed\nAri let's listen to what they sound like a as they're debating um this this clip that we're going to play here they're talking about a measure on the ballot called issue one which would emphasize drug treatment over prison time here is the one who thinks it's too soft on criminal\nOr are you telling me that we're not going to let ... it's my turn ... or they get outraged by measuring the get out it's my time you're going to get out shy proud of it was like OK here's Cordray getting a word and\nWe are the worst states in the nation the Trump Administration CDC report should we have the highest increase in federal debts last year and he stays in the nation are if so\nWhat we're doing right now is not working what am I for um for anything that will change what we're doing now\nExplain what's going on there obviously Ohio as we've talked about is a place with one of the worst uh situations when it comes to the opioid crisis\nShare is we're losing fourteen Ohioans a day or because of opioid abuse and and it's gotten out of hand and one of the things that we are that issue one that they were both referring to speaks to is it would take some of these low level drug crimes\nAnd take people who were uh you know sent to prison on those\nAnd it would you know allow them to come up and and make the case to get out but you know as Mike DeWine would say\nUm you know the other side of it is people say well you know you can get the treatment but uh you should be getting that treatment and also getting the punishment for doing crime this is just going to open the doors to more problems so there is a real debate here on uh how you actually treat people\nWho have these low level drug crimes and um how you get treatment for that\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\nFull what's on their minds well it seems like the biggest thing on people's minds these days is health care um a lot of people are like the Affordable CARE Act and even Mike DeWine would tell you that I'm even though he's been fighting against it ah Ohio is one of the states that expanded Medicaid\nAnd because of that a lot of people who have opioid problems have been able to get treatment through it and um you know they all like preexisting conditions there trying to parse out where they stand on the Affordable CARE Act and would they keep all of it or would they only want to keep part of it\nWhat's the polling telling you well at the beginning it seems like maybe Cordray was a little bit behind that the most recent polling shows us that that it's you know very tight and uh we've got eight million voters we do have\nIn this election that can vote and um we do have some interest as far as early voting numbers they're up over where they were at the same point in twenty fourteen it does seem like there's a race here\nNow a governor's races are especially crucial this year because who gets elected in November will be in office when states redraw the district maps in twenty twenty and the governor could either approve or veto those maps is redistricting a big deal in Ohio\nAnd that is a big deal it's always a big deal that Ohioans have approved at a ballot box they've approved a new redistricting measures we don't know exactly how those are going to play out we know the process certainly though we can be assured that whoever wins is going to have a a good good\nOpportunity to get in there and\nHelp draw those lines and I have some effect on\nUs joined goes who covers politics at Ohio public radio talking

seven thirty seven Macs a plane to crash into the sea early Monday morning the plane went down just minutes after taking off from the Indonesian capital of Jakarta\nInvestigators believe that all one hundred and eighty nine passengers were killed in the crash and it turns out there were concerns about whether the aircraft was safe to fly just one day before the crash joining us outside Kaplan from airline weekly Hi Seth\n... and we know that shortly after takeoff the crew for this flight decided to turn around and return to the airport in Jakarta but then the plane suddenly lost altitude and disappeared from radar what do we know about what might have brought this plane down\nWell water has to do with what you just said which is information from the day before people\nSaying that the plane was essentially going a radically doing things that we don't usually experience during flight my first thought was well you know what about whether what about turbulence but it sounds like something more than that something perhaps\nTo do with air speed indicators and a very early you have to emphasize that right now but you know if that played into this uh you know the pilots just not knowing exactly how quickly the aircraft was going you could have had a stall and this wouldn't be the first time that that has happened in my mind goes to a\nA crash that some people might remember off the crush of the coast rather uh Brazil back in two thousand nine Air France flight for four seven yeah\nUh and and in that case you sort of had a confluence of a few different things a mechanical

airplane and this was a brand new are planted flown fewer than eight hundred hours before crashing on Monday a brand new airplane sounds like a good thing but then you wonder you know maybe they
