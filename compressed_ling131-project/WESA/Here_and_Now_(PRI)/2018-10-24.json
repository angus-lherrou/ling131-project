the Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developer something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout star of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq War vet and President Trump's favorite Ron dissent is by as many as twelve points in the polling\nThe two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men to sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida as history probably as most progressive he supports hiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single payer health care system\nWill have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gives to Gail I'm against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations\nBut first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for\nAll I said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here in at the very least we would need\nA ... sort of states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs\nAnd others on behalf of its citizens and so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now are the Republicans have refused to expand Medicaid for that group\nCosting the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government\nThat right now is being given away to other states while we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissenters said that to a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to health care is that you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is disqualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee which is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in the state we were traveling in a young African American who is also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here said to us you know I I I think this is a problem he's\nTallahassee is the eight largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMuch that is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate\nMr dissenters described our community is one where people are sheltering themselves in homes in avoiding the streets and he's he clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognized that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what if humidity's do about it and what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers over the past four years we brought down our crime rate we instituted restored of justice practices created reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community gifts\nFried ... read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of

just do it for the president you may know Bo's about how you felt about President Trump and his loosen is with ads of leadership\nWell an absence of leadership as you as you put it rather than Trump's polling numbers they bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent to first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nWell I'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refuse to do with\nA I'm teaching my kids what it means to the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes around making fun of handicapped individuals\nReferring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter uh and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe\nIt's completely inappropriate behavior and Mr ... as he is sucking up

state\nUnfortunately for most of the center of this is not Russia\nOr we don't bow down to the president we work with\nA check for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle disagreement\nTried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail governor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama stimulus money\nAs much as I disagree with the conduct and the qualifications of this president if he tries to send Florida two point eight billion dollars I'm gonna take that money and I'm all put that money to work for everyday Floridians when I'm governor\nMy differences aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to help him on infrastructure\nHelp on transportation Rick Scott Knight who again don't agree on a lot politically during this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day on the phone\nTalk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region your opponent Santa's is now positioning himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to fail reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nCertainly different from your Republican sitting Governor Scott\nMy opponent can say anything he wants to in an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times\nAs a mayor before the capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above

races to watch we've talked about the governor's race between the Democrat Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum and the Republican former Congressman Ron dissent is there's a tight race as well for US Senate seat\nNot on the ballot but on people's minds Donald Trump in a hurricane here's some of what we're hearing [noise]\nBecause he had the Democrats\nI'm a Republican somebody wrote in right now\nYou all for\nDoes\nThat Wendy Alaska is in Miami also with her Miami there really to tell a Jake Bernstein an Alexander to heal healthcare President Trump can the sitting governor or the Republican Rick Scott unseat longtime Senator Bill Nelson is a lot going on for let's convene are Florida politics round table\nTo talk about it all and make Acevedo an anchor for Univision special correspondent for fusion joins us from W ELL are in in Miami high Enrique Hi Robyn\nI'm getting closer to you I'm In your state I'm Glad [laughter] and when they hear in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan hey Robin thanks for having me on well we want to start with you because we want to get to that governor's race um the Democrat Andrew Gillum as we said\nHas been fending off these charges that\nHe took tickets are handled it I mean handled and makes it after this race\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station\nThe sound of a free press\n[noise] uh you know just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers that turned out to be an FBI agent and I and as an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke the story of the text\nIn which a gala his friend a lobbyist told him about the health in ticket that this developer had for them Gillum respond awesome but he is insisting it even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket\nIs is this going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent is in some polling\nRight yeah I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here or\nThat or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answers these questions I mean almost undoubtedly\nThe disadvantages camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies in the story I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story um and again it's going to come down to how he answers the question\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know they couldn't be more different he's a progressive um uh let's hear a dissent is on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship with the president and the people in the administration Florida has a lot of names from our military footprint our transportation or water resources which been a big problem here and we need to work constructively with the federal government\nAndrew Gillum is running on impeaching Donald Trump I don't know what for 'em but I don't think he's going to be able to do anything productive ally with the federal government and I will be able to do that\nIn mind so how is President Trump laying out and say\nWell I mean I think you need to look no further than the uh Florida Republican primary um to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the Santa Scott the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump's and ah\nYou know I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent that tweet and being being Santas was up by you know however many points and and I I was actually a downtown where the Gillum campaign was are awaiting their primary night results\nThe Republican primary was decided\nWell before the Democratic primary that was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for a candidate\nWell and make it as if they don't let me bring you in here because of passing it also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections and that's this and he calls it the caravan of uh some say refugees some say undocumented immigrants making their way to Mexico to the U.S border\nThey are doing something like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that border till December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack on the border how's that resonating\nWhere you are in Miami thank he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the care of and then saying they're all for open borders I think this is one of those uh ... it's certainly a politically charged caravan are they very convenient time for the president\nBush said the the issue of immigration front and center which already was to be\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\nUm I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and I'm ... would really see the impact all the garbage and all the attention described and half out in the last couple of days and they will have a in the run up to your maternal election\nUh we'll see that on a ... depending on the journal both parties I think I read as he was a a turnout election\nWell and not to be clear this is a cat and that are reportedly was organized by a church is that it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar in the last one that was of this size\nA group of people um you know organized again by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states in the last care of and that made you got so much attention\nThat CNN is reporting that just three people uh were accepted into the country so there is that but I just and just to underscore this every day we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block\nAnd you will have people who will be a of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people they're seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point and Florida is a great example Robin you see the Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very pro Trump\nOr from one state in two thousand and sixteen now you have Puerto Rican said many of them who are already in Florida before Monday about all the security Maria\nOver the weekends I have seen a coming to Florida and that are um some of them have read registered to to be part of his mid term election and and they will certainly play a role and the result\nUh for for the governor race and and and the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not a monolithic community different interests and and different agendas\nI Want to turn to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nCenter Nelson and Andrew Gillum\nThere like high taxes um Andrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent [noise]\nThere and also voted for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher taxes higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd Here's Senator Nelson responding\nWell the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another uh apparently you never got your mouth washed out for slope after telling a lie because you keep on going on on every part of my record\nHigh and daily from WFSU here in Tallahassee always colorful but who's had the edge here and at especially with\nThe hurricane that just hit I every time I turn the TV on icy Governor Scott in a little kept visiting you know some terrible you know disaster where a school's roof has been ripped off I mean he is seemingly everywhere so who's who's got the ... year yeah I I mean",
