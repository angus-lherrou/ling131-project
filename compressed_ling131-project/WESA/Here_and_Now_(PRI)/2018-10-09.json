I think we are all here yes yes Justin Paul hello there even lettuce and hello\nBench I understand that this is all based on something that happened in your high school\nIs not directly based on something that happened to my high school but there was a student who I didn't know particularly well\nAnd she passed away and everyone in the school community\nAfter his death really began to sort of claim that they were closer with him than they actually were a myself included and I was sort of struck by this and when I met Justin in college we began to talk about how similar phenomenon like ah\nOur generations response to nine eleven we knew a lot of people who would insert themselves in this tragedy or pretend that they knew people that passed away and they might not have um and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular\nFeels the need to kind of\nPublic we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that further\nWell but in this case Evan Hanson a he's a kid that just\nGets up every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself gear Evan Hansen your kind of telling himself that how he's going to have a good day and what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmates but he presented kind of a bully he\nFinds one of the letters takes at home after he kills himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your editor Hanson and so he's they think their best friend and for Evan Hansen kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and also kind of changes him Stevenson\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with the story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also about the people around him are ... by the story as well um she feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this you know best friend of their son who of course is and I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear Evans mother a struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things that they\n\nTo how you were able to put those feelings into a song what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music to get across these characters no it's true um\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nSure how you were able to get the feeling any research on what's it like now that the ... novel you don't have music to get these characters\nYou know it's true or something that we talked about at the beginning of the process without which was you know how do you take the would become a sort of temple moments and the musical how do you take that in translated into a book\nIt is an interesting process of how do you get inside a character's head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as as a novel because the book\nAllows us to get inside these characters heads to really feel what they're feeling in the way that a song does so I think it does translate well and\nUh and same token we also felt like we want to just to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't slaves ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow any uh twenty pounds and this is very special to people all these characters and especially ... really means something to young people then he's in your hands\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel yes lots of sort of hands still sweaty hands in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In ... first monologue and the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say Evan also had sweaty hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands out to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being sweaty they're becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before here but I felt like I knew how to do this or emotionally I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity and the intensity\nWith with which people had attached themselves to heaven and the other characters\nWell talk more about this notion that you're writing about suicide you Erica I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize this\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know I'm just the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nWe all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of theirs and and the mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just a small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's the him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life he did he did he ever experienced joy or was it all you know I'm darkness\nThey only give anything away but I have to say we actually find out ... and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that\nKnow this is Steven yeah I think that's definitely a a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about Connor but do you really want to know more about counter or do you want to imagine more about Connor and\nI think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it is that we learn\nFried ... read it for the the\nNinety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAnd yeah I think that's definitely a a tension that we felt in the creative process was how much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about Connor but do you really want to know more about counter or do you want to imagine more about Connor and\nI think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it\nIs that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does\nAnd it was important to us that it not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt feels like a cautionary tale for times\nOf what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media Evan and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know what can happen

George Washington university global mental health program is drawn up a version of the Hippocratic Oath to address the problem\nThe ancient originated increase it calls for new physicians to swear to abide by ethical standards Philip can deal is is one of the doctors behind this new version\nIt's still the general principles of caring for patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits Cuban confidences but continue to this day\nCan tell us is professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen eighty two these told them\nThe way we turned to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we were eager to that people take care of their team take care of themselves recognizing that there was a cascade of care that has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first they have to take care of their teams\nThey have to make sure that they stay within their areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of when she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a Syrian section on a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult to uh in in desperate\nAnd you're saying that in its Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to say I can't\nRight that's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work do you think\nThis is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point uh our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already

potential culture clash as Muslim refugees and they are mostly Muslim enter a Christian region like the shores of Greece a pretty high margin is quite community\nHow has that caused problems and how

as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question and I really key documented said internal memo written by\nCommerce secretary Wilbur Ross who as commerce secretary oversees the Census Bureau and the twenty twenty cents is\nAnd it it he says that he initially thought about adding a citizenship question to the twenty twenty cents is as soon as shortly after he became ... the Senate confirmed him as the commerce secretary so this would be a late February of twenty Seventeen\nAnd then a over those months he\nWorked with his staff at the commerce secretary to find a way to get this question a citizenship question on to the census and this is a question that asks is this person a citizen of the United states\nIt's a topic that the Census Bureau has not asked all us households since the Nineteen fifty cents is although there have been a there's been a citizenship question on a smaller Census Bureau survey that's now known as the American Community Survey\nWhat reasons then did the administration gave her why it doesn't want secretary Ross to testify about it at least what the thing about its reasons\n[noise] well the Justice Department which is representing a secretary Wilbur Ross and the Trump Administration these lawsuits their attorneys are saying that the judges should\nDecide these lawsuits based on the documents these internal documents that they're released as part of the lawsuits\nAnd not on depositions questioning of Wilbur Ross ah and trying to get into his intent is mindset but that's exactly what the plaintiffs in these lawsuits and you know dozens of states cities and other groups that want this question removed\nThey say they really want to a better understand exactly why Congress secretary Wilbur Ross went to add this question because the Trump Administration has said\nThey want us out of because of the voting rights act and he wanted\nResponses from a citizenship question to better enforced section to the voting rights act which has protections against discrimination of racial and language minorities are essentially to make sure those groups have the right to vote 'em that the law the federal government has relied on

descending on the twenty twenty cents as\nPlaintiffs are very skeptical of that and they're concerned that there are other other motives here involved or one of the internal memos or one of the emails

as a former vice chair of President Trump's now defunct commission on voter fraud he wrote to Wilbur Ross are trying to lobby Wilbur Ross stew addict citizenship question and his concern was that undocumented unauthorized immigrants are counted in census numbers used to divide up\nThe congressional seats are among the states after the census\nOr all of this comes at a really pivotal time for the Census Bureau itself or the Senate has not yet confirmed President Trump's new appointee to lead the agency\nOr the Twenty one twenty cents as it's going to be the first to be conducted in part on line so with all of that going on how prepared is the Census Bureau for what is a massive undertaking\nOr the uh the Census Bureau has really anxious to find out exactly will the citizenship question that Wilbur Ross edible Steyer will grow and we probably won't find out until a few months\nAnd that's really pushing up against a deadline that the Census Bureau is facing of what to exactly prints on the forms are this will be the first online census but paper will play important part for live households and may not be comfortable or don't have access to Internet and so they will be paper\nAnd
