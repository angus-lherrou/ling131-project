northwest part of the state just truly unbelievable to see a looming crisis homelessness\nFEMA and aid groups like the American Red Cross providing temporary shelter but then what especially for the poor and low income where we can McCarthy is a senior news producer with W F F you and me and I know you and your colleagues have\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News that the sound of a free press\nFor more than two weeks ago but so many people still displaced do we know how many\nRight when we last spoke with FEMA they told me there are more than a thousand people and sheltered at this point and of course we know that not everyone who was displaced by the storm are are those people in the shelter so we can imagine that that number is much greater than that you know thousand or so people\nWill somebody with family or friends or in cars uh your colleague Lynn hat or spoke with tons of Denise Graham she was evicted from a low income housing project in Panama City because of the storm damage was listen\n[laughter] [laughter]\n[laughter] [laughter]\n\nSo you multiply her I'm sure by many and she has been approved for FEMA rental assistance we forget about I mean she was in low income housing but there are all these renters who don't have any recourse she got to see ... rental assistance and his waiting on a check\n'em but but then what I mean where she's supposed to she can find housing but we're supposed to find housing\nRight that's that's the difficult thing is that there aren't a lot of places available right now for housing and FEMA\nHas made some hotels available on their their vouchers said that you can use to stay these hotels but many of them are outside of the hardest hit areas so people have to have transportation to get there really there about twenty that are accepting vouchers\nAnd did you say you know trailers are on the way people think about those FEMA trailers but there seems to be a you know some slow down in the process they say they need to work with local governments they can't just come in there and say here\nWe come we're putting these trailers here the local governments need to ask for it and of course those local governments are are still putting themselves back together and so I think that's why we're seen sort of this slow response and they're\nAlso shelter is of course yeah well it will ah and\nBy the way we see FEMA people all over the place in their booty there working very hard you spoke with Michelle chestnut though she was staying in a shelter and a local high school and just want to listen to how\nWe say in charge and maybe it was just like all the windows busted out back and\nAll the trees come down and landed right beside the church though yeah [noise] um I have an aunt who houses destroys a brother in law is houses destroyed Seattle you know I'll do it while so home\nWell so first of all clarify for us because driving around this has driven home we're in the panhandle people might be picturing in Miami Beach and thinking these are second homes or be told her not\nRight this is a part of Florida where we have a lot more\nRural people a lot more low income people and so these these are even people who maybe don't have any insurance on their homes they are\nHomes that have been handed down for generations and so since they have no mortgage and they really don't have room in their budget for insurance they don't have that insurance which will make this recovery even more difficult they don't have that way chipped to begin rebuilding their homes\nWill and rebuilding was what because with so many things down a incomes have been cut another big challenge is joblessness that's looming 'em and you heard from Nikki Gilmore or Walmart manager in Mariana who said people showing up for work even though they have to really trying circumstances lives here\nAnd we're getting some terminated called one that gives them as the

smiling and great and\nDescribe like he just glad he has a job that he can recover from and a lot of sense to do that\nIt gives me a little compass yeah when he says we got air he means is he conditioning air conditioned right how are people getting by they have no income I think that it's\nTough I'm hearing from people who who are very concerned about at Gilmore had opened his door and it wasn't open to the public but he was allowing his employees to come in and just help with the cleanup process or that they could get a paycheck many of these people are living paycheck to paycheck\nThere is some unemployment like specifically storm related unemployment assistance available through the state but again that's difficult for the fishermen who maybe don't have a good way of tracking what their income has been and do they don't have a good way of applying for that assistance\nYeah but running water mostly back in some places it's not drink a bull communications as we have

seven six to ... was nuts yeah you're on an aunt okay good good\nI'm Dr Andy ... with your solar research Institute and we are at the edge of a pit that we're excavating dating from modern stuff right at the top all the way down to potentially maybe Fifteen thousand years ago some of the earliest occupation\nNot only in Florida but in the new world wow what kind of just getting to the the good stuff as we get through the earliest policy material and get into the end of the ice age the end of the terminal place of the material will be looking at things in the twelve to fourteen and it's like I said as much as Fifteen thousand year old range\n[noise] buckets are lined up shovels gently push to cross the pits for ... thousands of years with every they're careful exacting work you never know what you might\nBe the new findings stone tools just somebody knock the big flake off it was really sharp on one edge so they took a little um what a\nPiece of answer or another hammer stone perhaps interest sharpened it up a little bit more a drill the tip of broken off of that and we're probably guessing and again in the five six thousand year old range part of today's excitement has been that we had a little lens of charcoal\nAnd as we dug it out this morning it started to have some structure to it a Tom said perhaps corn cob a corn cob shouldn't be in nine thousand year old ... here but it's conceivable [noise]\nSo so that'll be that'll be the excitement this afternoon as removing this little pedestal that's got quite a bit of charcoal and if [noise]\n\nThe scraped materially dumped

Marts festivals where people are making arrowhead today and this is a double Taj that is what's on the floor after they get through the making of same during one at home\nIt was probably ten thousand years old [noise]\nI just touch something ten thousand you know ... school\n[noise]\nThat may be wasn't my hand that Dr hunting who just wiped out a few hundred years of history with one for the money was missing [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] it's funny but the reason he slips may not be artifacts are most beneficial to archaeologist they reveal their story best when they're found where they were left and\nStorms like recent hurricane Michael can disturbed that\nIf you stand in a place long enough you can feel the same ... and it's because you know snow into problems and agitation ...\nDo you think that's the rain as you as you shake your fist at the elements to just now\nIt importantly [laughter] um\nBut they think there's thousands of years old so they've been shifted\nSure if they're in place and not currently excavated and that's really why we were so very concerned is that we have an open excavation pit almost a meter deep with soils that have not seen the light of day for the better part a nine thousand years\nWe've we've made it vulnerable and so we covered this with tarps sandbag the whole thing and we we got off awful lot\n[noise] and so they continue the work that was started by a man who devoted his life to saving the history beneath Florida soil and found this site when a sewer pipes with laid\nThe original work was done by the state archaeologist Calvin Jones just along the sidewalk outside the large in Nineteen Ninety four and that's what some of the most important earliest points were made\nCalvin Jones isn't he the one who got a real barrel of loan delivered to his home and he's the one who realize that there was some ancient tool in that who said wait a second yeah he yeah the Jackson has and he's the one who said\nWait a second this there is more than dirt is part of this ancient burial site yeah here\nThey had a delivery of Sirte and within the ... there were\nThat is archaeologist Barbara clause of the Florida public archaeology

long meeting to grass covered hills rise like the backs of green elephant one bigger than the others okay we walked\nAcross that vast lawn and there it is I mean uh how how high near would you say this mounted\nThis is the tallest up to seven mountains it is thirty six feet tall these mountains were built basket by basket load of dirt\nAnd let's just backup what exactly is the mound\nThis site is actually part of what's called the southeastern ceremonial complex which is the south eastern regions version of the Mississippi in culture known by many as the mound builders over time they would build these mountains and their leader would live on top of the mountain and hot when that person\nDreaming on W E s say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university's integrated\nInnovation Institute details on the master's program\nAt CMU dot edu flash I I I\n... and then the next leader with live on top of it so over time it became taller and taller and you can actually see those different layers of soil if you were to kind of cut this mound and half you would see evidence of that you'd see the charcoal from the burned homes you'd see the burials in the mountains\nSplits climbed the mountain in that feels kind of [noise] I don't know you're walking on someone's funeral pirates it\nIt's a place that you you have to respect um people lived and died here just as we live and die today to definitely a very respectful kind of foreboding place\nI feel that but we are going to climate stairs to the top of it as a as a leader would've done hundreds of years ago so here we go [noise]\n\nAre there native peoples who are direct descendants of the people who live to use the\nDescendants of the people who live here where the Appalachia Indians that were here during the time of the Spaniards arrival there are still living descendents today most of them live in Louisiana\nAnd come over for educational events and things like that\nSo we're not climbing the the wouldn't stairs up\nThe mound um which is covered with wildflowers it's actually quite pretty I Know there's concern about how these ancient sites might have been impacted by what was the third largest hurricane you know in the country's history but I'm thinking since the year one thousand ADD\nThese mouths and we're right on top now these now have weathered uh when did a lot\nYeah I think the biggest danger to the mountains would be trees falling over because they take their root ball with them and with that of course they take part of them now and then you have an open place where rainwater can wash away parts of the mountains\nHere we are ready on top of the smell and we have all this growth so the leader of a community we'd get higher and higher and higher above the people I'm looking now on the big long where they'd all be living\nThis was strategically placed over here to our east we have Lake Jackson I always tell people when you're looking for archaeological sites you look for your basic
