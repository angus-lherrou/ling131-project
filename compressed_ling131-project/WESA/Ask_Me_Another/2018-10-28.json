you received\nThe information that you had an audition for sponge Bob square pants I was I remember very clearly I was in my friend's dorm room at Vassar College I was yeah go Vassar brewers I don't know if you remember that was our mascot\nAnd uh I was sitting on a bean bag chair in a dorm room and like a like a cross for me was my friend's poster of all the faces that sponge Bob makes all those wacky faces and then he had a\nPlush sponge Bob Dole that lived on that in that year so I was like sitting next to it and I got a phone call\nAnd it was a casting director who had just seen me audition for Romeo and Juliet really randomly as part of an apprenticeship that I wanted to work out for the summer and they said we have this audition for you can't tell you what it is technically it's the title Tina land up project but we think you might be the right shape for it\nYeah that hurt her a little bit I've gotten over it but you didn't know what they were talking about it oh no they\nThey said the name is chipper chip and just that we're going to send you a follow up email so I went back into the dorm was guys I got this audition how cool is going to be a and like there's like this little picture in the email of spongebob doing the hand eye like looked at the doll and I looked at the poster I looked at my friends and I was like oh chipper chip is sponge Bob\nI'm that is a crazy coincident it was it was really wild you go to the audition and you decide you're not going to do a sponge Bob impression is very distinctive\nHigh pitched kind of get ugly voice they are not going to do that you're just going to use your voice right yeah that was like both I'm a conscious decision as an artist\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nEight hours of preparation time sure uh I had never tried to do a sponge Bob impression I had a lot of friends who were great at doing the laugh yeah and that was not me so I stayed up you know working on my physical comedy routine until four in the morning on the quad\nAnd I just sort of like did the whole thing like this just like eat them but like a little bit more excited and um and the addition went pretty well but as I remember it Tina land out of the director at the end was like a great job awesome come back in and do the voice it's pretty important [laughter]\n...\nYes he says you're you are studying at Vassar you're sitting drama you yeah you got this apprenticeship for Romeo and Juliet did you know\nYeah I was actually cast in in the show or in addition to the apprenticeship which was like\nA huge for me it was like going to be my first\nProfessional gig yeah and I had to drop out because of a conflict with with sponge Bob uh [noise] which was like a surprisingly difficult decision because they were like well you got you know two weeks of this workshop or a full production of Shakespeare and I was like well I've been doing plays and I really love\nShakespeare I've I've been doing to shake their show since I was a little kid and DC and so that that was something that I'd always wanted to do and I talk to my professor at the time and she said Shakespeare will always be there but if you pass up the opportunity to work with Tina land out you're going to regret it\nSo I think Tina for being the reason that I chose the obvious bad [laughter]\nI Love the Shakespeare is always going to be there but spongebob is here right now right now right now his moments so this show is incredibly physical I mean you are doing gymnastics or jumping in the air\nFor what seems like over half of that show I mean it's intense so what kind of training did you go through a there was a lot of training and it's this five years you've been where he has shown me if I'm sick wow\nYeah but yeah I I've learned so many skills over the course of the six years I I learned things like juggling first scene that got cut and um I learned a great job right now I can juggle place so that sort of cool wow um yeah and and you know I went to train with contortion us for six months um yeah and yeah\nWhen you see the show you do this incredible back band that makes everyone gas yeah I'd say that I can I get thank you to a you know Jonathan notes and yeah my contortion teacher amazing okay\nI was really aware of the demands going into it and I didn't want to not be ready yeah oh yeah it was a lot and you mentioned that playing spongebob has actually affected your outlook on life it is made you a more optimistic person\nTotally yeah I mean it's hard not to I mean I I have the privileges\nYou know being the sponge a shows a week um when did you first notice this I don't I don't know it's been a gradual increase yeah I think I only started to\nAcknowledge it when people started asking me if I feel like a lot like sponge Bob yeah and like at first I was like [noise] no\nUm but yeah I mean like I\nAnd I I'm really proud that I Do because I think that shockingly spongebob has these qualities that I aspire to he he's sure he was like a little naive maybe but he's he's very optimistic and he's able to put his love of his
