on being nearby but she is co founder and former director of the center for contemplative mind into science team she's just written a new book together with ... walking each other ... conversations on loving and dying we spoke and two thousand Fifteen\nSo I Wonder how would you start to describe what that spiritual background of your childhood of your life or early life\nWell my early in life I was brought up Catholic and when I was seven my father left and my mother had to go to work and this is right after the war I say the second\nYou know you and a lot of other mostly Jewish and some Christian kids\nFried ... free to pursue the true not only five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nThe west is pretty amazing to think back on it and how that's how it is I mean when I first came back I mean [laughter] the idea [laughter]\nWe were so marginalized that's to put it mildly [laughter] and um [noise]\nUh we didn't quite know what to do that but many of us were really profoundly affected by it and felt that in some way or other we wanted to well first integrated into our own lives fully\nAnd then share it with others and so most of them are single and came back and wanted to teach\nJust with gold seen insurance sauce Bergen a number of other Buddhist teachers were there also be who became Buddhist teachers but when I came back two years later I was I'm pregnant and married and\nI had a child then so I couldn't when we first came back meditation we still had the model of it being monastic\nAnd so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just knowing that imagine [laughter] right [laughter] [laughter]\nSo but I was just just committed as everybody else to finding a way to bring this into um our lives in the west so first I\nStarted a business with my then husband John Bush and I was on the limitations and yeah yeah I thought when I was most interested in at a looming nations was integrating\nThis sense not just practice because not everybody who work there wanted to learn to meditate but we integrated in ways into the business that would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice ...\nYou know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know it's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more\nComplicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but at the time that was radical yeah so we really want to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words\nAs you can appreciate [laughter] so I ... we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east writes livelihood you know where what you're making\nIs wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the the season and at the same time the way in which you're doing it is helping everyone who's involved to wake up\nInterestingly we did so many things that when I many years later arrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there were there engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that they recognized about what makes a person more creative more able to ah bring their their whole self into work and to be able to grow\nFrom their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\n[laughter] right right [noise] that is a shaft that is still a\nStill has a long way to go oh for sure in terms of American\nDreaming on double you say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu flash I I I\nDon't worry of searching satirist self first of all I I I Love the story of how you that you had to find that language I mean isn't that right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't take [noise] yeah [noise]\nUh actually my friend Ming who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemporary of mind and he called up and well first of all he said when I was younger\nHe been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him so he'd been thinking for some time at Google that or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd been there since almost the beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter]\nAnd um when Google went public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide but it was so man decided it was going to be bringing meditation and he said I posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help so I went out there and we talked and we looked around and\nWhat we identified was that people ... employees there are\nAll quite young very smart graduated the top of their class from MIT or Stanford um [noise] had been in front of their screens most of their lives so I'm\nAfter talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there\nI suggested that we could\nOffer the same practices but emphasized the practices that that more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame and then a different way and so we called it of course they came up with this great name since they're the big search engine search inside yourself\nAnd then the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction and we asked Danny Goldman who also is in bug guy or with us back all those years right guy\nI'm asked him to give a talk at Google about the relation between about why emotional intelligence so important in the workplace and uh the relationship between meditation and Marshall intelligence he did that and then we punched in the course\nAnd in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up and since then you know over two thousand\nGoogle lawyers around the world have taken the course and there's a lot of talk now about bringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it helps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question\nAnything it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing but\nThis is a serious course and when you sit down and quiet down can calm quiet stable you have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes\nYou know really disturbing emotions rise but it needs to be taken to the next kind of level of depth in order for people to begin to question right\nFree ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nOffers enough time practice and a teaching to help people do that [noise]\nI mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing thing to name that if you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic right [laughter] I mean this can be superficial and it can be abused like any like any spiritual practice politically correct is um [noise]\nBut you know nearby something that really so intrigues me in um\nIn your work and in some of your writing is how you know like the language of emotional intelligence that you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including workplaces um [noise]\nThat what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has\nHas is faring noble lineage um you know it's it's um that is the tradition that has focused on this for ... years but you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention over and over again it's a very root of judgment character and will\nAnd I mean I don't know I don't think he was ... that that is the intention right have you seen and that's just quite amazing and then\nIn the seventies you had a somebody who actually I had never heard of David McClelland\nYeah in William James hall mhm um who became a teacher to all these figures have gone on especially in narrow science to retrieve David than Daniel Goldman cliffs Aaron mark Epstein\nAnd also to me what's fascinating is that she was Quaker and they lose something in your work there's this thread you've pulled through and seeing that this contemplative\nImpulse is a kind of human tradition as much as it is in their religious traditions I'm In ... center Owen cs Lewis and the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that far away from me and it's really\nCriticize him so much [laughter] I'm honored [laughter] yeah but\nYou know whenever you stand in line these days or do anything that involves waiting yeah um we're all on our phones immediately were never alone and were never in a ... gauge with our phones and I'm I'm kind of starting to wonder like what did we used to do [noise] you know I write\nDid we I mean you're talking about looking at a leap but I mean did we look around and I mean I Know there was\nBored I don't there's no romance attached to this but somehow we survived and flourished and it just makes me wonder what was happening in our minds are inwardly then or even in terms of our relationship to the world we were standing in yeah that is completely gone now\nDaydreaming ... which researchers\nFound that daydream is good for your brain [noise] um I don't think we do as much of that\n[laughter] teaching these students are also we at the end of the day we did that the yoga and in a deep relaxation\nAnd um of course they weren't allowed to use their phones during the day [laughter] but it's a dish of us in a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done a yoga class you know none of it's like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know [laughter]\nAs soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three brass fan and I saw these arm's reach out [laughter]\nFor their phones and about lying down [laughter] sorry for far right they brought their phones in front of their [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little Catholic girl and ... what's the sec religious right [laughter]\nRight well but okay so and you get all that beautiful work as Google and Google as part of the problem here you are to the point that nothing is pure and um but you also written about and it's very practical\nLike mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what do you talk about that yeah that's really ...\nYeah yeah um we devise that at Google upset she\nHer magazine and plus I'm I mean it's so simple\nFree ... free to pursue the true not only five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nIs so simple and we don't do it um [noise] you just type out your email either a response or an initiating email and then you stop takes three depressed follow your brass\nIn and out in and out and in and out and then\nYou read the email and you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on an emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be agitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion\nOr maybe even as this person likely to think you I mean you're offering more than you actually are what whatever we asked them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send\nAnd the first time we we did it it was a week in between the classes and so a week later they came back and said how did it go and um they all said that as radical me using and then one guy said\nI did something really radical I said what is that\nI picked up the phone [laughter]\nRight [laughter]\nSo yeah I mean there we all are emailing to the people in the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful\nReally helpful I wanted to go back for a minute because I didn't answer your question about social justice activism really house yeah I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change\nYeah but what mindfulness compassion practices others help with is\nThe understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand or repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body and then notice what your anger is see it and\nRecognize it as an energy energy in your body right but at the same time holds a compassion and echoing immunity for the situation because\nYou're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it causes in mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate acronym Annie and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to both see\nInteresting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it and communicate it\nWe did a lot of work with lawyers and judges and\nThat I didn't hear anything about that I wanted to ask you about that is so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental [laughter]\nIt's I mean we we laugh but it has you know it's they will lawyers worry that can they be as zealous advocate for their client\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E essay Pittsburgh NPR News the sound of a free press\nAnd um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men is not eliminating wise discernment it's\nEliminating pre judgment so that date judges are unbelievably overworked\nThey have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know some young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking\nThat this was probably who he is and what he's done right\nAnd they can't not have that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff but they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there isn't a moment clear and open minded with whomever comes before them but it's really hard so\nJust being there and really listening to what's actually being said that can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and\nThey loved it oh yeah I just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it has about two to three seconds long\n[laughter] kind of interesting right like physically like what we experience of the press about why there's two yeah and also that you can that it can be a longer right which is all you meditate or have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there [laughter] you can do all of the ... yeah [noise]\nI'm ... and do this on being today with what his teacher mirror by Bush who works at the intersection of industry social hailing and diverse contemplative practice [noise]\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with mindfulness and contemplative practice [noise]\nIt's so obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and a and actually say like for myself I have um I've had many experiences across the ears on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh [noise]\nEven a kind of one off contemplative experience can be instantaneously gratifying right it can be on just transformative and now they're asleep and all this science about how good it is for us on these very like biological levels and stress and all of that\nBut it's very hard to\nCreate this habit and has been hard for me I I have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise]\nYou know I decided I could do six minutes in the morning while my piece tapes which just seems so pathetic but yeah it it it's a hard time yeah and I wonder um\nI Want to ask you this you work with so many different practices I mean are there is this something where you really do have to find their way that works for you yeah well\nThe center we we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered you know we've had a Buddhist teacher and I\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nAnd teaching Christian practices um someone doing to be chanting we've done it that way and then", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Being", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "28"}
