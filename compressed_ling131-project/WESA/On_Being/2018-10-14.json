earlier this year the University of Montana in Missoula a blue city in a red state invited on being to attempt an outside the box civil conversation between two pundits with big followings on contrasting ends of the U.S political spectrum\nIt became a sold out public event in the spirit of Montana's Senator Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage and humility across the partisan aisle in the two most of the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWe first reached out to CNN commentator Sally cone who for several years what's best known as the liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News she just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate\nSally asked to be paired with Erick Erickson he was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta he enthusiastically agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation to two of them have been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who waited in a long line and they told me that come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThey were instead exhilarated\nIn the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witnessed or imagined that this was possible\nA true back and forth marked at one spy bedrock different and good will and humor and a willingness to bring our questions as well as our arguments our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening Mm\nI'm Christian tip it and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the Dennis in theater in Missoula, Montana and was co hosted by Montana Public radio [noise]\nSo you know as as I Move through two thousand sixteen um what started being clear to me kind of midway through the air is who ever won\n\nI'm ... and this is on being today at the University of Montana with conservative commentator Eric Ericson and progressive commentator Sally come on\n\nI think that this phenomenon of trolls as like a\nLight is made

you've done as he actually well he said he said I said I don't want to brag but somebody at Twitter told you that you had some of the worst trolls on the Internet I mean I'm just saying\nThat you actually called a bunch of them up a dead there were so many ...\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nOne of the interesting things you did you've done as you actually well he said he\nSaid I said I don't want to brag but somebody at Twitter told you that you had some of the worst trolls on the Internet I mean I'm just saying\nThat you actually\nCalled a bunch of them up a dead there were so many interesting things about my trolls even the word\nWe choose trolls right that the ... you know maybe she creatures who live on damages and throw rocks and they had a very ... humanizing latch\nYes um and I I'll I'll say I guess that there were two things that I took away the most um one was um [noise] no one thinks they're mean no\nOne thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just ... talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good\n... and these trolls didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil or are cooler unkind um and and in fact\nWhen I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of being called things I Can't repeat on public radio and online\nUm and they're going through real hardships\nIn their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this is one of the things they choose to do with their time but still um no one thinks they're mean\nNo one wants to be hateful okay what do we do is that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're in this well\nThe only thing I'll just say this is I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which is like right now but still there were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are and ready forgotten it's\nOr it could hurt you that they make you feel the way you were feeling\nAnd the thing that they have the opportunity a lot of them apologize ... thanks but why did you then do it right and the sort of it has something to do with a\nLack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads\nAnd so I mean there are studies that when people have to ah you know are sort of challenge to engage on line and computers scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to\nWe behave more kindly to there's this ... of technology that then allows us to fuel a demonization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of nurturing an ambulance\nBy it yeah yeah [noise] um mhm so I mean part of what I think we do\nIs start to understand that we all have a problem right and I don't look I don't I don't care who does it worse I happen to have an opinion on the matter about uh I'm actually on is what I really think I'm curious do you agree with us Eric is I I've come to think that ah that the left\nBy and large uh is\nNicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity and job [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we can somehow figure out a way to say okay you know what I like let's try to do both\nFree to pursue it for free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nThe people in specific but not humanity and job [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting right and and if we can somehow figure out a way to say okay you know why I like let's try to do both\nUm but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we all have\nA habit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other ... and we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people my liberal to say oh they're a game from supporters me that there are so racist and they're so as long as they can I hate them\nBecause they're so hateful I hate it out of\nIt and we blame the people for then expressing these views as do not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith\nIn people's\nTo be good and assume\nI Try very hard in this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I tried very hard to assume\nI tried very hard to assume that you like me\nIn spite of some of the some of the things I Know you've read in and and there and it's written and said about gay people\nI still don't assume you mean me oh well I don't\nI can and that and that the rest of that is sort of attention but it's also I I I Want to believe the best in people and it seems to me that's the gift I have to give other is if I Want them to believe the best of me\nYou you actually call that a daily spiritual practice I guess that's if\nYou know or I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught and one of them are related dynamics swell up this which is that the culture we've created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like them so but in a very particular instance are you said something I mean you said a lot of good to hear it but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret\nIt said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm wrote a whole chapter in the book about that one yes yes\nAnd um and the word goat was in it and yes I'd like to talk to my twins are all about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing the center you and I said how excited I was I talked to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed the saga yet but\nSomebody came through and energy and beyond ... ask Erick Erickson what a you know saying this has to do with repairing civil discourse\nYou know you use the word Jolie made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand nine and ... it was just I didn't know anybody but a couple of dozen people on Twitter at the dog and\nWas just friends and it wasn't my remark it was someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership over though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since\nUm but the number of people who still bring it up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten all of you and she just above right actually our route several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it's\nDreaming on W.

[noise] um\nI'll give a practical tips and a challenge to the practical tip is we we know from neuro science that when people\nA sense an argument\nTheir brain shuts down the persuasion parts of their brain shut down and the fight or flight parts of their brain light up and they picked aside\nAnd no one's going to pick your side it's by definition and arguments or the other person you're arguing with who's going to pick their side and and then the whole thing breaks down and everybody leaves feeling pretty crummy about things and so the extent to which we can keep things conversational and also that if you want to persuade someone else\nYou have to be open to being persuaded yourself\nThese are two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else to say [noise]\nUm I mean look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives and our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological ah it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have the stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprised I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we're such quick progress on gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims\nYou know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day out of Mexican cartel [laughter]\nWhether there are studies that\nYou know look kids who go to racially integrated elementary schools\n... grow up to actually they have less racial bias and college students who participate in racially integrated uh\nAnd after school programs are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other but then has a much more positive effect\nMore broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually I actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask as we\nAs we wind down which is if the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree\nRight and that in fact ah\nWe really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a a proposition is that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called con life\nThat if it is about also just learning to disagree better\nWhen we're integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect\nThis you know Sally says I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and Eric ... yeah you said some of them not to pay your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have been and can still be on social media and so so this is a work in progress for any of us\nFree to pursue the truth free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nIt's really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally says I haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and\nEric ... yeah you said some of them not what your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community is why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have\nBeen and can still be on social media and so so this is a work in progress for any of us and we're all centers um what is the experience you have a what does shift which is what becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um have\nThe experience myself of being unexpectedly kind in the face of people being cruel on line or off\nAnd seeing the difference it makes in yourself\nIn for it and I feel better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do\n'em try it [noise]\nBut it and then as well mhm uh people\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like [laughter] uh\nI had the\nPrivilege of finding example after example I mean there are in credibly powerful stories of people who\nWere you know professional hate mongers or kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things and who the targets of that hate showed kindness and generosity\nAnd transformed those dynamics on\nTwitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they had been raised thinking we're hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware of the power of the burden that in a way\nThis suggests is that those who are perhaps\nIf you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at\nThe receiving end of more of the hate should have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I I get that there are times where it feels daily ...
