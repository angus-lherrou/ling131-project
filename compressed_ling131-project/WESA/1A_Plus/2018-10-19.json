W E essay ... NPR News the sound of a free press\nLike the kind of illustrates my thinking about labor shortages or if you go into a store and you offered to pay less than the posted price for something and the store refuses to do that or we don't say there's a shortage I think the same logic applies to the labor market fits in recent years we just aren't seeing broad\nSigns of extreme labor scarcity in\nThe national data that scarcity should produce rapidly rising wages as employers compete for workers and we're just having observed that overall ... after we adjust for inflation remains very weak\nAnd there's little evidence of earnings and brought industry groups out pacing other industries by big margins are for example a wage growth in construction and manufacturing is not so different than for the overall economy\nAnd a and also say the wages are growing at roughly similar rates across regions going a bit faster in New England and the Pacific states but uh but not tremendous gaps and and then I'll just end by saying that that's all to say that\nThey were not seeing this at the broad national level but there could certainly be particular occupations in particular places that are characterized by labor scarcity and that have seen some pretty rapid wage growth I just don't think that's probably true of us labor market\nWe heard from quite a lot of you about just the nature of wages as an impediment to filling these jobs Ronald posted on our Facebook page as someone who worked for many years in construction mostly trim carpentry I can see wages in the field aren't enough to attract and keep people willing to do the work\nWas show emailed it's wages not supply\nAnd Christine car and wonder if you might respond to this tweet from Fran who wrote New Hampshire eliminated the state minimum wage a few years ago so even though all surrounding states have raised fares we're at the national minimum wage thousands traveled to Massachusetts daily were the pay is much better\nChristine in terms of what you were dealing with trying to get jobs matched up with workers how much does the state's minimum wage factor in just structurally\nOr [noise] well I I don't have any empirical data on why so many uh employees are working and natural traveling there but I Know and I live there that it played over as a caters everyday into the city and out and many of those that coming from New Hampshire\nSo you know wages is one aspect of it but there for sure is an actual shortage of people and my feeling is we've got to really just focused on how they can get the people that we have entered the jobs that are out there\nWhat do you see the Roosevelt shortage Christine was there a point at which you begin to notice more viscerally that the job market and the labor pool were significantly mismatched\nThat\nYou know I feel like you know my point of view is sort of a wider industry perspective in in a sense that it worked in technology for the last ten years and coming to New Hampshire and looking at each of these high end um occupation such as automotive construction\nManufacturing there just seems to be shortages across every single sector whether it's in India factoring are at high tech\nLet's get to a few more of your comments particularly about\nThe nature of what we've described as an aging workforce Christian in Wisconsin emailed to all the companies out there whining that they can't hire enough people stop discriminating against older workers and older is in quotes we're not old and we have so much experience plus we don't always want a huge

before we bring in our next guest particularly with regards to training skilled\nWorkers Chris writes as a current plant manager of a manufacturing facility and for manufacturing HR director slash production manager for over Fifteen Years in both metal and plastics I Am calling BS\nManufacturing in the U.S has completely abdicated any responsibility for training new employees since the eighties they want experienced people at relatively low wages right off the street\nIf you want lower wages to remain competitive you must develop an inhouse training program that brings lower wage entry level employees up to speed over time\nWe also heard from some of you in some pockets where employers are increasing wages here's one listener who left a voicemail in our inbox\nThis is bill I live in North Carolina and I work in the logistics and we're out and supply chain industry and we've had a a pretty good expansion of our business over the last six months\nAnd we're really struggling with two items one is employed turnover wherever there are chasing higher wages and and new facilities and new employers and secondly trying to hire the right people are as a result of that we've had to probably increase our incoming salaries the hourly salary is probably anywhere between ten and Fifteen or twenty percent\nWhat we did last year so we're struggling with both turnover and securing the right employees so having unemployment down as low as two to two and a half percent is definitely impacting logistics and warehousing\nIt's easy to see how Bill thanks very much for sharing your story with us\nAnother one of our listeners tweeted I hold a four year degree strangely enough in journalism but transitioned into a trade job shortly following college because the pay was three times what a starting job in my field would be I Know makes six figures yearly and work in the rural community I grew up in\nI Will withhold my thoughts on your ... your journalism degree good for you glad you found something that works for you but\nThis listener has an interesting point because to stem their brain drain some cities and counties and states are offering to pay workers to move there there's a city in Nebraska that'll match signing bonuses for newcomers to the tune of five thousand dollars\nVermont passed a law to pay people ten thousand dollars to move to Vermont and work remotely\nAnd accounting northeast of Detroit is offering to take a chunk out of your student debt\nThat plan was the idea of Randy Myers the president and CEO of the community foundation of St Clair county and he joins us now to discuss it Randy welcome to want to say\nThanks Joshua so this is called the come home award tell us what to come home award is how does that work\nHe had to come home award program that we lost in ... and early twenties sixteen is really turning traditional scholarship and smiles on their head um there are too many flaws and traditional scholarship to talk about and going up but\nAt its core what we're doing is changing the scholarship business model and instead of investing heavily in a Seventeen or Eighteen year old who may or may not complete college or maybe not be right for college we flipped it around and we said we will have significantly apart\nDreaming on WGN instituted by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation [noise] details on a master's program\nAt the end you die ... last I I I\nReally don't come home reward paying off of that\nSo this is for people who are who are from saint Clair counting to come back home to St Clair county\nYeah we have a very strong preference for those with family ties I mean to to help protect our investments we want people to know what it's like to live in a small town America or we want to keep them here and so we feel that they have some family connection here there's probably a better bet they'll stay\nTell me about St Clair county pay me a picture of what's it like\nSo small town America or its waterfront community along the shores of Lake Huron in the St Clair river um our largest town of course here has a population about thirty thousand people we do not have a four year University in our region we did I have a fortune five hundred company in our region\nA thirty percent of our workforce leaves our county and heads down in metro Detroit to to be employed\nBut they love the small town life or the family friendly environment amenities\nSmall town America Josh\nI was just going to ask you about Detroit you're about an hour outside Detroit is that right\nYeah and you were talking about something earlier Josh I Want to mention you know Detroit has become a talent magnet which is great for Detroit um but the health of America and the health of Michigan I think is better judged\nOn the economic health of regions like port Huron are Marquette or Muskegon, Michigan right it gives you a better barometer of what is our our true health\nHow did the recession do to do in St Clair county where people keep their pretty hard\nYeah I Would say it hit here earlier than than it hit the country and much more severely um the ironic part that we tell people and that's really one of the things that led to this come home program\nWas once we really hit rock bottom our stakeholders whether it was philanthropies government business any other sector\nWe realize that we all had to get together and play a piece in economic growth and prosperity we all had something to bring to the table but more importantly we we reached a point where we stopped waiting for someone from Washington or someone from Lansing to come in and save us with a plan it had to be an organic planned at that drove our prosperity\nSo Randy telling me how to come home award works suppose I'm from saint Clair county and\nI moved to Chicago for work and now I'm considering coming back and how does that work yeah\nChicago's a great example Chicago Austin's south um as long as you do not have primary residence here so let let's say your parents still live in this region maybe completed college six years ago and you're still living in Chicago but you met someone you met a partner medicine every other year you're weighing the option of staying in Chicago which is a great place to live\nOr you want to come back home settled down start a family spend more time doing what you want to do as long as you don't already live back in our region or you're eligible for a Fifteen thousand dollar award\nIf you're selected we give the recipients a hundred and twenty days to establish permanent residency\nOr they have to find a job that they don't already have won several already have jobs lined up and then we stretch those payments out over two or three years as a carrot to keep you here\nAnd it's really a simple back on scholarship we pay the loan holder directly which in every case for us has been the federal government\nSo I Do so you you pay it out a little bit overtime so by over time by the time the two years or up Sinclair county voted this program to come home award will have put in Fifteen thousand dollars towards one's Dan I'm guessing it's like would that'd be three thousand seven hundred fifty dollars\nFree to proceed to read to explore we're Ninety forty five ... say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nJoshua and the goal you know I'm is to really give young people actually yeah it could be in their twenties or thirties or forties I'm the chance to go two or three years without making that nationally I Know you see data says the average college student has thirty thousand dollars in debt\nI don't know where they're getting that data Josh because out of the fifty plus applications we've received our average editor eighty thousand dollars\n... that's that's a crippling amount of debt at preventing people from living the American dream\nI can relate to that I finally paid off my private student loans I had to settle them it was\nOh God it

A. M. U. dot org let me get to a few of your comments including some of your commenting about this Elizabeth Warren's story Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes him look bad and I was very happy that Warren released this DNA results\nHe showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares at hearing the story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to Andy's comment this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nI mean that was tried over and over again in the twenty sixteen election and it didn't end up working I think when you engage with Trump in some of these arguments that's what fires up his base and that's what's been his success in the past that's what could help Republicans\nScreaming on WGN appointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt the end you died last I I I\nI read still seems to be that static but we'll see how things play out\nIn the air go ahead for like a it's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to you know add to what Alexandra saying look this is what happened to two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio ... uh\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on in his you know neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook them out um and I think it's very dangerous uh for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and\nThat's that's meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff Josh will if\nYou look at the way in which um you know a parochial entity like the New Hampshire Democratic Party is trying to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections are founded telling that the gifts that they brought up\nA typically these would be people you know our presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been you know stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Ozzie and Alec Baldwin and\nThey we haven't yet seen I mean typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but we've ... the people who have drawn the most attention of the people who've cast themselves as Trump antagonists end\nOf the coffers of the local Democratic Party would tell you that that's been good for them so you know the mid term to appear lose their favorite but sort of an all against all on the question of Trump\nAnother politician who at one point was an antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again and this week he democratic he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke\nPeople are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight in a work came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at what point at one point Franco or ... what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate\n[noise] um you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races it's ... it's been the most fascinating race probably a throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nThis was always going to be a long shot a for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know tried not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know he but he's been dropping in the polls and he's\nHe's had to take a new tack using this language of lions had um attacking them about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas um it's been a major shift in tone for art\nBut it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with just yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat at the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants a you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for Beto O'Rourke some some hope is like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like that seems like another ballgame yeah Alex\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nOr ... I mean ... I Wonder if this debate gives us any more insight into whether it rather progressive Democrat like a war has a chance in a state like Texas who's you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans does this give us a sense of whether he moved the needle it'll\nProbably it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in the midterms typically you know not that many voters watch them sometimes undecided voters do but unless there's a major gas\nThey typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows that Ted Cruz's up by about seven points which\nOn election day of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think\nAnd under covered aspect of this raises the fact that Texas does straight ticket voting you can go in a box for Republicans and the strength of the Republican Party over all the strength as Governor Greg Greg Abbott for instance who's running\nAgainst Ed Ed Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties and seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even if that are over ark has been able to keep them to single digits\nI just wanna make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in Texas you can just mark a box of the top of the ... and says Republican and it automatically couch that vote dressed county for all the Republicans on the ticket\nYet you can basically do for every Republican all at once I'm this is the last election that they'll be doing straight ticket voting after that it won't be as easy\nWill fundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're due this week to the federal election commission they were doing Monday and the results\nLook pretty good for Democrats and house races at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of Democrats are dominating fund raising in house seat races the challengers the Democratic challengers out raised Ninety two Republican incumbents more than six the Democratic candidates raised more than a million dollars that quarter\nIn the Senate Democrats are also outrage and Republicans Beto O'Rourke raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races\nAlso glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas Karen tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday to rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continue to be felt and seen\nThe weather channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatalities spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to find people who've been missing\nYeah there are still people missing there's still people who are trying to pick up their lives um you know I think\nThe town in Mexico beach is not reported given any numbers\nUm of how many people are are missing a but there is talk of that it could likely be in the hundreds I mean this\nWas a massive storm I'm Talking about one of the biggest storms of the top three or perhaps by some accounts that you know had made landfall that would make it bigger than Katrina\nAbsolutely terrifying I'm Mary Louise Kelly healthcare in Arizona's midterms this afternoon on all things considered from an area\nThis afternoon from four to six thirty nine point five W E s say\nMany thanks to the more than Nineteen hundred people who contributed two hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars to the W\nE S a fall membership campaign it was a huge success special thanks to our sustaining members and our leadership circle members for their challenges in matches you make everything we do possible\nAnd if you didn't get a chance to contribute you can still do so at W.\nE.

A. M. U. dot org Josh Rogers let's talk New Hampshire for a little while there are two congressional races underway there are two districts in New Hampshire\nThe race in district one\nWill be historic kind of no matter who wins because either the Democrat Chris Pappas would become the state's first openly gay member of Congress\nHis Republican opponent Eddie Edwards would be the first black house member from New Hampshire tell us a bit more about the first congressional district as I understand that it's it's a swing district that Donald Trump carried in twenty sixteen right\nAbsolutely frightening and a party to party from two thousand eight or the GOP winning and midterm years Democrats winning in presidential years is now held by Carol Shea Porter fairly liberal Democrat who's\nRetiring I'm In ... where do you have people who are running really within the mainstream of their parties are pappas has been serving in various\nElective offices for a long time he's in his late thirties he says family owns a very popular restaurant in Manchester often to stop for presidential candidates\nHe um he comes from Manchester which is a town the where the even the Democrats have historically been a little bit more conservative than in other parts of the state particularly on fiscal matters\nUm Eddie Edwards is somebody who has a background in law enforcement he was in the navy he at one time led the states uh enforcement division of its liquor commission in New Hampshire we have those big highway liquor stores liquor is controlled by the state uh it was a fairly big job you of ram enforcement division and he's been a police chief\nUm you know they're pretty much keeping to well within the norms of their party Eddie Edwards has embraced Donald Trump Rudy Giuliani appear campaigning with them [noise]\nUm and he's in some ways trying to cash Kris ... you know part of some sort of resistance movement and saying we've obviously the nationally Chris Pappas is hardly a radical guy or you know family run restaurant ah worked I worked for Joe Lieberman when he ran for president um\nAnd uh this race though is one where the seat can go either way and uh both parties believe they have a shot\nThere's also a gubernatorial race underway here the Republican government Governor Crist new new\nFaces Democrat Molly Kelly she is one of the Fifteen women running for governor across the country which is an unprecedented number\nThe latest fundraising numbers that came out this week showed that tally the Democrat has raised some new new the incumbent Republican three to one uh ... brand of New York came to conquered on yesterday to help campaign for Kelly\nThey met with employees of the Granite State candy shop and they discussed paid family leave I'm interested in where this issue sits in terms of all the issues New Hampshire voters are considering but but here as part of what happened was here ... listen\nIt's going to help families the happier and healthier it's going to help people to be more productive at work and so\nIt's a win win everywhere I go in that state I hear about the need for paid family medical leave and how important it is for people to be able to have the choices in their life to be able to work\nHard where they're working but then to be able to spend time with the people they love the most when they're needed them out\nThat was Molly Kelly you heard at the end senator Gillibrand was ...\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station I have a free press\n... is this paid family leave issue a big one for her based on her political background her personal background will\nIt's been a huge issue for her whether it is for voters is an interesting test when she's been running pretty much exclusively on this issue [noise] um it's a challenge of somebody covering their first how many stories one can write about paid family leave my understanding as Democrats\nHave polling suggests that Governor Sununu is vulnerable on this issue he was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it\nAt the last minute or for fear that a payroll deduction imagine to an income tax which you know it was a real kind of fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax\n'em in the Democrats believe this is an issue that works for Mali Kelly by dint of her background at one point she was a single mother with three kids who work your way through college and that you know pursue new new son of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh\nYou know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get at New Hampshire has kind of a bifurcated economy uh\nUh you know boom times for people to the upper income we have budget surpluses and tax collections are up but you know their wage growth for people at the lower end of the scale\nHas not been great and\nThis is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it kind of hits a lot of boxes and may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race well I'm ... you know Sunni should win you know we have to your terms here no governor's been promised after one term\nUh since two thousand four and prior to that it had been a century so it's pretty rare that a governor doesn't get a second term apps and being a disaster or a really tanking economy we don't have either of those uh here polling indicates a new news about by about ten and you know you mentioned the fundraising numbers and\nMolly has outrageous Christian in three to one in the most recent reporting period he does enter the final stretch of this race with a cash advantage although for an incumbent\nWith a nationally known name he's a pretty bad fundraiser he healed freely many doesn't like to do it so\nYou know he's only got he's got four hundred thousand she's got two hundred thousand interest groups will will add to that in terms of advertising but\nThis is a race Democrats feel they have a chance to win if if a blue wave a venture weights and they think that ... uh buy dinner background but it'd be a woman is somebody who perhaps his best engineered to kind of ride away speaking\nOf nationally known names Frank or don't you know so I Wonder what your senses of senator Jill a brand making this trip to help Mali Kelly is their speculation about her future maybe in twenty twenty\nThere's a lot of speculation about her future and twenty twenty um I think how much is it kinda resonate as as the big question I mean obviously\nThere's so many names being kicked around ah right now or that you know it I think time will tell but there there is no question that killed rented one of the people that that people are talking about and certainly are watching very closely in every move\nOr that she makes 'em as being picked apart um you know analyze a and looking for it how it could mean and how it could uh what impact that could have on twenty twenty\n... discuss with business and the economy

A. M. U. dot org\nThis week some Americans were probably green with envy at our neighbors to the north\nRight out guy now\nAnd I got out\nThey were celebrating in Montreal this week because on Wednesday Canada legalize recreational marijuana\nNationwide it's only the second country in the world to do so why was the first in twenty Thirteen Andrew tweeted Canada legalizing we'd was like California legalizing we'd both for like a long relationship where you've been dating forever but just now made official\nHays how big a deal is this and do you think this is the start of a Global Trends something that has just kind of been understood for a long time and just hasn't been made official yet\n[noise] you know that's a great question because I'm not really sure I mean I think that\nWhen you look at the way that the criminalizing drugs has gone in places like Portugal\nThere at ... or do you compare that to things like the un officer drugs and crime still is very hard on marijuana and claims that it you know marijuana is this evil so it's really tough to tell where the global feeling is on we legalization\nIf um you were to bring it up say at a meeting in the European Union's\nOf European Parliament then I'm guessing you still would not have been nearly a majority of people in favor it even in a place like the USO Canada I don't know it really depends on how it goes in terms of the government controlling the access to marijuana which it it is doing now compared to you know it being a private business\nUh that private but illegal business among many small dealers or it depends on how it affects the global drug trade and whether\nUh there's going to be any sort of shift and you know I'm sure that cat is going to be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether caused the surge and traffic accidents where the cost of search tops realization or medical affects so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada\nThe CBC out of Ottawa has a story about how police there are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers aren't driving stone it is of course worth noting\nThat in this country marijuana is considered the most illegal level of illegal drugs they schedule one narcotic it's right up there\nWith heroin LSD ecstasy ... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have no currently accepted medical use and the high potential for abuse\nThere was a conference call this week with Todd\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nQuestion from a reporter is\nIt possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint has smoked in the past\nYes and mission of illegal drug use our our ground be found in the midst of all into the United states so yes that's possible\nThat's taught all of US Customs and border patrol Indira give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing this NAFTA to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was is updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of and then sort of pulled the TPP things packed the mind to NAFTA and set it snapped a to point out but it hasn't been easy there have been so many strains between the United states and Canada\nAnd you know this people are saying that essentially this is a potential marijuana mass right now I'm so I think this could be an issue because we certainly do not have legalized marijuana across the United states it's only on a state by state basis\nI Wonder also James what other kind of unintended consequences there might be for this I mean\nJustin Trudeau now has to kind of owned is whether it's seen as a good move\nOr a negative moved there remains the question as to what legalization of the national level mind me for Canada on top of that there are early reports that suggested supplies are running low because candidates takes time to cultivate to the point of being syllable and there were long lines around the block and things are running out supplies running out\nI Wonder what kinds of additional unintended consequences we might keep an eye out for\nWell you know the Canadian Medical Association journal called this a an uncontrolled experiment so we're going to we're going to find out a lot of things about this but I must admit that I'm not\nThat surprised when you can walk into the major states the United states like Colorado or California and there's dispensaries for recreational marijuana everywhere I I think this is a trend that's happening\nAll over the United states and it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna keep going because people are going to realize that there's a lot of money to be made when you tax marijuana\nA and they used as happened in any way and putting these people in jail is probably not the best use of public funds so I I see it as part of a continuum I think it was kind of inevitable that are progressive neighbors to the north we're probably going to get a jump on this on this\nBut um you know I I just been struck by going around the country and see in states where this is already happening and everyone kind of shrugs it's not a big deal\nYou know this doesn't seem James to have the kind of energy I mean it's not like the fight above against prohibition you know where it was considered this major like\n... issue about liberty and of course it helped spur of the rise of organized crime if you've never seen the Ken burns documentary what are you waiting for go see it this feels very much like something that was just kind of a matter of time like if they legalize it was going to happen sooner or later\nThat's my sense to you know that this is the trend is pretty clear in this country and and Canada Cain has had medical marijuana since two thousand and one it's very popular so too does not out on a whim 'em by endorsing the so I I think it's a it's kind of inevitable\nYeah not one of the loudest most aggressive social movements with regards to the legalization of cannabis a much more impactful movement that has reverberated around the world is the me too movement and we should talk about that before our time is up this week MJ Akbar who's the minister of state for external affairs in India\nLeft that post after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual assault and harassed\nFried ... read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nMeant by that but any woman trying to enter the ... temple in ... state in India groups of conservative Hindu men threw stones and attacked women and journalist who tried to get too close let's start with the story involving energy Akbar have how have we seen the me too movement play out\nIn India or is this just kind of the beginning of its effect on men in power\nI think so it's it's interesting because the me too movement really kicked off here in the United states a year ago and for a while uh I Know that our reporters at least we're watching Indian waiting and wondering when is it going to affect this culture where\nUh we were so sure that it would finally have an impact and now a in recent weeks it has finally like grabbed the country and shaking at\nA we've seen as all started with one actress a one Bollywood actress coming forward and just it's been a tidal wave of accusations sense than women taking to Twitter and being unafraid to name their alleged abuse abusers and altered by name\nAnd just being really willing to step out and do what the Indian courts haven't done before which is try to bring these men into account and um it's\nReally interesting that ... one of the first to go considering um he had such a long run in the Indian journalism scene and\nUh the most of the women who came forward about him were fellow journalists were fellow reporters so I feel like that is a bit of credence to these allegations and we'll see whether in the future they uh the the women who are I guess lower down on in social status will finally start to be believed as well\nWith regards to the protest of the ... temple and Carol estate the BBC's James Gleason was they're asking people why they were protesting here's what one man said", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "19"}
