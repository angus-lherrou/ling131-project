violence and whether or not President Trump bears any responsibility at all for these acts\nWe're discussing with Jennifer ... an American political rhetoric expert from Texas a and M. university highly by wreck of the Southern Poverty Law Center and Nick Gillespie of reason magazine Ronald writes our Facebook page one hate speech is allowed a platform under the guise of free speech hate will proliferate and violence will follow\nJust wanted to read this comment by way of bringing up we've mentioned this on the program before but just to be clear\nHate speech is protected under the first amendment you're allowed to speak hateful things in public the line is when it fails what the Supreme Court calls the clear and present danger test when it's considered to be intended to cause imminent violence\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... say Pittsburgh's NPR News they found a free friend\nRonald but just to be clear under the law hate speech is free speech speech that is designed to end likely the cause of violence that has not protected under the first amendment\nNick two of our commenters mentioned the same example which also has come up in free speech Supreme Court cases Robert writes research supports that hateful vitriolic speech drives hateful behavior the logic is blatantly obvious why is it illegal to yell fire in a crowded theater\nAnd ... if we can't yell fire in a crowded theatre watching the president yelled at immigrants lead to rapists in a crowded country Nick ah you know\nBecause that's the law and um you know it is amazing ah what we need a you know and and you know I I think part of part of what we're struggling with\nUm is Trump is a master of using the media to to make everything about himself and then everything becomes a referendum about him I mean literally since before he took office\nEvery news cycle every day I mean even you know the the day or ... ... less than forty eight hours after the synagogue shooting he talked about the media is the true enemy of the people and he's shifted the focus away from the synagogue shooting and the specifics of that back to his ongoing a critique of the\nPress for I think that's kind of pointing these comments I mean if you yell fire in a theater that is not in fact on fire then you can cause a stampede people hurt just based on saying one word fire that one word and cause trouble so my calling someone your enemy\nYou don't lean back when you feel an enemy is approaching you that's what this is on one side action but this\nIs also where you know and I mean it's I you know I'm a parent myself and it's kind of bizarre conversation to be having with the you know it was Seventy something year old man who's the president of the United states but it's like\nIf we continue to take the bait and by that I mean you know ... we're all part of the media now in in various ways whether or not we actually you know have a a company that publishes a newspaper or something like that\nWe need to we need to be engaging this in a different way and it and I'm not saying that we we ignore it and things like that but\nYou know talking about the caravan is like is fascinating um you know what reason we've published stories recently both looking at what is the makeup of the actual people in the caravan which is not you know a bunch of unknown middle Easterners as\nDonald Trump has tweeted and it's not ISIS agents and it's not even you know very many men\nAre looking at the demographics of the caravan looking at the countries that are emigrating from which the United states has a long history of of ah you know really bad foreign policy would make that kind of\nFelt like that kind of feels like when someone yell fire in a crowded theater you ask well where in the theater is and is there a fire curtain right ... ... that it doesn't work that way that visceral reaction takes over and may well have taken over for this guy who shot up the synagogue in Pittsburgh it sounds like you're trying to have an apples and oranges\nAbout what is what I'm saying is you you are not you are not going to win an argument with Donald Trump by\nYou know being visceral and reactive to it like you you ... what we need to do I think and this is part of the polarization that\nPolitics even as fewer and fewer people are identifying in political terms you know we're at historically low levels of identification as Republicans and Democrats as liberals and conservatives\nWhat these terms mean is now up for grabs it as it is leaking out of our life but the people who but we are acting as if it's the only thing that matters um and I think this was when I say we\nFree to explore read it for the the\nNinety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station\nThe sound of a free press\nPolitics particularly electoral or partisan politics because politics is a zero sum game essentially him somebody wins and somebody loses and the winner gets to put their thumb in the eye of the people who lose this was a bad way to organize our everyday life there are parts were politics are absolutely important and and needs to be dealt with\nBut Trump Trump is winning partly because he is able to keep us focus on this very narrow slice of our lives\nAnd he is dictating the discussion I'm Sorry that I don't think you're hitting this nail in the head for me I'm Talking about the visceral ... and ... how do you make highly am I going about this really I'm trying to explain this clearly but maybe I'm kind of facing in the wrong direction how do you see this\nWell I I like next call calls for a con discussion about this\nBut I don't feel like that's the way that we can respond to what you know Trump is doing in other words he's sort of been diverted the attempted civility that I Would argue prior presidents\nHave tried to maintain out of the tone of the White House and I think he thrives on\nThe chaos that is involved with kind of hate rhetoric and raising the emotions people basically stoking fear um which is what we're seeing what the caravan and\nAnd I don't know how you bring that down a notch by calling for civility 'cause it just doesn't seem to be to be working as much as I Would love to have that happen and and I think ... that\nI'm not talking about civility what I'm Talking about is you know on on some level we need to ignore the president there have been a couple of calls for saying you know every time Trump tweets it's not news and every time you said something stupid and in fact free or device of a device of\nIt isn't news and we're acting as if you know he is every ... every breath but he takes us somehow meaningful um and and again you know I I agree that\nUm I I it's not that I Want to read nor him but it's like if we could talk about policy if we could talk about actual things that are going on rather than every time Donald Trump you attack suppressor says something about the NFL or its cetera like we we are we're playing into his fantasy I think a lot making him the center of\nThe world I'll grant you that there is certainly a desire among many folks to talk more about policy than the hardcore politicking will\nGive some thought to maybe where this kind of conversation needs to go in the future when we continue with Nick Gillespie Heidi pirates and Jennifer ... Heidi I Wonder if you could respond to one of the concerns that I think are a number of people on the political right have raised which is\nThis idea that the rhetoric is too hot all the way around that the political discourse\nHas heated up in both directions many on the right has pointed to the left\nSaying that they use similar rhetoric to the rhetoric that President Trump has been using but they don't get cold out for it quite as much here is a sample of some of what they're referring to\nIs time for us as Democrats\nDedicated as they are being committed as\nMichele always says you know when they go low we all know\nThey go low we\nThat you cannot be several with a political party that wants to destroy\nWhat you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth\nNinety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nThe only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and respect its strength\nCouncil where the news comes together we came mornings at night on Ninety point five to ... we asked that\nPuerto Rico declared the sneak a crisis was over but it turns out they just stopped looking for it if you don't have to think how you got to know how many people have been impact back on the next reveal [noise]\nTonight at nine and Ninety point five W E s say\nW E s a is supported by community college of Allegheny county presenting mission critical filling tomorrow's jobs on November Fifteen part of the Robert M mill lecture series this discussion focuses on the efforts of business and labor to address the region's anticipated worker shortage details at C.

hear you on that it's an interesting analogy between horror and comedy I'm not big on Gore I Do not personally do well around blood and Gore at all but a good suspenseful movie like I can I can hang

these are secrets that only the Brotherhood knows I Can't\nTell how come on you can tell me something\nWell look to make it really simple uh there are no rules for any horror film\nThe horror horror

a\nSet up your scares set up things they're\nFrightening for the audience he said the word earlier suspense that's what's you if you get the audience in suspense and you can scare them\nSo maybe the key is having a story it's got enough of the right elements to make me feel that suspense so that they're there can be that pay off so that there can be the scare is that it\nThat is correct you got

the theme to the original Halloween is not in a plain old for for your time it's in five four time it's an odd kind of time's signature was what drew you to that\nMy father taught me five four time uh
