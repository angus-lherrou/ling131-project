for a\nAnd R I for a long time um had a suit filed within twenty four hours of that measure passing\nI think that it will certainly withstand judicial scrutiny from our interview 'em and be upheld and I think it's a natural reaction to that a mass shooting involving you know that are often\nUm with schools individuals who are within that timeframe of Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will note that Florida passed a package of laws at the minimum age being one all of which were\nA really designed to address the that type of issues that we saw a from Parkland at the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in the home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so important so we're seeing these kinds of package bills a reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me is it passed in the state of Florida\nRat has long been one of the strongest a sort of incubator of the enterprise legislative agenda and I think is very telling on obviously the reactions of Parkland and that that activism\nThat took place immediately following a the Parkland shooting\nI Would like to come back to safe storage and the moment but the

let me get to some of your stories and comments one member of the one a text club who calls herself simply scared wrote\nI'm twenty eight and afraid of the dark it's a challenge to have sex with the man I Love without seeing terrible scenes in my head\nAnother listener emailed I couldn't listen to Dr Ford's testimony I was raped when I was Fifteen and never shared at\nThe thought of listening to the testimony was too difficult for me to handle I Am proud of the women who are speaking out but there are others all around us were silently coping by the way we should note as we did at the top of the program a lot of what we are going to be discussing today\nHas to do with pretty Frank descriptions of sexual assault and harassment so if you'd like to listen to this program later on when you are more emotionally prepared for it away from the kids out of time maybe when you're ready to discuss it as a family you'll find the whole conversation on line at the one a dot org that's the words up the number one letter a dot org [noise]\nWhat's that another voice to the discussion joining us from NPR in New York is Marvin Gaye a member of the New York times editorial board more welcome to the program\nThanks for having me now on Saturday you wrote in the times an account of your salt and it's emotional aftermath in part you wrote quote I never felt compelled to share my story before because it is so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nOn unremarkable what made you think of what you had been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\n[noise] you know for years and my friends and I have been\nAnd colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of ours sexual assaults of our sexual harassment\nAnd just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring doctor for its testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain and they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to to stay silent Ken my own experience\nCan you share with others to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so and it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think and we both had and an interesting one other and\nWe drink a lot and if you had Twenty years old at the time on and he drank more than I did a one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was a\nRougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet the Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nDrink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place and and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was a\nRougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to\n'em and it was very painful and I I'm asked him to stop and eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think ... frankly it was probably too drunk to kind of know what was going on is what what I thought the time\nAnd you know afterwards I dated him and I think now I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nNo last week professor Conan the Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor Ford what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor Ford said\nIndelible and they hit the campus is the laughter fill up the uproar is laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun at my expense\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective why is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories perhaps by way of explaining what the hippocampus foods and what it does\n[noise] um they hit the campus is a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise]\nDoctor for it in her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has specific parts that are involved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm\nI'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away you when people who can encode that ... that fear about lying and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on\nThe brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the Muzak or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that even just hearing her talk about it really makes my heart caught you know it's really emotional\nUm but forget other details like uh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street\nThose aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is a brain operates\nA ton of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way he described it it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie or you know you walking through on and how you forget all the decor but that's being that leaked out at you the kind of forced your adrenalin to rise dots wouldn't codes that that's a great\nExample yes\nWhich um those aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is their brain operate\nIt kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way he described it it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie or you know you walking through haunted house you'll forget all that the corps but that's the thing that leaked out at you that kind of forced your adrenalin to rise that wouldn't codes that as a great example yes\nNo more you said that a moment when she's mia Loren I beg your pardon Lawrence Taylor these moments in code so intensely are there are ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or did you just kind of have to deal with those things kind of trigger those images\nThat are super vivid how do you work through the ups or ten\nThere are many many ways to work through those I'm\nTalking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or us a community support group or an ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful um what we do in our empowerment self defense

that came into us\nMy name is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year that I was able to acknowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from that\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years it has really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why it doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped\nWe feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves\nLet alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rape that left obvious mar it's easy to pretend it never happened and\nEmotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared and so hurt and so it shaped\nLoops thanks very much for sharing your story with us more geared love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment the comes\nAfter that incident like that after an attack like that wow and it's powerful um\nYou know [laughter] so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my assault or it was one of the things of many that that I dealt with but I have been so struck by by the number as friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nAnd you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and and I really am also a huge fan of brain brown and social research or any shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame needs secrecy to survive\nOn and off huge part of the reason I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore at that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame and so in telling my story you know I I was I feel a huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that\nI'm into the public arena where I Believe that belongs and and no longer hold onto that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of had

around\nAnd that ah I guess for me that's where who I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experience as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really watching\nYou know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of the embodiment of that injustice and\nThat's that's where I think you know the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from\nLawrence I just wanted to um that speak to what this\nWhat lives shared about her experience there are very\nHonorable powerful reasons not to tell I Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone who feels unable to tell or who makes the choice not to tell\n'em that it can be internal reasons like lives shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job um but they are all very real\nAt at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nWe have more control over our own experiences and how we shape at them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\nSarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college where sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and she gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend\nOn top of me still

U. dot org let me start\nWith the book this alliance between astrophysics and the military and give us a sense of what that is\nIn a nutshell and why it is as the title of your book suggests so unspoken\nYeah so so we already are familiar with the role that other scientists have played in warfare especially engineering you know somebody had to invent the catapult when that was first showed up on the battlefield what an asymmetric weapon that would have been a symmetric in the military sense where\nYour opponent has something that you don't have and you're in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call that an asymmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you look at the new book of of Leonardo da Vinci where yeah he did art but he also was a mastermind that sort of military machines that could lay waste to your army\nSo and we know him as one of the greatest combinations of its scientist engineer and an artist but moving forward you think of the physicist as a person who builds the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know the camera is you know would make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas\nAt the biologist my weaponize anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association because we just humbly sit at mountaintops and wait for photons to arrive from across the galaxy and then we carefully takes a detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw\nSo that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics in the military it just never shows up but in fact\nAstrophysicist and then the earlier days or ... have been fundamental to the growth of empires and the Gemini of nations in particular the the need to navigate with precision\nAround the world ... my my professional ancestors no new the night sky\nAnd to to know the night sky and on any level is to give you better advantage for navigating earth's surface\nBecause the sky what's different depending on where you are on earth and things rise of different times and said that in different places and so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established and there's\nRead it for free to explore we're Nineteen twenty five ... thanks Pittsburgh NPR News they found a free from\nBetter advantage for navigating earth's surface\nBecause the sky what's different depending on where you are on earth and things rise of different times and sat in different places\nAnd so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established and there's no end of examples where this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who have control over\nI should know we didn't have the conversation on this program for those who are more interested in this connection between science and the military\nAbout the origins of chemical weapons during World War one and a good bit of that heritage traces right back here to American University which is the institution that owns WAMC which produces one egg you can find that conversation on line at the one eight dot org\nNew President Trump announced the creation of a space for us this summer a six to branch of the military to focus on the militarization of space I guess it will be a fifth plant since the coast guard is technically part of the chess which is also the topic of your book\nGive us a sense of its ... within there is a topic of the book give us a sense of what this space force would need to do have accomplish avoid to be in the best interest of the American people and humanity\nSo first of all just to to the space forces not a new concept and ah it it surely been around even before I remembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission I served on a\nAuthorized by the White House to study the future of the U. S. aerospace industry which at the time\nOr had fallen they've fallen on hard times I lost a half a million jobs there's consolidation in the industry there's competition from Europe with Airbus and other places that were rising up like in Brazil has embraced Air Canada was making a regional jets\nSo there was a concern that well what happens if we lose this industry\nTo what impact would that have on our security on our transportation on our commerce\nYou order something from Amazon it's on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it they're right or at least to the nearest airport [laughter]\n... doorstep delivery by a airborne craft is still to come but we would call them drones I guess but so so you you ... when you\nLook at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well might we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns of space because these are the same companies\nAerospace companies that that became a word right and if you separated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nAt the time on this commission there was a four star air force general\nAnd the air force then and now controls space activities of the military is called a U.S air force space command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space where it's separate from what's already happening so I was I get a second guess the general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had\nFast forward to today on the Trump announcement as well as the pants follow on announcement\nAbout it if you just listened to it it sounded very very sort of macho look how big my biceps is as I speak that was very we don't want to just be there we want to we don't want to just leave we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that spooked many people\nFreed with law three different Ninety five doubling yet day for NPR News station worm free problem\nNow Smith as well as the pants follow on announcement\nIt if you just listen to it it sounded very very sort of macho look how big my biceps is as I speak\nThat was very we don't want to just be there we want to we don't want to just leave we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that spooked many people typically sort of ... out there who say oh my gosh what will this mean\nDo you think of that ad thing though I mean if the U.S has you know supremacy had Gemini over space our aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than seeing the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nYeah sure I'm just saying one could have said exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear the future of what could happen if you quote militarized space as I was really represent rhetoric not reality reality is\nA space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force\nAnd slide them out under one umbrella when sort of coherent umbrella and if you're going to do that\nUh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it\nThat could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroids strikes and then the limit it could render us all extinct\nI'm Jeremy hops in the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada a trade war with China Sky high stock market and fears that a recession could be right around the corner will take it all up with Larry Summers former economic advisor to President Clinton and Obama the next time around here and\nDidn't afternoon at one on Ninety point five W E s say\nIt's just food it's just\nAll of that matters but none of it matters\nStill working is Ninety point five ... series on work during the mom a job in western Pennsylvania told by the people who get up and live it every day is it W.

I just if you had goals if you can't otherwise I I bet we'll find tears for both of those before we learn how to transplant of brain but I think about that all the time\nCertainly helps them certainly hope so and wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is this there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you go to the ocean and you stick a class in any scoop out some water and the ... of water really carefully and say\nThey're no whales in the ocean [laughter]\nNo you haven't looked so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy and our search for life\nAre intelligent life uh for example um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or or Mars and perhaps other places but anyone who study the problem is in no\nWay doubts the strong likelihood that there's life elsewhere in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\nAmy asked on our Facebook page will the human race ceased to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends not considering a possible impact from an asteroid or other cosmic influence\n[noise] we're pretty sure that nothing extinction level is headed our way that would take us out in the next thousand years and we know that because the more dangerous than asteroid is the bigger it is typically and the bigger it is the easier it is to detect\nSo so uh I I think we're good about that it's possible that a comic could come\nFrom out of nowhere ... comments very long period comments\nThey sort of show up you know you don't have history for them and one could come in and take us out or it would be really bad luck to you if that were the case but it I regardless you want a healthy space program that can deflect these things and so I'm all for\nBuilding protecting having insurance plan\nThat you put a little bit of money in for a to protect you against a devastating saying that it would be very rare so but uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds of our power\nAnd over nature and heed the warnings are scientists\nI Wonder how what what the over under is on that I tend to be\nFairly hopeful younger people seem to have a very different grasp of the value of the earth that this is the one home we have than many of their parents and and forebears and I kind of you know today's generation gives me hope for dealing with some of the problems are climate faces but what about you\nYeah I'm hopeful I'm realistically hopeful so but I'm I'm ...
