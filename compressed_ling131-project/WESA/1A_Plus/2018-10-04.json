gotten angry and made their mark their anger is not always shown in the same form as somebody yelling in the face of a senator like Jeff Flake on live TV but anger nonetheless and Brittany Cooper you've written a book\nAbout finding your power in rage uh tell me a little bit about that theme in how the story fits into the moment [noise]\nA shore so part of what happens is that women are told 'em as many of your listeners say that to be angry it to be irrational\nAnd I had a student when I was a graduate instructor confront me um and said to me that she loved to listen to me lecture because my lectures were filled with what she called the most eloquent rage ever and it was a wakeup call for me as someone who had run away from the angry black woman stereotype my whole life\nBecause I didn't want to be discredited as a black woman moving through predominantly white institutions\nAnd so my student who was a young black woman thought and be a kind of authenticity and she helped me to realize\nThat my anger wasn't keeping me from doing my job are showing up are offering\nQuality lectures are material or material but that it was actually helping me to do a better job and so in that moment I made a connection that I've been encouraging other women to make which is ... knowledge that we have the right to outrage and so reject ideas that say that when we're angry about legitimate injustices\nThat this in some way make this irrational or make far claim illegitimate and when we then begin to own that anger doesn't mean that we would come destructive or harmful it mean that we happen to the energy and power and we start to use that energy and power to build the kind of world we want to see\nAnd more women need to give themselves permission to do that I've given myself permission to do that I'm at in this moment I Am on the front lines of saying to women outrage\nHave the potential if we own it and if we don't apologize for\nUs to change this very scary a trajectory of this historical moment we have a lot to be afraid about\nWe have a lot to be angry about opposite that anger is the catalyst for being able to do something about the things we see\nNow

Shawnee you shared this moment along with the rest of America us arena is a champion and one of the most famous black women in America somebody who got angry and somebody found who found that anger a weaponized against her\n[noise] Ah yes I ... I think that what we saw in their response was everything that Brittany and Rebecca and I have been talking about it was interesting because\nThere are so many egregious examples of men behaving in the same way but not facing the same policing or penalties mean she she was a defined that was levied against her is the highest ever for verbal abuse in the history of the u._s. open I Believe\nAnd so in that moment there were two very distinct sponsors of the responses of the people that really just wanted to see her in isolation acting um\nIt and this exchange with this man but then there were people who really looked at that exchange within the much broader context of the power dynamics in the moment on the history in the context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that she has faced\nAnd so I think that one thing that has been unexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as\nLeaders or as people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict um what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment not be accused the way that she was accused\nAnd with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models who have benefited from title nine and the lessons of title nine we ... we tend to think of it as a athletics but it is really about leadership and\nThe ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the nuance distinctions between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry I think we're seeing the ... of of that now in our political live\nThere were some pushback though to Serena Williams behavior on the court and the reaction to it even from within the tennis world a Brittany Cooper I don't know if you saw a Martina Navratilova his response to this arena Williams episode a couple of days later but she wrote an op ed after the U.S open and she said Martina speaking now\nSaid well yes women are treated differently yes there are double standards\nBut Serino was wrong her encore behavior was inappropriate and I'm paraphrasing just because men region empires and act like babies on the court doesn't make it right in a champion Serena should not emulated\nRight I'm Martina Navratilova was wrong or she did this thing that women are conditioned to do which is rather than use it as a moment of solidarity she tried police arena conduct\nA as a lifelong tennis fan I Am living ...

careful in her choice of words there to even as she was\nCommenting on it I mean I think it was um\nIt was ridiculous that this woman was called an authentic while being held to the standard\nOf care full control in her voice and her facial of parents and her body and her motive expression I mean\nThe two candidates um that were her primary\nOpponents but Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they could pound ... you know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger\nAnd that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card right there were all of these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign\nRecord ... is so right about that and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political press for their particular skill in channeling the anger of their supporters this with their gift\nThey were able to give voice to this frustration and we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion and yet\nEvery time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directed at one point Joe Scarborough she was

A. M. U. dot org we heard from Susan who sent us an email I Believe that our political risk started well before the Nineteen nineties the Vietnam Conflict was one of the most divisive issues\nSince the civil war and we still had never recovered\nAnd not witty tweets us on Twitter I was in high school when Gingrich and company produced their contract with America I remember peers who had been pleasant with each other suddenly became antagonistic suddenly politics became a team sport that experience is one of the reasons why I today\nAnd nonpartisan up Steve you're nodding and I think that type of reaction to sorting\nMight sound familiar to you I Want to go back to the history and just a moment but before we do I want to get to a moment in tribalism in politics where we are right now I Want to talk about Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham back during impeachment was a member of the house he was an impeachment manager\nHe helped impeach Bill Clinton and then went before the Senate to make the case as a prosecutor\nThat Bill Clinton should be removed from office because of the Monica Lewinsky\nExperience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended cabin on he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody thought I'm a single white male people want me to shut up and I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve hears\nLindsey Graham at a roast dinner and twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nHere forty six years or even the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party here the speaker of the house the Republican controlled house you're smart you know the budget that we're in for you have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon\nYou are dead men walking as far as [noise]\nNow back in twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quit to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough\nTo survive as a Republican Party of the future meeting Republicans had to broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics flash forward to that\nYou have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon\nYou are dead men walking as far as [noise]\nNow back in twenty twelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quit to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough to survive as a Republican Party of the future meaning Republicans at your broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics\nFlash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week I'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it any more stunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham ... and in the Trump beer at Haiti you about where we were in in in where we are yeah I mean I think\nTells me that the divide is deepening any idea tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to that you saw in the two thousand election and I say that we've lived with a sense\nThey're only going deeper and and the moment you talked about there and twenty twelve after the twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of establishment nationally look to the Mitt Romney's last a brac Obama included what you know what Lindsey Graham did it demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it it's not just that he won the general election elect a huge part of it but the fact that he was able\nTo sweep through the Republican Party like other primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen told Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixteen one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand granted than granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator for one more term or is he if he converted what's he think\nI mean look there's there there's all sorts of theories about this I don't know to give you a couple of them that that that that jump out at me what is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise and his enduring popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons\nTo Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk\nIf you are seen as separating yourself from this present your next primary especially if you're a Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being a being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that\nThere's also the theory that hey part of this is\nLindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you're if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises uh if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're a golf with him maybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons is to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump and twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think ... Lindsey Graham and just brought more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically Kennett last is the question\nInfluence in but I think one of the other lessons to is it is again Lindsey Graham looking at Trump twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one I think tells Lindsey Graham and just brought more broadly tells Republicans that this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically\nKennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacturing and fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if when he closed his eyes at night whether he's\nChanged his mind about that or not James sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised\nAt how often several of my neighbors expressed their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation\nOn the merits and in Steve you're nodding because that does not sound surprising\nTo you yeah well what he's describing his ticket splitting yet to be and political science they did the voters who go and they were Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and that that is just the rise of polarization the tribal isn't All right let's get back in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve ... so much of what your book is about\nUh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are on led to believe did not\nWhy there had never really been contingency plans made for this kind of a disaster free to challenge to explore is a lot of discussion in some of these Central American countries about ways you can get through to Ninety point five W\nE S say is Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nStart your day within box addiction stories about Pittsburgh St for our daily newsletter at W.

Capitol Hill today I have a quick update for you\nThe top Republican on the Senate Judiciary committee says the FBI has turned up nothing to corroborate allegations that Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was involved in sexual assault in high school and another instance of sexual misconduct in college there is nothing in it that we didn't already know said Senator Chuck Grassley adding\nThere's also no contemporaneous evidence this investigation found no hint of misconduct and the same is true of the six prior FBI background investigations conducted during judge Kavanaugh's twenty five years of public service that was Chuck Grassley chairman of the Judiciary Committee I was quoting their\nRanking member on the Senate Judiciary committee Democrat Dianne Feinstein of California disagrees she says it looks to be the product of an incomplete investigation\nThat was limited perhaps by the White House Dianne Feinstein ranking member expect much more on this throughout the day on your NPR station\nI Want to turn back to Steve ... in just a moment but before we do a quick appeal for some help with the program in the works for next week here on one day we spend a lot of time yesterday talking with women about how society views angry women and there's a broad range of opinion but most of the women were hearing from our progressive and liberals\nIf you're a conservative woman tell us how your seeing this moment what have you got to say how do you want to be heard in the fight\nOver Brett Kavanaugh and in the fight over me to the discussions over me to in

two will make sure to get your stories on the air part of the national conversation in the days ahead you're on one a\nWhile we're talking for the most part about what politician said and did in the Nineteen Ninety so how do they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington that's polarized we've been asking listeners for memorable moments from politics in the nineties and and here's one\nAnd the president is right\nIn many ways we are a shining city on a hill\nTruth is that not everyone is Sherry and the city's splendor and glory\nThere is this fair Mr President\nAnd the faces that you don't see\nIn places that you don't visit\nAnd you're a shining city\nAnd believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from oh gosh the early nineties I take you back towards any overhaul [noise]\n\nTo be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety to ... or send me also remember him will will with us any off before that year\nPresidential candidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with me\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nSoon\nTo be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety two on the Arsenio Hall show remember him for first before that year presidential\nCandidates didn't really appear on night time talk shows at all so that was something new talk about how politicians grappled with media coverage during those years Steve that was a moment not just because the president appeared on our city hall but he seemed to offer an alternative\nTo gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark\nVery serious and and a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nIt was also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second but in third place in the presidential race at that point versus a Ross Perot place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton in so they were his team he remembered that Bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Jennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of\nSlick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer Li try this scheme is way out of\nA out of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers in the draft and all that so here was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hard at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality\nAnd it was Ninety two it wasn't just starts anew Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot who was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began\nIn February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King Larry King and and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was on and February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent\nIn just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show\n'em in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show that night well\nWe won't be doing anything like that in our city hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that went went after it was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign that Bush wasn't doing our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message\nUm politicians now managed media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course\nSo yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know go adolescent jokes that's not that's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and\nBy the end of the campaign that Bush wasn't do in our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing you know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message\nUm politicians now manage media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama had\nA winning personality an affable nice guy and he used it to great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon just even cold there there isn't a show that ... Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than than maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public has\nChanged just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or sending your home\nAnd I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier\nAnd the rise of Gingrich net moment with Oh Neal what that moment came from was Gingrich looking for a way around what at the time where the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he CSPAN\nGive CSPAN was five years old in the early Nineteen eighties and he used the late night speeches and CSPAN to seek out find and develop a relationship with a new audience draw a line from that and how Gingrich or legal to build his career his rise in the house around that\nFast forward to Donald Trump Donald Trump do\nIt television obviously a part of it but really in the campaign social media Twitter\nDonald Trump identified through Twitter away to go around not just the news media but the entertainment media as well if they're so engaged in politics now into directly get his message across to voters to get around it I see what Gingrich was doing in the eighties was CSPAN and Trump was doing with Twitter and and I think there's a real common thread there well let's go back", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "04"}
