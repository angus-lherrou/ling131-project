history the host and creator of that podcast probably let me come to you wonder what you think of the overall message of Tim Cook speech the c._e._o. of apple we heard him refer\nTo the data industrial complex which has been a phrase it's been quoted fairly often in the days since he spoke kind of\nHarkening back to that idea of the military industrial complex of the prison industrial complex what did you make of of cooks remarks\nThought these were really strong words and coming from a taxi or perhaps the strongest we've seen so far now ... what he didn't stay in that speech was he didn't mention Google he didn't mention Facebook\nAnd that's the house because I I mean while he doesn't want to go that far but but also because apple is a business is quite different from Google and Facebook apple doesn't it's not in the the the ad tracking business the way Facebook and Google both are\nBut I think what all of these companies know collectively is that whether they like it or not regulation of some ... some farm is is on its way it's coming and so at some level of the other they have all endorsed uh GDP are which is Europe's data protection bill\nAnd I think they're beginning to imagine that some version of that will at some stage be implemented in the United states and the only question that is is what kind of language will be in that what it within tail\nAnd and and and I think what cook has tried to do in the speech again very strong words in his visit to Europe is to try and come out ahead\nScreaming on WGN recorded by Carnegie Mellon university

data protection regulation it's there's a new area law that protects\nThe privacy the data privacy of individuals within the EU or even the export of their personal data outside the you if you've noticed re in the last few months that a lot of the Web sites you go to have had these pop up saying hey we use cookies on this website we maybe try your information click here to accept\nThat was those websites complying with GDP are that's why they all had to begin putting those pop ups\nThose sites another story about privacy that caught our attention the British newspaper the telegraph\nPublished an investigation on Tuesday into a wealthy businessman who was accused by multiple employees of racist and sexist mistreatment the story had the headline the British me to scandal which cannot be revealed\nThat's because the accused was granted an injunction against the newspaper to prevent it from publishing his name but then this happened at Britain's house of lords\nOf this month juicy under a parliamentary privileged to named Phillip Green as the individual in question given that the media have been subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of a story which is clearly in the public interest\nThat was the voice of lord pain or Baron the hand of nice in the British house of lords using British parliamentary privilege to name the billionaire at the center of this story\nMichael Goldfarb what's behind this what makes this such a big deal it sounds like it's kind of an example a clear example of the very significant differences between free speech laws in the u._k. and in the U.S\nWell that's certainly part of a judge or in in this particular case I'm having a parliamentary privileges is pretty\nUnique tool you can say things in

this guy a Phillip Green is you know a fairly typical contemporary entrepreneur yet he was a night to bite Tony Blair for services to retail is set up\nA series of of um clothing shops over over the decades and made himself very very wealthy and indeed and um apparently he was just the kind of ball she would expect it was a bully Andy was\nSexually harassed people and\nLike Harvey Weinstein when when he settled up there were no disclosure clauses inserted into the settlements\nAnd the difference of course is that in the U.S New York times and the New Yorker can report that Harvey Weinstein is this and that and you know the details or can't get because of these nondisclosure agreements but at least we know his name and here in Britain it's something else [noise] it\nWas you know and moving oh go ahead Michael go ahead no no because I could go on about this guy forever and I want [laughter]\nWith with pre she had gone\nI was just gonna say it's an interesting case really because of the way that the British laws are structured to fly to have that that this this question which is the greater good here right because this is that the media than it already then a question is can you know
