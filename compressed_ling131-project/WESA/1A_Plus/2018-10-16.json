the hill before we move on from Medicaid read\nI I Do want to get your sense of kind of where this is going only one state Maine has approved Medicaid expansion through the ballot box so voters in Maine voted for expanding Medicaid but the governor of Maine Paula page still refuses to do so\nHe talked about his opposition to expanding Medicaid during the morning talk show on W. veal AM radio back in July here's part of what means governors said\nOne thing I Know there's no way they can force me to put state in red ink and I will not do that so I can tell I mean I go to jail before I put the ... the stage and read it and if that's the core tells me I have to do it then we're going to be going to jail\nAs part of Maine Governor Paula page speaking back in July and I read ... telling voters I'd rather go to jail can kind of feel like he's telling voters to go to somewhere else but how much of his political future I mean how's this going to end\nWell a ... page is a he was sort of Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump he uh ... was the loud and and bombastic candidates in a one two races that uh\nUh he probably shouldn't have won in the political side and that you know main is a pretty liberal state and I came in to shake up the old order and that's what voters elected in foreign\nUh now he is refusing to follow the will of the voters the Medicaid expansion will happen in Maine at some point ... just turned out this here are the Democratic candidate is leading in most of the surveys that are that they're up there um but it it has not happened yet and as a consequence of all the pages actions\nThere are thousands of people in in Maine who not only voted for this thing but voted for this thing and now don't have\nThe health care that they that they need at and this was a ... it's a problem in Maine especially in a community is that have been hard hit by things like climate change the lobster community in the in the northwest part of the state along the northern coast or is it has been pretty devastated and they work for very low wages in pretty dangerous jobs in\nA ... you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion\nLet's shift gears and talk about the cost of prescription drugs an issue I think that everybody sooner or later has to grapple with now dozens of states pass laws this year\nThe aim to get rid of this kind of gag rule it prohibits your pharmacist from discussing prescription drug prices with you we spoke to one democratic state lawmaker about isn't about why he introduced new legislation on prescription drug pricing\nI Am representative Ryan Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island and I'm In my thirtieth year as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection his doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he paid the retail price of the if you pay the retail price the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that there might be another option for you that other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would've been cheaper for me to pay those out of pocket\nRepresentative Kennedy learned that the pharmacy had a contract with a company called a pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that ... that prohibited the pharmacist from discussing this with customers\nKennedy and for the Democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban the so called gag clauses and the bill had not passed\nFried ... read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nKennedy learned that the pharmacy had a contract with a company called a pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that ... that prohibited the pharmacist from discussing this with customers\nKennedy and for the Democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban the so called gag clauses and the bill had not passed\nWe wanted to make sure that Rhode Island does have that opportunity to speak one on one with their with their pharmacists thin and learn what their their pricing options are because of that is consistently one of the big complaints we hear from our\nConstituents on a on a regular basis is how expensive drug costs have become\nSo Scott Greenberg or we heard from representative Kennedy about what's going on in Rhode Island how common are laws like the one that he's pushing ... how many states have passed laws like this\nWill be these gag clauses are are pretty common and uh last year there were a over a dozen states that [noise] excuse me took up legislation or\nHaving to do with these gag clauses um and actually just recently President Trump signed a bill outlawing these um gag clauses this was kind of low hanging fruit though of a\nOf a drug drug price issue a I don't think anyone like these gag clauses but uh\nYeah that that will the let federal legislation and the state bills won't change the fact that many many people struggled to pay for the prescriptions they need and um it's a very complicated issue and there are many states are taking other other steps to try to rein in prices\nSince you mentioned the president's he signed two bills last week as you noted that were designed to lift these gang clauses on prescription drug prices here is part of what the president said\nIt's the no the lowest price active two thousand Eighteen and the patient right to know drug prices act and uh\nObviously based on the name you can tell that this gives people knowledge as to prices at different locations where to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact to uh\nIt's called the law of supply and demand pretty simple but we didn't have that they didn't want to have\nA lot of people didn't want to have that but now we have it and it's going to really drive prices\nScott back up to the bills that various states have signed on this California signed a few bills into law and there's a few weeks ago governor Jerry Brown signed them and these are considered among the strongest of these laws in the country what do they do\nWell I think the what a lot of states are doing in California or as is often the case with this kind of progressive legislation is in is in the lead on this on California is trying to reduce drug prices through transparency in other words they are requiring um uh the drug companies to be public about a\nPrice increases increases beyond a certain point in the idea\nIs that uh if these are made public that they'll sort of be shamed into into reversing some of these increases it's still too early to say though whether this is going to have the desired effect um nevertheless other states this year California passed its bill\nOr in two thousand Seventeen and last year you had five more states um Connecticut Maine New Hampshire Oregon and Vermont all passed a drug pricing laws that are similar\nTo California so we'll see whether transparency is enough to reduce prices and then in addition to that um some states have tried to go even even further than that Massachusetts passed a bill that would've allowed a its Medicaid program\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nOn his ... we'll see whether

A. M. U. dot org Julie let's get to that question from months in law who tweeted isn't part of the reason Medicaid expansion didn't get as good support\nIs that it wasn't available as quote unquote GAP insurance for those whose employer plan has a high deductible well\nOf course the people who have an employer plans for the high deductible or our big problem in the lower income people of those have a particular\nLarge problem if you have many thousands of dollars in deductibles have to pay before your insurance kicks and there are a couple of small demonstration programs where Medicaid has been able to um basically fill in with employer insurance but generally Medicaid has sort of an all or nothing proposition you're either on Medicaid or you're off\nThe way the Affordable CARE Act was created with those people up two hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get 'em Medicaid people between a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty and two hundred and fifty percent of poverty get special discounts and they don't have those big deductibles so it it and then over two hundred and fifty percent of poverty then you're sort of on your own\nI'm In Arkansas I might point out though another we've been talking about a lot of different program that they instituted was to help people who often who were right at that margin we're constantly shifting back and forth between Medicaid and private plant and basically what they would do is the state was allowed to basically buy them into the private plans that they wouldn't have to keep changing\nWhere two weeks sidebar for just a second let me the the point of this series this this is talk about what states we're doing on big issues healthcare is a very big one it's one of the very first things that Donald Trump said he was going to act on when he became president repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act AK Obamacare\nThere are some people who feel like health care should be a national matter that every human being in the United states of America should have equally good planned what's simple set of healthcare costs and there are other Americans who believe it should be left up to the states that every state has different kinds of needs and different issues and there needs to be versatility\nAre we any closer to one side of this argument winning or is the state federal split just kind of baked into the nature of this country like where is this where is this going\nJulie actually it's where it's going is back to where it was before the Affordable CARE Act what we're finding from all these sort of small incremental changes that the Trump Administration has done is that the the Affordable Care act was intended\nTo create more of a national floor if you will for health insurance states still do an enormous amount of regulation of how can they always have the federal government has always been sort of the\nThe junior partner to the states um but it had gotten so such a patchwork that it made huge differences which state you lived in what kind of healthcare you were able to get to the Affordable CARE Act was trying to say\nThere's a floor beneath which people won't fall that is slowly being shipped away and we're going sort of every month looking more and more like we did in two thousand nine before the Affordable CARE Act passed\nScott do you get the sense of this means that the effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is kind of succeeding but it is taking us back to where we were before as\nWell as Julie said it is in some states but in states that want to go in a different direction again the California Massachusetts states like that\nThey're re instituting some of the uh parts of the Affordable CARE Act that the Trump Administration has and the Republican Congress have tried to undercut so for example ah on the individual mandate the requirement that you have insurance um\nSo called association health plans which are these cheaper plans that do not a ... a offer all of the benefits that were mandated under the AC a some states are saying well whatever they are joined the federal level um insurance is regulated or at the state level\nDreaming on WGN imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu slashed I I I\nThe individual mandate the requirement that you have insurance um\nSo called association health plans which are these cheaper plans that do not a ... offer all of the benefits that were mandated under the AC a some states are saying well whatever they are joined the federal level um insurance is regulated or at the state level and if you're going to sell insurance and our state you are going to abide by these rules\nI'll tell you one issue read that states and many people have been hoping the federal government will act on and if they've kind of moved on anyway and\nThat's dealing with medical marijuana it's on the ballot in some states again this year about twenty two states have already legalized pot for medical use some of legalize the recreational use\nVoters in Utah will choose whether to join the states are not the end the political battleground seems to have shifted and I want to read if you see it this way for more traditionally liberal states into more conservative areas overtime\nOr yeah and it's not just the medical or that has gone that way but also legalization of recreational marijuana the two states where legalization is going to be on about this here is in Michigan in North Dakota and ...\n... no for liver legal recreational though you know if her in in on the medical side there are three different amendments in Missouri which is nice and confusing for the voters out there to try to figure out\nWhich is which are and then that Utah is as you say on the ballot Oklahoma already approved it this year so yeah we're we're not talking about the liberal coastal elites that are legalizing marijuana ah we're talking about a red America that is now dealing with this debate or it came up and you know in Florida last year and\nLast year two years ago but this is this is now a debate that I think it shows the shift in the political conversation around marijuana those sorts of people who approve of\nA marijuana legalization tend to be a older white males funny enough and then the millennial generation that the younger the basically the younger you are the more you in favor of\nA legalization you happen to be um the older white males the theory is that's the that's the sort of libertarian streak or they don't want the government regulating something that\nThey don't think the government has a hand in regulating and the real swing voters or perhaps not surprisingly come down to suburban women are in talking to the people who run campaigns for and against marijuana legalization or basically the battleground is a bit of mothers who were worried that their kids are going to be exposed to marijuana\nSo you get the proponents are talking about the law enforcement to ability and ended the fact that are not that this will not expand the market into younger people who will then have access to recreational marijuana and then you've got the opponents who say exactly the opposite that legalization will in fact\nUh begin to rope and a bunch of kids why are there are three items in Missouri\nSo they're all on the ballot from different ah proponents different sides of it with two of them are from a actual citizen groups that that put them on the ... amendment to an amendment three and then there's a proposition which I if perfect from wrong I think the proposition goes on the ballot from the state legislatures that's going to be some kind of\nCompromise or a piece that's proposition see 'em and they are all sort of competing with each other and this underscores another piece of\nThe evolution of of marijuana politics pots big business or in a lot of these states that have legalized Colorado Washington Oregon a California Nevada Alaska or Massachusetts and Maine are the people who are setting up a ... who get to write these laws also essentially

conversation we would love your help with tomorrow's program about being Native American Massachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren recently announced that a DNA test has confirmed what she said all along that she is indeed of tribal heritage\nThe test was the clock back to President Trump who mocked her for claiming that heritage and refer to her as Pocahontas\nCritics including some tribal leaders said direct ancestry matters more than DNA testing in this regard\nIt's just one of many issues that may have Native American voters talking head of the midterms\nIf you are Native American what has claiming your heritage meant\nTo you what tribe or are you part of and how does that factor into your life leave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one a\nNow if you're not Native American then share what your heritage means to you especially if it's something you learned about a little later in life\nWhat did you discover and how did it change you tell us your story eight five five to three six one a one a or you can leave us a radio quality audio files through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Sarah ... and Paul blood so let's get in a few more of your questions and comments before we move on Noel tweeted I teach clients to think of anxiety kinda like sugar a little gives you energy to get going and too much shut you down and drains you need to keep it at that middle area I guess\nLet's get back to Arlene's question on our website and and a poll I Wonder if you could respond to her a lean rights\nSo if you change people's minds what then I see a lot of people who believe in climate change to do nothing to try to mitigate it in their own personal lives\nThere still driving around in gas guzzling SUVs owning their ... mentioned houses with a thermostat turned up not recycling not cutting back on meat and dairy basically waiting for someone else to do something it's like someone else's tomorrow not\nNo doubt personal action is important not least so that you're not hypocritical when you advocate policy and political action but let's be clear that it will take\nLarge policy action to reduce emissions in the United states in globally\nTo make the United states once again a global leader and cutting emissions to solve this problem we have the biggest thing you can do personally\nFor climate change action is to vote out people who won't take it and vote in people who will and I don't mean just Democrat and Republican because within those parties\nThere are a few Republicans who acknowledge like ah the congressman from some South Florida um but there are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the region\nFreed with will read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nCongressmen from some South Florida um but there are many more who deny it on the Democratic side there are some who are not strong enough and do not advocate serious policies\nWe have to recognize this is an imminent threat to people's public safety national security and economic well being as all the recent hurricanes wildfires have shown we need to vote\nI think one of the kind of saving grace of the er at this point in the conversation is that we we do need to deal with those policy issues but\nJust being able to have the conversation in a useful successful way I think that's a form of progress as well you just get people kind of pointed in the direction of being willing to do something so by the by way of kind of wrapping up I Want to go through a few comment objections to the basic argument around climate change and sort of role play how one might respond to those\nFor example be tweeted I often run into these excuses is warming is happening why do we still have winter and we've been told for decades that bad things would have happened ... years ago but they haven't Sarah how would you respond to that\nWell I mean that things are happening right now so [laughter] they have to have it in that um that that those projections are coming true I mean all of the pieces of projections that we have seen around temperature and carbon\nConcentration I mean we are able to do a very good job at projecting a the impacts of climate change on the ground and and that's the state of the science right now it's it's phenomenal\nI guess the issues not just that we're having winter but we're having like day after tomorrow winter like we're having super winner\nRight and and so like [noise] [noise]\nYes and there is cut and so there's complexity and how the regional climate and the seas analogy of different places are influenced by they the the on the Arctic weather system basically a\nCollapsing and how and how that changes North American climate and so we do see these complexities and why\nAnd people get confused right because they're like well wait a second this is a massive storm but this is the fundamental distinction between weather and climate\nClimate ... we can measure climate for the last you know ... million years right and the the the climate for earth planet has been awful lesions between glacial in inter glacial state abrupt warming into enter glacial\nFollowed by slow cooling into glacial date so that pacing of glacial into glacial warming that cold too warm structure that was fundamentally paste by the changing geometric relationship between the earth and the sun Sarah backup\nBordered along on the other changing geometric relationship between glacial into glacial stayed last me it's so cool it's amazing like oh it's confusing like like bring it down to earth from it\nOkay so in the last million years the planet's climate has been moving between glacial states\nWhere there's an ice on top of North American and erosion continent sea level is lower on it's a colder climate on and then in injure glacial state so we are in an inter glacial right now okay and that changed that cold too warm shift\nThis on this piecing this um oscillation its ... it's like a heartbeat of earth's climate and the heartbeat from cold to warm cold too warm that heartbeat with paste by the ... and ... of the geometric in earth orbit and earth tilt as it moves around the sun\nSo I only make sure following you just yeah just heartbeat this earth heartbeat but we hold too warm cold to war it's almost like the earth is having cardiac arrest heartbeat as off and the patterns\nThe reason we decided to connect to be standing members wet because we

you see that it bears some resemblance to the Cold War in what ways\nI think we're in for a generational struggle and that that struggle is going to include not just the use of force but this setting a whose values prevail who's norms prevail about the world that we want to live in\nAnd then you need to execute on those values with your tactics so ... do deterrent bring criminal cases make public behavior that you think is unacceptable like\nThe Russian uh now where not touch a that indiscriminately hit companies around the world like Maersk shipping\nFedEx hospitals and took them off line\nI think we can partner with countries that share our values around the world work together to collectively impose a cost on a rogue actor like Russia when they do that type of activity to say this is unacceptable it's not going to change overnight though just like the Cold War\nIt's going to take years and years and years of day in day out fighting and this war has already begun and part of what I

thousand seven it's a fairly long quote but I Want to read it in its entirety here's part of what Bob Mueller said at the time quote\nThere is an old saying that all roads lead to roam in the days of the Roman empire roads radiate it out from the capital city spending more than fifty two thousand miles\nThe Romans built these roads to access the vast areas they had conquered but in the end the same roads lead to Rome's downfall for they allowed the invaders to march right up to the city's gates he goes on to say quote\nThe Internet has opened up thousands of new roads for each of us new ideas and information new sights and sounds new people and places but the invaders\nThose whose intent is not enlightenment but exploitation and extremism are marching right down those same roads to attack us in multiple ways unquote\nIs this another Roman moment so we kind of becoming a victim of our openness\n...

to go check your Facebook account the most recent hack of the social media giant compromise about thirty million users names phone numbers emails and other personal details\nFacebook says last month attackers found a vulnerability in the code and use Facebook's view as feature to steal access tokens these tokens or bits of code that let you love right in without having type or password Everytime\nIt gave them whoever they are access to nearly everything your user name which devices you access Facebook with\nThe last ten places you checked into or were tagged at\nAnd personal details that you posted like your religion your hometown your birth date where you work yeah a good reason to go check your Facebook account now the company and the FBI or try to catch these hackers and this year Facebook's chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified to Congress that his company needs to race it's game\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company for most of our existence we focused on all the good that connecting people can do and if Facebook is grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the people they love\nFor making their voices heard and for building communities and businesses but it's clear now\nFried ... read it for the the truth\nNinety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station\nThe sound of a free press\nFacebook is an idealistic and optimistic company for most of our existence we focused on all the good the connector and people can do and the streets because grown people everywhere have gotten a powerful neutral for staying connected to the people they love\nFor making their voices heard and for building communities and businesses\nBut it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools are being used for harm as well and that goes for fake news foreign interference in elections and hate speech as well as developers and data privacy\nFacebook talks endlessly about its community and at the fringes there are some in that community who regard the platform as one of the best ways to spread terrorist propaganda over the summer we spoke to Monica bigger she's Facebook's head of global policy management about how the company is taking on terrorists\nThere are two ways that we become aware of content that might violate our policies and keep in mind we have billions of new post every day\nOr so the first thing we become aware is if somebody reports content to as you can report any piece of content through the fight if you do it comes through in its reviewed by Facebook or the second thing is we actually have technology tools that are out looking for content that might pilot our policy so for instance terror propaganda\nNow we remove of the terror propaganda that we've removed from face but more than Ninety nine percent of that our technical tools find before anybody in our community flags it for us\nNow once content has been flagged as potentially violating our policies it comes into one of our content reviewers and there's more than Seventy five hundred people sitting on the content review teams around the world reviewing content in dozens of languages are and making a decision if it violates the policy ... if it doesn't violate the policy to leave it up\nThat's got to be a hard job being a content reviewer at Facebook what kind of person does it take to do that kind of work\nIt really depends on the a specific area that person is working in all content reviewers who come to Facebook are hired with a certain degree of language expertise\nWe have a really global population using this service in fact more than eighty five percent of people using Facebook on a regular basis are from outside the United states\nSo if you think about the different languages that we see we have to hire hunting reviewers who speak all different kinds of languages and it's important to us that we have native language speakers because they really understand the way that language is used\nSo that's a big focus in our hiring once you're hired as a content reviewer you're trained in all of our policies but then you were assigned to become a specialist in one\nSo for instance you'll learn all about um our terrorism and harassment and bullying policies but you might ultimately be assigned to work on um identifying self harm threats of self harm\nWhen you catch content that doesn't belong on Facebook and violates its terms what's the difference between say reactive flagging and proactive flying how much of it is the kind of thing that say a reviewer or a bus would find as opposed to something that I as a user would flag and then Facebook\nWith us we still rely heavily on people to tell us when something is going wrong on the side\nThat said we've been investing heavily in tools that can proactively flag violating content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well and a couple of areas where it's harder areas where it's working really well with terror propaganda\nI'm with child sexual exploitation with spam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can slide the vast majority of that content before\nDreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program at\nThe end you dot edu flash I I I\nAnd content and I'll tell you there's a couple of areas where this is working really well and a couple of areas where it's harder areas where it's working really well with terror propaganda I'm with child sexual exploitation with\nSpam with fake accounts we now have technical tools that can slide the vast majority of that content before anybody in the community\nSend it to us or sees that at all um in fact when it comes to child sexual abuse imagery or terror propaganda were able to stop the majority of that at the time of upload meaning nobody ends up seeing\nNow when you think about a policy like bullying or hate speech or harassment a lot of that is very can textual\nFor instance um you know there could be if I if I wanted to bully you on social media and you and I are our friends at work or at our university and and now we've fallen out then there's a backstory there and the words I might use to believe on Facebook would not necessarily be the things that we could train our technology to catch\nSo it's really important for us to give tools to people so that if I ... on Facebook you can report it and our reviewer will actually look at what's happening and make that decision what about topics as opposed to content patterns how does that pattern recognition work\nWell we do so most of our policies are about content that people are posting but we do have some policies that are focused on actors themselves\nFor instance if you miss represent yourself on Facebook we will remove your account even if you're not otherwise buy it in our content policies we also have policies against terror organizations and our members hate organizations um and so forth so if you for instance wanted to create a page to support al ...\nAnd on that page you were just going to share photos of puppies and kittens and rain does we would still remove it because we don't allow those groups or anybody representing those groups to have a presence on the site\nUm if you see a page that is violating our policies in its entirety meaning it's a page that's represent an al ... page that has been created for the purpose of bullying somebody then it's appropriate to report the page to us\nThe reason I mentioned that is because whatever you report that the piece of content that's going to come through to our review teams first and so if somebody has an otherwise okay profile and then they are attacking you based on your religion and you report that specific attacking comment that what's going to come through our reviewers and they'll be able to take immediate action\nAlso worth noting if you're a mobile use or like if if you're an iPhone use or if you just have one comment directly\nSometimes it'll bring you up a menu that will say reply or lie or copy and then there's other options and even those other options there's an option to report somebody I Wonder how much Facebook is facing the learning curve of a world as learning to use Facebook know decides designed to be intuitive", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "16"}
