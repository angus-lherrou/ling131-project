L. M. I. thing Morgan's referring to Patrice floors ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nYeah so when we think about the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that\nUh you know for those of us who were industry in Ferguson we are mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protest there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organized everybody wants to beat of about the protests that\nAh it was organic there were a set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we will see for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend what's unfortunate is that there's this narrative that it's that have come up that is a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis to organize every body the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true so when I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nIs that I'm awful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who were industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom without you wouldn't there would be no protest a sabbatical important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exists for me that\nUh one of the important things about having a platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people have just sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names and in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together\nBut this narrative that there's like a small set of people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organizations\nWho like what a catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that\nCertain people certain leaders to become more prominent with the concerned about but who profits off the cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast is a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to you\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nMovements that\nCertain people certain leaders to become more prominent\nWith the concerned about but who profits off the cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast is a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause yes\nIt's interesting I think I'm always shut you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the\nThe way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end emily's sleep in a portion of all the pre order sales went to the N. double ACP legal Defense Fund that was\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just find the book raised to like that talking about the book specifically\nBut in general in the face like I'm mindful of ... when we started camping zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Thirteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of race for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nSo over the past three years we raised about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is\nA lot of money and the grand scheme of nonprofits and we did it so that we could just raise enough money to do the work that we thought was important right so we created the first of the database of police union contracts at first a public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done ever before continue to support organizes around the country and really discreet project [noise]\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not a I'm a salary from this stuff so we try to do it is like\nWith just the bare necessities so that it's not this question of like profit\nUh and with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton being part of it they get paid as a part of the ...

to re McCutcheon his new memoir is called on the other side of freedom the case for hope let's talk about some of the more personal aspects of your life that you describe in the book there's a short section of the book like page and a half\nWere you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she left\nA leader in the chapter you write code I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we remember joy and trials\nWhen we remember pain we are trying to protect ourselves and cope with trying to order the memories in ways that will allow us to make it to tomorrow and the day after tomorrow unquote talk about how those kinds of\nTraumatic or difficult experiences as a kid kind of helped to shape you as an adult particularly an adult who would gravitate toward activists\nYou know it's interesting uh this is the first time saying this because it just happened is that my mother read the book um and she texted me recently and it was like hey to re read the book we should talk [noise]\nAnd I just haven't had a cabin with right back at so hopefully I write facts either one of the reasons why I

and I just haven't had a cabin with right back at so hopefully I write back to [noise] he's one of the reasons why I wrote this chapter in the chapters I can remember and now with us that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into every room bringing much more than we name\nAnd one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had to sort of work within an grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and like that's important as we think about what it means to organize has that like we're all walk into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nA core part of it that the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities where there's poverty race\nOr or any other after today devotee they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family and I knew what ... not to ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know a ... a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraints that might the constraints become so great and the way that we learn how to survive\nThat we can start to manage and things beyond it and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd like you didn't know that they were seeing the right in the left is it the right has always re packaging old narratives for new time the left we're always engage them most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe that\nYou've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but like we believe that that's real and like\nTelling those stories actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good storyteller by the future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you enter the world\n[noise] you also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times at a rather young age\nAnd you connect that with what you call the clients quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never hidden any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love\nThe parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons why I was in Port in for me to be out very very um [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very\nSort of overt way when the to protest for him it's like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gay to think that the only way to do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and\nAh you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know doesn't mean it was a real like I was in the quiet and not the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room and the gay black man and like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collected within social justice or the work that we need to do\nWithout talking about a mile an identity that I wrote about the the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know um [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt was free in some ways to finally just they\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAnd the work to all of us have collected with them and social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about a mile an identity that I wrote about the the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know um [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt was free in some ways to finally just they and like not have to tiptoe around and not be ashamed to say that this happened and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally taught a couple of years later and they realized that he'd actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me um\nTo like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives and like that was important\nUm but I've had to like you know I write about in the book because I like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were periods and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right [laughter] so I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlets actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my all their career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian or gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people are OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things and that changes the conception\nDo you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know let's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my ... and they have to be\n[noise] yeah you know like I think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave the bike and there's not one way right that there is not to wait to be gay they're like\nThat's why the pride parade of really really all that like yeah so like sometimes it is the way rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is just like going on a date and like that it and like those are both valid way to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I might not get enough in like\nThat I don't talk about gay issues is publicly as possible and like you know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life dry leaves like other people can feel like it's real re\nFelt like I Know that you know we're working with the research right now to try to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests is that\nIt's not that people and people don't get tested if they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of the results that\nAre that they are actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function as small towns and they're nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cause and a friend like that they actually are nervous about like well privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I've I don't feel like I Need to talk about that every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cares about being gay right\nSo the other thing I'll say that there's some people who like a really homophobic but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your heat\nYou also talk very

want to have a lot of rain from time leaving I Want to make sure that\nIt was a blessing to going to the un\nEvery day and defend America and I always\nFrom fighting for our country that I Will tell you that I think it's\nNikki Haley speaking on Tuesday about resigning as US ambassador to the un and others resignation was different from some of the others we've seen in this administration because it seemed to kind of come out of nowhere by surprise last month\nAmbassador Haley published an op ed in the Washington Post declaring her loyalty to and respect for the president Shane what is your read on Nikki Haley's resignation announcement do we take it at face value is there more at play here what do you think well there's\nYeah there's always Marta ... particularly in this White House um it was a surprise there is no doubt about that it was a surprise even to people in the administration uh Nikki Haley [noise] also I think I'd found herself increasingly politically isolated in the power centers of foreign policy\nAnd the administration with John Bolton the national security advisor and my palm pay on now secretary of state a sort of absorbing a lot of that energy and then of course that's diminished\nScreaming on double you say it's imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nThought that it was a surprise even to people in the administration\nUh Nikki Haley also I think I'd found herself increasingly politically isolated in the power centers of foreign policy\nAnd the administration with John Bolton the national security advisor and Mike Pompeo now secretary of state a sort of absorbing a lot of that energy and then of course this administration being quite hostile to the United nations being UN ambassador is not necessarily the most powerful position\nUm Nikki Haley has presidential ambitions I she she said today are are there and her meeting with Trump this week she's not running and twenty twenty she plans will be campaigning for him a twenty twenty four is not that long the way a and so I think there's an element of that as well\nThe question of why now is a curious one that'll keep people in Washington guessing she may have thought get out before the midterms I'm\nThere may be of Demick certainly of Democrats take back the house they're going to become a subpoena factory this administration will be under investigation relentlessly and Nikki Haley herself is under scrutiny for a private jet flights that she accepted from friends and associates there's\nBeen some investigation to that um it might have just a band that now is the time to head for the exits and and I have to say she really does leave\nI'm probably one of the best positions of any senior trumpet vicious official she's not leaving under a lot of scandal uh she won generally plaudits for her work at the un she was seen as a stabilizing force within the administration that many people feel needs them uh and she can leave with her head held high and I think\nUh certainly someone as smart\nRare thing in our culture these days and public radio provides you this space it

U. dot org Todd's will look let's talk a bit about Brett Kavanaugh we're seeing\nHis Supreme Court nomination and confirmation heavily politicized going into the midterms President Trump\nIs using the issue to energize Republicans Democrats are doing the same thing on the other side of the aisle I Wonder where we see this going especially since Democrats some of them seem determined not to let the Kavanaugh confirmation\nGo it seems to have had office it affects or at least so it seems these numbers are a little sketchy I Want to put the provides all around what I'm about to say\nUh that the polls are fresh and we don't know exactly what this means yet for the upcoming midterms we will know in four weeks however it looks like now is having an opposite effect on Senate races and house races we've seen several Senate races places like\nTennessee or places like North Dakota where races that seemed to be closer where the Democrat who is challenging a Republican and a red state actually had\nA a chance of either surviving or in the case of Tennessee or maybe picking up an open seat to now a search for Republicans that Brett Kavanaugh phenomenon seems to in Senate races have solidified Republican base voters behind Republican candidates in most cases and then curiously in\nHouse races where so many Republicans are vulnerable\nUh I Can't say that it's had the opposite effect because I'm not sure that the Supreme Court fight as a cause and effect relationship on house races house members don't really have much to do with Supreme Court fights in at least not not in confirming them up but there doesn't seem to have been the same erosion\nIn a lead or in democratic support in the house however looking forward and you mentioned that a lot of Democrats are promising their base that the fight isn't over on Brett Kavanaugh not necessarily because of his ideological positions on a rower executive power\nA but what his behavior was in high school and college and more importantly perhaps whether he was truthful under oath in front of the Judiciary Committee and in his statements when he talked about his drinking when he talked about his behavior in high school and college uh I Would look to the house\nMost likely house members who may if the numbers hold true control the house after January they will control the Judiciary Committee they will control the investigations committees they will have chairman ships and like and like a shame said before they\nWill become subpoena factories they will also have to respond to a base that wants Brett Kavanaugh statements investigated a lot of this Joshua ... comes from dissatisfaction over the extremely limited nature of that FBI background check that week in between when Christine Blasey Ford came forward and we had that high profile\nHighly emotional and remarkable hearing in front of the Judiciary Committee or the FBI really investigate did they get to the bottom of anything did they ask\nTen twelve fourteen people who may have been witnesses in some form to some of the alleged behavior it appears that they didn't and people might be relying on Democrats to take up that church ...\nAdd to this you know senator calmly Harris is not just on the Senate Judiciary can they even she's also\nScreaming on W.

Trump was asked about to she'll use disappearance here's part of what the president's at\nFirst I Want to find out what happened and we're looking again this took place in Turkey\nAnd to the best of our knowledge\nIs not a United States citizen is that right or for a permanent resident okay we'll like John we'd all like it and we don't like it even a little bit but as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten million dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have\nFour or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to be okay but we're looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people think\nThe president speaking at the oval office yesterday in ... he was referring to the human Saudi Arabia and the four or five alternatives would be other countries from whom the Saudis could buy arms the hundred and ten billion dollars is an arms deal a military deal between the U.S\nAnd Saudi Arabia worry I Wonder if you could give us a sense of how this case\nFits into the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia especially in light of the comment that I read earlier a re read it chest sixteen forty three wrote on our website the one eight dot org\nAnd there is no reason to maintain close ties with a country that the heads more people than ISIS finally gives women the right to drive but it's only window dressing is killing civilians in Yemen and murdered a journalist who was critical of quote unquote royal family\nIf I were king for a day all the weapons we've sold them would be rendered useless and Jared Kushner would be banned from any policy making\nLaw the sharp elbows thrown in that comment I Wonder if you could help us fact\nChecked that yeah I think um it's a it's a really a fascinating point and also that that um clip you played of Donald Trump was really striking because I'm the one hand\nIt seemed so I'm cold lead transactional in the sense that he was saying you know we haven't billions of dollars pouring in why am I going to stop that just because they have murdered a dissident journalist in other words I Am so you know I don't care about human rights I mean we usually stand up for I care about money pouring into the United states economy\nAnd that attitude had activate a lot of\nPeople in Washington who are against our alliance with Saudi Arabia for example senators on both sides of the aisle that Chris Murphy and Rand Paul who have an argument for a long time just as the commenter said\nI'm now we're supporting a war in Yemen that it's unconscionable that is starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians and you know bus attacks and other things that are just horrendous um\nWhy the hell out of the country short but since you mentioned Rand Paul I'm really sorry to interrupt you but we have a clip of Rand Paul speaking to reporter this week on that very thing he said he would try to force a vote on us arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'll let you finish your thought but first let's hear from Senator Paul\nI think that the early reports have shown that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval so no I think that uh unless the unless hell of a sudden the journalist turns up alive I think that we should we should just continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia [noise]\nPlus I think we need to be voting in the Senate and debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was a Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead\nSo I was gonna say people like grandpa are going to push back against armed ... about our support for the war in Yemen um\nDreaming on W E n J imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated

or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead\nSo I was gonna say people like Rand Paul are going to push back against arms sales about about our support for the war in Yemen um even saw a lot of lawmakers invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that the u._s. jumping ministry and have to investigate what happened and if they find Saudi officials responsible they need to impose sanctions all that being said I wanted there is a counterpoint to that which is that\nOur relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been transactional Trump kind of said the quiet part out loud a little bit and the way he in a way he framed it yesterday because we have never had a relationship an alliance based on value since World War two it had all been about money and oil think about nine eleven Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia\nThat then lead to a permanent rupture in our alliance because we've always seen them as a strategic ally not as the values based ally as in Europe and I think that's important to keep in mind that Trump said it in a particularly accentuated way and he feels you know is very transactional way past presidents have\nBut this is somewhat reflective of what us presidents have said quietly for a long time\nYou just referred to chip in the ... here I mean I think Donald Trump said out loud what other presidents and other prime ministers have said it could moments in relationships you have with regimes that are far from perfect I mean I remember when Tony Blair was prime minister\nAnd there was a huge I'm Still that was about to be concluded\nOn the British serious fruit office launched an investigation into what Saudi Arabia or had been doing and whether they'd be paying kickbacks or whatever to get contracts through\nUm old ... and you know it was clear that the Saudis has said to Blair you've got to call this the core off the dos otherwise the deal is in jeopardy and highly unusually mercifully controversial Leigh Tony Blair intervened with a ... an independent investigation and said right we're canceling this investigation\nAnd he used his power as prime minister because he felt he had to because Saudi Arabia was to the customer too important an ally\nAnd you've seen with Donald Trump you know one of the first place if he went to when he became president was to Saudi Arabia I traveled with him on that trip\nAnd it was they were one hundred percent in with Mohammed bin Salman now whether they're regrets email note is an open question however
