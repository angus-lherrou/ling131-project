with a special report from NPR News the Brett Kavanaugh vote I'm Jeremy ... in Washington\nSo what does the nomination and confirmation process we've witnessed over the past three months mean for the Supreme Court the conservative Kavanaugh will replace Justice Anthony Kennedy who was for three decades the swing vote on the court [noise]\nWe heard from retired Justice John Paul Stevens this week is Ninety eight was appointed by Gerald Ford and said Kavanaugh should not be on the court\nIs of things that it's a real good and they should have been in for a ... but I think that is his performance during the hearings cause me to change but I Would\n... an extraordinary moment of former justice saying that about a nominee\nWell what he said was that because Kavanaugh had framed his entire critique at his the second round of hearings as a partisan attacks not just on Democrats but I'm liberal groups and unlike liberal activists\nThat all those people when they come to the Supreme Court could rightly\nMaintained that they won't get a fair and unbiased hearing from him and you saw Brett Kavanaugh today the wall Street Journal tried to walk back is what he said called his emotional comments but he didn't say specifically which ones in any event Steven's point was that uh\nThat he might have to recuse himself now I think that's a very highly unlikely\nPossibility given Kavanaugh's demeanor and how does that happen also that of justice refuses himself or herself it usually happens\nWhen there's a set of rules you know that say you're supposed to recuse yourself if you have any financial interest if your family is involved in any remote way if you're some very close friend has some financially or something like that there's a whole set of canon of ethical conduct but\nBecause the Supreme Court is the last place to go and if you recuse yourself there are only eight and they could be tied\nUm the justice has tried very hard not to have those conflicts\nYou can't take back a conflict like this and and I doubt that he's going to battle out\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station\nThe sound of a free press\nThere's a whole set of canon of ethical conduct but\nBecause the Supreme Court is the last place to go and if you recuse yourself there are only eight and they could be tied um the justice has tried very hard not to have those conflicts\nYou can't take back a conflict like this and and I doubt that he's going to battle out out of a lot of if any cases because of what he said\nWell Tom Goldstein President Trump has had a number of rallies where people chant lock her up about Hillary Clinton and Brett Kavanaugh got up there a before the Senate Judiciary committee and said that this was revenge on behalf of the Clintons\nCould he be a an impartial judge in a case that involved the Clintons were a left wing group he pointed out left wing groups as well well the Clintons might\nBe a very special case a given also his involvement with against our investigation in terms of\nThings involving liberals and conservatives and yes there's I think zero percent chance that he's going to recuse himself it would be in in essence an admission that he can be neutral in the fraud issues like abortion affirmative action same sex marriage and the like I Can't see him doing that I think that\nWhat he is likely to do is probably try and find some opportunities ah like he has recently with the editorial that he wrote to try and asked for some sympathy from the public and understanding exactly the kinds of pressure that he was under and what he was feeling in terms of how his family was\nUnder the spotlight with these attacks and try and kind of walk back the sense that he has some active partisan and get back into the mode where in his original testimony when he first came before the committee and really gave us this air of being a truly neutral arbiter of questions that come in front of him\nI Want to go through some key issues here that people are thinking about as they contemplate what Kevin I Will mean for the Supreme Court abortion first of all you know what do you think this is going to mean for the issue of abortion\nWell I think it's pretty clear that at at least\nThere are five justices on the court who now will begin to whittle away at abortion rights they may not overtly reverse roe versus Wade\nBut we could end up in a situation in which in those states where abortion is ... that that abortion rights are are popular they remain and in those states where they are highly unpopular they know there is no longer a clinic there because they can't function under the rules that are laid down by the state law\nWhat about same sex marriage a Justice Anthony Kennedy a who is retiring who did retire or authored that decision Tom Goldstein about same sex marriages that issue going to come up\nAgainst well I don't think in terms of whether there is a right to same sex marriage it would be very surprising to see the court\nKind of do a one eighty on that there are areas of the law where there's just playing the joints\nWhere you don't have to overrule something so to take abortion the standard is whether it's an undue burden on the woman's ... exercise of the right well who knows what that means you can feel into that whatever it is you want almost and that's why I'm more conservative court can allow more state regulation but there is a right to same sex marriage is a binary light switch on light switch off thing I can see them doing\nIt where there isn't necessarily a right to is\nAll kinds of things that go with it it's like a king you require the floor is too is against same sex marriage to design\nA floral arrangements for your wedding or as we saw a at a cake wedding cake or a photographer to take photographs or go to the photography studio and have them develop photographs of your same sex wedding I

President Nixon to turnover tape recordings that incriminate him in the end that we're putting into an ongoing criminal investigation\nUh it is true he's also said that it's one of its he cited it in a list of one of the great cases showing the independence of the judiciary\nBut he also said things that may be set has said maybe it was wrongly decided that we really don't know where he is on that what we do know is that he's a very very strong advocate of executive power in a wide array of areas\nAnd even proposed at one point that Congress should pass a law that would exempt that President from criminal investigation or civil suits while he's president\nNo on this question he only has one vote obviously but I Do think you'll probably get a lot of respect for this he spent a lot of time the executive branch you spend it in the White House and he was part of the Ken Starr investigation and so his view of how disruptive this can be to the presidency to have you know criminal proceedings in Grand juries unlike me get a lot of attention from the other justices\nWhere is Kevin are going to fit a on the court in terms of the other conservatives you already have Justice Alito Justice Thomas now justice Gorsuch pretty reliable conservatives and Justice Roberts as he become the swing vote on the court at Robert\nIt in a technical sense there probably are some cases like the case involving Obamacare and we she cast the deciding vote but mostly\nObama and the other conservatives in the in the court or at least pretty much in lock step on the outcome I mean he dissented in gay marriage he dissented in gerrymandering he'd just send it in a whole bunch of other you know in a whole bunch of other cases as long as Anthony Kennedy was on the court\nHe could move the balance board a little bit when he decided that this was a subject on which he agreed with the liberals to some extent or another there's nobody like that in the center of the court and now there are four pretty liberal justices I Would call the\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five ...

people like Beto O'Rourke a who's running in Texas against Ted Cruz\nWell he's got his own uh uphill battle and uh that's the fact that a Texas is Texas [laughter] that's a different situation but I think ... rights as arrow in on some of these red state Republican a red state Democrats who are running in places\nThat President Trump won you know Texas is among those kinds of places but first and foremost you gotta look\nA like a tells you mentioned that Heidi Heitkamp\nYou know someone like John ... says he's no he's seen in Montana in Montana seems fine in his rate but Joe Donnelly who I really wonder if he would have rather kind of said nothing uh before saying no immediately after uh that Thursday hearing\nUh I don't think Democrats quite realized how this was going to fire up Republican white men in particular this\nUh you know our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll really showed a big shift among Republicans and it was driven by by men within the Republican Party\nA who shifted very quickly\nAnd you know you have something like eighty percent of the Republican Party right now saying that the elections are a very important and that significant because that's basically a tie statistical tie with Democrats\nAnd Democrats had a ten point advantage on that over the summer\nNow does that remained this high or does that recede given the fact that cabinet looks like he will be confirmed and the fact is Democrats democratic women in democratic men they have been fired up this entire time and are expected to stay at that level\nOkay well let's listen we've been talking to a a couple of strategist on each side here this is John braid bend a Republican strategist and here's what he thinks that this means\nWhat we found in the last week is there certainly seems to be some Republicans come out [noise] um the problem we had is that particularly moderate Republicans are not huge fans of this president he makes up for that oftentimes by getting conservative Democrats\nBut at least in a lot of the surveys I've seen in the last week a lot of them about number one that the Democrats overplay their hand that it wasn't even that they didn't believe professor Ford\nThey just were unhappy with a lot of the tactics that they saw the Democrats taking and felt that uh they were they were just merely playing politics\nAnd I'm so it was interesting so it's so it's sort of by the Republican Party at that and um\nI I think the question now is can they keep that sort of small momentum going all the way until election day\nOkay so that's a Republican strategist this is democratic strategist Anna Greenberg\nI think it's very helpful for Democrats I think it's going to galvanize women who are already feeling aggrieved\nBut I also think that it way Trump doubled down and attacked Dr for rallies and I think his cabinet eyes I just think all hands are fairly leaving confirmed in the end I'm cabinet that are more\nTells me I was down on Capitol Hill earlier today are talking with protesters outside the Supreme Court and outside the capital and some of them said to me I think he's going to be confirmed but that's just going to make me more excited to go out and vote for Democrats this November ... what do you think when you hear those two strategist who who is going to\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you\nYet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nOr tells me I was down on Capitol Hill earlier today are talking with protesters outside the Supreme Court an outside the capital and some of them said to me\nI think he's going to be confirmed but that's just going to make me more excited to go out and vote for Democrats this November ... what do you think when you hear those two strategist who who is going to be more energized well\nI think that Dominican as of right it's really hard to get people Democrats more energized than they already are\nI Do think that there is a question that has been raised not just by Democrats but by some Republicans about how much this support for the president that we're seeing right now is conditional on this issue we've seen that happen over and over and over again where a Republican voters and Republican elected officials will join Trump's side\nWhen he's doing something that they like and then quickly abandoned him when he does things like handle rally at the end says things that are politically incorrect or offensive\nAnd that's been the story of the relationship between traditional Republicans and this president since he was elected and in fact and he became the nominee so I it will be interesting challenge to see if that changes in the situation as well\nYou know what do you think\nI Want to wait and see I realized that I'm I'm a I'm really not helping you at all here but [laughter] but\nI I don't actually know I'm inclined to think that this was a bump for Republican enthusiasm and it will recede at least partially because probably because some of the wives of these guys will tie them up and not let them go out and vote [laughter]\nMet a girl is the thing is when you're talking to Jon Benet bender who's a Republican and Anna Greenberg who's a democratic pollster both very good at what they do they're both looking at how this plays with their bases and like I was saying both bases are fired up over this right the real issue I think for what's going to determine this election\nIs how those swing voters those middle of the road suburban women or do you know go out and vote in this election do they go out and vote in some of these kind of moderate to right leaning districts in these house districts now look remember Democrats need twenty three seats Internet twenty three seats\nTo take back the house I think that what we've seen over the past week or two\nWith how the Senate numbers have moved there is a very real possibility\nThe Democrats wind up losing out in the Senate where they lose a couple of seats and wind up taking back the house that's a very real possibility has been a real possibility from the beginning and it's starting to look more like the most likely scenario\nBecause the ... the Republican leaning a suburban women have really moved very sharply and been sharply opposed to President Trump\nA all along and there was a huge list of a potential targets in those are in those swing slash suburban district\nAnd the numbers in the Senate let's read reprise those er reprise those um there are a twenty six to ... twenty six Democrats up\nFor democratic Democrat and only nine and then only nine Republican seats and and and that ten of those are and overwhelmingly resonates so of the Democratic seats the of the seats the Democrats have to hold onto our and overwhelmingly red states\nIt's a it's it requires a huge uphill climb\nIt's worse than that it's actually the worst landscape ever for a Senate map that any party has ever faced since the direct election of senators I guess Lindsey
