Joshua\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free friends\nIt terms called the state we're in this week we're looking at state trends in laws on unions involving the public sector workforce like teachers firefighters and government employees they make up one of the most heavily unionized sectors of America's workforce\nBack in June the Supreme Court passed a ruling that could make it harder for unions to secure a labor contracts through a process known as a collective bargaining the ruling affects more than twenty states and the consensus is it the decision will hurt unions financially and could lead to a further decline in membership\nAhead of that ruling some blue states took steps to protect organized labor what impact will all of this have on the labor movement and what impact does it having on election season\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Scott Greenberger executive editor of state lie a journalism project of the Pew Charitable trusts Scott welcome back to what ... thanks very much for having me let's get some definitions out of the way first of all when we say collective bargaining what are we referring\nTo uh when we'd say collective bargaining or what we're talking about are negotiations between uh employers and a group of employees are on salaries benefits working conditions and the like and typically employees are represented by unions\nKind of basic wages and working conditions exactly now a number of states have a right to work laws on the books that are called right to work states what exactly do we mean by right to work\nSo a right to works a states and there are about to I think twenty seven twenty eight of them now uh they prohibit labor unions and employers from requiring workers to pay union dues as a condition of employment\nUh and of course a union dues are extremely important because that enables the unions to not only um conduct the negotiations during collective bargaining but also a to engage in other activities including a political activities\nSo if you are at a job at a a union covered workplace typically you know what I mean in a non right to work state you get that job and you join the company and they say hey will convince job recovered by union here's your initiation fee you need to pay\nIn a right to work state you can get the job and say no thanks I'm not eager to pay for this but I look forward to starting work that's right\nAnd the next fresh air Melissa McCarthy\nMyself in a rather [noise]\nMcCarthy stars and the new film can you ever

public sector employees have a First Amendment right not to pay union for collective bargaining unions called this unfair because non union workers benefit from the contracts that can be reached to collective bargaining but now won't have to pay for that\nSome blue states saw this decision coming in preemptively passed legislation to protect unions from high court's ruling were discussing that and more issues related to state laws on unions with Scott Greenberg executive editor of state line Sarah dunk and is still with us on the line she's a candidate for the west Virginia House of delegates and she has a K. through eight visual arts teacher\nHere or there was one more thing I did want to ask you before we had to let you go we heard from a number of listeners\nAbout their thoughts on being in unions not every teacher is satisfied with the union that they're in great that I Can't think of any union that makes all of its members happy but we do\n... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nI'm a member of a teacher's union and while I Do appreciate all the things that the union negotiations or us on her behalf one salary health insurance\nAll that kind of stuff\nI Do feel like that sometimes the unions can prevent a higher level Caesar accountability that would ultimately lead to higher salaries more competition within the profession I feel that sometimes wants teachers achieved tenure that's negotiated underneath of the union contracts\nThat were unable to continue to drive competition and the teacher marketer and ultimately compare ourselves to other business areas where competition drives salary growth\nJohn thanks very much for getting in touch with a series I Wonder what you think of John's commented does he have a point to unions allow workers to sometimes rest on their laurels\nWell and I'd like to make a couple of comments about that\nUm first off I've not always been happy with everything that mining and has done but one thing that I really realized especially this past spring is that the union is the numbers\nThe union is not just your union leaders in movements are driven by numbers and lenders need to demand and you know what they want to see the union do also I Would say I think there's some misunderstanding about you know teacher hiring practices and firing practices\nUm it's actually not that difficult to fire a teacher but what unions have done is made it clear that\nYou can't just fire a person for no reason you do have to give them due process you have to observe than you have to evaluate them you can't just say well we don't really like what you said so we're going to let you go or you know and\nPart of the reason that's so important is because teachers that have been around for a lot longer receive higher pay\nIf we did not have that due process in place you would see a lot of teachers let go simply because they\nMake higher salaries and you you know counties can save money by not keeping those teachers around\nBefore I let you go see her I Know that your goal is to get into the west Virginia House of delegates in and try to work with the other delegates about improving policies for teachers what about West Virginians do you think the residents of your state\nOr really motivated to see the kinds of changes you're trying to bring about I mean if they were motivated than I Wonder if it would have taken the strike to make things happen in West Virginia\n[noise] I think that they are motivated and I do believe that that is why the strike was so successful we could not have done what we did without the support of our communities and I think that our communities realize you know it was portrayed in the media as if this strike was just it up a or just about health care\nIt's not about that not just about that it's about improving conditions for students for teachers for families and for working people in general um I have seen with my own eyes legislators repeatedly putting the interests of outside corporate interests over their own people in this state\nAnd that is what I Want to stop\nSarah Duncan a Kennedy for the west Virginia House of delegates also a visual arts teacher Sarah we appreciate your making time for thanks very much thank you without a few more voices to the conversation now but first let me read a few of your comments bill in Cleveland emailed\nI don't think workers should be forced to join a union but also don't think that those who choose not to join should receive the benefits of the union efforts non union members should go it alone and individually negotiate their pay and ...\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nYou didn't how we govern unions seems to be the wrong question if working conditions were good or fair or equitable enough unions would be a necessary so maybe ask how do we govern employers Scott I think we should be clear with regard to bill from Cleveland ... comment about non union members\nGoing it alone and individually to go shooting just to be clear for people who've never been part of a union\nCorrect me if I'm wrong but a union contract is a floor not a ceiling it's the basic wages and working conditions workers can negotiate for more if they want but a union contract kind of sets the minimum the basis for all the workers working conditions right\nI Believe that's the case I mean there's a lot of variation from state to state and workplace or to work place when it comes to um union rules and and the sort of um [noise] uh uh differences that you're talking about\nI Know someone that we should put that question to think is an expert on down the ... and she's joining us NYC in New York Randi Weingarten is the president of the American federation of teachers which is the second largest teachers' union in the U. S. Randy welcome to one day\nHey Joshua and that Sarah and Sarah is one of these awesome members and I she's running in and very upscale district and I hope she makes that point of the three hundred teachers is running\nI Do want to talk to a little bit more about that in a moment I should also union contract I actually I don't usually contracts I said also introduce Vincent for ... he's a senior fellow at the Mackinac Center for public policy and senior policy adviser at the state policy network and he joins us from Michigan Radio Vincent welcome\nHey thank you for having me on friendship of us use me Randy before we continue could I just put that question to you in terms of members going it alone just for the sake of clarity a collective bargaining agreement is a floor it's not a ceiling you could negotiate for more but the point of a CPA is to save these or at least the minimum working conditions and wages right\nWell um it's in in some in some industries it's a floor now the ceiling\nIt depends on what the clause is about ... city um and the beginning clauses of a union contract\nSometimes it's for everyone and sometimes it's a floor and sometimes it covers all of the conditions of um of employment including pay okay so it it it it changes from place to place it's not monolithic\nOkay good that's that's that's a good con a context is for folks maybe who never been in a union to know that it can be their their their mileage me very Vincent you you have said that the oral arguments in the Janice case that Supreme Court case we mentioned earlier led to the teachers strike this spring house so\nWell that's right but before we get to that let's just go back and to find exactly what right to work isn't exactly what Janice brought to public employees across the country\nAll right to work all Janice means is that a union can get a worker fired for not paying them it doesn't affect collective bargaining in any other way unions workers can still negotiate with employers over wages hours working conditions anything they could before right to work before ...\nThey can negotiate for after it\nExcept for the ability to say you're ... you must pay us or you're fired\nAnd going back to that contract is a a floor and not a sale like uh the vast majority of collective bargaining agreements especially those in the public sector have seniority built in are the only way to get a raise is by logging another your other job can I I'm ... and one way to go ahead and finish off\nUm so I I I actually agree with Bill um you know workers should have the ability to negotiate\nFree ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station\nThe sound of a free press\nIt's called the workers choice that allows public employees to fully opt out of union representation represent themselves and negotiate a better contractors to him\nThe confluence weekday mornings at nine Ninety five to ... percent\nMany thanks to the more than Nineteen hundred people who contributed two hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars to the W e as a phone membership campaign it was a huge success special thanks to our sustaining members and our leadership circle members for their challenges in matches\nYou make everything we do possible\nToday's programming is supported by the Pittsburgh foundation the Pittsburgh foundation is committed to helping all members of the Pittsburgh community improved quality of life information on a statistician charitable fund applying for funding and making donations to address the region's most critical needs can be found at Pittsburgh\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E essay ...

A. M. U. dot org General McChrystal I Want to follow up on something I heard in that montage I ... I recall some people using the word leader\nAnd some using the word hero and I wonder if we need to distinguish between that dock at a tweeted\nIf a quote unquote leader fails to leave but makes people do what they have to do by using threats intimidation or fear or they still called leaders shouldn't they be called anything else but leaders\nI get the sense General McChrystal for reading your book that those people could still be leaders we just might not think of them as being very heroic in their leadership\nI think that's right I mean we broaden the term leader to be people in roles and people who get people to do things even though that may be bad things so we don't say leaders are good or bad we said or effective or not because\nYou can have some pretty negative people ugly objectives who effectively lead people in that direction think Adolf Hitler\nIf we really step back and say because some of the names and the ideas and the montage there were tremendous\nWe think back when we want from our leaders what should we want from our leaders the dad retired from the military I had never met President Bush forty one and yet he called me on the phone just to tell me he thought it would be a difficult day and then the short conversation\nHe just reached out to somebody in an incredibly thoughtful way\nHe made me feel better I think we want our leaders to make us feel better but more importantly I think we want our leaders to make us better\nSometimes that's not the leader who rubs your belly and tells you you know it's everybody else's fault and you can get you deserve more sometimes it's a leader who's a little tough on you that coach that teacher that parent\nWho pushes you to be better than you would otherwise be that military commander who works you physically really harder makes you go in harm's way\nBut at the end of it you sit back and you go you know\nI'm Better or for that yeah I'm a bit better than I Would otherwise be they ask much sometimes they demand a lot\nBut typically they give along side to us and and if we we frame leaders in that way and look in the mirror and say are we demanding as followers are we asking and demanding from that from our leaders then I think we ask we answer many questions about our society today\nIn the book there are three minutes that you're trying to tear down in terms of the way that we think about leaders let's go through them one at a time one is called the formulaic mess which is basically this idea that leadership can be boiled down to a formula you argue that it's much more can textural right\nAbsolutely you can have this list of traits or behaviors and the leader can use\nScreaming on WGN appointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation in the town on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu flash I I I [noise]\nWhere's your in a different place and it doesn't work at all so in reality a leaders got to be constantly adapting themselves to meet the needs of the team in the situation\nThe second one is the attribution myth you write that we attribute too much to leaders and we give them we use a kind of tunnel vision as you describe it what do you mean by that\nWell I wrote my memoirs and twenty ten and I thought I was writing the play of my life and that would be easy because I was there and I would therefore be to star\nBut when we did all the interviews the background to get the other parts of the stories in many cases I had made a decision and there'd been an outcome and therefore thought I should get credit or blame for that but I found out all the other people who had done things I didn't even know about and the other factors that have played upon that\nWhen I concluded was the leader still part of it I mean I Wish to like keep part of it but I wasn't the dominant part and so we find today\nWe treated a little bit like a Broadway show we put the spotlight on the leader and we keep that spotlight following the leader no matter where they are but all the other things in the situation\nOr putting shadows I think we make a mistake if we assume that the leader caused the great thing to happen or is ultimately responsible for the failure there just a part of it\nAlthough I Would say that based on one of the leaders you profile in the book Walt Disney there are some leaders who want it that way Disney did not credit his other animators initially in the silly symphonies and the short films that led up to Snow White and the seven door so he kind of you kind of wanted it that way\nIt's very common I mean if you think about it everybody a little bit like the the spotlight likes to be on the pedestal so it's a natural thing and Walt Disney after the success of Snow White for what she did an extraordinary job of pushing his team to create a masterpiece\nHe wanted to Baskin that and it was a natural problem but it cost him huge problems just four years later in a bitter strike in Nineteen forty one\nWe're speaking to General Stanley McChrystal from NPR in New York the co author of leaders miss and reality that third myth you call the results myth which says that leadership is the process of driving people toward an outcome why is that a myth don't results matter\nWill results matter and we claim that that's how we select or choose to follow leaders whether they get a good bottom line or whether they win battles or win elections but in reality\nThe data doesn't support that we tend to follow leaders even though many er serial failures or their outcomes are often much less than they want them to be or have said that they are [noise]\nIt's really on the followers to understand this because leaders tend to feel some place in a certain emotional requirement for us they give a vision for the future we're much less analytical and demanding of actual results than we think we are\nMarjorie emailed good leaders know how to train the next leaders and went to release the training wheels and

W. A. M. U. dot org\nAnthony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from the\nOther side that are acquaintance ship with them for you know two decades and uh I uh he is threatened to run and now in times past than\nI always thought it was like a great publicity edge you say to threaten to run yeah threatened to run yeah LA's either offer a president or are going to support Romney 'cause you know I've decided it's not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there's something a little short of about the word for it and not he floated the idea or he hinted at a rally threatened\nYeah let's go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party it was a threatening to run and that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know if you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president but sort of like that sort of a threat but uh\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution them on something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person has a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of the story and then it makes it harder for your a bottle you know so for me um I Love coming on MPR all go on the left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalists interviews\nBecause I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said that he spent a lotta time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt that were very\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nThe other side's ideas made a person sharper and and by the way if I got to the other side and it weakens my argument that I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going\nA lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from well\nAnd there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the\nPress is communications director where you tried to convince the president said to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you said that it it pushes back\nIs normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's\nIt's not productive I hear you on that but the president didn't seem to be happening he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except\nFor except for a handful that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda\nYeah no no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know like if you're if you're if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in there\nWas to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so\nHaving the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power and that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department on my ... plan is a online somewhere somebody lead did so it it's out there was a ... page plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press and servicing all parts of the press so it didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything I only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call on CNN had been called on for several weeks\nAnd I want to send a message to those people that hey we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room we're open for business\nAnd you know I'm obviously not a shrinking violet or build my own business and you know came from scratch so I went in the square out at the I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted previous and ban and out of there I made a very big gaffe when he put Kelly and the job\nHe was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president\nAnd even if I accepted a subordinate role which I Would have been happy to do that I'm a team player I don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality or does that strike you as somebody like General Kelly with like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ...\nHaving you know your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for him to even be on that list but as far as like me any more than he likes surprised at all your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press\nShe could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean I get the sense that the president just\nDidn't agree with that [noise] um no actually\n... you know there's a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with um the penny and meeting where I've been announces ... over a Tim in Iowa alone in the office I'm going to go on

what you declared war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media first of all you're gonna lose that war\nSecondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well were you way better served if we dial that down\nOr any other thing is the president is a TV star a people may not like me saying that about him\nBut for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism let him parity with Leslie stall let him have a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's at least a half of them have that voice and so I was arguing for that I think we had him in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people don't like the presidents are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story or we know that about the president's or there's a lot of people inside of calm seems like okay\nWe got to protect the president from him telling these like ... and him telling these up\nA story on average ... may be a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is that oh okay that's right 'cause I'm either on seeing inaccurately\nAnd and clearly in consistently over ... listen I just left a morning show where these guys like but they they ... them all day and night and so and they're calling him a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energized and I understand that\nAnd I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John Kelly\nThat would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want\nAll that stuff to be dial down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to so so but but we have to do then is you've got to tell them straight yesterday man this is not working you gotta you gotta you gotta said straight but what he'll say back to you as well as energizing my base it's bringing people out to the to the to vote\nAnd and this is always going to be as ... as long as Donald J Trump is the president United States it's going to be a battle between\nPolicy and personality and the people that like his policy are going to take his personality and the people that don't like his policies are going to really focus on his personality and by the way\nW E s supported by Center for victims providing clients with a victim centered trauma informed approach to help survivors of
