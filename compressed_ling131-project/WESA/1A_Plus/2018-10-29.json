to Thomas comments on Facebook Tommy rights\nWhen speeches free and in the open people get pushed back when it is driven underground it is giving legitimacy\nAnd leads to action one of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert Bauer had there\nA gab dot com is a sort of a basically a Twitter clone um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racist begets [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter\nFor for violating put her as community standards are\nAnd gab was sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know ... the absolute power of a free speech but what ended up happening with gab is at it it became a cesspool it became a place where only the sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerate it elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I became it it has become a\nA place where white nationalism a\nAnd an extreme or bigotry homophobia whatever a has a has been embraced and\nAnd uh and this was a place where the the Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say his name was maybe not radicalized necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his\nI truly hateful views it was the last place where he\nHad posted before at the shooting 'em and it seems that it was it was sort of a\nA A N unproductive event for a lot of that hatred um\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nOr had been an active participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming and realizing this for the first time a note noticed that ah that that this place is a dark\nPlace to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying a words are not bullets in social media posts a have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this free speech is different from from action\nAnd I started when they did they actually say words are not bullets anyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence\nWith it you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens a lot of a free speech communities online that they don't really believe necessarily for speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is that it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalue speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences and then there's sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protected so hard if it means nothing um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people don't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nRabbi Jacobs I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like down and get us off the only place where this kind of speech to lift weights on line it is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment would First Amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given a new kind of speed and virulence that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened to Pittsburgh all the more worrisome to folks like you\nSure it will first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true it said how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to speak to such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger but we've seen nothing like\nThe white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae B. T. Q. people against immigrants refugees et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported nimble than from the very top from the president of the United states that the white nationalists see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides and that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we\nDreaming on double you say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university's integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nAnd who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist the racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign out before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and light Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power in the United states which of course trap taps into\nVery old anti Semitic tropes ... yeah well\nI I I'm Sorry where am I but I Do want to get a little deeper into that a lot of talks a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts at that on that I mean the president did address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday he began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti Semitism and every other form of\nThe vote and unfortunately the vote comes in many forms and we come together as one American people\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning she wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people\nFor

weird but I actually feel some hope\nAfter the massacre it was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears we were told it was just trumping Trump's telling it like it is you could be as prejudiced and rude as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nA GW tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with her own words are votes and our money\nAce in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call

unquote fair\nTo all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism the president's ignorant rats if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to scream very hot\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W yeah say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nEra we won't hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks so much for having the show I um I guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who's both religious the Jewish and also very much scientific\nI think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left of people who have a strong religious views\nAnd a close connection state of Israel I mean uh I teach at a small Jewish school here in the city and or in the in the suburbs and a lot of her students do feel uncomfortable with House bill that um\nYou know if they express a strong here instead of Israel or especially religious views that aren't\nUm you know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you or how the school deals with it\nWell I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we\nMean there are students who are you know are not particularly\nStrongly support of Israel and one way or the other but um when our students leave this school and they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a friendly if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh so I mean while it's true I mean I don't\nThink it's reasonable say that you're seeing a lot of violence in the left of it if that's true I think you are saying and I think our students feel certain intolerance 'em when they go to college um and it's you know I don't know we we tell\nWe do tell kids probably should need need to shut up you know and I don't say shut up that you know you can't argue with every\nJust kind of who you're gonna have to learn to live with that to kind of pick your battles and I think that's a hard thing\nYeah to pick their battles I should I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised didn't do that they're not\nThey're not federal everything will David there Tom but can be can be very hard to even let me put\nThat to you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rubber what do you make of David comment\nThank you David I wanted to respond both to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to save Seventy first time really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course a high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I Want to be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and all laughed and very often it expresses itself\nAs as attacks on Israel on Israel's right to excess now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is is anti Semitic which it's not and you can criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses the line into anti Semitism\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of his trials governmental policies that we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crosses the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policies that rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out\nWho carry a violent acts and say that they are motivated by hatred of Israel that the targets\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nGot and at the same time and the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred a race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia and the right is it it's being supported by the government\nIt would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore who's ... who is criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U.S and said we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right and riling up his people\nGet to a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation which has many recalls as we can as well Stacy wrote on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escape and no sanctuary but as our nation rabbis teachers the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nLynn wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope\nVarious religious leaders offered support strings and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happen last night's fellowship help to bind our wounds and set us on the path for making our town better Indira would you react to that I feel like part of what worked [laughter]\nI hate to say in Pittsburgh favor but one of the things I think helped in this whole process as you described grow ill\nIf it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had so in crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to locked arms with\nOne another that's right I mean a squirrel hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community um it's right next to CMU Carnegie Mellon university and pet\nAnd a lot of the people who live and scroll hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers accountants dentists it's an educated community a tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall is also um you know politically a liberal community\nAnd it voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton and the last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community of Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help in Pittsburgh favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the end of the enemy of the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning I'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta\nJust four months ago an attacker killed five reporters and Annapolis news the Capitol gets that\nSo you know I Do think we have to worry about drawing a line um I mean meaning there is a line between hateful rhetoric and I'm hateful actions because of group polarization that happened\nDestination unknown I'm Mary Louise Kelly bed all things considered we plan our daily voyage carefully and take the time to see the important states along the way don't worry we'll still get you where you need to go on all things considered from NPR News joined the journey\nOn Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News station\n[noise] money continues for another hour here on Ninety point five W E s said then stay tuned for the take away at noon the showers are moving out but it's going to remain cloudy today in Pittsburgh with a high end forty seven partly cloudy and cold tonight low thirty nine sunshine returns for tomorrow with the highest fifty eight\nBroadcasting from Pittsburgh historic south side this is Ninety point five FM W E s say an W E s say HD blind Pittsburgh it's eleven o'clock\n[noise] me too movement has revolutionized how America talks about sexual harassment how much is it changing the laws to protect victims and punish harasser\nFrom W.

A. M. U. dot org Emily Martin I Love to get your reaction to what we heard from California state senator ... and so I was like ... California is trying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think\nI agree that California's been a real leader in this space\nThose with the laws that um we just heard about that were passed last last session as well as if you love that\nDreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university's integrated innovation Institute\nDetails on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nPlay sexual harassment claim\nYou know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about I'm\nTalking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that is not enough time often for people to figure out what they need to do how they want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action\nSo you know we joined the national Law Center joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week\nCalling for twenty states by twenty twenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassment protections and California I think it's really a beacon for other states and thinking about how can they strengthen their laws and meaningful way spending\nStates Emily that you're targeting in particular\nWell I think that one of the things that we've seen this past year is that it's not just progressive states for example Tennessee a past new prohibitions on employers requiring employees to sign non disclosure agreement that the condition of coming to work that would ah\nKeep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and so we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide solution\nSuzanne ... your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Jackson\nYeah I think that's a great example of a legislators I'm really trying to grapple with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and and\nI'm introduced a lot of different types of legislation to get out that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that\nI did want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states and that provides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment or a place in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note that quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitation laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find the conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org vets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously I Wonder Susan and if we can begin to the line of where nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not\nInherently illegal they can have a purpose\nIn contracts I work in the news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information Dennis wrote on our Facebook page\nThere is a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however it is a disservice to our communities when they're used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allow anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement Suzanne\n[noise] yes well that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states and our legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements and sometimes they just call them contracts um or other types of agreements most of the legislation that we've seen\nUs specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace\nDreaming on WGN say it's imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation [noise] details on a master's program at\nThe end you dot edu flash I I I\nGuess this is ethically to sexual harassment in the workplace pressure typical before we move on to too much for\nThere can you just define that term force what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do well\nThere's actually two types there's the type that you mentioned that people find that the start of their employment that says keep our information confidential and there was another type of people signed usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they've hired a lawyer and those are to settle the person's legal claims\nAnd those are the ones I think that had become most problematic because in those cases it's clear that some sort of bad conduct of the current or is disputed and in those cases both parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts on her line that case\nEspecially when you speak with you from it I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or help for hurtful in terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you have said that they may not be enforceable because they may be some there maybe some contradictions\nWith federal law but I Would gather that sometimes they can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line\nWell\nFor the contract you sign up the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes clear that does can't cover sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in the contract\nThat keep our business information confidential but if you experience unlawful conduct you're allowed to talk about that so the contracts in a way educate the employees about their rights\nIt's a lot more complicated though if you're talking about settling a lawsuit because in that case many times the person has represented by a lawyer and I've heard plaintiff lawyers say that they like these provisions 'cause it's move the path toward the settlement\nAnd the thing that's kind of hard about this is the people who maybe have the most interests and learning us information aren't at a table future effect and potential victims of harassment they don't have a say in whether the victim and the employer decides to keep the information secret\nWas because of some of your comments and questions Alix tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier luckily we have to go through sharp training every year we all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where when I actually had to use it\nI knew exactly what to do\nStuff on emailed my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in Chicago for a work conference a resident of Illinois sexually assaulted her despite my encouragement she is terrified of coming forward for fear of retribution\nDo laws across state lines especially in Illinois and New York\nComplicate the legalities that would otherwise helped bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say the stuff on well that's a\nGreat question if you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond federal law yes there can be complicated questions that arise if the person is usually employed and win state but the harassing or assaulting behavior was in another\nBut it's important to remember that we're talking about state law stay in the ways in which states are going above and beyond federal protection there are core federal protection they should be strengthened in various ways that their core federal protections against workplace sexual harassment against sexual harassment in schools and so that is a baseline that covers\nEverybody with the important exemptions that we've talked about but no matter you know what is it because they live and\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nOr at least one of its proposed bills on sexual harassment and that was in Louisiana it had to do with settlements of sexual harassment cases Louisiana State House bill five seven eight would have stopped employers from forcing workers to
