thing is is that we're supposed to be and then it's really worth nothing more than a paper on which it's printed I work at some companies why some companies were the value statement was like Fifteen bullet points la I'm like well what what was even start\nYou suggest that we should limit our core values to to just to and there's a long list in the book I'm trying to find it because it's all on the list and I really struggled to narrow down to my to why only two\nWell here's the thing if you don't offer racialized values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat poster\nI mean it really is it just really a poster so every point in my head but little do yeah [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] you know and so what\nWas so you know operation allies values into behaviors\nFewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with have actually done that had taken the time to say you know what a some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in and so the two is\nReally kind of backing into the data\nThe men and women\nWho had the capacity to be the most courageous could identify their values and they had two to three values and you know I have you know\nThere's a long list in the book like we talked about and there are like Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nAltruism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independents self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list that are super important to me but when it comes down to it my two Corvette my to core values for me are facing courage and I know that the core values because it's a place where every other thing on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we have an we had a companion work buckets free downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operational as an end to behaviors\nUm it has changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them\nAnd then we have our company values and that's actually how we assess you every quarter\nNumbers on the values that you were to do it\nLike for example one of our values is take good care taking care of each other ourselves in the community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talked to people\nI mean you either do it or you don't\nAnd so I think it goes back to

S.\nUm so in some ways this this is sort of um you know in intellectual debate although other countries are are working are sort of further along on this but the idea is\nUm if this would affect how you drive it would probably um be taxed based on how much carbon monoxide would be a produced by burning\n'em by burning gasoline show it would most likely be added to the cost of the gasoline that you put in your car so if you're going to put in\nAnd in Mount of gasoline in your car that would produce a certain amount of carbon dioxide when you burn it\nThat would raise that tax would raise the price of gasoline and the idea is then you would be motivated to buy a car that use less gasoline essentially that that's how it would drive the market so consumers would want to buy electric cars would want to buy efficient cars not because not out of some sort of\nA moral sensibility but because actually a a price on carbon would make it cheaper to use an electric car it's a it's a powerful market signal\nHosted the yesterday Exxon Mobil committed money to lobby\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... say ...

you might want to listen to this conversation later on line at the one a dot org\nLet's get to a few more of your calls Heather in Indianapolis is on the line hey Heather what's on your mind what'd you think of the movie\nHey well of course I loved it but I loved it for the entertainment value but my big piece was that moment when he brought her onstage knowing that was not her comfort zone knowing what she'd been told that she wasn't going to be good enough\nThat no one would care that no one there to find her interesting or attractive\nAnd she just went out and she killed it and they loved it and for that has second ac that she realized they were wrong and everything they said to her that was a pretty important moment if you're someone who's been afraid to put yourself out there for the same reasons is kind of a big moment\nYeah I I I hear you on that just does that resonate for you in a way like was there something personal that that made you flash back to er sad about for a lay\nAbsolutely yeah I think you know\nI Do a lot of things where I have to go out in front of crowd or in front of people and you often hear you know you need to be thinner or project slower or beat this or that are younger and at that moment with kind of all of this\nIt was kind of all of us will have that moment that we can personalize it whether it's in an interview or what have you and I think that was a part of it\nHas her what'd you think about that whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her no\nYes yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and uh for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she was like this is my notes listening needs to take me as I Am and she worked at it\nYou know got them to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and I thought it it kind of the ill\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that Ali billboard\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station\nThe sound of a free press\nAnd I thought it it kind of an ill\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that Ali billboard and he says we should have just made all billboard your nose\nI think the thing about the comments about her nose is also a guy guys\nHonoring Barbra Streisand and one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a exist in and thrive\nIn Hollywood as far as coming up the music industry it absolutely is of a powerful comment on the music industry as the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing is placed in time where this movie a space and time it's interesting to think about that because\nAlmost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's\nReally no acknowledgement of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming playlists and um the major record labels having less power than they used to so it's almost like we own fashion in his view of the music industry\nBut only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also try to end but by the way for those who have not seen star is born will not be seeing stars ... just kind of want to be on the conversation she tells Bradley Cooper character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose your nose just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go into homes I Wonder how you view that commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie I felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona\nThat she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art\nI also thought about pink\nWho's very much and invention of pop music but who also have this kind of rye cynical filed style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this film in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways is very linear it's a very linear idea of there is the one I'm rose to fame there is one path you just simply offend or D than as opposed to\nThere is no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like\nThat he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming\nWith out kind of going through that traditional path agree with Anna about that but I think\nThat um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them pass each other on this fame ladder and I think you kind of have to construct it that way and what you're saying about lady God you know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist's like Lady Gaga who has been so able to make such an indelible mark on him\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety twenty five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nYou know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist like Lady Gaga who has been so able\nTo make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean the funny thing about the city as she is way more important to share than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from Bradley Cooper they've had a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd in that way\nYeah except for that voicing rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diversion but you're right I mean he is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of the story line you know one of the big parts\nOf the storyline is the love story and Bradley spend a lot of time sitting up that first time meeting here's a piece of that moment from a star is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga is character alley is just improvising alive saw him they found\nTime to time can do\nTo [noise]\nBradley Cooper Lady Gaga in a star is born Cooper spoke to NPR's MORNING EDITION with the host Rachel Martin about his work and said this about working with Lady Gaga\nAnd then we went to the piano and saying and it was just kind of wonderful thing I couldn't believe it\nSo that was the beginning of the journey and the first time we sang together I mean everything's ... we say we

Iowa City of her being discovered\nBecause he was drunk and looking for a drink and their life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was the continually same and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent\nI guess he was your age or the guy who made her over\nThe manager do agent played yeah what what is your main character\nI didn't like him and I I guess I wasn't supposed to but ah the minute he had that conversation with jacks and um and and basically getting ready to accuse ... are accusing him\nOf being a problem in that whole relationship\nI just I just knew that that was going to be the start of of something really bad happening\nYeah yeah I I I hear Eugene a hundred percent of ... and I I figure I heard you chime in as well\nNo that was a male nominee yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of the story one of the tricks with the manager is I think they do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is\nI'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them\nFrom the beginning um but then they are ultimately headed toward this pre determined tragic ending in which um he dies of suicide and so\nI think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately seems\nA forced element that it doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes in to just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed it because when he's been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager\nDreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on the master's program at\n... dot edu flash I I I\nIt comes in to just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed debt because when he's been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate and a lot of different ways for sure but you know did the movie really deal with the job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough\nTo drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film was by agree\nWith you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell and there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happen or or we're done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example he goes on stage to her with her and he can't keep up or he keeps we're getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened to someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right so if they would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way for me\nIt exactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that's part of that the narrative issue with the ending\nLet's all go ahead and go ahead well of course\nOf course the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame machine or the fame monster is like the guy got what's called it and one of her album during a destroys people is a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of star is born in there and in fact all the bridges of the SARS weren't have that manager character in a different embodiment\nUm that character in this film I\nAbsolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions he almost was a sympathetic enabler um of of the male lead and who then was like hey you know\nWe're trying to keep them afloat but he's going to mess you up\nEsther Esther was the first name of alley or in the star is born versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people um requires that a a stand in for the machine be part of the part of the cast you know has to be there um\nI also just want to say before we end gotta get this out there that um\nThis is also the story of how a woman's arise leads to a man's fall [laughter] and that's an internal problem with the stars bar and you know I have um it's a melodrama it's it's a melodrama traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic\nA ... toward the lead female character but there is this underlying sense have to say it that even as Jackson, Maine is saved temporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from\nHis young protege ultimately he is destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushed to the periphery\nFeminist reading problematic from\nWell but you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a feeling\nScreaming on WGN appointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation [noise] the town on a master's program [noise]\nDot flash I I I [noise]\nHis young protege ultimately he has destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushing the periphery feminist rating\nProblematic found well but you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a failing male ego is the wrong story in this meat to era\nWe get to a few more of your views of the film Harvey in Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen\nFor stars I deeply appreciative guys nuanced shyness in her early portrayal which made main characters advising her work well I'd like to have the same Eliot brother character better developed possibly a moment perhaps a moment could have been written in the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance\nHis scenes seemed a little too detached from Maine overall I Love the big venue concert treatments\nThat kind of gets to a comment from Argo in ... North Carolina who tweeted three stars a star is born was a story the performances especially the musical ones were fantastic\nAnd the cinematography was incredible I expect a lot of nominations to come for deep ie the director of photography the cinematographer Matthew ... production designer Karen Murphy costumer Aaron been act score original song\nAnd editing John horn spoke with the cinematographer Matthew ... about shooting live performances which are not really straightforward spaces to navigate here as a part of that conversation from Cape PC sees the frame\nThis film was very difficult to sort of navigate the stage performances because we had three different modes basically we had the Coachella mode which is I'm borrowing stages or that were already set up with the lady that was already existing\nAnd putting in our own crowds and then there was the I'm running guns sort of we have ten minutes to shoot in between two sets with a real audience apologizing and thanking the audience for a sort of I'm shooting a movie in between\nTwo bands and then we had the third which is the Greek theater which in which shallow was performed where we um we actually in more of a movie fashioned was able to create the Greek theater as a set\nAnd put a certain amount of crowded and so that was my most controlled scenario but the lighting of it had to have a consistency my my goal was that um you know in creating a a character from St Louis cinematography standpoint", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "10"}
