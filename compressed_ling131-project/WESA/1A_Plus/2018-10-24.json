W. A. M. U. dot org\nEbony you said that you were kind of incredulous at first when Donald Trump said he was going to run for president what were you skeptical about and then what kind of turned you around from that\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nGauge and uh I uh he has threatened to run and now in times past than I always thought it was like a great publicity edge you say what a threatened to run yeah threatened to run yeah LA's a higher than run for president are are going to support Romney 'cause you know I've decided it's not the right time for me to run for president\nSo there is something a little short of about the word for it and not he floated the idea where he hinted at a rally threatened\nYeah let's go go back and look at some of the tapes when he was running in two thousand for the reform party it was a threatening to run that's how I described it on my and I'm not describing a pejorative way but it just always he was like okay you know you guys don't straighten out I'm going to run for president sort of like that sort of a threat but uh\nYou know your your listeners that don't like your guest choice I'd I'd I admire them but I'm also going to caution them on something\nWhen you shut down because like I'm a pro Trump person has a shutdown intellectually and then you start to demonizing caricature of the other side\nWhat ends up happening is you you lose an important element of this story and then it makes it harder for your a bottle you know so for me um I Love coming on NPR all go on left leaning shows all the time and I'll do left leaning journalists interviews\nBecause I really do want to hear their side Jack Kennedy once said that he spent a lot of time understanding the other side's ideas that he felt they were very smart people on the other side in that always understanding the other side's ideas made a person sharper and and by the way\nIf I got to the other side in it weakens my argument that I'm a strong enough of an intellect if you will to change my argument and to say you know what I'm looking at that appropriately and so so I encourage people to keep that open dialogue going\nA lot of people out there that I disagree with but I like hearing from them\nWell and there's something to the the work that as you describe it in the book when when you were getting more involved with the press is the communications director where you tried\nTo convince the president said to dial down some of the rhetoric against the media you said and and this is not a secret that you said that\nIt it pushes back is normal but this kind of an ongoing war against the press just isn't helpful it's it's not productive I hear you on that but the president\nDidn't seem to be happening he seems to have never met a news outlet he didn't love to bash at some point or other except for except for a handful that that must have been on some level frustrating especially since you see the potential in his in his policy agenda\nYeah no no no question I mean listen I'm a very big believer in the first amendment or if you really read the founding documents and you know\nLike if you if you if you've read the federalist papers the main reason why they put the first amendment in there was to protect us from tyranny and they always felt that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely to quote lord act in and so\nHaving the free press there to observe leadership is a check on their power you know that's why they've always been called the fourth estate now\nThe press has gotten fragmented and it's gotten a little bit ideological but they still have that right and I always thought that the communications department and my ... plan is a online somewhere somebody leak did so it it's out there was a ... page plan\nThat basically illustrated that we were going to be in the customer service business servicing the press and servicing all parts of the press so it didn't necessarily have to be right leaning press if anything\nI only did one press conference a but it was very important for me to call and CNN had been called on for several weeks and I wanted to send a message to those people that have we're now open for business the lights and cameras are back on and the press room or open for business or\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nFrom scratch so I went in the square on that though I mean you give the president good advice why wouldn't they stick to it well I think what ended up happening is there was a lot of commotion he clearly wanted to previous ban and out of there I made a very big gaffe when he put Kelly and the job\nIt was going to be impossible for Kelly to keep me because I was reporting directly to the president\nAnd even if I accepted a subordinate role which I have would have been happy to do is I'm a team player I don't think Kelly would have been able to sustain that I mean look let's face it I'm a New Yorker I have a New Yorkers attitude at a New Yorkers personality\nOr does that strike you as somebody like General Kelly was like you don't have to answer the question I'm saying ... having you know your General Kelly like I I I I think those might be somewhat of friction points for him to even be honest with you on that list\nBut as far as like me any more than he likes the president would your advice about the press in terms of the way that the president deal with the press\nHe could have kept that advice even after you left the White House I mean I get the sense that the president just\nDidn't agree with that [noise]\nUm no actually ... you know such damage where there's a funny story you know because you know it was a short period of time but you almost have like a black box recorder in your brain when it's going on I'm sitting in the oval office with um the penny and meeting where I've been announces ... director is over it's him and I alone in the office\nI'm going to go on the air to three o'clock to do the press corps he looks at me and says hey it's a great relationship with the press I mean why do you think it's gone so poorly in the first six months\nI listen to what you declared war on the media I mean you can't declare war on the media first of all you're gonna lose that war secondarily any a president that's made a war declaration on the media how is that going to end up well because everybody gets their guard up everybody gets in a defensive posture I said well were you way better served if we dial that down\nOr any other thing is the president is a TV star a people may not like me saying that about him but for me I like seeing them on sixty minutes I like seeing him in areas where he's outside of that style box of conservatism\nLet him parity with Leslie stall let him have a real conversation with a crust Cuomo or somebody like that I mean he doesn't like these people\nLet's say at least a half of them have that voice in so I was arguing for that I think we had him in position to do that\nThen the blow up happened and then people get very very defensive and then there are there also a lot of people don't like the president's are prone to exaggeration he's a little bit like my grandfather that one said why let the truth get in the way of a really good story or we know that about the president's or there's a lot of people inside of the ... like okay\nWe got to protect the president from him telling these like ... and him telling these\nStories that only the average ... may be a generous word for some of the things I mean Trump is that oh okay that's right 'cause I'm On my inaccurately and and clearly in consistently over ... listen I just left they show where these guys like they\nThey ... on them all day and night and so and they're calling them a rank liar and I get it I mean he does say things\nThat are inaccurate he is doing that in a way to fluff up the crowd and get everybody energized and I understand that\nAnd I understand if you're a military leader like somebody like John Kelly\nThat would probably refer your feathers because you would want accuracy and you would want all that stuff to be dial down and obviously fifty sixty percent of the public probably wants that to so so but but we have to do that as you got to tell 'em straight you say man this is not working you gotta you gotta\nYou gotta said straight but what he'll say back to you as well it's energizing my base it's bringing people out to

say that the women has shown me personally the absolute\nDark side of human nature and you know it wasn't my women but I have absolutely experienced it I'm sure my parents would have many many more

of get away\n[noise] because my parents want in a state where you cannot remain anonymous and for them that with habits because they love to brag about it they loved the lab actually like it's like look at say where I'm more of the exact opposite and some of that is just out of fear you know I'm I'm\nKind of fear based anyway you know you worry about the people that are going to kidnap your kids for ransom I worry about up here at someone hitting them over the head making sure everyone stays home and\nI'm going to know I I Know we've got to move on in in just a moment but I Wonder how you reflect back on that if you could go back to whatever the store was where your parents bought that winning ticket and see something to them before they bought it what would you say\nIt would be the same thing that I Would tell anyone who won tonight or if you won two million dollars each one two billion dollars that doesn't matter I think it\nThey absolutely need to have the typical advice that you hear you know surround yourself with a great tape a CPA a financial advisor at attorney but my biggest vice would be to be careful\nThese are not necessarily the people that you went to high school with your office is in a strip mall are handled your last divorce or whatever you know you've had you know the scale of your new state has to match their ability to serve you\nAnd you know\nYou can't remain anonymous consider options that allows you to remain as anonymous as soon\nAs possible and then you control the message out you know I I Know that there are ways to do it and I think the last one is to just be aware of people's actions no matter how subtle you've gotta create your own litmus test of who becomes your tried right or not you're close family and it's not your friends\n...

wars and also just want to be clear there's a sectarian part of this to you know these these who the rebels who kind of came after the government you're Saudi Arabia involving itself but there is a Muslim sectarian aspect to this also this Sunni versus Shia conflict as a proxy war right\nSo this is what's interesting and this is what a lot of the people don't realize first of all the shot and Yemen I don't practice the same sect of ... that Iran practices or the Shiites in Lebanon are at all to practice\nThey practice a sect called the DSM and the ideas and is known as five or ... and it's really different from twelve or shall which is a form that's practice in Iran\nWhat's interesting is that it's the closest form of ... that resembles Sundance them a and again and we the Sunnis there are ... and the divide isn't you know the the ... are not a minority like in other places or forty five percent of the population\nAnd so what's interesting about this you know Sunni Shia conflict is that it's entirely manufactured in a sense that of course there are differences between these those two sacks of course there are situations where they don't agree but they managed to co exist for many years now the the these are the who the sect\nOf of you know what's happening in Yemen they're no longer practicing as atheism as it as it seems like they're trying to politicize said the as them and to kind of a associate themselves more with the Iranian sect of she has them and the ...\nHas struggled to maintain it sucked as it is with the influence of well how does them and set up as them coming into the country\nAnd so in a sense what you're saying is that the most radical elements of those two are fighting each other and so in a sense you have the presence of a new ... conflict but one thing that I have to point out to the listeners here is that that's not the only thing going on\nI'm a huge portion of the country and the liberated territory from the control\nIs actually demanding secession and that is something that you don't hear about in the news as much you know in the south and ever since Nineteen Ninety four the people there felt that they were under occupation and the cost is a session are rising day after day as this conflict continues\nI'd want to make sure we get to a voice on the ground in Yemen but I hear what you're saying some are in terms of all of these very complex fault lines of kind of come together to fuel the civil war today before we came on the air today\nWe were able to get through to Sana'a in Yemen all communication into and out of Yemen is really tough but we did make contact\nWith least grounding she's the UN's resident and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen least laid out what the conditions are like right now for those who

fourteen million ... who are facing famine by the end of the year this is why the United nations is rain the alarm bells\nAnd telling everyone that we are facing possibly the biggest famine in living

have similar levels there is a lot of color in the country but it's not spreading at the rate of cars last year\nThat being said when people exist for months and months on supplemental rations when they are eating limited amounts of food what happens over a period of time is that they slowly start\nAnd this is absolutely but we are seeing for millions of people in this country their immune systems are weakening and that makes some highly vulnerable to infections and water borne diseases including cholera\nAnd just by way of contacts leaves mentioned that there are fourteen million people at the un fears are at risk of famine the population of Illinois where we are right now doing this program is from Chicago he's Thirteen million people just by way of context least give me a

A. M. U. dot org before we bring in our next two guests Steve I didn't want to ask you one thing about the wave the documentary was made I Wonder how you said about\nTelling the students' stories I mean there is a moment in one episode where either you or a cameraman tries to talk about one student about her cutting class I mean all the kids that she followed go through various struggles with\nHis class was grades with life what kinds of boundaries do you have to set when you're telling a story about high school as well\nThat's a great question um I've always tried in the films I've done over the years is to a ... have the subject feel like they have\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... say Pittsburgh's NPR News they found a free press\nYou know the idea we aim for is is that we're really making the film with them not on them\nAnd yes ultimately we have editorial control but we take very seriously that kind of relationship and on this series it was vitally important that they're also be other filmmakers involved we had a diverse team of filmmakers Kevin shower Rebecca parish being Lou\nCharles a story was followed by Kevin ... I mean I found a little bit with Charles but that's really a cabin who\nI mean being I'm Sorry being that that followed a Charles a story and they had to establish these kinds of relationships\nUm that important now the moment you're talking about is with the Arab that's actually a story I happen to be falling and you know you have to navigate those those times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions\nBut you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with her because she was struggling with a lot of things\nAt that time I thought was relevant to include that in the film\nA few more of your comments before we bring in our next two guests Mitch writes we can't move forward if we fail to address the past and continue to ignore the inequalities of today people of color are treated differently in America period and the sentence\nAgility for fun tweeted I've watched every episode of America to me I absolutely love it I'm shocked at how clueless the white teachers are especially that physics teacher\nThe school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by the news of full disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Stephen ... for his thoughts on the series we did not get a response but the invitation remains open\nWe also reached out to the principle of Oak Park in the river forest high school Nathan rouse we were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit for courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary eat or is that right see that's right\nWas that the more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide\nAmen to Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race and public policy at the University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called\nDespite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to want to say thanks for having me also with us here at W. B. easy is David Stovall a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago\nHis focus is on the influence of race in urban education community development and housing and he is a Chicago native professor Stovall welcome they so much that have professors have you watched the series any part of it some of it all of that yes\nFestival what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest thing that struck\nMe the hardest is an episode to win one of the parents of student actually goes on the fourth floor and I think this is the end the conversation that we do not have about schools that have the illusion of integration and I said the illusion of integration because it just means\nThat students of color are in the same place with white students\nBut when this mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties in on that fourth floor and he still happening today\nThat to me is the story of us today professor Lewis what about you [noise]\nKnow one of the things that really struck me there are a lot of powerful moments in the series but I think one of the things that often struck me as the silences some of that some of that kill missions and I know a lot of this had to do I'm sure with who was willing to participate in or was it\nDreaming on WGN imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program at\nThe end you dot edu flash I I I\nEr fall wealthy families are the key leaders and the district a lot of the people who had the most power and the most influence over what that school ends up looking like a opt out and I think that's a kind of powerful and symbolic I'm a example of what's actually going on in the district\nPay by the way for those of you listening and I forgot to mention we may be discussing some things in the documentary that if you're eager to watch America to me might turn out to be spoilers so deeper that in mind in the conversation if you would like to listen to this lady because I don't want to get them tweets do not ... main ruin this film for you I don't want to hear it\nBut if you want to listen to this later on your own after you've had time to watch the documentary you'll find our conversation in its entirety at the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org we're talking about racial\nEquity professor so what does that mean what does racial equity look like is it and making sure that black kids in white kids get the same test scores is it about disciplinary procedures is it about truancy is it about people feel\nBeing nice to one another like how would we know racial equity if we had\nIt right I mean I think this is and thank you for that question I think the thing around equity and I think the ... to manage point what people are unwilling to talk about equity is really talking about we distribution\nSo when you talk about distribution so now the question becomes who has had the least and now what are those things that they talk about that they meet the other thing around equity is getting people what they need when they need it\nAnd I think is ... is the issue and concern give me an example of getting people what they need when they need a young person says we have a particular problem with this teacher who is constantly giving us disciplinary referrals\nConstantly grading us in ways that we feel to be dubious now there needs to be some that racial equity team at the schoolhouse wherever that is\nThat person needs to be in the conversation on that racial equity team it can't be the conversation around young people which often happens in school houses that young people are blamed for this not equitable condition professor Lewis ... what\nW.

asked some of the members of our one age ...\nScreaming on WGN lauded by emailing university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt the end you die flash I I I\nOne person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were bussed in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother tax club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up took me years to rent myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was white unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like advanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and scholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way\nCan push too far that we can give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make it\nTo me I I mean it's not in a a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue will not pushing far enough\nRight when we talk about equity we have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity and then how are those opportunities denied in real time currently and because one white student did not get one scholarship does not mean that\nBlack and Latino students across the country do not are not typically denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve that's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction that I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you been able to parse out reactions that that finally\nWell I've I've not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise] but you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdotal experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it it has been a good experience and more eye opening experience if for no other reason there are other reasons is is that we've tried to take you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not\nLiving in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all of the things that we see an awful lot of and documentary filmmaking including some past work\nAnd I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white\nParents Charles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for anyone high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin is does that reflect your experience and all my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general like there's kind of like a ... there's this blanket we put over white kids as like your you know they always going to be one regardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color\nDreaming on double you yet it's imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program at\nThe end you dot edu flash I I I\nBut we ain't got one blanket for everybody and only some people get that sleeping bag you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who's also featured documentaries were like\nI wouldn't say like the ... well I I didn't want to like comparison to other students but the school has like\nI guess prominent interest in us because of what we do with our extracurricular lose and so it was just already you're saying that they're like okay well we need to make sure those kids are good you know but for someone who is in in any extra curricular who's who doesn't have any type of\nUm non student teacher relationship with and you do in the building they like it's hard for you you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even considered forget one and that's like I think that's the whole thing right there is as blankets versus sleeping bags whereas like\nAll other white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and have stakes in the school the parents are big funders their siblings went there whatever whatever I mean you got the kids too I mean like me luckily I found spoken word but you got kids like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went to oh the but other than that\nRight there was nothing really to kind of have to fend for yourself exactly and we like it does is not the case you know I think it goes to show and um which episodes that we must have done it was like most of the kids and he was on the news um tutoring sessions are usually white fair and are widely so yeah All right and that's that's part like you know\nPersonal accountability but that's also to school like\nYou got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to ... on his tutoring but that's just the one right the you know so well to\nThat point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor loose carry tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty years [noise]\nYou know it's hard to look at the high school level and understand you can take a snapshot of high school level but when we study districts like a park like Evanston like Brookline mass like Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens of these kinds of districts\nThat tracking that kids experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts we take kids that might be you know an inch apart in terms of their skills coming in\nAnd we tracked them early and what we know over and over again for research is that that tracking means that kids are in higher attracts get more they get better and better teaching and so we take his it might even be a niche apart in terms of skills and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time\nAnd so when we look at school like a park as Dave said earlier\nThe structure that we have in place around around things like creating these academic tracks um are inevitably going to uh take\nRacial disparities that exist in our society and and reproduce them at our schools and that this travel the troubling thing is that race becomes not only part of how these trucks get credit and if you look at the history of the really deep racist history of tracking and general\nRace also becomes explanation for why it's okay the fact that you can walk into a school today and twenty Eighteen and see that the most advantage educational spaces in school or Ninety percent white and the least advantage educational experience you know there are places in the same exact school are predominantly black\nShould have us all up in arms that the fact that we think that that's okay it's all about our racial mythology\nI I think we also have to ask questions about what defines being educated and bought a good education is them\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E essay Pittsburgh NPR News they found a free friend\nOr a teacher in the series lament the fact that as a piece students often
