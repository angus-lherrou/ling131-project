let's say five five to three six one two one two will dig deeper into the files of ... and get to some of your questions tomorrow from Atlanta on one day\nBack now to our conversation with professors amend the Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our one eight ... how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall\nOne person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were a bus in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother tax club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up took me years to wrap myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was whites unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like advanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and scholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way\nCan push too far that we can give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make it to me I I mean\nIt's not a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue will not pushing far enough\nRight when we talk about equity we have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity and then how are those opportunities denied in real time currently and because one white student did not get one scholarship does not mean that\nBlack and Latino students across the country do not are not typically denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve that's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color or have you been able to parse out three actions that that finally well I\nScreaming on WGN pointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu flash I I I\nI think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdote experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience and more eye opening experience if for no other reason than there are other reasons is is that we've tried to take you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not\nLiving in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all of the things that we see an awful lot of and documentary filmmaking including some of my past work\nAnd I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white parents\nCharles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for anyone high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin is does that reflect your experience and all my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general it was like there was kind of lie\nHer I say it's there's this blanket we put over white kids as like your you know they always going to be worn regardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color they're like okay well we got like\nA whole bunch of the sleeping bags but we ain't got one blanket for everybody and only some people get that sleeping bag you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who's also a feature documentary where like\nI wouldn't say like the ... well I I didn't want to like compared to any of the students but the school has like\nI guess prominent interest in us because of what we do without extra curricula and so it was just already saying that they're like okay well we need to make sure those kids are good you know but for someone who is in in any extra curricular lose who doesn't have any type of\nUm nine student teacher relationship with any adult in the building they like it's hard to get you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even consider it to get one and that's like I think that's the whole thing right there is this blankets by sleeping bags whereas like\nAll other white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and have steaks and the school the parents are big funders their siblings went there whatever whatever and then you got the kids who I mean like me luckily I found spoken word but you got kids like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went to oh the but other than that\nRight it was not really so you kind of have to fend for yourself exactly and we like it that's just not the case you know I think it goes to showing 'em which episodes that we must have done it was like most of the kids in his our news um tutoring sessions I usually white fair and are widely so yeah All right and that's that's part like you know\nPersonal accountability but that's also to school like\nYou got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to get on his tutoring but that's just the one right that you know so\nWell to that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor loose carry tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty

envelopes\nThey're attain tended recipients according to the mailings included Hillary and Bill Clinton Iraq Obama Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder democratic donor George Soros democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters\nFormer CIA director John Brennan an actor Robert De Niro all of them have been vocal critics of President Trump\nAt least one package had a district office of Florida Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz listed as its return address shields as the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee it bounced back to that district office when it failed to reach its intended recipient Eric Holder\nThe bond that was sent to John Brennan was sent and care of CNN studios on Columbus Circle in New York when it was discovered the entire CNN building the time Warner center was evacuated\nAnd the FBI says additional packages may have been mailed elsewhere and initial examination shows that at least five of the bombs are rudimentary but functional none of the bombs detonated on site and no one has been hurt as far as we know\nNow President Trump urged unity during the White House press conference yesterday\nThe full weight of our government is being deployed to conduct this investigation and bring those responsible for these despicable act to justice we will spare no resources are expense in this effort\nAnd I just wanted to

A. M. U. dot org before we get some more questions from our listeners Suzanne what about the IRS his role in all of this\nIs their job to catch the Fred Trump's\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News station the sound of a free friends\nFlipped on this it it is their job and it's an interesting um you know a theme throughout the story when we started to look at the different um schemes and I think one thing to remember about the IRS does um you know ... large um they're understaffed and and often a lot of stuff\nDoes get through 'em and I think that that sort of became a parent's house as we were sort of looking at the totality of the uh the ... now and again that we saw we do see I'm In some of the things that we found that the IRS did push back\nAnd you know from talking to the tax experts that we did\nUm you understand when when the IRS does see something um there's back and forth I'm with you know and it would have been in this case the trumps but with the people were where were problems are found and eventually they come to a settlement\nAnd we we saw that additional tax in certain things was paid when they saw valuations that they too agreed were low um and then the cases settled and and and things move on and the case of all county um we found no evidence that the IRS I'm like oh county as the company where they had they were putting the invoices in order to drain\nI'm Fred Trump's empire an in cases like that we saw no evidence um that they were aware of what the Trump we're doing there so it's sort of a mix of they caught some stuff and and they push back an extra tax was paid here and there and then other cases where we're not convinced they even knew what was going on\nNow that you report has come out Ross have we heard anything more from the IRS they plan to look into any of these allegations or is it is it too late or are there statute of limitations that are involved\nThere are statute of limitations on any potential criminal charges those have since told there is if there's a fraud involved there's not a statute of limitations on civil penalties and and collection of back taxes we haven't heard anything from the IRS we wouldn't necessarily expect to they generally run\nVery silent and most people who work at the IRS are forbidden by law from talking about any individual taxpayer we have heard from New York City in New York state taxation authorities\nWho say based on ah the the reporting that we did they have opened investigations and and are looking for ways or if there's a reason to collect a back taxes with penalties\nBenjamin has a clarifying question about all county building supply and maintenance Benjamin tweeted did all county building have to pay taxes on the income it made how much of a difference is the percentage from the estate tax Suzanne which said arrangement\nUm it's a good question the estate tax that they were looking at what have been fifty five percent and all county the partners in our county Donald Trump and his siblings I'm would've had to pay some tax would have been a business tax\nUm and it would have been substantially less than it's interesting at least in the case of the president we know because of the law says that he it incurred throughout his um his life that he may be potentially would have been able to shelter the income and not paid taxes on it because in America when you have\nYou know law says you're allowed to use those losses to offset future income so we just don't know exactly what each of them paid but it would have been substantially less than the fifty five percent estate tax that they were facing\nThe story also one of the other aspects of this the kinds of stands out is it how Fred Trump went to some pretty great lengths to bail out Donald Trump repeatedly if he ran into financial trouble rush there was one story that involves millions of dollars of poker chips at one of Donald Trump's failed casinos\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News station the sound of a free friends\nUp was really in the darkest moment he was facing a a payment on a bond basically a money he owns the hotel lenders and he couldn't make it from the revenue to the casinos his father's a lawyer showed up\nWith checks totaling three and a half million dollars bought some gambling chips took the chips back out to the limousine and went back to queens with them and uh and never cash them so that was an eventually determined to be an illegal loan Fred Trump or had given his son to help them make a payment get over that hump\nI Wonder if we all should be clear here I mean even if\nEven if ... in New York or the IRS had known all of these things about the Trump family Suzanne and had decided you know what let's go after them let's ran down to fool for civil law on the trumps and make an example of them\nHow much could they've really done I mean what what's the worst case scenario that Fred Trump and the trumps might have faced at the time if they had been caught and fully prosecuted\nOr a big one is they would have had to pay taxes and all the uh on all the money but there could have been civil civil fines I'm there potentially could have been criminality I mean we talked about one area with our county where you know they use these padded receipts that they are\nThat they came up with to drain the empire they didn't pass those costs onto the tenants and I'm In doing so you know they inflated they ... they did it on and you know they did it with inflated receipts and they shouldn't have done it that potentially could go into areas of wire fraud among other areas and not\nSo there's a range of things um and now you could be looking at not only having to um\nThey're they're facing potential not only back taxes but penalties in interest on the money the toad so there's there's a lot of things that that I think various taxing authorities I'm another authorities could be looking at um\nWhere the food they have ended up in in federal prison for this\n...\nFederal or state prison it depends on who would choose the prosecutor the clearest a legal violation that could go into a crime was what she was describing all county they were filing false documents with a state agency um and there would be slower level charges that would flow to that\nAnd yes those could be we've talked to several former prosecutors who said that looks like\nSomething that could have clearly been prosecuted as a state crime\nClearly some of our listeners so if you feel that this is not as big a story as some of our other listeners feel it is Charlie wrote on our Facebook page sounds like President Trump is more brilliant than we ever thought and freedom and Jay tweeted so you're prove that Donald Trump success did start with a loan from his father\nAs he stated where exactly is the discrepancy none\nSudan they're\nComments I had one one thing that when when
