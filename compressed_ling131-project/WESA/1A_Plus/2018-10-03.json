I Want to talk about a fight going on in Washington DC where we happen to be you know one of the studios of WAMC you enter the world [laughter] unfortunately increasingly so but there has been\nA very important wage fight going on on the local level not in Washington is a world knows it but D.C as locals know it uh there was a ballot initiative where voters in DC voted to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nAnd there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looked like grass roots resistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the pushback was indeed coming from organizing interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others\nUm voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters were wrong and they are in the process of voting this very day to ...\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free friends\nOrganize interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others um voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars and now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters were wrong and they are in the process of voting\nThis very day to overturn the will of local D.C voters on this issue what does this fight here in D.C say about the state of wages especially for ... workers people who might get paid by their employer I don't know five bucks an hour because they make up the rest in in ones and hopefully five ...\nThe way I see it this week the living wage movement took three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen\nAnd they took one big step back with the DC Council voting to repeal um that the will of the voters to eliminate and in a gradual way this sub minimum wage for tipped workers\nUm federally than minimum wage protects workers is two dollars and Thirteen cents it's been stuck there for a couple of decades here in DC it's three dollars and eighty nine cents\nTechnically if you don't make enough tips to bring that a wage up to that the um the local minimum your employer is supposed to make up the difference\nThat pretty much never happens I used to work in the restaurant industry and I've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happens and so we have a workforce of restaurant servers primarily women many women of color\nOr ... at jobs where people face ramping sexual harassment they're vulnerable because they're having to do whatever customers say to get those tips because without the tips they're back down to really a A N E L a wage that doesn't amount to anything so\nPeople in the district um voted to get rid of this two tier system\nUm the industry launched an incredible campaign against it they put posters up everywhere in the city saying save our tips to try to make people think that this had something to do with banning tips\nIt did not it was clearly be beyond a local issue this was a national showdown between the restaurant industry and people who are trying to get a fair wage for this vulnerable sector of the workforce\nMichael Saltsman and what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with workers versus management in a fight like this uh the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters have is remarkable but what about the economics of it well actually so\nI I think in this case you had a situation where the interests of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing\nBefore the council voted on this this bill to repeal the initiative initiative Seventy seven I'm I was at the hearing I testified at two thirty in the morning it wait until three twenty in the morning um and the number of employees who showed up to say this is going to be harmful to us you need to repeal this far out numbered those were there to support it\nAnd I I just want to take a step back to I mean it was mentioned earlier that a living wage in in DC is is is Seventeen dollars an hour I mean tipped employees in DC uh according to the bureau of Labor Statistics or with their tips about Eighteen Nineteen dollars an hour or so you have people who are\nAlready doing quite well in what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together and said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage um regardless of what you think on the merits of that\nWe're also going to raise the kids may win among wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employee who said\nWe want to keep the tip credit we want our tips to count as income there was one group of New York based group called rock\nIn dollars an hour or so you have people who are already doing quite well in what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together and said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and regardless of what you think on the merits of that\nWe're also going to raise the tips may win among wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employees who said\nWe want to keep the tip credit we want our tips to count as income\nThere was one group of New York based group called rock that didn't like that and so they they came in and they had a lot of money that come in to try and put this issue\nOn the ballot and what happened was yes the restaurant industry um was opposed to this ballot measure but you had a massive grassroots outpouring from employees hundreds of who showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say\nWe don't want this and I think it's part of a bigger movement of employees now you say you say grass roots and I'm\nSure that you're right but grass roots are astro turf we see so much grass roots in the area of wages and minimum wage is only to find out that the grassroots workers who are fighting against increases in wages are are backed by business center as well so actually\nI I think it's I think that that talking point I think that's been used by proponents is is is a little bit um demeaning to the workers who who came forward um because the the testimony they gave you know one forty five in the morning or the people who got up or at Franklin hall and said you know what this is going to be harmful to me this is going to be harmful to my industry\nDon't try and save me I'm not asking for it I mean I think that the the the the notion I think that these people are just doing that um because they're sort of put up to enter somehow that they're not real employees\nUm I I think it's kind of insulting to what they're trying to do in a film Mendelssohn that chairman Phil Mendelson the chair of the DC Council made an interesting point um when he got us to talk about this which is a he said\nI have heard from countless employees who tell me this is not good for them I have heard from almost nobody who wants who wants to keep it and he said people can come to me privately they can email me this is not an issue of their owners being intimidated\nHe said that the grassroots on this in support of it was silent he called them the silent grassroots and I think that's that's indicative of where the passion was on this\nIssue let's pull back from the district the district of Columbia the local D.C back out to the nation at large and so many of you won a listeners\nHad been reaching out to us Nina posts on Facebook I'm In a precarious position if my wages go up I won't be eligible for Medicaid so it's a
