Scott Greenberger I Wonder if we can talk a little bit more about red flag laws and their impact the Jerry Brown the governor of California the outgoing four term governor of California\nJust vetoed a bill that would have expanded that states red flag law Jerry Brown is a Democrat very progressive but also thoroughly pragmatic and has pushed back on Democrats get an array of ways so\nThis is an unprecedented in terms of him vetoing something the Democrats would have wanted but what do you make of the veto\nWell a ... you know California of course is a very blue state of progressive state and already had um a\nA relatively speaking a pretty strong gun control laws in place so um and the Jerry Brown has a governed as say a pragmatic a liberal and progressive and so I'm\nA you know in this case he felt like it perhaps you know with some of the concerns that ah Richard raise that uh it went a little too too far um and a richer note it's a question of a balance but I Would add also I think it's interesting that generally speaking a that a lot of the debate um\nPost a Parkland tests focused on\nA these so called red flag laws or I'm\nA limiting the gun access to guns for people a domestic abusers you know the argument or the ... argument for for such a long time was that a guns don't kill people people kill people and it seems that now rather than\nTrying to revive a for example on assault weapons ban uh the assault weapons ban from the nineties\nOr people who are in favor of more um\nDreaming on W.

impact you think\nThat that kind of influence would have on more states passing these kinds of extreme risk laws\nI think it has a positive impact absolutely a and I think governor Hogan actually there is a he's doing the right thing and be you know he's a politician he has to be aware that that has an impact\nOn has NRA rating it has an impact on the rating that Brady Gibson as well and I think it relates back to the initial point\nThat I made that is part post Parkland really there is a groundswell of activism on this issue a huge new slate of polls that have been taken\nWhich show in every state across this country a vast majority well over fifty percent normally in the seventies or supporting exactly these kinds of measures\nThey're sensible measures they're pragmatic measures and they balance appropriately uh the you know the second Amendment rights of of gun owners with the idea that we all want to be safe in our communities one of the most heartbreaking components of my job\nIs getting polling data back and focus group information that really yields two different things and I think it's really important to think about these laws in this context first\nAmericans

pragmatic argument but you know when it comes to gun laws their constituents in their constituents I mean Vermont is a good example of that I mean Vermont was one of the states to ban bump stocks as

should talk about the minimum age for purchasing long guns and rifles four states California Hawaii Illinois and Florida passed new laws that would raise the minimum age from Eighteen to Twenty one uh Florida State representative who ... who was a Republican\nSponsored new legislation on new gun control after the shooting in Parkland, Florida he had an eighth grade from the n._r._a.\nSerious speaking on WFL our TV in Miami about why he agreed to raise the\nLegal age this is an edited version of his interview\nA determining what age someone can do something is a judgment call and we do it and in many areas of our of our law making and so I think it was for that on was the fact that you had an Eighteen year old a who did purchased this weapon I think I think without that particular fact

lobbyists there for a\nAnd R A for a long time um had a suit filed within twenty four hours of that measure passing\nI think that it will certainly withstand judicial scrutiny from our interview 'em and be upheld and I think it's a natural reaction to that a mass shooting involving you know that are often\nUm with schools individuals who are within that timeframe of Eighteen to Twenty one uh and I will note that Florida passed a package of laws at the minimum age being one all of which were\nA really designed to address the that type of issues that we saw a from Parkland\nAt the age of the shooter obviously the fact that this weapon was actually kept in a home where he stayed on secured\nAnd that's why the extreme risk laws so important so we're seeing these kinds of package bills a reviewed and introduced that the most notable point for me is it passed in the state of Florida\nRat has long been one of the strongest a sort of ... of the ... legislative agenda and I think is a very telling\nOn obviously the reactions of Parkland and that that activism that took place immediately following a the Parkland shooting\nI Would like to come back to save storage and the moment but the but by the way we did a program when we visited Salt Lake city\nAbout guns in the mountain west states and and the nature of gun suicide in the mountain west in which a state representative who

bump stock restrictions could be examined maybe through the administration's authority on a federal level rather than the state level\nOr we just shooting ourselves here should we just come out and just see the IRA is not in favor of any new gun legislation that can be passed on a bipartisan basis are we trying to make the n._r._a. more ... and more collaborative than it really is\nWell first let's define something I'm always a little bit of a loss to understand when people talk about the n._r._a. ... member of the n._r._a. there five million NRA members\nUm there's the board of directors

what it is it could mandate\nThat ah when you turn Twenty one you're given a gun they're almost institutionally has to be against it because of the terminology and the political position of the terms gun control\nThey don't mean that we sometimes think they mean are they mean different things to different people at different times\nYou know what I mean talking about Wayne LaPierre Oliver North the leadership of the national Rifle Association what we hear you know from the big ... the main figures who speak with a national voice for the ... it's the\nYou know the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun it's those ads within the last that say you know they are coming for our freedom and they use their media and the n._r._a. as you know ... you know liberties last safe place that NRA that's who I'm Talking about\nWhat you're talking about that's politics\nThat's galvanizing the true believers that's about membership that's about fundraising that's about a organizing for the next a political event both sides to it and there's nothing unusual about that whether we're talking firearms or the environment\nOr any other hot button issues and America\nEverybody does it that way perhaps we see it a little more distinctly in the a firearm debate than others although we've been put on that side ... well I just order sides\nI wanted to ah just ah to to add to that that you've seen on some of those issues issues you just mentioned and perhaps uh we're going to begin to see it on gun control as well that in cases where state legislatures are gridlocked and the power of\nA um the gun lobby is such that uh that lawmakers won't pass anything I'm\nA there is another outlet in many states and that's about initiative Washington state will have a ballot initiative in November that would raise the minimum age to buy a a\nSemi automatic rifle to Twenty one uh Oregon people in Oregon and supportive a similar measure came close to getting down on the ballot so we may see that I mean that's that was a pattern with marijuana legalization for example so that that might be a that might be coming in the future", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year":
