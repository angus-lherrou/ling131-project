the state level\nNext month in the midterms four states have ballot initiatives that would change how they draw voting districts instead of lawmakers drawing their own lines independent redistricting commissions would take over Twenty one states already have these commissions\nSupporters say independent commissions helped make districts more competitive critics say it's too much power to give an elected officials\nJoining us to discuss it is read Wilson national correspondent for the hill read welcome back to want to say\nHey Joshua also with us is David daily a senior fellow at a fair vote a nonprofit focused on electoral reform\nDavid is also the author of an upcoming book about redistricting called the rising David Walker thanks from event and joining us from WG VU public radio in Grand Rapids Michigan is Katie ... she's the founder and executive director of voters not politicians which is based in Grand Rapids Katie thanks for joining us\nGlad to be here Katie you're on the ground in Michigan working on redistricting reform I Want to hear what you're up to in just a moment but first I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and ... and let me start with you if you just explain what we mean when we talk about\nRedistricting and and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering\nSo this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the defending your senses are the census really starts the whole process of the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives the states the official number of uh their population and then the number of seats\nScreaming on WGN imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu flash I I I\nPoint redistricting becomes gerrymandering right so this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the descending ill senses\nOf the census really starts the whole process of the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives the states the official number of uh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get\nThis really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years\nBut that that's how so every state all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know there are four hundred and thirty five so that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington hill method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well uh but then it does\nThe seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAh and that's how we figure out that ah say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state so this happens every ten years and then\nEvery ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways\nUh some legislatures have challenged uh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power ... other states other legislators have more willingly given up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various courts here and there\nAre and uh the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty or the the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and then the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows\nPretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there and when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when\nA party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate in crazy ways in ways that where the the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power um and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own\nHiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we're going to see thrown around a lot of in this next redistricting second\nYear in North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leading we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing these district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform\nIt I think there's an awful lot at stake on if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing states as a Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sundays similar number of members of Congress of both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats to Washington the Democrats have only been successful and flipping one\nFried ... read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nConference you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sundays similar number of members of Congress of both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats to Washington the Democrats have only been successful and flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive said from this entire decade and that's the Conor Lamb seat and the special election in two thousand Seventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no swing in any district in any of these competitive swing states\nYou also see this as as well at the state legislative level so you have all of these states that are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that\nDemocrats may often when more votes state wide for a chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority in in both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override\nThe actions of a democratic governor here at mix politics more extreme it insulate members\nFrom voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom build it wildly unpopular and yet the politicians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation um ended also discourages competition in a lot of the states in North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent of all statewide seats went\nWithout a major party competitor so voters had no choice and almost half of their districts here because folks took a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nTo get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans of the show no one of our audience as hot as taught us topics including with Michael wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power there shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballots are fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty\nAnd Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered they rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an active for this twenty Eighteen election ain't that a load of crap\nThat's all the same in North Carolina Laura by the way we did a program a while back in February ...

more Democratic governors secretaries of state attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states\nWe got a lot of comments read about\nThe role of Republicans in gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current map it's gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to them their losses\nIs that fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantaged but what what what do we know\nThe Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and how they were Democrats came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates back in twenty Seventeen\nThe way originally elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nA but but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which\nIs sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives uh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the there's no party is blameless in this\nUh gerrymandering started we get the word from a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts\nUh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal at members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those still existed today\nA is to win all the districts around it uh the a newspaper down in in Boston\nTook a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he was a gerrymander so that's how we actually get the word and so

that some of this happened back in in a feeling of democracy back in you know live\nFive hundred BC uh but when we talk about today\nBoth parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south that were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially in the state of Maryland uh there's one district to out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the lines and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes\nBoth parties do this Republicans have done it a more publicly lately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about a fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the lines aren't fair and therefore are are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish\nThe fact that that these lines may not be fair right but the the people who who ... tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if you will\nWe do get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both sides of the aisle tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the G O P is going nuts in Colorado over ballot initiatives to redistricting by a nonpartisan commission\nSlow deep tweeted I Wish this was such a hot topic back when Democrats in my state had districts in the shape of a pencil\nJoanne wrote on our Facebook page redistricting reform has been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court was a majority appointed by Republican governors and approved by the Republican legislators\nNothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislative branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership than killed by Republican chairman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and say so publicly\n... he I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had\nWith folks that you've been witness to folks kind of talking across the aisle about this does this feel practically to you on the ground like a unifying issue\nYeah my experience really has been that um I mean in Michigan though we have had Democrats and Republicans control the line drying process so maybe that helps but\nWe have volunteers who are Democrats or Republicans independents and I think that what we've seen is that no matter which party is in charge in Michigan they're really common sense things\nThat we all lead to government ... at least help provide basic things like clean water or roads that aren't falling apart um those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know we are also a Detroit is pretty gerrymandered they try and packed a lot of

wrote on our Facebook page maybe the real issue here is that the criminal justice system in general and law enforcement in particular are being deployed to manage the effects of social and economic problems that they are ill equipped to resolve\nAnd Seth wrote on our Facebook page as a white person who works in an office that staffs mostly black people\nHearing stories of police shootings scares me that one day I might lose a loved co worker just because of their skin color when I found out they found this men guilty I was elated it's time for bad cops to stop being protected killers\nJust go now I Know I had to cut you short before we pause my wonder if we did pick up with sets comment and finding officer Van Dyke guilty it seems rare that officers are convicted after shooting someone under questionable circumstances ... what's the legal reason behind that\nWell there is a decision from the United States Supreme court that really is the key to all of this and that is the decision that the court made many years ago the grand case that basically said that\nWhen you are determining whether or not an officers engaged and they use that excessive force even less basically take the in the state that that is that's a the fate of the officer so it's a very subjective standard\nWhat would a reasonable officer\nHave done it in that situation so it is a lot and that ... that look is what is the officer feeling what is the officer saying what is the officer experiencing so that's what the jurors are required to do it as a result you find\nVery few judgments first of all you know and and civil ensuing police departments are jurors ethic and hold the standard and prosecutors before they decide to to charge the officer have to look at the standard and say what would\nAn officer reasonable officer in that situation has done so it is the Supreme Court that has set this world for all law enforcement agencies in the country\nAnd they were over Eighteen thousand separate police departments throughout the United states they all have different rules but they are all under the umbrella of whatever the Supreme Court set of that is the rule that is out there now\nYou referred by the way referring to the seasons Graham versus Connor it's a case from Nineteen eighty nine and some of you actually commented with regards to what's going on and officers mines like Peter Peter

voice to our conversation before we get to some more of your comments joining us now on the line is Shannon ... the Chicago police officer who was also a whistle blower within the department more undercover with the FBI Shannon welcome to the program\n[noise] thank you Joshua\nNo I understand you had been working as an FBI informant within the department and as a result of what happened that caused some of your fellow officers not to be too fond with you what what happened that caused such stirred did it has to do with with corruption inside the Chicago police department\n[noise] absolutely Joshua I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that some of my fellow officers were\nActually involved and the money that are kind of trade with and the Chicago area and\nTherefore I began\nAnd operation dumped operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers who\nI use the term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately that\nLed the officers one of them being a bus to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular among the rank and file within to Chicago police department because\nBefore I came for with operation brass tacks the code of silence\nWas unheard of you didn't talk about it it didn't exist or they tried to label man it's crazy for believing that this was actually going on within the ... the department so it made me very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nI Wonder why that is from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer have law enforcement in my family but I've never taken an oath so I I Can't I'm speaking as an outsider\nBut I Would think you know if I knew that there were reporters who worked for my station who were lying in stories and they got caught I Would be grateful to see them go because I drugs all of us now why do you think it's not a similar mentality and law enforcement\n[noise] you know honestly a lot of police officers get approach man they still talk to me and you are correct on us police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt officers however the code of silence\nIs so strong within the Chicago police department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide that\nOfficers actually fear what will happen to them if they break this code of silence and\nWhat was interesting to discover during this journey of\nBreaking the code of silence is that there is this common

get some more of your comments before we start kind of looking for that were the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nThe sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is a very easy standard to apply it's not that hard we do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology too many cops have no business carrying a badge and the gun however\nGalvin had these questions Galvin writes the question is what is reasonable\nDoes disobeying a police officer shouting orders constitute the right to use deadly force\nThere was a drug dealer running away from the police deserved to be shot\nWhile they may be criminals or the actions from the police equivalent to the criminals actions to Cornell maybe you should respond to golf and how do we suss out in a fine or sense what reasonable mess is\nSaid well this is in the eye of the beholder it really has no one definition and what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes\nOf the officer and what was the officers dating thing and oftentimes incidents happen and you know just a matter of a few seconds so it's there really is not one definition of it\nThat but I Do want us to get to something it said Joshua about you know looking ahead I Believe it's time to we imagine policing in America\nPolicing in America today is is quasi militaristic and police departments off there just seen as an occupying force especially in communities of color and in low income communities\nThat's not how policing started in this country policing started with individuals who lived in the community knew everyone and they were people who are not seen as an occupying force there were people there to basically provide a service and healthy individuals in the community\nAnd it has dramatically changed we have police departments armed to the teeth with tanks and all kinds of of the equipment that a very commonly used in the mail\n... free to pursue the Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nWho are not seen as an occupying force there were people there to basically provide a service and help the individuals in the community and it has dramatically changed we have police departments armed to the teeth\nWith tanks and all kinds of of the equipment that a very commonly used in the military and I think it's time to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box why do we need police officers to basically a\nPatrol and and take care of traffic issues\nFor why can't that come from within the community like Ken individuals community members somehow the debt the ties to deal with with those\nKinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nMoon some some of these ... and I'm I'm not disagreeing with you or just by way of conflicts there are some places where a lower level of sworn law enforce off or worse when officer does deal with things like parking enforcement and traffic enforcement things that are less likely to require deadly force\nSure but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic\nForce and and they they do have a command structure and ... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole image we have of police being occupiers and look at a different model entirely\nI'm not opposed to criminal to criminal justice reform but look what happened\nWe we get body cameras and what what happens well we have officers civil oh don't turn the Amazon or we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year and a court order ticket footage out on for example in liquid shooting so\nThat that the whole lack of transparency policing for example has very little sunshine\nIs very little sunshine and police say we don't get to know who these officers are their track record their history they're disciplined history it's very very difficult to get that information and state\nI think that dovetails with the comment that one of our listeners left for us Reggie who lives in Maryland with this in our inbox\nI talked to police both black and white and uh they seem to have this new look drifting approach to the community I haven't\nHad experiences where you know we just simply\nYou know would rather have conflict with ah with community rather than actually serve it I really think that they should you know take away the guns are the first couple of months but leads to buy the\nInside of the community without guns make them stand community the force you to have a dialogue with community I think it'd be a ... a lot better uh with serving it's me\nAnd she thinks we're calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin I Love you to respond to that but if I could first if we could contrast what Reggie said\nWith another set of comments that we've gone from some of our listeners like what's scholar Rhodes Scholar rides\nPolice put their lives on the line every day protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality in hold people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law I'll convict them but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time knew what would you say to folks who say that police word is inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we use the public also have a role\nFried ... read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAnd got them shot if a cop breaks the law I'll convict him but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time\nNeal what would you say to folks who said that police work is inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we as a public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just being able to get home at night\nSo I Believe it was Reggie that left a message yes um you know that was such a brilliant comment because forcing the dialogue seat when you develop a relationship with those people you are serving the citizens who are serving\nAnd you get their support your job doesn't isn't as dangerous as it is today it you know going back to what the judge courthouse that come\nOut used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors\nWhen something happens they support you when you have those relationships but when you have this occupying force were you know none of the people who are very few of the people were the ones that you do know there's conflict on the under ... on the other end of that relationship\nThat's a problem this goes to community control policing that I mentioned before\nWhere the community sets the philosophy where the community sets the budget for those in uniform where the community decides who the the leader is going to be whether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever with the community decides what's important were the community decides you know what\nWe can handle these issues at the ground level we just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that\nW we supported by the Westmoreland museum of American art hosting the big ...

E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program at\nThe end you dot edu flash I I I\nKnow when you step aside and someone else to do the job so thank you\nAnd I will say\nThis um if are all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can tell me she went I'll be doing it for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president and the next ...\nBut his Nikki Haley the U.S ambassador to the United nations speaking just a few minutes ago at the White House announcing that she will be resigning from that post back now with our conversation with ... brown and maybe by way of a transition\nWe should get to an email from Hillary who says I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed the work environment have you noticed a difference\nAt ... absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point work is not immune from the larger culture and I think we have seen just like we've seen\nIncreased polarization in our families and our neighborhoods among our friends is at work too and it feels dicey or at work um I think that\nPeople have to be careful and especially when there's power differential Z and it it's I I actually believe it's become a pretty significant source of anxiety at work and home\nJust being able to talk politics or culture or any of your other dividing line\nYeah cause everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural debate where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nTo see I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to kind of open up\nIf that ... toward keeping the professional and personal separate that at work I just need to be this one person I Do to keep my head down and we do not make waves on you to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there\nAnd the minute that we started talking about empathizing and being vulnerable and being open and compassionate and knew that opens the door for me to say something about how I voted\nOr you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love\nThat is going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like\nIt's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of less\nI think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I'd never seen anything meaningful or significant come from mouth shut had down\nIn my career that's just not how we make contributions\nAnd so what we have to do is learn how to listen talk here each other and\nRumble and we use the term rumble because it really feels like a rumble rumble with the vulnerability of seeing other people as people and being seen as a person and it's a muscle it's a foundational skill set\nI don't think spending what ... what do we spend about ... about a half of our adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives in armor\nIs something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high\nAnd we're not solving problems I Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experience as all of who you are to address the problems\nFor reading your book and based on the research that fueled the book a

address the problems\nFor reading your book and based on the research that fuel to book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a scar yeah you know stars tough because the wind is tender right and so if there wasn't something ... there'd be nothing to protect\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really it was actually voided my hypothesis going in so where did you arrive\nPuffy I yeah I just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at gassy what I'm going to find but not in this case\nSo we asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders that there is a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred fifty sea level global leaders three years building a daring leader assessments that people can see where they are\nAnd these were MBA and NBA students at Wharton catalog rice\nUniversity and then tons of data evaluation data so I thought when when when\nIt was clear that the future of leadership is about courage we need greater leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier was going to be fear but then we went and talked to several daring leaders and said so you're not afraid very often and they were like\nWhat I'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long I was like so that blew my hypothesis have fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership the greatest barrier to daring leadership\nIs armor it's not the fear it's how we self protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism the pleasing the defensiveness the anger that having to be the nowhere and get everything right instead of being the learner\nUm so really you know and it's interesting what you said about scars and tender places\nNot only does armor keep other people from seen us and sharing ourselves with other people armor protects the fear and less it faster and grow\nAnd metastasize so we need to create were cultures where armor is not rewarded or needed\nI ... the largest migrant camp in Greece is on the island of Lesbos for the migrants their their journey as traumatic it's also difficult for the people

lead with regards to armor ... emailed can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah I mean boundaries are actually a big part of this box because batteries are incredibly important [noise] um we defined it very simply as what's OK and what's not OK and so armor is not about\nProfessional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense in it is I Am going to put the protection of my ego\nBefore doing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I might protect feeling good about myself\nOver moving our work forward\nTo the difference between so there's a difference between say armor an image such as kind of the self that you portrayed other people to kind of keep bad things and it's it's on a more it's on a deeper level now\nThat's an idea but I mean the one of the greatest examples of armor the armored leadership versus air and leadership has one form of armor we see a lot and folks is the need to be right that it's that I've got to be the ... and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being the learner and getting that right\nWe've got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth\nNinety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nThat's on a day but I mean the one of the greatest examples of armor the armored leadership versus airing leadership has one form of armor we see a lot and folks is the need to be right that it's that I've got to be the ... and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being the learner and getting that right\nWe've got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into workplaces and hope emailed can you speak about the ways in which racial power structures and broader society that manifest themselves in the workplace\nDisproportionately impact the contributions of people of color in their work and the extent to which they progress in their careers before you answer here's one example professor ... tweeted\nAs a woman of color an immigrant and an academic I've learned that showing vulnerabilities and even my own resilience can and will be used against me by those in power would love to hear professor brown talk about overcoming that distrust\nWell here's one of the biggest findings I think is that one of the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the losses on her ability and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic and so that I mean racism\nHomophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege\nThose are those are everyday Thomas and it is real that that that you know the armor that you need to survive those things Israel which is why if leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here you can take that off and be seen\nThan we can't I mean gender as another you know I I think the kind of\nAnita Hill criticisms that happen after the for testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of fun during a way it wouldn't have got to go\nAbout who was you know but absolutely vulnerability can be used against us um and I think that is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about core values and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some kind\nOf mission statement or vision clarification or posters everywhere for any of this was yes we're supposed to\nBe and then it's really worth nothing more than the paper on which is printed I work at some companies wind been to some companies where their value statement was like Fifteen bullet points\nLaura I'm like well what what we're even start you suggest that we should limit our core values to to just to and there's a long list in the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot on the list that I really struggled to Merrill down to my to why only two\nWell here's the thing if you don't operation allies values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat poster\nI mean it really is just really a poster so like I'm a recording of my head that little tone [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] God [laughter] no and so\nWhat was so you know operation allies values into behaviors fewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with had actually done that had taken the time to say you know what a some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in\nAnd so the two is\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth\nNinety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station\nThe sound of a free press\nValues into behaviors fewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with have actually done that had taken the time to say you know what I some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in\nAnd so the two is\nReally kind of backing into the data\nThe men and women\nWho had the capacity to be the most courageous could identify their values and they had two to three values and you know I have you know there's a long list in the book like we talked about and we're at hardly Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nAltruism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independent self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list are super important to me but when it comes down to at my two Corvette my core values for me are facing courage and I know there's a core values because it's the place where every other things on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we have an we have a companion work buckets free it's downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your to our and an operational lies and into behaviors\nUm it has changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them\nAnd then we have our company values and that's actually how we assessed shoot every quarter\nLoose on the values that you were to do with\nLike for example one of our values is take good care take care of each other or south and the community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talked to people\nI mean you either do it or you dumped\nAnd so I think it goes back to something we haven't talked about yet that has a real core finding which has courage is one hundred percent teachable\nIt's for skill sets each of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught it's learning how to rumble the phone or ability living into your values which we're talking about right now\nIt's braving trust understanding how to talk about trust and breaking it down so we can talk about the anatomy of trust and learning how to rise how to get back up on your feet after a fall or a setback\nSupporting
