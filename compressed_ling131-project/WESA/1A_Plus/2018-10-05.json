correspondent Steve ... about his new book the red and the blue the Nineteen nineties and the birth of political tribalism well here is one well remembered moment from the nineties I take you back to president almost president at this point Bill Clinton\nUsed to that question is a member of who say well you know when I was in England I experimented with ... ... didn't like it didn't inhale and they're trying to do\n[laughter] Bill Clinton in the run up to the presidential elections in Nineteen Ninety two or the deceased late Christopher Hitchens went to Oxford with Bill Clinton said the idea that Bill Clinton didn't inhale it Oxford was probably true because he knew firsthand their Bill Clinton chose to take his marijuana\nIn edible foreign password Hitchens used to say he was no friend of Bill Clinton by the way we should stipulate that\nWe heard from Susan who sent us an email I Believe that our political risk started well before the Nineteen nineties the Vietnam Conflict was one of the most divisive issues since the civil war and we still have never recovered and not witty tweets us on Twitter I was in high school when Gingrich and company produced their contract with America\nI remember peers who had been pleasant with each other suddenly became antagonistic suddenly politics became a team sport that experience is one of the reasons why I today\nAnd non partisan a Steve you're nodding and I think that type of reaction to sorting might sound familiar to you I Want to go back to the history and just a moment but before we do\nI Want to get to a moment in tribalism in politics where we are right now I Want to talk about Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham factoring impeachment was a member of the house\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nI today and non partisan a Steve you're nodding and I think that type of reaction to sorting might sound familiar to you I Want to go back to the history and just a moment but before we do I want to get to a moment in tribalism in politics\nWhere we are right now I Want to talk about Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham back during the impeachment was a member of the house he was an impeachment man writer\nHe helped impeach Bill Clinton in ... before the Senate to make the case as a prosecutor\nThat Bill Clinton should be removed from office because of the Monica Lewinsky\nExperience I'm now Lindsey Graham is also made himself highly visible these last several weeks during the Brett Kavanaugh hearings he angrily defended cabin on he said the other day in the hearings I think everybody thought I'm a single white male people want me to shut up and I won't shut up and he was red faced and he was furious on behalf of\nBrett Kavanaugh and presumably white men everywhere but contrast that with the Lindsey Graham of twenty sixteen and twenty Seventeen and even twenty twelve\nHears Lindsey Graham at a roast dinner in twenty Seventeen poking fun at Paul Ryan speaker of the house but making a point\nYou're forty six years given the vice presidential nominee of the Republican Party here the speaker that the Republican controlled house\nYou're smart you know the budget that we're in for you have a good temperament and disposition and the judgment of Solomon you are dead\nMen walking as far as [noise] back in twenty\nTwelve Lindsey Graham the same Lindsey Graham used to warn about the future of the Republican Party he would quipped to me at any reporter who would listen we can't make angry white guys fast enough\nTo survive as a Republican Party or the future meaning Republicans had your broaden their appeal to women to minorities to Hispanics flash forward to the Lindsey Graham of this week\nI'm a white male and I'm not gonna take it any more\nStunning what does this transformation Lindsey Graham hocus vacation in the Trump beer at said EU about where we were in in in where we are\nYeah I mean it it tells me that the divide is deepening any idea tells me that the the lines that were kind of drawn to that you saw in the two thousand election and I say that we've lived with a sense\nThey're only going deeper in the moment you talked about there and twenty twelve after twenty twelve election\nThere was as you remember the certainly the the Republican sort of um establishment nationally look to the Mitt Romney's last a brac Obama included what you know what Lindsey Graham did it demographically the way the country had been divided up for the last Fifteen or Twenty years was not going to work for them long term\nThey came up with that autopsy report they were going to change on immigration all this stuff\nDonald Trump comes along and violates every tenet of this of this autopsy and wins\nAnd I think it is not just that he won the general election elect a huge part of it but the fact that he was able\nTo sweep through the Republican Party like other primaries like he didn't twenty sixteen told Republicans like Lindsey Graham and of course easy to forget but Lindsey Graham did run for president in twenty sixteen one of the sixteen or Seventeen Republicans who did and failed miserably and I think that's it I think that lesson there of going head to head against Trump\nOf dismissing him completely at the beginning of that race Graham called him a kooky called him a bunch of things\nUm in twenty sixteen and then watching how within the Republican world how Trump resonated with voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe that we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand ...\nMore than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death now with this party\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free friends\nOh within the Republican world how Trump resonated with voters it told them boy there's something about our own voters our own party our own tribe\nThat we didn't quite understand maybe we didn't want to understand ... granted more than just name calling in a primary he told Republicans we are finished if we nominate Donald Trump that he is the death knell of this party\nSo what is Lindsey Graham thinking now is he thinking I have to win a Republican primary in twenty twenty in South Carolina where Donald Trump is popular so I'd better get on the Trump train and that's all there is to it the last\nThe last gasp of the Republican Party and I'm going to be a senator from one more term or is he if he converted what's he think he I mean look there's and there's all sorts of theories about this and I don't know to give you a couple of them that that that that jump out at me what is what you're saying yeah he's got to worry about a Republican primary every Republican one of the lessons\nOf Donald Trump's rise in his in during popularity with Republican voters one of the lessons to Republican officeholders as you are taking a major major risk\nIf you are seen as separating yourself from this president your next primary especially if you're a Lindsey Graham and you already have a history of sort of being\nA being antagonistic towards the right here and they're so grim has to worry about that there's also the theory that hey part of this is Lindsey Graham trying to play the influence game if you're if you're you know friendly to Trump in public if you sing his praises or if you change your tone on Trump the way he as if you're a golf with him\nMaybe if you're Lindsey Graham and you have some issues particularly on foreign policy and national security this is a way to influence them but I think one of the other lessons to is it is again\nLindsey Graham looking at Trump than twenty sixteen and saying this is absolute political suicide for the Republican Party to go down this road\nAnd then seeing down from when the election I Know it was narrow but seeing the one\nI think ... Lindsey Graham and just brought more broadly tells Republicans\nThat this tribalism is so much deeper than we realized it was and it changes what you're able to do and what you can do politically Kennett last is the question given the demographics of this country Lindsey Graham I'll remind you one last time said himself over and over we can't make angry white guys fast enough we can't manufacturing and fast enough\nTo be a party the future I Wonder if\nWhen he closed his eyes at night whether he's changed his mind about that or not\nJames sent us an email I frequently have yard signs for political candidates in my front yard and because there are good candidates on both sides of the aisle I usually have candidates from both major parties and I am surprised\nAt how often several of my neighbors expressed their genuine irritation with me that I can endorse candidates from both parties very tribal instead of an evaluation on the merits and in Steve you're not him because that does not sound surprising to you yeah well what he's describing his ticket splitting yet in political science they the voters who go and they\nA Democrat for president Republican for Congress they split up the ballot\nJust election two election that the number of people out there who do that who split their ticket has been shrinking shrinking and you're looking at single digits right now and in that that is just the rise of polarization the tribal isn't All right let's get back in our way way back machine are red and blue way way back machine go back in history with you Steve corner you so much of what your book is about\nAh we talked about the speaker of the house Newt Gingrich who are on led to believe did not talk to you for this book although although if you

Nineteen Ninety so how do they define their ideologies for the American people it's not just Washington this polarized we've been asking listeners for memorable moments from politics in the nineties and and here's one and the president is right\nIn many ways we are a shining city on it\nTruth is that not everyone is sharing in this city's splendor and glory\nThere is this fair Mr President\nAnd the faces that you don't see\nIn the places that you don't visit\nAnd you're a shining city\nAnd believe you're hearing from Mario Cuomo their former governor of New York maybe at the peak of his political career the shining city on the hill well here's what I was going for another moment or the moment that listeners sent us from oh\nGosh the early nineties I take you back towards any [noise]\n\nTo be president President Bill Clinton June Nineteen Ninety two on the Arsenio Hall show remember him ... before that year presidential candidates didn't really appear on nighttime talk shows at all so that was something new talked about how politicians grappled\nWith media coverage during those years a Steve that was a moment not just because the president appeared on our city hall but he seemed to offer an alternative to gosh even Pat Buchanan speech there is a religious war in this country very stark\nVery serious and and a lot of Americans agreed with him here was Bill Clinton in sunglasses just having a whole lot of fun the guy you want at the party\nIt was also the moment that was June Nineteen Ninety two when Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show Bill Clinton was actually running\nNot in first or second in third place in the presidential race at that point versus Ross Perot [laughter] taking place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton and so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be an electable he'd gone through the scandal about Gennifer Flowers he'd gone through the skin\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nPlace in the presidential race at that point versus a Ross Perot [laughter] bag into place was Bush the incoming president in third place buried\nI was about twenty five percent was Bill Clinton and so they were his team he remembered the bill Clinton who emerged from the Democratic primaries in Ninety two had was thought to be unelectable he'd gone through the scandal about Gennifer Flowers he'd gone through the scandal about avoiding the Vietnam draft he'd gone through the I didn't inhale moment that sort of hard in this image of\nSlick willy the guy who's going to you know lawyer Li try this scheme is way out of\nA out of everything and so they were trying his campaign was to to change his image and he had this you know obviously winning personality and they wanted to showcase it and they wanted to get around\nInterviews with you know traditional news interviews where every question was going to be about gender flowers and the draft and all that so he was a way you go on a syndicated nighttime talk show like Arsenio Hall which was very hot at that moment you're showcase a different side of your personality and it was Ninety two it wasn't just are sending Ninety two was the year\n... media had been expanding in so many ways in that media expansion really met up with politics presidential politics I mentioned Perot who was running in first place at that point the entire Perot phenomenon began\nIn February Ninety two on the CNN show Larry King Laurie came in and Larry King would sometimes have politicians on and sometimes aging celebrities and they'd spend an hour and they take calls\nAnd Ross Perot was out in February Ninety two and he said you know if the if there are volunteers out there who will put me on the ballot in all fifty states I'll run for president as an independent\nAnd just from that\nA movement sprung up organically across the country to do in Texas about two months later volunteers submitted two hundred and fifty four thousand signatures to get Ross Perot on the ballot and he was running in first place by June and he was doing talk shows\nClinton was doing talk shows there was a Clinton Jerry Brown primary debate on the Phil Donahue show the syndicated daytime talk show\n'em in in George W. Bush this was a generational aspect to sixty eight year old George W. Bush the president running for reelection his spokesman said after Bill Clinton did the Arsenio Hall's show that night well we won't be doing anything like that\nIn our city hall went on his show the next night and just tore into Bush that when went after it was beneath the presidency yeah it was beneath the presidency to go on a nighttime talk show where people goof around and make a you know goof adolescent jokes that's not\nThat's not for a president and and Bill Clinton said Oh yes Oh yes it is said and by the end of the campaign that Bush wasn't do in our city oh by the end of the campaign but he was doing\nYou know morning shows on TV in ... he was starting to sort of get the message\nUm politicians now manage media in a very very different way now going on a late night talk show is par for the course because people want you to display your personality Brock Obama had a winning personality an affable nice guy and used it\nTo great political effect everywhere from Jimmy Fallon just even cold there there isn't a show the Iraq Obama didn't go on successfully\nUm Donald Trump in his campaign did the same as well because he's extremely comfortable on live television even if somehow less likeable than than maybe Barack Obama was but but the mores of how you reach the public has\nChanged just radically they changed completely since the moment when George W. Bush said we're not going to lower the presidency by going on or sending your home\nAnd I think too you can you can draw a line between we were talking about Gingrich earlier in the rise of Gingrich net moment with Oh Neal what that moment came from was Gingrich looking for a way around would at the time where the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich third term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my medicine\nScreaming on WGN imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation in the town on the master's program\nAt ... dot edu flash I I I\nDon't mind between we were talking about Gingrich earlier in the rise of Gingrich net moment with Oh Neal what that moment came from was Gingrich looking for a way around with at the time where the dominant sort of media platforms and they were just the broadcast networks and Gingrich\nThird term congressman from Georgia said I'm not going to be able to get my message out across ABC CBS NBC because they don't pay attention to me he CSPAN\nLeaders day old Brett Kavanaugh's old friends are coming forward to say used to drink so much you got to a blue ribbon from cabs itself to join us for the news with the sober as a judge from NPR's [noise]\nSaturday at ten am I Ninety point five W E essay\nToday's programming is supported by the Pittsburgh symphony orchestra presenting be and why melon grand classics Bernstein in Pittsburgh\nManfred ... pieces that Bernstein himself conducted with the PS so over his forty year relationship with the orchestra including Jeremiah Bernstein's first symphony tickets at Pittsburgh symphony dot org this is Ninety point\nFive FM W E s a into W. E. S. A. H. D. one Pittsburgh we are Pittsburgh's NPR News station\nLive coverage of the U.S Senate deliberations on Supreme Court nominee judge Brett Kavanaugh begin this morning at ten the Senate is expected to take a cloture vote to end debate clouds this morning giving way to send this afternoon we'll see how high near Seventy four partly cloudy tonight loan you're sixty three then rain on Saturday hanging or eighty three\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep we are roughly thirty minutes away from a vote in the United States Senate two and a debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme court clears that hurdle the final vote would likely be sometime tomorrow\nSenators are giving some closing arguments now we'll go to one of those in just a few seconds but first NPR's Scott Detrow who's in our studios and who covers\nCongress this year and Scott would you just remind us what the vote tally is so far as anybody knows\nTherefore key votes here who have not said whether whether they're going to vote yes or no that's Republican Susan Collins Jeff Flake and Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Joe Manchin we know that Joe Manchin isn't going to announce his vote until he's on the Senate floor we're hearing indications that is the case for Susan Collins as well and one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote\nThe Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend or ...\nOr say okay fine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy and it sounds like if there's four key votes this has got to be close very litigious forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nFor Susan Collins as well and one key thing to keep in mind is that this is not the final vote the Republicans especially may vote yesterday but not ... not necessarily yes over the weekend I Will say okay\nFine I'll end debate but I'm not going to vote for this guy\nAnd it sounds like if there's four key votes this is going to be close there I guess forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one maybe fifty two at the absolute most ah let's go back to Dianne Feinstein she is the California Democrat who is the senior members senior democratic member on the Senate Judiciary committee and she used to live in her closing argument let's listen to her\n\nUp okay we're going to try to get back to the Senate floor in a moment Dianne Feinstein is delivering her speech there oh she's just concluded her remarks as a matter of fact so we're now going to hear a in there and entirely over the next few minutes\nFrom two more key players here one is Charles Schumer of New York he is the Senate Democratic leader and he is a senator who vowed very early on the Democrats would oppose this nomination but everything that they had\nThe other senator we'll hear from is the key player in so many historic debates over the last decade and a half really Mitch McConnell the majority leader the Republican leader in the United States Senate and someone who has been absolutely central\nTo the Supreme Court battles of the last few years it was Mitch McConnell who said that President Obama's last nominee to the court would not even get a vote\nIt was Mitch McConnell who then steered President Trump's\nFirst nominee Neil Gorsuch confirmation it is Mitch McConnell who has repeatedly said during all the drama of the last few weeks that he intended to guide Brett Kavanaugh through and so we'll hear from Charles Schumer and Mitch McConnell in the next few minutes Nina Totenberg has this year and you know what's on your mind\nWell Mitch McConnell is not what you'd call a riveting speaker and neither is Chuck Schumer who will also be speaking they're sort of doing the final cleanup hit for their sides\nAt but don't be fooled by their boring presentation Mitch McConnell is a brilliant strategist he has done amazing things for\nA matters that he wanted to advance whether it's his agenda on the courts or getting through a budget when lots of his more conservative members wanted to just block everything and this is true he negotiated with a vice president Biden during that\nThe Obama administration and they got budgets they got you know funding for the federal government through when it really served the Republicans politic larger political interests very well although there were a minority of Republicans who didn't want to do that and Chuck Schumer\nYou know he's not the majority leader so we can't see if he's a brilliant strategist yet but but but he is there a guy he's their appointment\nHe's been marshalling the Democratic troops to the extent that it can now let's get a sense of the scene as we await their speeches because Brakkton Booker NPR's Brakkton Booker has been outside the United states Capitol today it's an area where there have been many protests over the last several days in Brockton what's the scene like this morning\nWell Steve there are some crowds out here not as big as we've seen in previous days but the date is still

the country in the last several days [noise] as well we'll talk about that a little bit more a mom and apparently Charles Schumer has now gone to the Senate floor let's listen to the Senate minority leader\nSorted chapters in the long history of the federal judiciary the well was poisoned from the outset\nWhen President Trump selected judge Kavanaugh\nFrom a list of names pre approved by hard writes special interest groups for whom the national interest as a trifling concern compared to repealing roe v Wade cutting people's health care and achieving a partisan majority on the Supreme Court\n... worse and when the Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee shielded the bulk of judge Kavanaugh's records from the public just guarding decades of bipartisan precedent and forwarding norms of transparency and the fairness and finally the dam broke\nUnder the weight of credible allegations that judge Kavanaugh\nCommitted a sexual assault\nIn high school in twenty Eighteen\nThe Republican majority conduct at a hearing that made the Anita Hill hearings and Nineteen Ninety One look fair by comparison\nIn this hearing there were no corroborating witnesses on either side no independent investigation of the facts to inform the questioning\nThey even hired an outside counsel\nTo put a witness Dr Ford on trial [noise] only at the eleventh hour urging a breakaway members of their caucus Republicans submitted reluctantly to a one week investigation of the allegations\nAn investigation which was then severely ... scribe by the White House our Republican friends blame us for this process there always finding a straw man but nothing could be further from the truth first they blame us for\nDelay knowing full well\nThat majority leader McConnell has complete control\nOf when nominees are brought to the floor leader McConnell could've moved this nominee two weeks ago\nDemocrats had nothing no say and don't when it comes to who comes to the floor\nBut in each case leader McConnell couldn't move the nominee forward because he was blocked by fellow Republicans not Democrats for moving forward when it comes to complaining about delay\nTwo words never come\nFrom our Republican friends lips Merrick\nRepublicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign where the politics of personal destruction\nWith this nomination\nFreedom ... free to explore we're Ninety twenty five W E essay Pittsburgh NPR News ... the founder of a free friend\nWhen it comes to complaining about delay\nTwo words never come\nFrom our Republican friends lips Merrick\nRepublicans are also saying we engaged in quote a smear campaign or the politics of personal destruction\nWith this nomination in reality again they're using Democrats\nAs a strongman because what they're really talking about is what Dr Ford said\nDemocrats did not end do sort of come forward\nOr conscience there\nAnd our Republican friends are are are Republican friends accusing Dr Ford\nAnd her deeply held memories of what happened to work\nOf a smear campaign are they choosing Dr Ford of a smear campaign of engaging in the politics of personal destruction because that is who they're actually blaming their decrying her testimony\nAnd then trying to blame Democrats\nI don't blame them they have a flawed nominee they don't want to focus on the nominee\nWhen future Americans look back at these proceedings let them draw no lessons from the Senate conduct here let them look back on this chapter\nThose listening to this speech and others include David Axelrod former adviser to President Obama he's now on the line Mr Axelrod mourning mourning what are you hearing there [noise]\nWell look I think uh there is a lot of a sound and fury on both sides about this nomination but there's only one thing that matters which is how a a a very few number of senators are going to vote and\nTo me the indications are that a judge Kavanaugh will be justice Kavanaugh by by the end of this weekend\nOK bottom line there now Mitch McConnell has taken to the floor of the Senate majority leader so let's bring that up and give a listen to that thanks to\nToday the Senate has the opportunity to advance his nomination every one of us will go on record was one of the most consequential votes you ever cash and the Senate\nNow the stakes are always hot for U.S Supreme court nomination\nBut college the extraordinary events of regional wage have raised them even higher this time\nWhen we vote later this morning\nWe will not only be deciding whether the elevator stunningly\nWell qualified judge show our highest court not anymore out after all this\nUnited States that are also be making a shape whether the states\nThat partisan politics can override the presumption of innocence\nOr will reaffirm that in the United states of America every one is innocent until proven guilty will either state the facts and evidence can simply be brushed aside when politically\nInconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the center\nThe mob can attack\nAnd the Senate cash almost\nFree to explore free to pursue the Ninety five W yeah day Pittsburgh NPR News station just have a free press\nBrushed aside when politically inconvenient and signal that media bullying and mob intimidation are valid tactics for shaping the center\nThe mob can attack\nAnd the Senate case\nAll set up and say that serious thoughtful fact based deliberation\nWill still define this body\nWill either give notice\nIt totally uncorroborated allegations are now officially officially enough to destroy an American pie\nOr will declare that our society cannot and must not well not set the bar so low\n\nSo modern president today as a pivotal day and the nomination process of this excellent judge but it's a pivotal day for us here in the Senate as well the ideals of\nJustice that have served our nation so well for so long\nOr on full display so let's sit back and sample of fear that choice moments that the Senate and the American people have been treated to during the disgraceful absolutely disgraceful spectacle of the last two weeks they're very nice\nJudge Kavanaugh was so now says the president's choice where are the junior senator from Oregon declare the nominees would pave the way they're tearing it\nCrowds of are allowed protesters still\nFilling out in the blanks on they're picking sides there weren't quite sure who the nominee was going to be yeah\nWe've heard the junior senator from New Jersey to describe judge Kavanaugh's nomination as a great moral struggle\nIn which they are just two camps you're either complicit and evil or you're fighting against it\nMore recently\nWe've heard the junior senator from Hawaii you argue that her personal disagreement with judge Kavanaugh judicial philosophy admit\nNow listen to this he deserve less of a presumption of innocence when it came to allegations of misconduct\n\nYou disagree with her\nYou're not entitled to the presumption of innocence when it comes to allegations of misconduct\nThat from a member of the Judiciary Committee that's the definition of due process\nHardly get due process only if you agree with her\nAnd even more recently we saw the junior senator from Rhode Island hold forth with great confidence great coughing\nOffering his expert interpretations of goofy jokes in high school yearbooks from the early Nineteen eighties that was incredibly enlightening innocent jokes\nBeer drinking references oh no our colleague was quite positive there must be some other hidden or sinister meetings at play until of course a number of judge Kavanaugh class by southern stripe earlier this week\nShe'll stop and consider the snap shots\nThe absurdity the absurdity they end\nScreaming on W E s courted by ... Mellon University integrated innovation to the town I'm a master's program\nCMU dot edu last I I I\nPlay until of course a number of judge Kavanaugh class set in ... earlier this week\nJust stop and consider the snap shots the absurdity\nThe absurdity the indebtedness it this\nIs our approach to confirming\nA Supreme Court justice\nThis is the Senate's contribution to public discourse\nBefore the end of dried on justice Kennedy's retirement our democratic colleagues made it perfectly clear what this process\nWould be about delay obstruct\nAnd resist\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of this year I committed\nWere racing to announce it made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation\nMere hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated\nMy friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated\nIt was a bunch of like clear that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination\nBy any means necessary\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats consider this nominated with an open mind\nIt would be delaying tactics obstruction and so called resistance until the final vote\nWas calls\nFor a few weeks they're offered played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here\nThere were excuses for a delay those fell flat there were broach distortion to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside factor first and there were all the usual phony apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whatever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice\n... ...\n... vulnerable people hospital workers same old tricks same old playbook but here's the problem\nThey all players weren't working the distortions were being liberated drowned out by\n\nSenators were saved and reviewed more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination\nCombined\nWe read judge Kavanaugh's twelve year record of judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court\nThree hundred plus a pen which\nWe are sworn testimony written a couch from hundreds of character witnesses from all stages of judge Kavanaugh's life and career\nAnd the picture painted by these facts was nothing like the character\nNothing like the character\nSo it was clear madam president they owe taxes weren't working one going to get the job done the resistance demanded more try something new they said well we all know what happened\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety twenty five ... you have to say Pittsburg NPR News they found a free crime\nWas nothing like the character\nNothing like the character\nSo it was fair amount of president they owe taxes\nWeren't working one going to get the job done the resistance demanded more try something new they said well we all know what happened next uncorroborated allegations of the most sensitive\nMost serious or were quickly sharpen into political weapons\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and confidence with the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nSomehow mysteriously found its way into the press\nWell chairman Grassley admittedly sat out on a sober focus search for the truth the committee collected tested all organized a new hearing and most recently I asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh FBI investigation\nBy any parents that are the facts the actual facts proved to be straightforward no corroborating evidence not not was producers support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh\nNo corroborating evidence from the FBI inquiring\nOr from anywhere else\nNothing\nMansion either way mentioned by the way I always went to the hearings and sat there for hours of testimony Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd just today than looking again at the FBI report looking at every detail that he possibly could I'm just trying to keep count here a little bit Scott Detrow if a flake is yes at least on cloture if Collins is aghast at least on cloture\nDoesn't it look like the Republicans have fifty which would be the bare minimum fifty one vice president Pence had to break a tie there there is that correct\nOr two no votes sink the nomination if if either Murkowski or management votes for cloture then yes this advances too is that okay\nSo we're still one vote short or they are still one vote short that is the situation\nThat's right and this vote may drag out that this is a more formal vote than usual you see the senator sitting at their desk standing up and announcing their votes which very rarely happens in the United states give a listen\nTo some of that this bring that up and give a listen Moran\nIs Murkowski Mr Murphy\nOkay silence on Murkowski because she's not there yet or\nUnclear if he's not there yet most will vote if their names are called them this more normal setting but are these votes can drag out again I go back to that key vote to repeal Obamacare way down with lots of last minute drama if you know the deciding vote you may let it play out before you cast your deciding\nVote absolutely and we do see a number of senators that there is very often this voting period as a time when you see senators looking quite college or there'll be standing in knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people had roast conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAround even before all of the controversy of the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice is one of the most formal\nDreaming on W. E. N. pointed by kind aching Mellon University integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu flash I I I\nAnd knots of people you'll see a hand on the back you'll see people you had to close conversation or you don't see any of that today which matches in some sense the sobriety of this moment doesn't it\nAbsolutely even before all of the controversy over the last few weeks voting for a Supreme Court justice was one of the most formal you know historical things do\nNPR's Ron Elving has seen many of these votes in the past and Iran I Want to ask about one of the many characters in this drama we just heard a moment ago from Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader\nHe has made himself central or to one historic debate after another for close to two decades now across the administrations of several presidents and if he manages to get this nomination through to a confirmation it would be another significant move from Mitch McConnell\nYes and to some degree you would make up for the narrow defeat he suffered a year ago when John McCain cast that for an addict thumbs down vote yeah on the repeal of Obamacare of this would be the culmination\nFor Mitch McConnell of a a lifetime really of campaigning for a change the federal judiciary unless you're supposed to listen to a little bit more as they go through the roles are killers\nMr Toomey Mr Udall\nIs there a Van Hollen Mr Warner\nOkay Mark Warner of Virginia has a no vote their Scott Detrow\nRegime that Lisa Murkowski voted no on cloture okay deal\nOK so Lisa Murkowski is I don't know um and so does that mean it's all up to to Joe mansion\nOr at the moment it appears to me I should point out uh a clarification that we always make during Senate votes were hardly ever broadcasting them live the vote is in is it fluid entail its final senators can change their mind so and as you see that's right or you can't have a firm stance about the final vote goes until they banged the gas\nAnd there could also be a senator whom we have assumed as a yes or of assumed as a no who just at the last moment does something different and we're\nOn a nice edge here where a single vote one way or the other could make a difference well we should all Jeff Flake we're now told was a yes vote voting yes for cloture again that doesn't assure that flake would vote for the confirmation but he appears to have voted for\nClay telegraphed really even when he made the compromise of ...\nAnd ... of the Delaware has got to have Delaware in ... to have a one week investigation he said I'm a conservative I Want to vote for ... cabin up but I also don't want to blow this process up over this let's have a one week they'll lay and barring anything really new he said I'm going to vote for this guy\nSo Jeff Flake is yes but there's still some uncertainty and I want to come back to something that you mentioned Joe Manchin when you said going to read that FBI report\nThe Senate has only distributed distributed isn't even the word they've had one copy that they've been sharing among themselves\nAnd they have been er and everyone is it are they in a secure facility that's normally used for intelligence matters for classified information and Joe Manchin has been in that room looking at a report today even as he considers how to vote\nNPR's Scott Horsley is at the White House which he has covered for years Scott what is the view from the White House as this Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nEven the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination or that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting concerts\nDreaming on WGN applauded by emailing university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu last I I I\nThis Senate vote continues in the capital down the street\nJust even the White House spokeswoman told you earlier today they are confident that they have the votes to advance this a nomination\nA that would be a huge victory for Mitch McConnell who has been laser focused on putting conservatives on the bench it would be a huge victory for White House counsel Don McGahn who's been sort of the architect of\nA President Trump's make over of the federal judiciary moving to the bench in a conservative direction\nFor President Trump I think he also sees a political advantage here he's been talking\nA at his various campaign rallies in recent days about the energy that this confirmation process is generated\nOn the right or helping to close and enthusiasm gap that uh uh Republicans had been suffering a relative to Democrats that according to our polling this is now more or less closed Republicans are just as focused on the November elections as as Democrats already were\nAnd you know the president has been very critical of this this morning on Twitter of what he or the people who have been who've been protesting this nomination heat he tweeted this morning the very rude elevators streamers are paid professionals only looking only would own eggs senators look bad\nNo evidence that that is correct description but I Want to mention Joe Manchin of West Virginia when we were just talking about has now voted by a Scott Detrow again with an asterisk that it's not over till it's over it looks like a three of the four swing votes at least have gone in favor of Kevin that's right\nBrett Kavanaugh is very likely going to advance a advanced is key procedural vote or there will be a final vote over the weekend but as of right now it looks like this was going to be a fifty one forty nine vote in favor of Kavanaugh's nomination or you had Jeff Flake and Susan Collins voting to advance a cabin all along with Joe mansion\nAnd Lisa Murkowski voting now Joe mansion isn't a really tough spot here he is one of the many Democrats up in a deep red state this cycle he's been a head in the polls really out performing how Democrats are in West Virginia\nHe's under a lot of pressure to vote yes for Kavanaugh given the makeup of the state but also if he is the key deciding vote and it's a Democrat\nAnd he's the only Democrat voting for Brett Kavanaugh you're going to see a lot of liberal blowback on mentioned in the final month\nOf he's raising a difficult situation but he is a yes at this time on ending debate to test vote in a sense and just to remind people who may be joining us\nThis vote is not the final vote there's another one sometimes senators would go the other way on the final vote that would be expected to be\nA coming on Saturday you are listening to special coverage from NPR News and we'd like to bring another voice here as we await the final tally but not quite the final tally at this moment on Brett Kavanaugh although it appears he's gotten up to fifty one votes which would be sufficient\nAlex comment has been following all of this debate and it's been involved in many of the political battles of recent years he's a former advisor to senator and presidential candidate Marco Rubio is now a Republican strategist and he's on the line Mr Conan welcome back to the program\nIf they could be with us\nSo what are you thinking about as far as the political significance presuming that Kavanaugh is on his way through and we can't say he's there but it looks like he's on his way\nWell it's like it's going to be a big win for Donald Trump an a big win for Mitch McConnell\nYou know continue to give Republicans some momentum and some energy heading into the mid term is that the terms are barely a month away that's the big ... big delivered for our base that fast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHidden sinister meanings had been found an innocent statements by Kevin on the past that he suffered grade and dignity that there was no corroborating evidence against him that many of the charges were nonsense and he told senators this is one of the most consequential votes you've ever had\nAnd it's a vote that went for Kavanaugh\nThis is special coverage from NPR News\n\nThe political left and right are bitterly divided over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nJudge Kavanaugh on ... on as a sham lack of impartiality contemporary most appalling smear campaign and miserable\nJustices are supposed to be above the political break

bread crumbs lead to certainty that another country is actually guilty David what do you think\nAbout cyber attribution is something that people are getting a lot better at I'm certainly there are lots of ways to make it appear that a cyber attack came from other places when the New York times was attacked by the Chinese and its computer systems uh years ago it looked like the attack was coming from a University in the southern part of the U.S\nBut the fact of the matter is a combination of forensic evidence a motive\nPast use so similar tools can get you most of the way most of the time so there are some pretty good ways to go do it\nThe bigger question facing many governments is once they've found this out and perhaps decide to announce it as happened in these most recent cases than

down into the system or the ability for commanders in the U.S to do cyber attacks back without having presidential sign off\nTill now that's been something that the only only the president could

two thousand Eighteen we could be vulnerable on twenty twenty so we haven't actually tried quite figured out how to protect ourselves get alone\nThe world's kind of coordinating on a global scale to

President Obama's tenure and reimposed sanctions Iran took us to court the international court of justice to argue that the u._s. actions violated the terms of the Nineteen fifty five treaty of amity\nWell the Trump Administration hit back this week\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday that the U.S is ending that treaty\nThis is a decision frankly that his thirty nine years overdue\nIn July around brought in Marilyn's case and the international court of justice alleging violations of the treaty of amity or on six to challenge the United states' decision to seize

some have said that ending this treaty is largely symbolic or is that so\nYeah it is an unknown and a lot of ways I think in general it's more just I'm reinforcing the administration says standing efforts to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and um crackdown on Iran and kind of show that they're not messing around and so\nI'm basically this was just one more step in that process but as far as any real uh changes on the ground it really doesn't do much it's really just our sponsor\nTo on the international credit just says ruling that uh that essentially said that sanctions on that we they re imposing sanctions um we're not fair to Iran\nBreak my step back for just a second what is this treaty of amity [noise] uh I'm sure that was a question if the state department I just had this vision of some low level staffer going through the basement looking\nTreaty are really really am damage as I can read the whole thing for what we've heard about that is that they're big acronym to Jaycee peel away the Iran nuclear deal but\nIs this treaty mammoth well in Nineteen fifty three the U.S help orchestrate a coup in Iran bringing the shah of Iran back to power or they were us in Iran

good friends from fifty three until the Seventy nine revolution of is it a shot who was deposed in Islam and rolled in the Islamic Revolution of ...

S. for refusing to lift them if this treaty of am at sea is more symbolic where might there be more tangible impact\nThe so the tangible impact is November when President Trump has said that he will impose the full sanctions on Iran He's given allies warning that this is coming\nAnd those sanctions if he does it as he has pronounced would say to any ... company around the world particularly European companies\nIf you do business with Iran you're not doing business with the United states and it's an effort to choke off the Iranians\nBy making the big aircraft makers Boeing's ready pulled out the big oil a production equipment makers all get out of Iran and they were doing that what's happening now though is that the ... the Europeans are saying we're going to find a method\nTo buy oil from Iran without clearing it in dollars so that the u._s. can effect that with the sanctions and a number of us went up and met a with the Iranian foreign minister when he was at the un ah last week and he made an argument to us is who Saturday evening", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "05"}
