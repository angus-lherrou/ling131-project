A. M. U. dot org Katie you're on the ground in Michigan working on redistricting reform I Want to hear what you're up to in just a moment but first I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and ... and let me start with you if you just explain what we mean when we talk about\nRedistricting and and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering right so this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after the ... census\nThe census really starts the whole process of the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives the states the official number of uh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives they'll get\nThere's a really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that that's how so every state's all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know they're four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington hill method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well but then that does the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAnd that's how we figure out that ah say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the ...\nDreaming on WGN recorded by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nEat as well but then that does the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAnd that's how we figure out that ah say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state so this happens every ten years and then\nEvery ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways uh some legislatures have challenged\nUh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power ... other states other legislators have more willingly given up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various quirks here and there\nAre and the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty uh the the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and then the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows\nPretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there\nAnd when we get to gerrymander young that's when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate a in a crazy ways in ways that are where the the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power\nUm and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own\nHiccups with political gerrymandering a it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we are going to see thrown around a lot of in this next redistricting second\nYear North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leaving we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David of what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing these district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform\nIt I think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing states of Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sunday similar number of members of Congress both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats to Washington a Democrats have only been successful and flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive states in this entire decade and that the Conor Lamb state and the special election in two thousand Seventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no swing in any district in any of these competitive swing states\nYou also see this as well at the state legislative level so you have all of these states that are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that ...\nDemocrats may often when more votes state wide for a chamber and yet here for example Republicans

Democratic governors secretaries of state and attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states\nWe got a lot of comments read about\nThe role of Republicans in gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current maps it's gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to stem their losses\nIsn't fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantaged but what what what do we know well\nThe Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and how they were Democrats that came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates back in twenty Seventeen\nThe way originally elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election uh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nA but but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which\nIs sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their gains in the U.S house of representatives uh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the there's no party is blameless in this\nUh gerrymandering started we get the word from a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts\nUh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal and members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those still existed today\nA is to win all the districts around it uh the a newspaper ... and in Boston took a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he was a gerrymander some ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning of the republic\nHum you could argue that some of this happened back in in a female and democracy back in you know the\nFive hundred BC uh but when we talk about today yeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south\nThat were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially in the state of Maryland uh there's one district or out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the lines and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes\nBoth parties do this Republicans have done it a more publicly lately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about\nA fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the winds aren't fair and therefore are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish the fact that that these lines may not be fair right but the people who who ... tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if you will\nWe do get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both sides of the aisle tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the GOP is going nuts in color\nScreaming on double you say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nThe fact that the these winds may not be fair but the the people who ... tend to be the ones who are not ... not holding the pencils if you will\nWe do get comments from folks on both sides we all complaining about how both sides we all tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the GOP is going nuts in Colorado over ballot initiatives to read just require a nonpartisan commission\nSlow deep tweeted I Wish this was such a hot topic back when Democrats in my state had districts in the shape of a pencil\nJoanne wrote on our Facebook page redistricting reform has been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court was a majority appointed by Republican governors that approved by the Republican legislators\nNothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislator branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership been killed by Republican chairman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and see so publicly\nKatie fishy I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had with folks are that you've been witness to folks kind of talking across the aisle about this does this feel practically\nTo you on the ground like a unifying issue\nYeah my experience really has been that um I mean in Michigan though we have had Democrats and Republicans control the line drawn process so maybe that helps but\nWe have volunteers who are Democrats Republicans independents and I think that what we've seen is that no matter which party is in charge in Michigan they're really common sense things\nThat we all looked to government to at least help provide basic things like clean water or roads that aren't falling apart um those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know there's also a Detroit is pretty gerrymander they try and pack a lot of Democrats into one district but there there are still Republicans do you live in those districts into their voices aren't heard\nOr because a lot of these races are happening in the primaries and we don't really have competitive elections at the statewide level of Michigan we're a lot of people talking about even if they're\nThe of fish all that is there um representative as the party they
