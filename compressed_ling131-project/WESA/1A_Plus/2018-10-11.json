things were asked to go out in front of crowd or for people and you often hear you know you need to be thinner or project slower or beat this or that are younger and at that moment with kind of all of this it was kind of all of us will have that moment it we can personalize it whether it's your interview or\nWhat have you and I think that was a part\nOf it has her what'd you think about that whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her no\nYes yes I mean and I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she's like this is my notes listening to me to take me as I Am and she worked at it\nYou know got tend to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and I thought it it kind of the ill\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that Ali billboard and he says we should have just made the whole billboard your nose\nThat thing about the comments about her nose is also a guy guys\nHonoring Barbra Streisand [laughter] and one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a exist and and thrive\nIn Hollywood as far as coming up the music industry it absolutely is a powerful comment on the music industry\nAs the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing has placed in time where this movie a space and time it's interesting to think about that\nBecause almost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's really no acknowledgement of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming playlists and um the major record labels having less\nPower than they used to so it's almost like we own fashion and its view of the music industry but only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really tackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also chime in but by the way for those who have not seen a star is born will not be seeing stars form of just kind of want to be in on the conversation she tells Bradley Cooper character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose your nose just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go into homes I Wonder how you view that commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie\nI felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art\nI also thought about pink\nWho's very much and invention of pop music but you also have this kind of rye cynical style style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that the view of the music industry in this film in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways is very linear it's a very linear idea of there is one\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nWas doing it and that was what made people love her\n[noise] [noise] yeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this film in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways is very linear it's a very linear idea of there is the one I'm rose to fame there is one path you just simply offend or D sand as opposed to\nThere is no suggestion that either one of them that he or she might have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like\nThat he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming\nWithout kind of going through that traditional path agree with and about that but I think\nThat um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them passed each other on this fame ladder and I think you kind of have to construct it that way and what you're saying about Lady Gaga you know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character talking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever\nIt is funny to see an artist's like Lady Gaga who has been so able\nTo make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean the funny thing about this movie is she is way more important to culture than he is um if you're talking about the real people so it's kind of funny to see\nHer big personality taking advice from you know Bradley Cooper without a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd and that way yeah\nExcept for the voicing rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diversion but you're right I mean he is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of\nThe story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley spend a lot of time sitting up\nThat first time meeting she was a piece of that moment from a star is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga

L. M. C. Morgan's referring to Patrice ... and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nHere so we think that the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book is that\nUh you know for those of us who were industry in Ferguson we are mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protests there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organized everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nAh it was organic there were a set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protests last and you have to remember\nThat we were the street for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend which is unfortunate that there's this narrative that it's that have come up that is a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized everybody the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true someone I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nOr four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend which is unfortunate that there's this narrative that if that has come up that is a race so many people that suggested there was like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized everybody the organization to that work\nAnd that's just simply not true so when I think about like how I use my platform hiding about my work\nIf I'm mindful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who were industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom\nWithout you wouldn't there would be no protests are so that is important to me and then the second part is that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that\nUh one of the important things about having a platform and access is that not only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people have sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names are in in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of a street together\nBut this narrative to death I guess most of the people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organization to like\nWhat the catalyst for the protest is just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that\nHave certain people sort of leaders should become more prominent\nWith the concern about but who profits off the cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast as a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nYes it's interesting I think I'm always shut eye you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the\nThe way the question gets asked to like it's public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end of ... a portion of all the pre order sales went to the N. double ACP legal defense funds that was\nPublic I did it because it was important and and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book right so like that's I think about the book specifically\nBut in general in the face like I'm mindful of this ... when we started campaign zero which is like our our biggest project started in twenty Fifteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of race for funding specifically because of the question that you asked\nSo over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars per year which is\nNot a lot of money and the grand scheme of non profit and we did it so that\nWe could just raise enough money to do the work that we that was important right so we created the first oh the database of police union contracts at first it public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really discreet projects [noise]\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not paid I don't know salary from the stuff so we try to do it as like\nWith just the bare necessities so that it's not just a question of like profit\nUh and with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany Sam and Clinton being part of it they get paid as a part of the ... because I think that that makes sense um and it's not like some you know huge moneymaker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to\nRely on a nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well ah\nAnd you know it's like I ...\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free friend\n... I think that that makes sense um and it's not like some huge money maker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to rely on a nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well and you know it's like I ...\nIn the way that I exist in the world right now is like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I don't have you know it's like I\nKnow a guy that and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like he was a really rough um it was rough\nAnd only it's only a couple of months ago was the first time and I'm actually lived alone since the protests I've ever since you've been saying in the basement of a like my second parents after the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not us you know wants to get married in the in the basement of their second parents that's not sustainable\nBut it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like there are these narratives of like oh I made ... and it's like well no you see me on the news you came in a pod cast you like see me out of an event that that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case of that I've had high incomes before and you know that that there were some income and wealth is pretty significant though\nUm some people have been like really confused by that\nBroadcast you're listening to of one this morning is paid for by listener contributions now obviously you can't give Joshua Johnson the money that's needed to keep all of that great time content coming from his studio\nBut we can do it for you that's how public radio works you make a contribution you stand by W E s say we turn around and we pay them to provide this great programming be part of it for one to six nine seven twenty nine fifty five online\nThat W E s said on FM\nGetting ready to go back to one day with Joshua Johnson Thirteen hundred dollars to raise between now and eleven o'clock that's twenty minutes or remember if you become a sustaining member current standing members will add five dollars a month to your contribution for the next year for one to six nine seven twenty nine fifty five W E S H ...\nW E s a U.S supported by the Pittsburgh dance council presenting a new work by Brazilian choreographer Deborah coker on Saturday October thirteenth ... theater inspired to buy a poem of the same name dog without feathers combines spectacle dance with projections by filmmaker cloudy awesome more information of trust orange dot org slash dance\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from progressive insurance offering a way to buy a home insurance with their home quote explorer tool custom quotes in rates are available online learned more progressive dot com or one eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\nFrom capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere capital one what's in your wallet capital one NA\nAnd from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nBack now to our conversation with to re McAfee is in his new memoir is called on the other side of freedom\nThe case for hope let's talk about some of the more personal aspects of your ...\nScreaming on WGN appointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu flash I I I\nCapital one NA and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nBack now to our conversation with the ... in his new memoir is called on the other side of freedom\nThe case for hope let's talk about some of the more personal aspects of your life that you describe in the book there's a short section in the book like page and a half\nWere you talk frankly about your mom leaving the family when you were a toddler and the fact that you never have asked her why she left\nA leader in the chapter you write code I'm mindful that we remember pain and trauma differently than we were a member of joy and triumphs\nWhen we remember pain we are trying to protect ourselves and cope with trying to order the memories in ways that will allow us to make it to tomorrow and the day after tomorrow unquote\nTalk about how those kinds of traumatic or difficult experiences as a kid kind of helped to shape you as an adult particularly an adult who would gravitate toward active as\nYou know it's interesting uh this is the first time I'm saying this because it just happened is that my mother read the book um and she texted me recently and it was I hate to re read the book we should talk\nAnd I just have it like having them with right back at so hopefully I write back soon\nIs one of the reasons why I wrote this chapter in the ... I can remember and now with us that and it's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter was that I Know that we walk into everywhere on bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what does it mean to be worthy that if she could leave it feels like anybody could leave\nAnd I like that is something I've had that sort of work within an grow with as an adult to make sure that that doesn't hurt me or other people and that's important as we think about what it means to organize has that like we're all walk into rooms and meeting people where they are part of meeting people where they are that we know where we are and like I think that that has to be like a\nA core part of it that the part that you read about like how we remember pain and I remember a joy is that for so many people you think about like the constraints would a million people who grow up in marginalized communities around his poverty race\nOr or any other after today identity they they learn the constraints really well I Know I knew how much money we had as a family man you would pass home and not to ask why new\nLike when we didn't have toys how to make fun outside and you know there are a lot of people talk about growing up poor but I said one of the hard part is like when we grow up and sometimes we still only see a world of constraint semi that can strength become so great and the way that we learn how to survive\nThat we can start to have a magic things beyond and if we're ever going to win like it'll be like a deep imagination that gets us to the other side\nAnd Mike eating whether they were seeing the right in the left is it the right has always re packaging old narratives for new time the left we're always engaged in the most intense make believe that like we're always trying to tell a story about a world that nobody's ever seen before but we know it's possible you've never seen health care for all but like you believe it you've never seen a world where every woman has a right to choose but like we believe that that's real\nAnd like telling those stories actually really hard and there's no way to to be really good storyteller by the future that you've never seen if you aren't able to tell stories about the world that you live and how you enter the world\nYou also share fairly late in the book the fact that you are a survivor of sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times at a rather young age\nAnd you connect that was what you call the client quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote I think about the quiet instead of the closet\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nFor sexual assault something that you write happen to you numerous times at a rather young age\nAnd you connect that with what you call the client quiet about the assault but also quiet about your own identity and your sexuality you've been out for some time in the book you write in part quote\nI think about the quiet instead of the closet because I've never seen any part of myself from myself or others you go on to write quote but I grew up quieter about the parts of myself that I didn't think anyone would love\nThe parts that I had never seen loved in others unquote how does that interact with the person you became\nYeah you know one of the reasons I was important for me to be out very very um [noise] I mean about for a long time but to be publicly out in a in a very\nSort of overt way when the protests began with like I didn't want any kid growing up who was also gay to think that the only way\nTo do this work publicly with to to be in the closet and ah you know that chapter started from this tweet that I wrote a long time ago that was like just because you didn't know that doesn't mean that whether we are like I was in the quiet and the closet\nAnd ah you know I I Walk into every room and the gay black man I'm like that is real to me it's important so there was no way for me to write a book about the work that we've done the work to all of us have collected with them and social justice or the work that we need to do without talking about a mile an identity\nNow I wrote about the the sexual assault because it was real it's one of the things that I haven't really talked much about I mean it's in the book now so it's not just you know it's not something that only I Know\nUm [noise] but it was like sort of\nIt was free in some ways to finally just they and like not have to tiptoe around it and not be ashamed to say that this happened and it was real and it was awful and\nYou know when I told when I when I finally taught a couple of years later they realized that he had actually been sexually abusing like a whole set of kids who are even younger than me um\nTo like you know speaking up actually made a difference in other people's lives and like that was important\nUm but I've had to like you know I write about in the book is that like my own relationship to my body I had to learn that had to learn what it meant to be in relation with other people and like it'd be one where we were periods and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right as I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlets actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out\nFrom most of my own career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian or gay journalist association\nOpposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like there's a whole different kind of being out because people are OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things\nAnd that changes the conception do you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know\nLet's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my ... and they have to be here you know like\nI think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave the bike and there's not one way right that they're not two ways to be gate and like\nThat's why the pride parade is really really all that like yeah so like sometimes it is the way rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is me just like going on a date and like that it and like those are both valid way to jump in and the identity that I Am right uh so so yeah there are definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I might not\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\n... like those white pride parade is really really all that like yeah so like sometimes it is the way rainbow shoes right and sometimes it is just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid ways to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there are definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like that I don't talk about gay issues is publicly as possible and like\nYou know it's one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life dry leaves like other people can feel like it's real re so like I Know that you know we're working with the research right now they're trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that\nIt's not that people when people don't get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of the results but that\nOr did they actually nervous about showing up at a facility and in cities that are that function of small towns in a nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with seeing like somebody's cars and a friend like that they actually are nervous about like what privacy really be private right and that like how do you actually or how do you set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I have I don't feel like I Need to talk about that every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cares about being gay right so the other thing out there that that some people who I can really homophobic but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your I hate\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bid for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to

Blacksburg he's the show runner of Netflix bow jak horsemen it just released its entire season for streaming and I've watched just about all of that fifth season a rough it let's talk about season five\nRight let's get into it getting dirty a big amount of season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner himself it there's a line out actually something along the lines of television as a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nAnd yeah I have to say a when that line came up at the table read it got a much bigger laugh and I was expected from the crowd of people over there\nI mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner on a press to her about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be unimpressed or talking about a ... a little bit it's\nIt's strange and you know one of the things we wanted to talk about we're putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so um\nAnd it it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius who you know touches a show and turned it into gold and it all just\nYou know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain um ... it's a very collaborative process and we have people making a better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast brings so much the designs by at least they had all the uh director is bring so much to the episodes of the the story board animators the editors um ... it really it takes a village um\nSo it's odd but yes I'm doing all these interviews now and talking about the show and talking about how I made the show because it's not how a TV show gets made at all and I think anyone\nWho presents that as how a TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word play the slapstick the ponds and the ... falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that runs throughout the season and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes\nHim it's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers so we can't help but make it funny\nUm but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season one of the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions we take it very seriously um\nYou know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and those guys are talking octopus or you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here uh but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other on the French go like the little rascals [laughter]\nUm so the story is quite serious ah but the stories themselves can be\nScreaming on WGN appointed by cranky

or a man that is clearly just a\nThree small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals [laughter] um so the story is quite serious ah but the stories themselves can be quite silly you know what one way I think of it is is we're telling stories about real grounded characters in the crazy cartoon universe lots\nOf animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adult as Beau jak or who to whom do you think you owe your origins in television ... who do you see is your for\nUm oh you mean by influencing yeah or do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show and not I mean\nThe shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them the shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American ... well I\nI think you know the obviously the the the giants as The Simpsons and I will be disingenuous for me to claim that\nThat show had had no influence on me or my show or the success of my show you know one at one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of the Simpson hum but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist\nOutside of the the bubble um\nOr the perceived bottle of animated TV you know I said ah we're going to say when we start season one you're going to watch it and the first is going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park\nBut then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening is going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men um and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really\nTake things seriously a in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak and he said they're credible Francis Carolyn sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat uh Internet a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there at some\nYeah I'm see them as one of the first people we cast [laughter]\nAnd I was cast her whale as a newscaster well uh we we had in the script to um you know a a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Lynda la montage and said I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role [laughter] really and we call them like yeah it sounds like fun\nUm and he's fantastic we keep bringing it back season after season\nAnd you know what am I a first memories of making a show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had him do all his lines um and then at the end result gray also get you making some whale\nNoises and you know this is\nKeith Olbermann who I thought it was a very serious man uh goofing around going\nYou know making whale noises I thought this would be a fun show I think well one of your other\nMain

thing we look for is neat printing\nNow my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was on a med school track years ago people were like yep we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of printing I as a cue cards I've seen her all written in all caps yes\nCorrect It's you know it's it's a this is it's a it's block lettering it's all caps um it's it's really about the spacing between the between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the spacing between the sentences\nIt's not something like I Can't just bring somebody off the street and say okay start doing your guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train it for like two or three weeks\nI'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn um two or three weeks of training yeah it it 'cause you 'cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you can just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just interviews ... these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these new things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalized only in certain words it's not capitalized than during whereas where how to end the card of courage to stand on a period or ... or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to end it so that it flows the next car just so many different rules where you can only learn it by by doing it and practicing it\nWe're speaking to Wally ... and the founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York\nOkay so let's say you're working for me for you know the late night with Joshua Johnson right and I come out to do my opening monologue I've just hired your company and I said Wylie I'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship\nTell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out how to be a good cue card vendor for me All right first thing I ask you how's your eyesight why near sighted or glasses\nOkay so you were a glasses were your classes on the show where you were a contact so we're not we're either\nI don't really like contacts hourglasses\nOkay so you're wearing a glass of so you can see fine I won't have to if you didn't wear glasses and you wanna wear contacts I could put your letters bigger so that you can see but that would also make less words and the card and it would make it harder for you to ... to flow to the ... like if you're taught especially if you're telling jokes\nSo I Would recommend glasses and contacts for you if you know if you want to so you're gonna wear glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we were we were to have her son's ride would practice with you if you've never read two cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you\nOr look directly at the cue cards don't look away because it'll that look like you're reading the cue cards\nHow do you mean it looked as regularly as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your bad leader\nAnd I had two cards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that you would want to play to those cue cards now if you were looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the car to the bad later the audience would be like oh he's obviously reading something\nBut if you just played those few charged it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the camera so yeah so I'll I we both is depending on where you are in position to the camera I'll make the cards the right the lettering the right side so that you look directly at that card\nScreaming on WGN pointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation in the town on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu slashed I I I\nJust played those few cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the camera so yeah so I'll I we were open depending on where you are in position to the camera\nI'll make the cards the right the lettering the right side so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nShow your cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction the the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper that's\nExactly right it's especially with Saturday Night live\nThat's what I that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day is block sketches and I'll be out there was one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put\nThe cards and I work with the director the stage managers wild well kind of can for and I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they knew that extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical working week at SNL look like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously unfilled eleven thirty five PM I Wish it were that a simple [laughter]\nNow we we start on Thursday we start rehearsals on Thursday and Thursdays a light day\nSo the music the musical group ... for the first half of the day and then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only ... one one set of each sketch because I have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more and it\nIt'll change from Thursday the sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely rewritten from Thursday and friday\nAnd then friday is the same process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process we print but then on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it ... the cards so it makes sense and then we I mean that we do that we don't have the we don't have the luxury of waiting until Saturday to dupe the friday sketches because Saturday show day\nSo everything's print that I have about eight people there on friday just yeah basically writing all day I have to find job I'm Out on the SAT blocking working with the actress having fun they're sitting underneath the bleachers from eleven o'clock to sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nAnd the
