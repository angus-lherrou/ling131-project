himself no thanks for the question we had the most groundbreaking progress when it came to fair housing during my tenure at hug you know for years decades of\nA different democratic administrations have been trying to get done something called the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule essentially this was part of the Nineteen sixty eight fair housing act\nUm that said the secretary of HUD had the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing the problem was that that had never been put into a rule on so in twenty Fifteen we actually came out with this rule which put teeth into the fair housing act by requiring cities that got\nA hug money basically taxpayer money to get more serious about ensuring they had ... equal housing opportunity in their community and I'm\nVery proud of it ah unfortunately that's one of the things that's been rolled back uh through a secretary Carson and the Trump Administration a second thing that we did that I was just fantastic for the folks who are able to benefit from it was something called connect home um\nThe vast majority of people living in public housing don't have access to the Internet at home\nAnd we know that you're having Internet access at home today is not a luxury anymore it's a necessity folks that are trying to look for a job kids that are trying to do homework and so on and so we actually created a a\nA public private partnership with Internet service providers housing authorities nonprofits to expand to extend broadband access to families living in public housing dean\nAt tweeted as past secretary of HUD what do you feel is the best way forward for affordable housing and how is Huck doing on this now\nWhile I Wish I could say I have more confidence in the direction of HUD right now um I think what you have over there is a whole bunch of\n'em a career employees that are dedicated to the mission that are trying to do the right thing but a political leadership that is not dedicated to the mission that wants to blame people for being poor you know secretary bank are yeah which I completely disagree with I think they've taken into the wrong direction\nI'm the best thing that can be done is is number one to invest the resources\nTo create more housing that is affordable to the middle class and of course to low income individuals are and\n... up and down the line from the ... the federal level state level and local level to do that and then also to work with the private sector in important ways for instance at the local level to figure out a zoning codes and planning codes to make affordable housing more develop all\n[noise] you spent some time in Iowa you were in Des Moines last week supporting Democrats there who are running for office and we know that President Trump's trade policies toward China are really hitting some farmers in Iowa pretty hard last month I was agriculture secretary Mike nags spoke to CNBC about what impact that that's having at home\nIt as we head

to CNBC about what impact that that's having at home\nWhile it as we head into the twenty eighth taint harvest season for corn and soybean out here in Iowa this escalation of the trade conflict really couldn't come at a worse time so it is impacting our markets and that's impacting our farmers so ah are farmers to understand that there are issues that need to be resolved particularly what China\nAre but there is no doubt that the retaliatory tariffs are impacting our marketplace and that's impacting our producer negatively\nThat's my next secretary of agriculture in Iowa speaking to CNBC I Wonder if you've been hearing what you've been hearing rather from farmers in Port producers and others\nIn agriculture as you're making trips through Iowa and and elsewhere are some of them okay what's the current state of relations the U.S China they understand what President Trump is trying to do and agree do they tend to be more posed what are you hearing\nHere a lot of concern a lot of worry and ah folks are also wondering what's the plan here uh you know I think a lot of folks are can believe that we can improve our trade relationship with China\nBut they think the president has gone about it are completely the wrong way in this go it alone style very radically starting a trade war that is going to hurt Iowa farmers they're also disappointed in their representatives are folks like Steve King right now that they felt feel have sat idly by\nA while the president has done this or David Young is another good example out there and so I heard a disappointment\nWith the leadership of of uh of some of those Republican congressional representatives and also tremendous concern because President Trump is so erratic when it comes to China\nNow my neck has spoken positively about the newly renegotiated NAFTA agreements between Mexico and Canada what about the trade deals that the president has been making in his time thus far particularly if you become president in twenty twenty and have to enter office with these deals as a starting point\nWe should always begin I'm from the premise that we want to ensure that our trade deals are good for American workers\nAh we also want to ensure of course that American companies who are engaged in trade are are treated fairly and uh that\nWe don't get taken advantage of and so I don't I don't think folks disagree with that I think what folks disagree with is how erratic Donald Trump has been and so you know in San Antonio we actually hosted in Nineteen Ninety two or Ninety three the signing of NAFTA\nAnd we know that there are states that have benefited more than others from NAFTA one of the challenges for this president and the next president is to strike trade deals that can benefit as much of the United states is possible [noise]\nWe've seen some of the benefits of trade deals in San Antonio we've had additional investment\nUh from auto manufacturing a to a number of on to other industries certainly along the border of Texas logistics warehousing\nI'm so Texas probably has been the biggest beneficiary of that\nWe always need to look at our trade deals for perspective the American worker and how they can benefit\nSo what do you say the workers though who understand where President Trump is coming from who say you know I appreciate the value of trade but I see what's

that folks can be successful in this twenty first century global economy\nUm we have to be smart because I Do think we can improve these trade deals these relationships at the same time uh we're far past the point where the United states is just going to close its doors and not be part of a global trade relationship\nUm so the question becomes how do we ensure that you and your family are well

U. dot ... before we move on from Medicaid read\nI I Do want to get your sense of kind of where this is going only one state Maine has approved for Medicaid expansion through the ballot box so voters in Maine voted for expanding Medicaid but the governor of Maine Paul the page still refuses to do so\nHe talked about his opposition to expanding Medicaid during the morning talk show on W. veal AM radio back in July here's part of what means governors said\nOr one thing I Know is nowhere to can force me to put the state and reading and I will not do that to tell them to go to jail before I put the ... the stage and read it and if that's the core tells me I have to do it then we're going to be going to jail\nThat's part of Maine Governor Paula pave speaking back in July and I read ... telling voters I'd rather go to jail can kind of feel like he's telling voters to go to somewhere else but how much of his political feet or I mean how's this going to ask\nWell a ... page is a he was sort of Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump he uh he was the loud and and bombastic candidate in a one two races that uh\nUh he probably shouldn't have won in the political sending that you know main is a pretty liberal state and\nI came into shake up the old order and that that's what voters elected in foreign uh now he is refusing to follow the will of the voters I'm In the Medicaid expansion will happen in Maine at some point ... just turned out this year or the Democratic candidate is leading and in most of the surveys that are that they're up there\nUm but now it has not happened yet and as a consequence of all the pages actions\nThere are thousands of people in in Maine who not only voted for this thing but voted for this thing and now don't have\nThe health care that they that they need it and this is a it's a problem in Maine especially in a community is that have been hard hit by things like climate change the lobster community in the in the northwest part of the state along the northern coast or is it has been pretty devastated and they work for very low wages and pretty dangerous jobs and\nA ... you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion let's shift\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nNeat and this is a ... it's a problem in Maine especially in communities that have been hard hit by things like climate change the lobster community in the in the northwest part of the state along the northern coast or is it has been pretty devastated and they work for a very low wages in pretty dangerous jobs and a ... you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion\nLet's shift gears and talk about the cost of prescription drugs an issue I think that everybody sooner or later have to grapple with now dozens of states pass laws this year\nThe aim to get rid of this kind of gag rule it prohibits your pharmacist from discussing prescription drug prices with you we spoke to one democratic state lawmaker about isn't about why he introduced new legislation on prescription drug pricing\nI Am representative Brian Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island and I'm In my thirtieth year as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection his doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he paid the retail price of the if you pay the retail price the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that there might be another option for you that other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would've been cheaper for me to pay those out of pocket\nRepresentative Kennedy learned that the pharmacy had a contract with a company called a pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that ... that prohibited the pharmacist from discussing this with customers\nKennedy and for the Democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban the so called gag clauses and the bill had not passed\nWe wanted to make sure that Rhode Island does have that opportunity to speak one on one with their with their pharmacists thin and learn what their their pricing options are because of that is consistently one of the big complaint so we hear from our\nConstituents on a on a regular basis is how expensive drug costs have become\nSo Scott Greenberg or we heard from representative Kennedy about what's going on in Rhode Island how common are laws like the one that he's pushing ... how many states have passed laws like this will\nBe these gag or clauses are are pretty common and uh last year there were a over a dozen states that [noise] excuse me took up legislation or\nHaving to do with these gag clauses um and actually just recently President Trump signed a bill outlawing these um gag clauses this was kind of low hanging fruit though of a\nOf a drug the drug prices issue a I don't think anyone like these gag clauses but uh\nYeah that that will be let federal legislation in the state bills won't change the fact that many many people struggled to pay for the prescriptions they need and um it's a very complicated issue and there are many states are taking other other steps to try to rein in prices\nSince you mentioned the president's he signed two bills last week as you noted that were designed to lift these guy clauses on prescription drug prices here is part of what the president said\nThe you know the lowest price active two thousand Eighteen and the patient right to know drug prices act and uh\nObviously based in the name you can tell that this gives people knowledge as to prices that different locations where to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact to a\nSchool the law of supply and demand pretty soon\nFried ... read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nTwo thousand Eighteen and the patient right to know drug prices act and uh\nObviously based on the navy you can tell that this gives people knowledge as to prices at different locations where to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact to a\nSchool the law of supply and demand pretty simple but we didn't have that they didn't want to have the thought of people didn't want to have that but now we have it then it's going to really drive prices\nScott ... back up to the bills that various states have signed on this California signed a few bills into law and there's a few weeks ago governor Jerry Brown signed them and these are considered among the strongest of these laws in the country ... what do they do\nWell I think the what a lot of states are doing in California or as is often the case with this kind of progressive legislation is and that is in the lead on this on California is trying to reduce drug prices through transparency in other words they are requiring um uh the drug companies to be public about a\nPrice increases increases beyond a certain point in the idea\nIs that uh if these are made public that they'll sort of be shamed into into reversing some of these increases it's still too early to say though whether this is going to have the desired effect um nevertheless other states this year California passed its bill or in two thousand Seventeen and last year you had five\nMore states um Connecticut Maine New Hampshire Oregon and Vermont all passed a drug pricing laws that are similar\nTo California so we'll see whether transparency is enough to reduce prices and then in addition to that um some states have tried to go even even further than that Massachusetts passed a bill that would've allowed a\nIts Medicaid program to exclude some drugs from the a formula and the the um [noise]\nUh the group of drugs that are available to Medicaid recipients and the idea was that this would give them some leverage when negotiating with a drug companies over prices if they were able to exclude some FDA approved drugs and and as of right now Medicaid state Medicaid programs have to include all\nYou know to find Dr is about paying for NPR programs that make your day more

our conversation with read Wilson Julie Rovner and Scott Greenberg are still time to get in a few more of your questions and thoughts about state health care policy where you live one a at\nW. A. M. U. dot org Julie let's get to that question from months in law who tweeted isn't part of the reason Medicaid expansion didn't get as good support is that it wasn't available as quote unquote GAP insurance for those whose employer plan\nHas a high deductible well of course the people who haven't employer plans with hijacked our our big problem in the lower income people of those have a particular\nLarge problem if you have many thousands of dollars in deductible so you have to pay before your insurance kicks and there are a couple of small demonstration programs where Medicaid has been able to ah basically filling with employer insurance but generally Medicaid has sort of an all or nothing proposition you're either on Medicaid or you're off\nThe way they Affordable Care act which created with those people up to a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get 'em medicated people between a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty and two hundred and fifty percent of poverty get special discounts they don't have those big deductibles so it it and then over two hundred and fifty percent of poverty then you're sort of on your own\nI'm In Arkansas I might point out though another we've been talking about a lot of different program that they instituted was to help people who often who were right at that margin we're constantly shifting back and forth\nBetween Medicaid and private plant and basically what they would do is they say it was a lot to basically buy them into the private plans and they wouldn't have to keep changing\nWhere to eat sidebar for just a second let me the the point of the series to this is talk about what states we're doing on big issues healthcare is a very big one it's one of the very\nDreaming on WGN appointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu slashed I I I\nArgued and we're constantly shifting back and forth between medicate and private plant and basically what they would do is they say was allowed to basically buy them into the private plans and they wouldn't have to keep changing\nWhere to eat sidebar for just a second let me to the point of the series is to talk about what states we're doing on big issues healthcare is a very big one it's one of the very first things that Donald Trump said he was going to act on when he became president repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act AK Obamacare\nThere are some people who feel like health care should be a national matter that every human being in the United states of America should have equally good plan was simple set of health care costs and there are other Americans who believe it should be left up to the states that every state has different kinds of needs and different issues and there needs to be versatility\nAre we any closer to one side of this argument winning or is the state federal split just kind of baked into the nature of this country like where is this where is this going Julie\nActually it's where it's going is back to where it was before the Affordable CARE Act what we're finding from all these sort of small incremental changes\nThat the Trump Administration has done is that the Affordable CARE Act was intended\nTo create more of a national floor if you will for health insurance states still do an enormous amount of regulation of how can they always have the federal government has always been sort of at\nThe junior partner to the states um but it had gotten so such a patchwork that it made huge differences which state you lived in what kind of healthcare you were able to get to the Affordable CARE Act was trying to say\nThere's a floor beneath which people won't fall that is slowly being chipped away and we're going sort of every month looking more and more like we did in two thousand nine before the Affordable CARE Act passed\nScott do you get the sense that this means that the effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is kind of succeeding that it is taking us back to where we were before as\nWell as Julie said it is in some states but in states that want to go in a different direction again to California Massachusetts states like that\nThey're re instituting some of the uh parts of the Affordable CARE Act that the Trump Administration has and the Republican Congress have tried to undercut so for example a on the individual mandate the requirement that you have insurance um\nSo called association health plans which are these cheaper plans that do not a ... an offer all of the benefits that were mandated under the AC a some states are saying well whatever they're joined the federal level um insurance is regulated at the state level and if you're going to sell insurance in our state you are going to abide by these rules\nI'll tell you one issue read that states and many people have been hoping the federal government will act on and it's the it's kind of moved on anyway and that's dealing with medical marijuana it's on the ballot in some states again this year about twenty two states have already legalized pot for medical use some of legalized for recreational use\nVoters in Utah will choose whether to join the states are not ... and the political battleground seems to have shifted and I want to read if you see it this way for more traditionally liberal states into more conservative areas over ...\nOh yeah and it's not just the medical that has gone that way but also legalization of recreational marijuana the two states where a legalization is going to be on the ballot this year is in Michigan in North Dakota\n... ... you know for ... racial noted for in in on the medical side there are three different amendments in Missouri which is nice and confusing for the voters out there to try to figure out\nWhich is which ah and then the Utah is as you say on the ballot Oklahoma already approved it this year so yeah we're we're not talking about the liberal coastal elites that are legalizing marijuana ah we're talking about a red America that is now dealing with\nFree ... read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nSide there are three different amendments in Missouri which is nice and confusing for the voters out there to try to figure out\nWhich is which are and then that Utah is as you say on the ballot Oklahoma already approved it this year so yeah we're we're not talking about the liberal coastal elites that are legalizing marijuana ah we're talking about a red America that is now dealing with this debate or it came up and you know in Florida last year and\nLast year two years ago um but this is this is now a debate that I think it shows the shift in the political conversation around marijuana those sorts of people who approve of\nA marijuana legalization tend to be\nA older white males funny enough\nAnd then the millennial generation that the younger the basically the younger you are the more you in favor of\nA legalization you happen to be um the older white males the theory is that's the that's the sort of libertarian streak or they don't want the government regulating something that\nThey don't think the government has a hand in regulating and the real swing voters or perhaps not surprisingly come down to suburban women are in talking to the people who run campaigns for and against marijuana legalization or basically the battleground is a bit of mothers who are worried that their kids are going to be exposed to marijuana\nSo you hit the proponents are talking about the law enforcement to ability and ended the fact that not that this will not expand the market into younger people who will have to have access to recreational marijuana and then you've got the opponents who say exactly the opposite that legalization will in fact\nUh begin to rope and a bunch of kids why are there are three items in Missouri so they're all on the ballot from different ah proponents different sides of it with two of them are from a actual the citizen groups that they put them on the ... amendment to an amendment three and then there's a proposition which I if I'm wrong I think the proposition\nGoes on the ballot from the state legislatures that's going to be some kind of\nCompromise or a piece that's proposition see 'em and they are all sort of competing with each other and this underscores another piece of\nThe evolution of of marijuana politics pots big business or in a lot of these states that have legalized Colorado Washington Oregon a California Nevada Alaska or Massachusetts and Maine\nUh the people who are setting up a ... who get to write these laws\nAlso essentially get to determine who's in the market um and who owns a very lucrative space one of the biggest opponents of recreational legalization in a bunch of early states where the people who ran medical marijuana shops because they already have the monopoly right why
