A. M. U. dot org\nAdam or go see a before we move on to our next story I Wonder if you could respond to that tweet from Michael that reads this just further reinforces that people solely look for media that confirms their already set beliefs how do we break out of this show people that does you disagree with are still human Adam\nBoy uh I don't know [laughter]\nI think uh the technologically enabled a fracturing of media is a really really significant factor in the status of our public life right now on the other hand I'm not sure that it's the causal agent um it might be a corollary uh\nI think that um you know we can talk all day about the norms of civic discourse breaking down but a nice that's very real trend are actual substantive policy disagreements between Americans differences in fundamental values\nThat are really really wide and were perhaps paper over for a lot of years by the media mano culture and now we're able to see them for what they are\nI Am personally kind of amazed that more political violence doesn't happen in the United states given the depths\nOf these differences um I don't think it's just in how we talk and who we're talking to and who were listening to I think a lot of what we're experiencing hears about fundamental differences in what we believed to be important in life and what we want government to do ... we\nHad fundamental differences forever in what we believe in but I think\nThis increase in rhetoric I think I'm demonizing people making people your enemy making and then he was the enemy of the people had made a difference and I think that people don't generally talk to each other anymore there's not enough people that go up I mean I\nBecause of because I'm a report I talk to everybody but I Will ask people did you vote why did you vote who did you vote for people don't talk anymore they look at their phones and they are in their little bubble\nAnd Eugene I think it's important to note that and I don't know if you encounter this working for the Washington Post but certainly I Do on a program that's on it\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the town of a free press\n[noise] listen to I mean I understand the idea about the division but if you hate NPR so much how do you know what we sat on one aid to criticize us if you ate the Washington Post so much how do you know what it was printed there to criticize\nYeah and quite frankly I think that that a behavior is exemplified most\nFrom the president himself who really hate CNN but seems to watch a lot of it\nUm and and I I'm blown away by how many people are are engaging that's who don't want us to do what it is that we're doing and and it's unfortunate because I think we are a meat criticism or the media needs to be criticized we need to be held accountable but we need to be criticized well so that we can serve the public better\nWe're going to keep moving from the story again just a quick caution as you listen to the coverage of this story over the weekend the please just remember the stories moving really really fast we're going to try really hard not to jump to any conclusions\nAbout what has happened there already been some details of the story that had been clarified or walk back so that is common in a fast moving breaking story like this keeping your on your NPR member station for the latest and an eye on NPR dot org\nA few more of your comments before we move on\nMatt emailed if Trump is responsible for the bombs are Democrats responsible for the shooter at the Republicans baseball team practice both of these statements are untrue bleed mass referring to the the congressional baseball game in which Republican Congressman Steve ... beliefs of Louisiana was injured\nPhilip emailed the suspicious packages may have originated in Florida but the perpetrator or perpetrators tours are not necessarily based there the Unabomber lived in Montana but traveled to Utah and the bay area to physically male his devices in order to deceive law enforcement\nAll right let's keep moving on with some other stories and if the story continues to move in the next few minutes we'll certainly let you know but let's talk a little bit more about politics particularly with President Trump's he was at a rally this week in Houston and he made headlines for a different set of remarks listen [noise]\nThat wants to do well frankly not caring about our country so much [noise] you know what we can make\nAnd really we're not supposed to use that word you know what I Am I'm a nationalist sub [noise]\nUsing Scott I Wonder if we can get to a clear definition of this term sheer what exactly is a nationalist I mean there's this ... is it typically consider to be what President Trump says it is\nAnd and me there is a global if I'm a according to President Trump to to be charitable or a nationally it's it's just someone who put America First um but the reality is anyone with a is a historical context of nationalism knows that and it's a worldview\nEmbraced on other rising uh that has led to um you know genocide and violence and separating people not like yourself a\nFrom a ... that would give them rights that uh we we deem a central and important to human beings um and so a Trump you know early in his campaign I'm really distance himself from ... the term national that's when we saw a Steve Bannon associated with it primarily because\nUh the ... the form of nationalism that was most a familiar with a band\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friend\nIn um you know sweep Europe and I even hate groups in the states um and so it's it's been it's been deemed by most people to be problematic to see Trump embrace it I'm wild misrepresenting it put him on the receiving end up significant criticism\nAdam reduce the I'd love you to chime in on this I Know that you are a stickler and rightly so for precision in language and I wonder what your take is on the use of the word nationalist versus said patriots\nParticularly because words like nationalist often heard in in phrases like white nationalism global list has connotations of being anti Semitic give us parse the words parcel language for us here\nI mean I think Eugene has already done a pretty good job of that I'm a I'm a little bit mystified by this whole story um the ... the idea that for President Trump to say hey I'm a nationalist is remarkable is kind of nuts to me um\nAmerica First his ... secondary campaign slogan is a perfect crystal ... of nationalism it's\nFor him to put a label on it is I think totally and consequential it would be like if President Trump got in front of a group of people and said hey my hair is kind of weird\nWill die we all know that um I suppose it's sort of remarkable that you said it but you know it's it's it's a truth is right in front of us I think a lot of why the comment has gotten the attention is that yes I'm as Eugene said um nationalism has a really really bad track record in the twentieth century of leading the genocide\nOn all things considered from

explore we're Ninety forty five ... say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nThat podcast let me come to you wonder what you think of the overall message of Tim Cook speech the c._e._o. of apple we heard him refer to the data industrial complex which has been a phrase it's been quoted fairly often in the days since he spoke kind of\nHarkening back to that idea of the military industrial complex the prison industrial complex ... what did you make of of cooks remarks\nI thought these were really strong words and coming from a taxi or perhaps the strongest we've seen so far now ... what he didn't say in that speech was he didn't mention Google he didn't mention Facebook\nAnd that's the hats because I mean while he doesn't want to go that far but but also because apple is a business is quite different from Google and Facebook apple doesn't it's not in the the uh the ad tracking business the way Facebook and Google both are\nBut I think what all of these companies know collectively is that whether they like it or not regulation of some form of some form is is on its way it's coming and so at some level of the other they have all endorsed uh GDP are which is Europe's data protection bell\nAnd I think they're beginning to imagine that some version of that will at some stage be implemented in the United states and the only question that is is what kind of language will be in that what it will then tail\nAnd and and and I think what cook has tried to do in the speech again very strong words in his visit to Europe is to try and come out ahead of it knowing that this is going to happen anyway to try and appear to be one of the uh the tech support as a of a potential data privacy laws in the United\nStates we should be clear also GDP are as the general data protection regulation it's this\nEdu area law that protects the privacy the data privacy of individuals within the EU or even the export of their personal data outside the e you if you've noticed re in the last few months that a lot of the Web sites you go to have had these pop up saying\nHey we use cookies on this website we maybe try your information click here to accept\nThat was those websites complying with GDP are that's why they all had to begin putting those pop ups on those sites another story about privacy that caught our attention the British newspaper the telegraph\nPublished an investigation on Tuesday into a wealthy businessman who was accused by multiple employees of racist and sexist mistreatment the story had the headline the British me to scandal which cannot be revealed\nThat's because the accused was granted an injunction against the newspaper to prevent it from publishing his name but then this happened at Britain's house of lords\nOr feel it's more juicy under parliamentary privileged to blame for green as the individual in question given that the media for being subject to an injunction preventing publication of the full details of his story which is clearly in the public interest\nWas the voice of lord pain or Baron the hand of nice in the British house of lords using British parliamentary privilege\nTo name the billionaire at the center of this story Michael Goldfarb what's behind this what makes this such a big deal it sounds like it's kind of an example of clear example of the very significant differences between\nFree speech laws in the u._k. and in the U.S\nWell that's certainly part of it just for you in in this particular case I'm having a parliamentary privileges is pretty\nUnique tool you can say things in\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nLibel actions and Peter hand was a working he'd been approached by some of the women who had spoken to the Daily Telegraph this this guy a Phillip Green is you know a fairly typical contemporary entrepreneur yet he was a night to bite Tony Blair for services to retail is set

was\nSexually harassed people and\nLike Harvey Weinstein when when he settled up\nThere were no disclosure clauses inserted into the settlements\nAnd the difference of course is that in the U.S New York times and the New Yorker can report that Harvey Weinstein is this and that and you know the details who can't get because of these non disclosure agreement so at least we know his name and here in Britain it's something else\nYou know moving oh go ahead Michael go ahead no no because I could go on about this guy forever and I wonder\nWhat they're doing it on\nI was just gonna say it's an interesting case really because of the way that the British laws are structured to say to have that that this this question which is the greater good here right because this is a\n... the me too
