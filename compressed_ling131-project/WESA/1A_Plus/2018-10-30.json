back to Thomas comments on Facebook Tommy writes\nOne speech is free and in the open people get pushed back when it is driven underground it is giving legitimacy and leads to action\nOne of the sites that has made news lately is this social network called gab dot com which I don't think a lot of people had heard of before this incident what what can you tell us about gab\nAnd the kind of online footprint that Robert Bowers had there so\nUh ... dot com is a sort of a basically a Twitter cologne um and it is was created under the premise of a maximalist free speech beliefs so the idea was a lot of you know racists bigots [laughter] we're getting kicked off of Twitter\nUh for for violating Twitter's community standards are\nAnd gab with sort of a a another refuge for them a place where you could say anything because we believe in the you know eat the absolute power of of free speech but when it ended up happening with gab is at it it became a cesspool it became a place where only these sort of worst people would go to express ideas that\nAre that we're really not tolerated elsewhere because they were hateful because they were angry I became it it has become a\nA place where white nationalism a and an extreme or bigotry homophobia whatever ah has has been embraced and and\nAnd this was a place where the the Pittsburgh shooter I'm not going to say at his name was maybe not radicalized necessarily but but certainly able to express and have an audience for a lot of his I truly hateful views it was the last place where he\nHad posted before the shooting 'em and it seems that it was it was sort of a\nA N unproductive venture for a lot of that hatred I'm an after\nAfter um after it was clear that the shooter had been an active participant on gab there was a lot of push back a lot of people who are coming in realizing this for the first time a note noticed that at that at this place is a dark\nPlace to incubate a lot of awful ideas gab responded saying our words are not bullets in social media posts a have a body count at zero sort of saying that you know this free speech is different from from action\nAnd I started when they did they actually say words are not bullets anyone who says that should go read the declaration of independence\nWith it you know what's interesting about this and this is something that happens a lot of free speech communities on line that they don't really believe necessarily for speech but just in being able to say anything outrageous I is it actually shows that that that the owners of gab\nDevalue speech to a degree if they believe that it has no consequences then then there's sort of this you know this odd warped understanding of why protected so hard if it means nothing um and and I think that that is something that that a lot of people don't quite grapple with especially on the Internet\nRabbi Jacobs I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like Gavin get us off the only place where this kind of speech proliferate San line it is worth noting since our program one a is named after the first amendment a quick First Amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes\nCurtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but

looks like you\nSure it will first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true I've seen how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to speak to such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to

Q. people against immigrants refugee is et cetera\nAnd what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported and embolden from the very top when the president of the United states that the white nationalists see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the left who is in charge we have somebody on the right who is the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist the racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign out before the election\nIn which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power and the United states which of course trap the taps into very old anti Semitic tropes ... and so we\nYeah and it was a ...

A. M. A. U.\nDot org again across America at W. A. M. U. dot org\nToday we're looking at a surge in early voting across America with the help of three stations we're partnering with\nZoe Clark is the program director at Michigan Radio in Ann Arbor Michigan she's also the co host of its program it's just politics so we welcome Joshua joining us from Kate UNC public radio in Greeley, Colorado north of Denver is reporter Michael ... Michael glad to have you with us\nHi Joshua and joining us from Kate M. U. W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas is report Brian grim it Brian ... glad to have you with us I happened to be here too by the way our other three partner stations for one a across America or W. B. H M public radio in Birmingham, Alabama\nMinnesota Public radio and Houston Public media and we look forward to hearing more from them in the weeks and months to come but let me start with the three of you in Michigan Colorado in Kansas\nWith regards to early voting in your state particularly accounting for absentee ballots mail in ballots and so forth and so a court in Michigan let me start with you what's early voting look like in Michigan\nRight so we actually are seeing an increase over last mid term elections I Want to kind of do apples to apples instead of apples to oranges has an election just because of turnout is higher here in Michigan as it is across the country during the presidential election so we are comparing to twenty fourteen\nTwenty four can we add six hundred and eighty nine thousand requests for absentee ballot we are now almost at one point one million as of October twenty seconds like sixty percent increase here in this day\nMichael do you want to what about in Colorado what's early voting look like they're\nWell it's too early to tell us so far but a big a flood of ballots have already come in about six hundred Nineteen thousand of them\nAnd more expected this morning we have male voting here and people can register all the way up until election day and on election day and um uh it's it's too early to tell but there is a strong turnout so far\nUm and it mirrors or what your guest earlier was talking about um the Republicans are tend to be a voting early but I'm over the past week or so I'm the I'm Democrats are starting to um get their ballots\nAnd Brian ... what's Kansas look like with early voting\nIs falling out of those those national trends there's a there's there's so many of the counties across the state of reporting a record or near record turnout especially in some of the more populated areas they Hispanic and particularly when it comes to early voting you know\nA ... they're saying requests in in one of the most populated county Johnson county by near Kansas City ah they've had requests for more than forty thousand advanced voting ballots\nLet me stick with you how does early voting work in Kansas to people tend to find it easy accessible or there are a lot of hoops to jump through\nPeople are there are a lot of hoops to jump through out of Kansas handle voting early\nWell it depends on the county I think it's it's a county by county the way they decide um\nObviously how many polling places are open where those polling places are uh you can also request a ballot to get in the mail so vote by mail isn't the common way to do it but if you would like to do that you can request that you can get it sent out\nUm it's so it's it's kind of reasonably are open to people who'd like early votes I'm here in the county that I'm In and in Wichita, Kansas uh we've had early voting now for a week or starting today they've opened a few more locations for early voting so they're trying to make it\nI'm somewhat accessible to to to voters would like to pick that option\nWe heard from some of you in Kansas Colorado in Michigan about early voting\nA critical mass tweeted I voted I Am in Colorado we have early voting and mail in ballots mailed to us early it's very easy to research candidate amendment or proposition at leisure while completing the ballot Michael would you respond to a critical mass in Colorado how's ... how this early voting work\nWill uh basically you get your ballot in the in the mail they mail it to you um you you got to do a lot of research in Colorado is your is a very full ballot and um you go through the subjects one by one it's great because\nUh you can really sit down with it and um do your homework um you know have a micro brew we love that here in Colorado and fill\nOut that ballot and then um get it off in the mail or\nOr some other kind of relaxing recreational or limit on kind of a cup of tea my whatever you want a bird with\nExactly um you know and so uh you know a lot of people I'm like this system in Colorado but not everyone um you know that it ... the world is full of procrastinators so um there are people who wait until the last minute and at this point\nI'm a you know the secretary of state's office is saying if you haven't mailed in your ballot already um now you got to think about a delivering it by hand or just going in on election day in voting\nI'm Glad you brought that up Michael that's probably something that everyone who lives in a state with early voting are male and voting should bear in mind that there is a certain cut off\nBy which your ballot has to be received November six times and I I don't know how it is for\nYour three states but every state I've lived in election day is the day your ballot has to be in not just the day that your ballot has to be in a blue mailbox so that is something I Want to remind whatever state you're in your ballot has to be in an election officials hand\nOn election day not a postal carriers hands on election day glad to get some of your comments as to why you do or don't like voting early\nMitch tweeted I don't vote early details may change through election day I Want my vote to be cast exactly as it should be since there are no do overs or take backs\nRachel is in Fayetteville, Arkansas and Rachel emailed I Love the convenience of early voting I don't have to worry about long lines or work or travel on election day that would prevent my voice being hurt\n... tweeted no early voting for us in Michigan we can vote absentee if you're willing to lie about the reason why you're not able to vote in person on election day ... do you have to lie to vote early and\nFor all practical matter is yes so basically how it works in Michigan is if you want an absentee ballot you have to basically say that you are going to possibly be out of town let's say a and there are folks that go and say should be out of town\nAnd and lie at their office in other ways that you can get absentee\nAround the state that that folks do just say you know what I'm going to be out of town just take to get an absentee ballot\n... what is being over sixty has to do with voting early\nUh possibly can make it easier right so let's say you're over sixty years old and maybe the idea is that there are long waits let's say for example in the city of Detroit it's going to be cold and maybe the idea is that if you don't want to Seventy\nEight year old having to to sit outside let's say in a wheelchair for three four hours and wait to vote so that is one a one way that that you can get an absentee ballot\nThe other question becomes internal need one of those guys were guys that day\nReconnecting with your faith after it's been shaken by the unsinkable that next time on the take away

W. public radio in Wichita, Kansas today we're introducing won a across America\nWill be spending the next two years traveling to communities across the country that don't tend to play an outsized role in national elections before them come come back to ... let me get to a few more of your comments Linda tweeted I voted in Hamilton County Ohio over a week ago no lines was fast and easy\nCounty is in Illinois and county wrote on our Facebook page I'm choosing to vote on election day because I bring my children and want them to see and feel the import of this right\nAnd Melissa tweeted I loved to vote in person I enjoy seeing all of the people getting out to the polls and making their voices heard\nThere's only I Love you to react to a message that one of our listeners since we're app when vox pop from Michigan and told us three reasons that he's voting this year and all of his reasons for voting after you do with voting\nI show up for Michigan where all three branches of government or a Republican controlled and have been for a number of years\nThe main driver of my voting this year or two constitutional amendments\nThat try to rectify the Republican attempt to suppress or control election participation proposal aims to put ... district thing in the hands of a nonpartisan commission\nThe other makes registering to vote easier makes apps and a team voting

through the ... what would you say the trucks call is that a kind of reflected in why a number of Michigan are voting this year\nWell let's say yes that I mean there he is speaking of that proposal to which is a redistricting as he is\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAnd that would allow no excuse absentee voting earlier of course we're talking about whether you have to lie or not to to get an absentee ballot that would change how that works um [noise]\nYes uh particularly a prop too which would create this independent commission has just sort of taken the state has been a barn storm of a\nA ballad I Am most ballot initiatives like one would like to think right that it's some people some community folks who are like we want to change the law in Michigan let's gather together and let's go you know get enough signatures and put it on the ballot no no no that is not usually how it works in the state usually a\nOrganization some kind of a political organization pays\nFor signature sometimes a dollar two dollars per signature to get questions on the ballot but um this voters not politicians as prop to\nChanging redistricting a young woman Katie Fay he's twenty eight years old when she started this all grass roots organization got four hundred fifty thousand signatures\nAgain grass roots volunteers to get this question of redistricting on the ballot and this is just sort of fascinated both voters and political watchers in general\nYou've heard from a number of you who are reacting to some of these initiatives in Michigan pat emailed in Michigan seniors over sixty are allowed absentee ballots I Love not having to stand in line at the polls\nThis year a referendum called promote the vote is on the ballot which would allow anyone to use an absentee ballot too many people having trouble getting to the polls on election day\nAnd John emailed I live in Ann Arbor Michigan I voted with an absentee ballot for the first time this year I Do so because I'm volunteering as an election inspector this year\nI'm also working with the voters not politicians group and supportive prop too which is passed will make Michigan one of only a handful of states with fear of voter district de\n... what's the the kind of the split in terms of who is supporting these measures and who is opposing them is it kind of a partisan split or do Michigan understand the kind of agree that the time has come for this how how does that shake out\nWell I mean again if you're going to take this idea that this grassroots organization that four hundred and fifty thousand signatures one would portend that that is going to create some turn out on election day or for folks who got absentee ballots I'm\nBut you you have seen the Michigan chamber of commerce which tends to lean towards conservative Republican candidates ah come out against a proposal to you've got the freedom fund which is um\nI I get money from other device organization just last week up putting one point two million dollars against proposal to again this is about redistricting\nProposal three though which is to promote the vote which would allow an shrine I should say straight ticket voting automatic voter registration same day voter registration and no excuse absentee voting\nWe really haven't seen a a organization full and wholeheartedly come out against this proposal because for many folks are not only are these popular ideas but\nA majority of states in the country twenty seven states in DC all allowed no excuse absentee voting\nMichael do you want to let me come to you as another proposition that seems to be energizing voters in Colorado and that might affect other races Jennifer's in Colorado and she left his voice mail explaining her view on prop one twelve listen\nOne twelve on our ballot this year would increase the distance between new oil development and any building that is designed for human occupancy it would increase it to twenty five hundred feet which is less than half a mile\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... say ...

Kansas that's suburb of Kansas City the goal is to attract what he calls thinking Christians with little or no engagement in their faith\nToday it has more than twenty thousand members across four campuses it's considered one of the most influential mega churches in the nation\nPastor Hamilton says that he has observed deep divisions within his congregation that reflect the nation's divides what's his plan to get people of faith thinking differently\nWe discussed it this summer when we were both in Aspen, Colorado for this year's Aspen Ideas festival here is the first part of our conversation Josh what's great to be with you today thank you\nDescribe your congregation to United Methodist church of the resurrection in leave would Kansas or tell us about your company\nThat sure we'll leave it as a suburb of Kansas City we've got four campuses throughout Kansas City is a downtown Kansas City Missouri was friends with her in a couple and the Kansas on\nAnd it's a very diverse congregation it's a highly educated largely a highly educated we have um we did a poll that long ago we found out that forty nine point two five percent of our people are Republicans and fifty point seven five percent of our people are divided between independents and Democrats\nThe Republicans are divided between conservatives and ... you know conservatives on social issues and those were moderate progressive on social issues but conservative fiscally\nBut Democrats are largely moderate to a progressive and the independence of divided between Republican leaning independents and democratic leaning independent so we ever were pretty divided congregation and I think we represent the country you know fairly well they're kind of divided within divisions dish exactly that's exactly right and so it's an interesting thing when you come you know you have to as a religious leader\nSpeak about the issues that are happening in the world you know I constantly have not constantly but I regularly get emails from folk saying well you know you're being too political I Wish you wouldn't talk about politics and\nAnd I have to say okay wait a minute I'm not standing endorsing candidates I'm not even talking about the candidates but what you're calling politics I'm calling ethics and morals and values when we're talking about\nJustice issues we're talking about\nPeople who are being hurt we're talking about moral issues we're talking about and and so if you think about what forms your politics what is it is it just thirty second soundbites on you know in radio spots or TV spots for a campaign or is it a deeper\nSense of spirituality in a deeper sense of the meaning of life and why we're here and and surely I pray that\nWhen you're doing your politics\nYou're doing that through the lens of a deeper moral system in the value system\nHow much do you as a as a pastor as a minister lean into the political debates\nAnd a religious lens on them as opposed to trying to have times where you may be lean away from them like I imagine there are some weeks where you say let's just do a sermon on you know tithing earlier I just do a sermon on this story of the garden to be anything but politics yeah\nSo here's a so for the folks who are upset by it they feel like I'm doing all the time\nBut here's the way I Try to look at it is um if I were reacting to the news stories every week and in particular in the ... than the Trump era there's always some you know big thing that's happened in the last week I Would be rewriting my sermon every ... every Saturday\nBased on what happened in the news that week and then probably Sunday Morning and and again probably sending morning and so what I've set is and that's not how I'm going to do this I outlined my sermons a year in advance you know actually I have ideas for two years in advance and yet somewhere in the midst of those is preaching on these themes the things that are happening in the news are going to come into play\nBut my ... isn't that I mean I I think people are hearing so much news all the time and so much political rhetoric and so much divisiveness that when they come to a church I'm not sure they always need one more\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... say it's for NPR News they found a free friend\nIs carefully choosing where one of the moments when I Need to say something this is this has to you know something has to be said when there's a school shooting and even then there are so many school shootings I'd be preaching about school shootings too you know or violence in in our society so I said we're going to talk about that a couple of times this year but I'm not going to talk about it every Sunday\nI Try to build into the ... into the year at least one sermon series is going to be focused on Christian ethics the entire series we're going to look at one of the issues that were that are dividing us or one of the issues we're facing in our society and then we're going to take a look and see how you know for it to be a sermon and not just a an ethical electing a lecture on ethics\nWe're gonna look to see how the scripture speak into this how does our faith shape our response to these things and when I Try to do the pressure I tried to take us to say okay I Know we are divided about these things I'm I'm gonna try to help you see things through the eyes of the other and so we are going to try to understand what might be the truth in this complex moral issue that this one side has\nWhat does this side of bringing to the tables were having this conversation and I'm going to say now\nYou know with all the humility I can muster you can disagree with me but this is how I see this issue right now I could be wrong but as I say this issue right now [noise] gun guns is a is a great example of this and uh recently I've preached the sermon on gun violence in schools at the sermon on a on gun control and and gun legislation that a year ago [noise]\nAnd as I did that you know I've surveyed the congregation and laid out some basic common sense kind of measures that wants to take to um to address the prevalence of guns and how easy access to them and and it was interesting how how many people agreed on both the left and the right on some of these basic things\nNow that sounds like potentially risky ground because it begins to get out of spirituality in actual policy yeah uh\nIt does actually so so here we are talking about what would what would we as people of faith how how might we respond\nTo you know the issues of shootings in school so the shootings in schools is the presenting or just violence our communities as a present an issue\nAnd so and obviously there's no guns in the Bible but there are swords and spears so he got plenty of plenty of places where we talk about how do we respond to people who are our enemies we've got Jesus saying love your enemies we've got\nPaul talking about you know doing good to those that would harm you you know you've got a lot of things you could [noise] so so there's a part of that that's going to be about those basic biblical principles but then there's going to be another person that's going to say so are there any solutions and is there any way that we as people of faith\nOn the left in the right can come together to find some solutions and in the end we found that more than two thirds of our people who were gun owners agreed with us or you know we lifted up four or five basic things that people said yes that that makes sense\nAnd in the end you know part of all we did as I said you know\nFor those of you know it's easy sometimes in the ... in the world around us to think that those people are and they are in RA are all gun toting nuts\nBut I I have friends and people who I Love dearly who are in the in our and they love to hunt and they're not gun toting nuts and they grieve every time there's a shooting the school\nOn the other side you know you've got the these aren't people who want to take all your guns away these are people who want us to figure out we've got we've got to do something we got it can be so when you can when you can treat both sides as human beings and you can help them hear each other it opens the door to finding answers\nDoes your congregation want from its religious experience at our church do they want a place to deal with the social issues\nThat they want a refuge from the politics of the day do they just want you to stick to the scripture or do they want you to be more prophetic on the issues of our times what is your congregation expressing to you know the answer is yes a lot of it if I if I get emails across the\nStreaming on W.
