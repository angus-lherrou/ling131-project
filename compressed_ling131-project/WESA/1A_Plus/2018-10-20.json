New Hampshire it's the friday news round up with New Hampshire public radio senior political correspondent Josh Rogers\nFranco or don't yes White House correspondent for McClatchy and Alexandra Jaffe a correspondent for vice news tonight on HBO Martin rights do you think Native American voters will vote Republican and support Trump because of this not likely\nAndy writes I relish anything that makes Trump angrier makes him look bad and I was very happy that Warren released this DNA result\nHe showed his immaturity and lack of decorum once again when he simply replied who cares at hearing the story beat him endlessly and bring him out of his whole for all the world to see that's my desire\nAlexander I wonder if you could respond to Andy's comment this idea of beating the president and kind of showing him for what he really is\nMean that was tried over and over again in the twenty six states\nFree ... read it for the the\nNinety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station\nThe sound of a free press\nLet's see the arguments that is what fires up his base and that's what state had success in the past that's what could have Republicans on sort of succeed in the midterms and it's a dangerous strategy for Democrats in twenty twenty I think taking the high road still seems to be that static but we'll see how things play out\nIt's a very dangerous strategy I mean I just want to you know add to what Alexandra saying look this is what happened in two thousand sixteen every time a day when it during the primaries and the Republicans every time Rubio J uh\nYou know Jeb Bush all of them tried to take a Trump on in his you know neck of the woods kind of playing in this dirty dirty water Trump just kind of\nTook them out um and I think it's very dangerous or for Democrats or to try to play in those waters and\nThat's that's meant in many ways why Trump continues to be so powerful particularly in the Republican Party because so many of his own a party members leaders are afraid to take them on because he's so good at this stuff Josh will if\nYou look at the way in which um you know a parochial entity like the demand for Democratic Party has tried to stoke enthusiasm for its base coming up to the elections are founded telling the gifts that they brought up\nA typically these would be people you know on presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been you know stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Ozzie and Alec Baldwin and\nThey we haven't yet seen I mean typically the more traditional candidates would started arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've the people who've drawn the most attention of the people who've cast themselves as Trump antagonists and\nUh the coffers of the local Democratic Party would tell you that that's been good for them so you know the the midterms of up here who's your favorite both sort of an all against all on the question of Trump\nAnother politician who at one point was an antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again and this week he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke\nPeople are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight in a work came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at one point Franco or don't is what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate\n[noise] um you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races it's ... it's been the most fascinating race probably a throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nThis was always going to be a long shot a for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know tried not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know he but he's been dropping in the polls and he's he's had to take a new tack\nUsing this language of lions had um attacking them about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas um it's been a major shift in tone for work\nBut it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with just yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat of the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants a you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for better or some some\nFried ... read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAnd Canada but that seems like a that seems like another ballgame\nYeah Alexandra I was going to ask you whether or not or what you read was on whether this could work I mean ... I Wonder if this debate gives us any more insight into whether\nThey rather progressive Democrat like O'Rourke has a chance in a state like Texas who's you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans does this give us a sense of whether he moved the needle it'll\nProbably it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in the midterms typically you know not that many voters watch them sometimes undecided voters do but unless there's a major gas\nThey typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows that Ted Cruz's up by about seven points which\nOn election day of Texas that's the way it typically does is enough I also think\nAnd under covered aspect of this raises the fact that Texas does straight ticket voting you can go in market box for Republicans and the strength of the Republican Party over all the strength of\nGovernor Greg Greg Abbott for instance who's running against Ed Ed Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties and seems to be enough to carry Ted Cruz over the finish line even if that are over ark has been able to keep them to single digits\nI just wanna make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in Texas you can just mark a box of the top of the ... and says Republican and it automatically counts that vote dressed county for all the Republicans on the ticket\nYet you can basically do for every Republican all at once I'm this is the last election that they'll be doing straight ticket voting after that it won't be as easy\nWill fundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're due this week to the federal election commission they were doing Monday and the results\nLooked pretty good for Democrats and house races at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of Democrats are dominating fund raising in house seat raises the challengers the Democratic challengers\nOutraged Ninety two Republican incumbents more than six the Democratic candidates raised more than a million dollars that corner in the Senate Democrats are also outrage and Republicans Beto O'Rourke raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races\nAlso glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas Karen tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday to rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continue to be felt and seen\nThe weather channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatalities spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to find people who've been missing\nYeah there are still people missing there's still people who are trying to pick up their lives um you know I think\nThe town in Mexico beach has not reported given any numbers\nUm of how many people are are missing a but there is talk of that it could likely be in the hundreds I mean this\nWas a massive storm I'm Talking about one of the biggest storms of the top three or perhaps by some accounts that you know had made landfall that would make it bigger than Katrina\nThis has been a huge effort many people still do not thousands still
