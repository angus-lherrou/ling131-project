friend of mine who was visiting Portland, Oregon and uh so I've driven down to to see him\nUm [noise] but I'd also brought along ten thousand dollars in cash with me because you never know and uh I saw those because you know on the way a gamble a little bit and then went to Portland hung out with him I spent the night and I was back in the casino and I was hung over and ill in part because I was in a casino\nAnd uh casinos are a little bit sad\nAnd small casinos in impoverished rural areas are a little bit extra set\nAnd I was also concerned about my own gambling and my relationship to what I was doing at that moment I used to play a blank check for a living I was a card counter um which is card counting as a a legitimate um\nMathematically valid method for winning at the casino game blackjack and I I used to do that for a living and then uh and then my life took an unexpected\nAnd the dealer finished shuffling and started to deal and I\nSaw the cars come out that indicated the queen's we're in theory do and I placed\n... maximum at this place it was three hundred dollars on two consecutive lucky lady squares and\nSure enough for the first round one queen of heart was dealt

she put another queen of hearts and then she stopped\nAnd she looked at the table and she called over the boss and he came and she looked at the table and\nWould they eventually figure it out with

[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nI uh first went to war when I was thirty one I grew up in a wealthy\nSuburb I spend my twenties or writing short stories and trying to wait tables\nAnd I got to thirty and I guess the best way to say it is I didn't feel like a man I didn't feel like I was a man that I thought war would be a exciting and intense and then it would transform me in some way\nUm\nAnd so I got a backpack and I put a sleeping bag in it and said no books and pens and a few thousand dollars I went to Bosnia during the civil war is are able to try to learn to be a war reporter\nAnd war was all those things that I thought it would be I mean the thing about war as it does not at this point but it's also way more than you bargained for\nUm for example this the first time I saw a dead body it wasn't a fighter\nMost of the people dying words of civilians and it was in Kosovo during the civil war it was a girl's sixteen Seventeen years old I always imagined that she was probably really beautiful um she'd been I'm taken by served paramilitary forces\nA and ...\nThey took her up to a field above a talent goes to a record and they did whatever they did to her and then they cut her throat\nAnd what I saw her it was a couple of weeks later summers hot and ... the only way you could tell she was a girl or really even the only way you could tell she was human or was that you could still see the red finger nail polish on her fingernails\nAnd that girl stay with me for a while she was more than I bargained for\nUm [noise]\nI remember the first time I got ready to die prepared myself to die I was in Sierra Leone during the civil war and I've been out of the front lines that it was a goat getting pretty bad out there and I tried to get back to freaked out I got an a jeep was a few ah\nSierra Leone and soldiers who really were good for much and then another couple of journalists were dry\nRead it for free to explore we're minding twenty five W yeah say Pittsburg NPR News they found a free press\nOne of the jungle in front of us with their guns level at us and we came to a stop\nAnd we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd ...\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was numb\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt that's all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little black hole the bullet comes\nOut of you know one point a guy ... his gun and started to shoot like another guy grab the barrel instructed off I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes well\nAll these little black holes are staring at us and I thought it was the attorney inside those holes and there are so small the thickness of a pencil and attorneys\nIn there and I couldn't look at them I couldn't bring myself to look out for some reason they didn't kill us and we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze\nIn combat you go to war you think you think you're going to be brave have you don't think that you\nProbably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd ...\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo Tony man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against some sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face and\nWhen you have to understand about bullets is that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoes that you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you asked yourself am I getting shot at because the sounds of bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle\nAnd then the gunfire arrives moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then if everything goes crazy well the boy\nThe boy a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face it that's what I felt what's the angles\nDeviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right\nNow what's the math on that angle you don't even want to think about it um and then it's all you can think about well I was paralyzed\nBullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking and everything\nI was paralyzed those behind some sandbags and our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bulletproof vest\nWe're getting a tax on three sides they're coming up and to the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there he finally jumps across that gap any graph Sufi throws my camera to\nMe it throws my bullet proof vest the grass itself is throwing a motor soldiers does the soldiers are pinned down to and it gets back and I have my camera\nScreaming on double your email from pointed by high Nike Mellon University integrated innovation to the town I'm a master's program [noise]\nYemeni guy ... flash I I I\nTim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously very very brave\nA lot braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men\nAre free to love each other on reserve is Lee without it being mistaken for something else that was Tim\nAnd that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary about this little outpost we were going to call it Restrepo and we're going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot\nOn this rigid in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Achilles on this trip\nSo I had to go home to kind of ... So Tim took the next trip\n\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seen a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American physicians got overrun they drag off of wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad out there\nWay worse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of all that soon broke his leg is it ten thousand feet up in the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long\nAnd the medic examines his foot and says well as broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain my daughter we are going to get hammered\nHere's two Advil and Tim new Jim knew that\nIf you're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg but for the sake of thirty man you shouldn't be out there\nAnd he did it I don't know how but he did it he got down on that mountain\nSo we finished up our deployment and um that's how we started to think of it are deployment I'm", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "26"}
