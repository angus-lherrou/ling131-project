[noise]\nSo when I got married I was a ... why crafty crazy person from the minute I got engaged I became obsessed with the details of the wedding I thought it was an opportunity to show everybody who we were as a couple and not that we were just perfect for each other but we had perfect case to\nSide dived into research I was looking up at cakes and photo booth backdrops and wedding dresses I was basically the reason ... was invented [noise] and after all my deep dives I was ready to go I started the invitations I hand embroidered every one of my wedding invitation [noise]\nAnd I mailed them in on the lips with vintage stamps I had picked out to match the personalities of every person that I invited [noise] so my dad got a salute to the military stamp and I had to scour ... for a vintage WC Fields for a funny friend ...\nI may have some Still Alice is leftover if you're a fan of practically but after those were sent off I started thinking about the reception [noise]\nI don't like the smell of flowers that give me a headache so I decided to make all of our center pieces I Would create flowers from buttons from his family and my family I made my weddings okay I created flowers from pieces of my grandmother's wedding dress and my mom's wedding veil\nAnd he went along with all of this [laughter] she actually went with me to thrift stores picking out all the Knicks snatched vintage plates we would use for the reception and tracking down all the little top first for the twelve cakes we were going to have is twelve I'm a big believer in cake so [noise]\nThere were things he cared about to mostly the music he actually wrote a song for me to walk down the aisle he composed it an orchestrated it and send it off to the band and we got prepared for our big day going to be so beautiful like an anthropology catalog threw up over everything but\nI thought I wanted [laughter]\nWe got married on April twenty four which is my grandparents wedding anniversary they had been married sixty four years in the day of my wedding and I thought by picking that day it would bring us the same good luck\nAnd we were married outside St Louis Missouri in a town called ... core which is his home town and his sister's back yard\nSo on April twenty fourth we hung out ... twinkling lights and the trees decorative little stars put out tables in my beautiful center pieces and on every seat lay down a custom made play bell I had done for the event\nNow all of this preparation he failed to mention that April in Missouri it's tornado season [noise] I was actually watching a YouTube learning how to fold napkins and to the shape of swans when the tornado siren went off\nAnd then came the rain and then hail and wins and it knocked all of the table over\nFree to pursue the truth

a circus clown [laughter]\nThe only time that's lucky by the way up\nWe had invited all of these circuits people so we had trapeze artist and jugglers and if there is anything they know how to do this pitch a tent so up\nWith the big top and we cleared out the branches and threw away all of the handmade bunting I had made got my grandparents out of the tornado shelter that they had been trapped in and we're ready to be getting now\nThat it was supposed to be the ring bearer but she was not having it and she wouldn't get into a little card I made so we just proceed without her [noise]\nUm [noise] I was looking forward to the song\nHadn't heard it and I realized oh they're not going to play it because the bandleader had a heart attack [noise]\nHe's fine um but they didn't feel comfortable playing it without him so instead I walked down the aisle to the theme song from the west wing [noise]\nFavorite show so um [noise]\nThe photographer had never shot a wedding before so she forgot to bring a flash 'em and some guy\nShowed up and apparently brought a stomach virus that I had not registered for um [noise] so throughout the day people kept getting sick and dropping like flies amongst all of this\nThe worst part for me was that my dad decided not to come\nI didn't ask him to walk me down the aisle and so he said I'm not going to be there by the step father that I've had since I was seven years old and I didn't want to get into the politics of which guy on which arm so I decided to walk myself\n[noise] but he didn't like it and so he chose not to come\nTo my mom called them I called him and he said well I send a check\nAs if that's the same thing\nOn his only daughter and he chose not to come to my wedding and that will always be true but I Can't do a father and daughter dance by myself\nSo I I danced with his dad and my grandfather and as we weighed beneath the big top he looked at me and said your dad should have been here\nAnd he showed them and then\nMaybe he would have seen the small fire we had in the kitchen [noise] all of our hamburger slider just went up in flames [laughter]\nBut\nHe also missed the double rainbow that came out after

E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program\nAt CMU dot edu flash I I I\n... and as I got older um stats literal feeling a feeling trapped in the wrong body got more and more pervasive and painful until it became um literally unbearable and I wasn't sure I could keep going [noise]\nUm and then I met a transgender person and I realized that it wasn't a joke at all actually was a gay man trapped in a woman's body\nA and this was great news um because it meant that there was a solution to this problem and there was a name for it and there was a community of people that I could go to um but most importantly it meant that um I could stay alive a and I could transition and I could be happy\nUm which is what I did um [noise]\n\nI I started taking testosterone and that made me look like I Do now like every other gay men in Portland [noise]\n\nAnd it turns out that I'm the kind of transgender person who was just like fine with just hormones I didn't have any other surgeries or anything which means that I have a fully functioning uterus and totally healthy eggs and this is not trans he's just a normal gay dude he's not normal he's special [noise]\nYou know what I mean so between the two of us even though we are two men we have everything we need to make our own baby\nA and we'd known dozens of other transgender men like me with beards and everything who have given birth to have the beautiful children we knew it was possible but it had been hard for pretty much all of them and that was really worried about my safety um navigating the world as a pregnant ma'am\nI'm but I uh live in a world of rainbows and unicorns ah and I just hope that it was going to be okay and I also am not good at taking no for an answer\nI'm so eventually he did say yes and I went to a doctor and everything was in good working order I stopped my hormones um and we started trying a\nAnd a few months went by nothing happened um and I started that thing maybe it wasn't going to happen for us after all and just when I started to feel the peaceful about that I woke up one morning and I felt really gross [noise]\nUh [noise]\nAnd I had read all the pregnancy books you know I Love everything about pregnancy and I've been tracking everything on the ... you know um but it wasn't the right time for me to get to be pregnant and so I refuse any that pregnancy tests and then they have made me and I took it and there were two lines and I was pregnant\nAnd it was going to be a baby and I'm so excited but also super scared because you have to do a lot of things to get ready for a baby like pick a name and buy diapers and learn how to take care of a baby [noise]\nHaley unwind we'd been toddlers when they came to live with that so I didn't know what to do with a baby um and then my body started to change really quickly um\nAnd all of those ah markers of femininity in everything just got bigger everywhere and I had anticipated this um that it would be the worst part of being pregnant\nBut it actually ended up being okay\nAnd I think it's because really early on in my transition I just had to like um accept the fact that my body is is going to be like different I Can't go back in time and be born with a body that's more like best or my dad than I could spend the rest of my life I'm obsessing over all the things I cannot do\nOr I could get excited about the thing that I can do that their bodies can't which is to create life so that's what I did um I just leaned into that\nAnd then I just let everything else go a and later on\nFree to pursue it for free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News that's the sound of a free press\nAbout you all but basically every store I've ever heard about a transgender person has been um something terrible has happened to us um and that's I think why it had been I'm so scary for me to come out as trans um because our lives our misery says the media\nAnd I thought maybe we could tell a different kind of story um because yes that there is hardship and and being transgender especially for trans people who are not like me I'm transgender women and trans people\nOf color but for all of us there is also joy and love and and resilience in family and I wanted to tell that story and I and I hope the world was ready um\nAnd we didn't think it was a big deal for me to be a pregnant man everybody else did [noise]\nUm and I don't know if they still say let go viral um but that is what happened um to our story basically overnight I'm pregnant man was everywhere like Yahoo News if anyone's don't read that um CNN a Washington Post people magazine\nPregnant man and I thought that maybe this is good you know maybe people are ready for this next evolution and what it could mean I'm to be transgender and I live in Portland and let me tell you people were ready\nFor my story in Portland I'm In Portland like maybe if you see a pregnant man at Starbucks that's not the weirdest thing you've seen that day [noise]\nThey were into it you know um\nAnd like trans\nKids would come up to me with their parents like in the grocery store and just say thank you for helping them understand that there is a little more than one way to be a man and and more than one way to be trams\nUm a lady once told me that she adopted her niece too and she thought it was marvelous that my body could give me the life I deserve while also bringing new life into the world\nBut outside of the Portland bubble I'm not everyone was ready for this story um\nI became really good friends with the ... and ... because I Would just get hundreds of messages on Facebook that was just that um people would tell me that I wasn't a man
