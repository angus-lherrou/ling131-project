in Sierra Leone during the civil war and\nI've been out of the front lines that it was a goat getting pretty bad out there and I've tried to get back to Freetown and I got an a jeep with a few ah Sierra Leone and soldiers who really weren't good for much and then another couple of journalists and we're driving down this empty road back towards Freetown and these rebel ...\nStep out of the jungle in front of us with their guns leveled at us and we came to a stop and we just staring straight ahead while they argued about whether to kill us\nAnd ...\nI tried to get ready I was hollow I was numb\nAnd I didn't have any grand thoughts I just kept thinking I Hope this doesn't hurt as all I thought and the guns were pointed at us and you never see a gun like this but I could see the little black hole the bullet comes out of\nYou know one point a guy ... his gun and started to shoot another guy grab the barrel inject it up I mean it was like that for Fifteen minutes well\nAll these little black holes are staring at us I thought it was the attorney being inside those holes and there are so small the thickness of a pencil and attorneys in there and I couldn't\nLook at them I couldn't bring myself to look at them for some reason they didn't kill us and we drove back to Freetown and um I kept going back for more I kept going to more wars I felt like there was something\nSomething I needed to understand about war that I didn't understand yet and I kept looking for it kept going back I remember the first time I froze in combat\nYou go to war you think you think you're going to be brave\nHave you don't think that you probably don't go to war and sometimes you are brave but then other times you or not\nAnd ...\nSo this time I was out at a small American outpost in Afghanistan outpost called Restrepo twenty man positioned up on this rich are getting attacked all the time and um but this day it was really quiet hot day nothing was going on I was leaning against some sandbags\nAnd some dirt fluent ... side of my face\nAnd would you have to understand about bullets is that they go much faster than the speed of sound so someone shoes at you so much to say you're from five four hundred meters five hundred meters\nThe first thing that happens is you you asked yourself am I getting shot at it gives the sounds of bullets make when they go past you is pretty subtle\nAnd then the gunfire arrives moment later yes I Am getting shot at and then as everything goes crazy well the boy\nThe boy a bullet hit two inches from the side of my head and kick dirt in my face that's what I felt what's the angles\nDeviation at five hundred meters that gives you two inches to the right\nNow what's the mass on that angle you don't even want to think about it\nScreaming on WGN appointed by high Nike Mellon University integrated innovation to the town I'm a master's program [noise]\nYemeni guy ... flash I I I\nRealized bullets were coming in hitting the ground hitting the sandbags smacking and everything I was paralyzed by some sandbags our gear was right right over there just a few feet away cameras bulletproof vest\nWe're getting attacked from three sides they're coming up into the wire it's really bad and we can't get to our gear there's too much gunfire and I'm paralyzed and the guy I was working with Tim Hetherington photographer we're on assignment out there\nHe finally jumps across that gap and he grabs Sufi throws my camera to me it shows like bullet proof vest the grabs his stuff he's throwing amateur soldiers 'cause the soldiers are pinned down too\nAnd he gets back and I have my camera in my hand and I start shooting I start working and then I'm fine I'm not scared anymore Tim I'm Tim was an amazing photographer and obviously\nVery very brave a lot braver than me um\nBut he was also really kind of thoughtful about war and I remember at one point he said to me you know war might be the only situation where young men\nAre free to love each other how deservedly without it being mistaken for something else\nThat was Tim and that's why we were working together we decided to make a documentary about this little outpost we were going to call it Restrepo and we're going to spend as much of the deployment as possible at this in this little spot\nOn this rigid in eastern Afghanistan so we were going to alternate trips and I I tore my Achilles on this trip\nSo I had to go home to heal up so Jim took the next trip\n\nHe was on a on a combat operation a weeklong combat operation up up in the mountains on foot very bad seen a lot of lot of guys got killed a lot of American Soldiers got killed and wounded\nAt one point um the American physicians got overrun they drag off of wounded American soldier at night in the middle of a firefight\nThey got him back but it was bad out there\nWay worse than anyone back home really knew you know and in the middle of all that seemed broke his life he's a ten thousand feet up in the ... with a broken leg and the platoon is moving down the mountain all night long\nAnd the medic examines his foot and says well as broken and we can't get a medivac and we have to be off this mountain by daughter were going to get hammered\nHere's two Advil and Tim new Jim knew that if\nYou're not prepared to walk all night on a broken leg for the for the sake of thirty men you shouldn't be out there\nAnd he did it I don't know how many did it he got down on that mountain\n\nSo we finished up our deployment and um that's how we started to think of it are deployment I'm and I'm not you know the rest of it was okay the worst is in the beginning actually and uh and we started making our film Restrepo and um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Moth Radio Hour", "city":
