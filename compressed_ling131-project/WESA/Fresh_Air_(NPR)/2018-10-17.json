anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone to any of the trouble is you know my my grandparents grew up in the great depression and and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly were the kind of people who thought we should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now and I'm open about that to help uh you know distant ties you seeing someone was talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and that's where for me are was such a saving

okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles and this is how you have to ask\nAnd so she as an as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching kind of book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that a ... a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally at and that in that moment uh and and back then this was now the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dress somebody else's character so that advice by by Marc Lynch really
