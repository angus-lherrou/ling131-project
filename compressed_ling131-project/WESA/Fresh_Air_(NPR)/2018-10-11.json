from September fourth the interviewer asked for Trump's thoughts on the fact that the planning of the ... was not shown he was asked do you think that's upsetting\nAnd Trump says I think it's very unfortunate it's almost like they're proud of it's almost like they're embarrassed at the achievement coming from America I think it's a terrible thing\nBecause when you think of Neil Armstrong when you think about the landing on the moon you think about the American flag and I understand they don't do it for that reason I wouldn't even want to watch the movie\nAnd then he's after you think other people should go see the movie and Trump says that's up to them it really is that's up to them I don't want to get into the world of boycotts and then he goes on to talk about Colin Kaepernick and Nike\nOr the controversy about the flag material the movie you know I think those\nAre pretty much exclusively among the people who haven't seen the film and I have to say I understand very much the emotions that something like that or get aroused I think uh obviously the moon winning was an American achievement\nAnd an incredible one and the flag on the moon was a very important part of that

it was another surprise [laughter] among many you know that I learned about when learning about Neal I'm\nA it was actually seen the Ryan himself it stumbled on a you mentioned in Japan since book that Neal liked this track and uh I think it was interesting about it is you know it's not just at the track itself is\nSo Florida or you know are so little known they were also more famous tracts of music that uh that Neal is the other astronauts play during the course of their mission they played a piece for by divorce shock and\nAwe and what not but this you know strange little less Baxter tune a was something that was actually a new and Janet or listen to two together that they loved together when they were young and loving in college so to me what was interesting was that someone\nA in

equipment or cruel or or or a green screen that will fill in later\nYou see the earth's spinning by over and over again\nYou know our deep you had to kind of big light that would sort of on a on a

going haywire sort of experience for a for the actors and for you know there by the cameras inside\nA inside the crafts I mean I mean the hope was to really you know it was kind of feeling if we can

extension the the the audience will really feel that they themselves are and that capsule to\nLet me get this straight so uh Ryan Gosling isn't this capsule that you are violently shaking so that it looks real answer that he's really experiencing all of the uh usually on patient and and just physical jostling um all of this\nYes you know we didn't literally a spin rind in the capsule at you know several rotations per second as happened to a Neal and and Dave Scott you know are we a ride and I both wanted to try and make it as physical as possible and and uh experiential as possible\nGet anybody throw up\nOur question [laughter] not\nThat I Know of we uh we didn't need to give rise to break after about a week of sort of heavy launch sequences and shaking because uh he started to uh apparently you started to not make sense when he was talking on the phone to someone and so we had to uh\nLast night it was getting ... from ... we had to take a we had to\nTake a moment no he got his actually all very a a word for a second because rides the type of actor who really just you know a really wants to do as much of it himself as as you can\nDo I think we all had to kind of intervene at a certain point and go you know what we should we should give you arrest and ah you know have you checked out and and well shoot other stuff for a little bit turned out he was fine\nBut I think it's a testament to Ryan that or if it were up to him I think he would have just kept on shooting ...\nAnother thing that adds to the whole experience of seeing this is the noise I mean you're hearing alarms go off you hearing banking 'em and you think of space as being very quiet I guess at times like this is not quite at all inside the space caps on a recent lessons and\nUm what were some things you learned from her that help you understand what she and she's portrayed by Claire foie and what Armstrong we're going through during this period in the sixties when he was an astronaut\nOr well one thing I think that Neal engine and had in common was visibility to put on a face and in moments of incredible uh you know upheaval I'm you know that ... that they were able uh\nYou know it was something in their character the sort of mid western I'm a kind of ... that they had that also you know it was very much a product of of of their time in their culture\nThat was just able to do the impossible without complaint and uh you know I really got a vivid sense of that when talking to Janet you know I I Would ask or things like you know ... well you know how did you\nHow did you do this how did you you know how did you feel when ah you know you're you're you're moving from place to place to say you're moving from a juniper hills in California where when they first moved there for Neal to be a you know test pilot VX Fifteen he's\nWorking and incredibly dangerous job they're living in a cabin with no running water no electricity or and in the middle of nowhere a then they moved to Houston after a you know after suffering and uh\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press [noise]\nYou're you're moving from place to place you know to say you're moving from a juniper hills in California where when they first moved there for Neal to be a you know test pilot VX Fifteen he's\nWorking in incredibly dangerous job they're living in a cabin with no running water no electricity or and in the middle of nowhere a then they moved to Houston after a\nYou know after suffering a agree this loss as a family um and you know again Neal is work in a dangerous job and and away eighty percent of the time and who knows if you'll ever return I mean just you know how how did you cope and and she would uh several times just look at me and and all this with a shrug say well sink or swim\nThat really stuck with me just that it was as simple as that in a way um but of course that's complicated is that and uh you know so she vividly remember to so many of you know the kind of day by day activities and instances of that we depicting the movie and a lot of it was even down to\nYou know lines of dialogue to quite emotional moments in the movie for example when when Janet a you know late in the film a A N ... her husband that he sit down and tell us kids before he goes off on his moon missions sits down and tells them that he may not return\nMade him do that in real life\nYeah yeah that that this is all you made a lot of this was is already recorded and Jim Hansen's book I'm a but a beginning to actually talk with her about it and you know talk through what that conversation actually wasn't than what the ensuing dinner table conversation actually was I mean\nA lot of that scene in the movies taken verbatim from ah from what she writes elected and from what her son's a wreck in March were incredibly helpful through the whole process of the movie recollect it\nYeah and in the senior attacking Batman apparently in real life to Neil Armstrong didn't really want to have that conversation with his sons saying I might not make it back that she demanded that he has to do it and that she wasn't going to do it he has yucky and that\nAnd and he has been in this incredible like low key way without really\nWithout really showing emotion\nYeah I mean I I think uh for Neal in particular but it applies to both of them in order to you know the only way you get through something like a mission like that or or or you know for example through some of the law says that they experienced as a family\nI'm the only way you can get through a release the only way they felt they could get through was was by trying as hard as possible to hold those emotions in check but that's sometimes a difficult thing to do you know and I think I think Neal in the movie and I think you know it is in real life it to a certain extent with someone who uh I\nThink it was more afraid of engaging with those emotions and and are actually sitting down and facing them\nOr are you know and and and and talking to people about them than he was a hurling themselves through the atmosphere and flying into the void of space you know he he was he was a man without any fear or they were a married couple without any fear\nExcept for this sort of deep ... fear that I think they constantly had to deal with day by day on the ground\n[noise] I'm suggesting her what did the score for the film and you also work with him on whiplash another land he met in college and I think the music is really good for the film and um [noise] I Know music is very important to you during the the moon landing sequence\nUm there's music that sounds to me like part military part like western seeing music and Star Trek refer to space as the final frontier [laughter]\nI don't know if that was intentional to have a kind of western ads edge to it because there were them sounds part military ... kinda galloping like horses in less than\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E essay Pittsburgh NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nLike part military part like western theme music and you Star Trek refer to space has the final frontier [laughter] I don't know if it was intentional to have a kind of western edge to catch the rhythm sounds part military ... kind of galloping like horses in western\n[noise] uh well you know it was a I think the biggest thing for me was the rhythm of it was just the the that kind of relentless drive a that yeah you know good sound like horses galloping good sound like the machinery itself uh to me also just reflected in the state of mind this was a\nYou know that that final stretch of the journey that final landing and and you kinda get a sense of it when you listen to the ... uh themselves to the inner confidence that when you\nSee a sorry yeah when you you know the actual audio or between the capsule and kept Columbine and mission control and what not um you know ... you can listen to all of that in real time or you can listen to all of it online and and uh um\nIt's just this uh you know there was sort of one thing after another that went wrong or almost went wrong um and uh but I\nI get the sense that Neal was going to ah was going to weigh in that thing I wasn't going to be stopped and and uh you know a everyone it come too far at that point to turn around and and uh and you know so when you when you learn things like the fact that they landed with you know only two percent\nOf the you know gas remaining they landed within the thirty second window or by which point they would have had to do a mandatory aboard a you know or or\nOr or else basically die um you know that those are things that I didn't really know about when I first thought about the moon landing um and uh you know so it felt like a music why should we could get in to Neal's mine space that we can get into that sense of just relentless on stopping drive um uh it would it would just set the scene\nOkay let's hear some of that music and this is ... music\nThat's landing music from just inherently to score\nFor ... and new movie that Neil Armstrong and his
