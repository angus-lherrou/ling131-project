justices\nMy guest David Kaplan says the court has reached the point where justices are often seen as political proxies of the Republican or Democratic Party\nHis new book is about how the court became so politicized and so powerful\nThat also includes profiles of several of the justices the book is based in part on happens interviews with several of the current justices as well as past justices sixty five law clerks who worked at the Supreme Court and congressional and White House officials dating back to the Reagan Administration [noise]\nA lot of the interviews were done on the condition that he not named the source Kaplan is also a former legal affairs editor at Newsweek where he covered the Supreme Court for a decade his new book is called the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution\nDavid Kaplan welcome to fresh air so one of the main themes of your book is that the court has become so politicized you can predict which justice will vote it's become politics by another name elaborate on that idea for us\nWell on those hot button issues like abortion and same sex marriage and voting rights and gun control and campaign finance you pretty much know ahead of time where they're going to come out so the larger question I'm trying to asked in the book is whether the court ought to be as interventionist\nAnd as involved in American Life\nAs it is and enduring for example the recent Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings you heard questions about specific issues like abortion or presidential power but nobody asked whether the court is properly involved in so many of these political\nAnd social issues because everyone pretty much assumes a that it ought to be\nIn what sense do you think that the court is overstepping\nThe court docket is almost entirely discretionary the justices decide which cases they want to hear and too often they choose to hear cases involving issues that I argue would better be left\nAnd it questions the credibility of the court quite because they might be very biased in their opinions\nWhether they're biased or as you know have the appearance of bias is a real problem for the court and there is no real solution I don't for example I think you will see recusal\nIn such areas of the law I don't think you'll see Kevin recused himself anymore than Clarence Thomas to part of that is it's hard for justice to recuse himself\nOr herself at a lower court you can always substitute in a new judge you can't do that\nOn the Supreme Court there nine justices if one doesn't sit in the case then you're down to a they don't like even numbers of justices but we'll we'll Kavanaugh bend over backwards in in such cases to try to undo the concern people have that's\nSuch dime store psychology is beyond my pay grade they're certainly isn't any indication in his opinions to date of a bias but you know his performance after Dr Ford testify\nTalking about how this was a vast left wing conspiracy the Clintons and all that even if he apologized for try to in Wall Street journal op ed piece I think that in some respects\nA leaves him\nIn an even tougher position than he might in a sexual harassment case there are a lot of cases it if they don't involve the Clinton specifically obviously they involve politics and a cabinet or you could argue showed his true partisan shelf\nIn that twenty minutes of testimony I Would be justice concern in that area\nWhat kind of cases do you think that might influence\nWell you could imagine campaign finance\nAppeal coming up they're going to be more of those and depending on who brings it\nAre are there Republican interest or their democratic interest I think even if he's not in fact biased the appearance of by a bias is a real one\nHaving settled that there are all kinds of reasons of course to criticize justice Thomas's performance on the court for the last Thirty years and I do so in my book but I'm not sure you can\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\nSpent or regulation of the workplace 'em and say that Thomas ruled the way he did out of ... or bitterness from his hearings back then\n[noise] I don't know if this was after last February or not but last February that lives in New York magazine cover story headlined the case for impeaching Clarence Thomas with stories of other women besides Anita Hill who had stories of sexual harassment ... um regarding Clarence Thomas\nSo it's um it's a story that keeps you know coming back to life\nIt does and\nSome folks could argue that maybe it was silly generous it was unique and it was dated but the Kavanaugh stuff brought that all back to light and as you point out now we've got two justices under a cloud separated by Thirty years that is really bad\nFor the court it's bad for the courts prestige\nI think it helps to an end feeble Congress we have a lousy Congress for any number of reasons but one of the reasons as various congressmen and senators would tell me they don't act is 'cause they know that the justices across the street will act and I also think it\nIt distorts presidential elections and the way that we saw in two thousand\nSixteen twenty twenty five percent of Trump voters said they didn't like Trump's temperament they didn't agree with the with a lot of what he said but they voted for him simply because of the Supreme Court\n[noise] so um it in terms of how politicized the court has become I'm\nPresident Trump supported Brett Kavanaugh through the hearings and front insulted Christine Blasey Ford who made the allegations of sexual assault [noise] are you concerned are their concerns out there that Kavanaugh will feel the hold and teach Trump and therefore\nCome to conclusions in ways that support the Trump Administration when the Trump Administration is involved in a case\nI think they're all kinds of\nLegitimate bases for criticizing Cavanaugh I thought his testimony\nAfter Dr Ford's was appalling I thought Kavanaugh's performance of the press conference the White House was a ... of a justice but I think the notion that now that he's on the Supreme Court he's going to feel beholden to the president who appointed him is misguided one of the great aspects of the system\nWhich has lots of laws is that once you're on the bench and have life tenure you really don't have to look down Pennsylvania Avenue with any degree of loyalty because the president can't do anything\nAt that point other than tweet so I think by and large most justices or throughout history have\nSuccessfully proclaimed and demonstrated their independence from the president's so pointed them look at the Nixon tapes case in Nineteen Seventy four were unanimous court ruled against Richard Nixon that doesn't mean you kind of a friendship\nWith the president and various FDR appointed justices remain friends with FDR butter on my list of criticisms of and concerns about Brett Kavanaugh the fact that he's grateful to this president I don't think will affect his decision making I think most justices most of the time\nOnce they're up there they're free and clear\nI hadn't known of Brett Kavanaugh before he was nominated to be a Supreme Court justice\nScreaming on W.

Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents that are blamed the Senate but I I think you in the first since that you need to blame the court because it gets involved\nSo often it raises the stakes of who sits\nOn the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues than you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of a politics necessarily becomes tightened it wasn't\nAlways that way when John Paul Stevens was picked by Gerald Ford in the mid Nineteen seventies\nAnd it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other examples those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\nDo you think that politicized politicization of Supreme Court nominees but includes how Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nAbsolutely and and listen if the Democrats get control\nOf Congress ah this this time round or in two years twenty twenty I think you'll if they can get their act together because they're not really good at playing dirty or you may see them raise the stakes you know they talk about ... about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require\nA constitutional amendment but if you want to increase the size of the court\nPack the court as it were all you need is an act of Congress if the Democrats control the house in the Senate or the White House in twenty Twenty one I don't think court packing is off the table at all and if you want to get back the Merrick Garland seat and if you want to take back control of the court\nJust add to more seats a point to liberals than an eleven member court you have a six by majority do I think that's possible yes\n[noise] being a Supreme Court justice is I'm a lifetime appointment you leave when you say you want to leave and how old is your third against but now eighty five and how it was a John Paul Stevens when he left\nNinety yeah so it's a you can say for a really long time um so a lot of people\nAlready good it's a pretty good gig\nGig [laughter] yeah [laughter] um so the lifetime appointment issue has been challenged by many people because now that people are living to such\nOlder ages than they used to when the Supreme Court was first created you know and when the constitution was first written um ...\nDreaming on W.
