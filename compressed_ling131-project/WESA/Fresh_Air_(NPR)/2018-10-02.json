Washington Post\nYou know you're right in the book that Trump has avoided consequences for offenses that were long considered politically fatal often by lying in the face of overwhelming evidence Flynn however had noticed that community I was interested that you use the word lying\nLying when used in the same sentence as Trump is very controversial and the journalism world because line implies intent\nYou know our fault that it is when you speak something that isn't true lying implies that you know it's not true and you're saying it anyways so people are just weighing ... is is worthy of using the word lie or not so you've used the word lie so I Want\nTo ask you about how you decided to use it\nYeah I mean I feel like\nUm it is a difficult decision and we don't we don't throw that word around lightly we um we often get criticized at the post for being too reluctant to use that word and I think that's true in other news organizations as well but at the same time\nI mean we're at here at this moment are you know we have a fact checker at the Washington Post who has documented\nFive thousand or more fall swords from this president since he's taken office many of them are false words that he repeats despite repeated corrections public corrections repeated efforts even by his own staff\nTo um to correct his misstatements I mean there is an intense I don't think there's any doubt that there is an intent or that it is part of\nIt's part of Trump's per se car very complex personality it's part of what it is and it traces back to his origin as a as a as a public person um I

trying to figure out well we now know that Flynn had discussed sanctions would the Russians was basically cutting a deal behind his government's back with Moscow\nAnd not just raised a lots and lots of questions about well who else was in contact with ... with the Kremlin during the campaign if anyone right so we're we're digging by our news organization and many others and this was a conversation with the chairman of the house intelligence committee Devin Nunes has\nWho has who is read into all of the most sensitive intelligence on questions like this\nAnd I was asking him you know what else is there we are seeing lots of indications contact between Jared Kushner and and officials for Moscow and other members of the Trump Organization we already knew about Paul Manafort of course and he says that the FBI has been looking at this and all and it's all a dead trail\nAnd I pressed him because I could not believe that he was saying that there was already abundant evidence of contact that you could say that that was incidental and meaning listen harmless but you couldn't say didn't exist but\nHe says it you know when I pressed him not even pizza boy delivery contact and it just struck me at that time that that was\nSo implausible um that he was you know he was trying to throw sand in our eyes basically ah in my eyes as a reporter he was trying to um protect Trump and that that was um more important to him in that conversation that adhering to the facts that had already been established\nMy guest is Greg Miller who covers intelligence and national security for the

these are supposedly public officials they are they are are public servants there or not\nPresident Trump's public servants um the idea that anybody would be required to sign any kind of loyalty oath to him personally I'm is just goes against the grain of so many ah principles that it's hard to fathom [noise]\nSome people who want to just credit reports about the Trump Administration that report said expose I'm either you know lives false heads misdeeds say all those stories relying anonymous sources I'm not going to like trust I'm not going to trust or not and I'm now an anonymous source [noise]\nUm so what are your rules what are your guidelines for using an anonymous source and for how to use them and and and also like who knows within the editorial hierarchy at the post who those sources are so they can be confident\nAnd do any fact checking that's necessary\nSo that's a great question Terry and it's really a in a really important one\nAt this moment because we do depend on anonymous sources um for a lot of the stories we do and frankly if we weren't able to use anonymous sources\nWe would really be unable I think to give our readers and the world an accurate picture of what's happening in the U.S government inside the Trump Administration inside the CIA or abroad\nAs Bob Woodward says over and over again I Want when we say anonymous source the reporter knows who the source as it's the readers who are kept in the dark about the SARS but it's not like you know ... of the information\nThat's up see right through sources are not anonymous to us\nUm these are sources that um we know who they are um many in many instances their sources we have known for many years and have developed trust in because of how reliably they have given us information\nUm and you know frankly even in that case when we're writing sensitive stories I we talked earlier about the the Mike Flynn story and how we ended up\nHaving nine separate sources there's no magic number nine was not

they how much do we know about them inside inside the Washington Post there are lots of conversations at varying levels of specificity about that sourcing so sometimes you might be asked well\nWhat is the position of the ... where is the source and coming from from the story um who are we talking about here and you can you can basically described their positions in government sometimes if it's highly sensitive senior editors are going to want to know\nMore they're going to want you to identify your source and that you know that sometimes can get a that can get touchy depending on the nature of your agreement with sore say or source be\nBut it's something you know ultimately despite you know we we all of these accusations and criticisms that's our reliance on anonymous sourcing\nI mean the the record just sort of holds up\nThe stories that we've written over the past two years attributed mainly to anonymous sources of almost all proven overtime to be accurate I mean there might be mistakes at the margins here or there were a news organizations are perfect and and then can we do make mistakes but boy we've gotten a lot right\nUm and I know Marty Baron the executive editor at the Washington Post talks frequently about\nYou know the post and other news organizations um are always trying to get it right\nBut at this moment in our history where we are under such attack all the time and accusations of fake news\nYou know there's extraordinary care given to getting the facts and even the nuance exactly right\nIt it's really it would really be damaging to not just the Post's credibility in my credibility as a journalist but to the broader\nUm journalistic community if whenever we get things wrong there's a lot riding on the media right now and it's ability to do its job and do it well and do it right let me try to give you one more example of\nThe recording environment that we're trying to operate in just how much pressure we're under as reporters how much pressure our sources are under a as well um there came a time this past year when the Justice Department in Congress released the memos that former FBI Director Jim Comey had kept\nEvery time he met with Trump Everytime he meets with Trump something happens troubles him he goes straight to his computer types up a memo to record what ... what transpired\nOne of those talks about a conversation he had with

national weather service part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany essential positions and the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says uh filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing while others have conflicts of interest our political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing about this in articles published in Vanity Fair Michael Lewis welcome back to fresh air explain what the fifth risk is\nShort answer is the risk you fail to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is what I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump\nI come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government trying to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what I'm asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture part or even the White House the name of the top risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with three or four and then they can't think of this so I thought that's the ... where the mind failed to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it the fifth risk now that you've explained what the fifth risk means\nWas the response to what I found about how the Trump Administration has gone about taking over the federal government\nFree

W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\nOf mine fails to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it to rest now that you've explained with a fifth risk means\nWhat it was a response to what I found about how the Trump Administration had gone about taking over the federal government we're kind of like a fire under me is what I discovered that the Obama administration spent the\nBetter part of a year and thousands of people's lives preparing essentially the best course of that ever been created in in how to run the federal government or what was going on inside the federal government\n[noise] well if you're just joining us my guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and commerce departments [noise]\nWe're gonna take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nW we essay supported by children's museum of Pittsburgh hosting ...

A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what did to in the Commerce Department [laughter]\nIt's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and they simply don't National Weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was a versus the biggest part of no ... and how do they get their back in the seventies\nOr Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and um he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War Nick Nixon got ticked off\nAnd just shoved into the Commerce Department as an actor vengeance so is there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nAnd it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department\nAre and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good that he runs a weather Prediction Center okay well\nI'm so here's the problem are typically the person who runs no or as as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but the weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nA which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but but weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them an image and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better\nOr all of that saves lives and property or if that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to\nCommunicate with the public uh it it has to let the rest of it as it has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to present the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to essentially forbid the national weather service from\nFrom doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you and the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIs the the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean they they these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the ah the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so they can go and you know\nAdvertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the date of the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts but what he's been trying to do is organized a sexually a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do is business for free\nYeah you're saying that the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that I'm\nThat no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is naturally or a government operation and so and it's naturally a governor operation to deliver a weather forecast to the public\nSo Barry Myers or had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yet\nMy guest is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break and Terry Gross and Mrs fresh air [noise]\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nFor NPR comes from the station and from cancer treatment centers of America working to outsmart cancer for the use of genomic testing to profile each individual's cancer and revealed possible treatment option\nLearned more about precision cancer treatment that Cancer Center dot com\nOffering a tire decision guy to help customers find tires that fit their car and driving conditions with a network of more than seven thousand independent installers\nThat basically represents their point of view so what was the landing team and what was pile tasked with doing\nSo landing team is a grand phrase for what arrived at the department of energy because it was really just piled and he didn't show up until a month after the election\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings from people in the department of energy who would prepare them but he what he did instead was meant for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office and listen politely and didn't take notes\nAnd the people who were running the department of jihad the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um as part of the quote landing team will send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to somebody for questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nHe wanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with climate change\nHe was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him a list of names but he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in and what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy mission to\nEngage in and fun basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing project because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I in the Trump Administration are getting on ... because there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those department are antagonistic toward those departments\nSo yes there's actually there's actually a direct connection between the undoing project my last book and this is what got me into this book in the first place [noise] one of the insights that drought\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\nAnd when the people who have been put in positions to run those department are antagonistic toward those departments\nSo yes there's actually there's actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book in this one is what got me into this book in the first place\nOne of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economist and Amos diversity who are studying the way people judge risk\nIs that when you changed the odds people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that is there's a one in a million chance of it happening\nAnd change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that and I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risk of a pandemic or a the risk of a a nuclear accident or the risk of a terrorist attack or the the one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River and poisons the\nWhole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking it lots of you know one in a million or one of the ... hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely because he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it\nAnd I thought this society doesn't feel it it kind of interest you showed you that people don't really feel this and that inside is what got me going in the first place [noise]\nSo you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mark the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done um I'm actually in what your thoughts are about whether we are now in terms of financial stability and\nAnd world markets [noise] well I'm a big question [laughter]\nWell the question I mean you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next well I\nI Know that's not really your job but\nYou know it's not my job but you know if I ... I Would love to have one outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say oh the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption and the treasury bond market they stole money in the first place from us we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a a war way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk I at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's gonna be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthy\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalize and better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's going to be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding we have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt I'm it would that wouldn't shock me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why\nWould a figure trigger a financial crisis well\nBecause the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots of lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable\nThey'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds or the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and just kind of playing with it here but if you asked me to like ... predict\nWhat might trigger a the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would have predicted some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun when you predict things funding sort of predict things where where\nWhere they happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it ah I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming\n[noise] my guest is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal government under President Trump and the book looks at the energy agriculture and Commerce Department we're going to take a short break and we'll be right back this is fresh air\nW.
