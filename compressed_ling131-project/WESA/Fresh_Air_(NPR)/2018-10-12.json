A. dot org\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with the ... is author of the new book blurred lines sex power and consent on campus\nSo let's talk about the definition of sexual assault and how that is maybe changing what\nWhat was the kind of common understanding of the definition of sexual assault in the three years you were talking to people on college campuses\nThere was a huge shift and the definition of sexual assault from like two thousand and fourteen to Seventeen while I was there and I watched as it happened um\nMany students said to me that they weren't sure if groping counted as sexual assault maybe it has to be penetration 'em\nBy the end of those three years that idea was completely blown up the water 'em and I even had students say to me\nYou know sexual assault is maybe even the way you speak to people all the way you abreast San people in speech and make them feel like justice uh like dirty like a sexual objects I mean they were thinking through this idea how far can we actually take this [noise]\nSo um it is there no commonly held understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is now\nI don't think that there's a national understanding of what the definition of sexual assault is I think that um people who are in Lenin about this issue understand that it doesn't have to include penetration um but\nI think that part of why good part of the country is in line with Trump on this issue is that we don't have a national definition\n[noise] so um you also say that the definition of consent is being redefined and the slogan used to be no means no but now at the yes means yes what's the difference between no means no and yes means yes\nWell there is a huge difference something like yes means yes is okay until you get some sort of yes you don't really have permission to touch somebody now\nI guess you know in the college definition could be verbal or it could be um they like to call it acts unmistakable and their meaning which I suppose means I'm mon are grown are pulling off clothes et cetera\nAnd from looking at us in researching it I didn't agree with this at the outset but I came convinced that this is\nA really good standard for young people and perhaps for older people as well certainly anybody who's in a workplace who might have a crush on somebody else you know you got to ask a question 'cause you could be misinterpreting signals people do that all the time\nSo why were you resistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sex is something that is ... folk\nAnd that's kind of energy between people and more exciting\nFree ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet very Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nOr were you resistant to this yes means yes standard and why did you change your mind\nWell I'm an adult you know I'm In my forties and I know that that's not the way sex usually happens means sex is something that is an ... book and that's kind of energy between people and more exciting in some ways when it's like that\nYou know we see a lot of young people who are having sex with people that they met on dating apps they barely know these people and that's part of the\n... part of the charge but and I I'm not so doctrinaire that I think that you should have to say yes to each escalating base or sexual act which is the way a lot of people think of yes means yes but I Do think that the question is not that big a deal\nI'm In Gen x we had the question you know should I get a condo which was always\nKind of a a question about protection but it was really a permission question I'm there really has to be an extra question\n... you read that the strongest argument for affirmative consent for yes means yes is it frees girls from the cage of socialized politeness when do you mean\nWell one of the complexities of sexual assault is that girls don't always saying no um they certainly don't say it that way no get away from me I'm pushing you away right they say well maybe another time\nUh I don't think I Want to do this tonight until band up\nGiving up um you know some of the most interesting work that's being done now in terms of trying to\nFix this problem is about girls understanding the signals from people who might in Trenton them harm and removing themselves from the room before anything actually happened because people understand once they're in the room is really hard to get how\nWell you know the thing about yes means yes there's a lot of people say oh that's so awkward to kind of have these like rules like almost like a questionnaire like I authorized huge too like you know take off my shirt or whatever [noise] um but it's equally awkward I think for the woman to be in a place where the man is making all these advances\nAnd you have to say no no no stop no I really mean stop no okay I'll leave no it just put the responsibility on her and it makes it like really awkward\nAnd it's not a shared awkwardness it's like one person and having the full burden of the awkwardness exactly so this is a little ...\nOkay ... ... it definitely changes things I mean I went to a dance party I like to go out and dance it may\nRecently you know guys try to come up and downs with you and you try to get away and this guy came up and he was about to put his arm around me and then he said is it okay if I put my arm around here and I said no\n[laughter] no I'm In his arm around me and he said oh yeah I get it consent I'm I totally get it I understand I'm Glad I asked\nWas that the first time that happens here that was definitely the first time for it to be\n[laughter]

lives in kind of designed to call attention to the most sexual areas of the body [noise]\nUm so you know you could see it one way like it's a sign of my sexual empowerment or you could see it another way I'm offering myself to you as an object\nAs a sexual out as somebody I Want you to look at me sexually I Want you to see my power as being sexual power or at least partly sexual power and I am inviting you to really focus your gaze unless sexual parts of my body\nMhm and and again you can see that as empowerment or you could see that as objective vacation and I'm just wondering\nIf you have any thoughts about that or if that's an issue that came up a lot when talking to young women on campuses\nWell it's certainly not an issue that came up when I spoke with the young women 'cause they completely believe it's empowering but it's an issue that came up a lot for me because I found myself really torn between those two ideas is is empowering or is this denigrating 'em\nAnd you know being somebody who comes from second wave feminism item my knee jerk reaction is like you guys were calling the self object vacation isn't that just a\nA ruse isn't that the somewhere justifying on

empowering to them now we have all sorts of data also saying that they have\nA huge amount of nervousness about it and they feel I'm anxious and depressed disguise like their social media posts et
