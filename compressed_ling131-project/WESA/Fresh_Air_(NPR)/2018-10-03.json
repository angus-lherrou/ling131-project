money ball and the big short which were adopted into films and the undoing project\nLewis lifted Trump's government by focusing on three departments energy commerce and agriculture\nIf you're thinking that this is about boring bureaucracy consider that as Lewis points out the government manages a portfolio of risks that no private person or corporation was ever able to manage ranging from forecasting and warning about hurricanes the national weather service is part of the Commerce Department\nTo preventing the accidental explosions have our own nuclear weapons one of the energy department's many responsibilities\nMany essential positions and the Trump Administration remain unfilled and some of the key positions Lewis says uh filled by people who are uninformed about what areas they're supposed to be overseeing while others have conflicts of interest our political views that make them antagonistic toward the department or agency they're leading\nLewis started writing

to imagine it's is while you're worried about what you're worried about is the thing is actually going to come and kill you and the longer answer is when I'm working on this book about the federal government under Trump\nI come to see the federal government as really a portfolio of risks that are being managed\nAnd as I'm wandering around the federal government trying to figure out what these risks are over and over again I what am I asking people in the Energy Department or the agriculture partner even the White House to name kind of the top risks on the tip of their minds\nAre they all come up with kind of three or four and then they can't think of the fifth so I thought that's the moment where the mind failed to imagine what it needs to imagine\n[noise] since your book is about the federal government under Trump focusing on the energy agriculture and commerce departments why did you name it to rest now that you've explained what the fifth risk means\nThe job and it turned out he had two billion dollars less than the Forbes ritual is to calculated him having and four of us who watches this investigation discovers that he'd been lying to the fore rich list all\nWhich then apparently caused Trump to take a lot less of him but he you know he is an odd choice he was very odd choice because with that department really needs is someone who's really comfortable with

A. Noah and you say sixty percent of the Commerce Department Israeli Noah first of all what did you turn on the Commerce Department\nIt's a really good question so it's even more than sixty percent it's four sixty five percent or so of the budget it goes to this one thing I Know it eats the Commerce Department and isn't quite our National Weather service by the national weather service is a bit and now there was there which is the biggest part of no\n... and how do they get their back in the seventies or Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and\nUm he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior at the time came out against the Vietnam War next next and got ticked off and just shoved into the Commerce Department is an act of vengeance so if there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\nOr Nixon was contemplating a reorganization of government and um he was going to put the no ... in the department of interior and the secretary of interior of the time came out against the Vietnam War next next and got ticked off and\nJust shoved into the Commerce Department as an act of vengeance so if there doesn't much matter that it's there except that people don't know it's there and it is it's the single most important institution within the Commerce Department\nAre and it does it eats most of the resources and it and what it does um is absolutely critical and er into this place Trump is put the most really about the worst person you could possibly put to run it\nAnd you're talking about Barry Myers who is the C. E. O. N. accuweather I that sounds actually like a good thing he runs a weather predictions\nWell I'm so here's the problem are typically the person who runs NOAA has as a science background and Barry Myers is a lawyer but let's leave that to one side it's a ... you know as a giant science operation um\nThe problem is that the national weather service uh which has been a ... a fabulously successful operation I mean people don't pay much attention to it but but the weather prediction has gotten generally\nDramatically better over the last few decades we we can predict the paths of hurricanes and we can give tornado warnings a faster than we used to be able to give them and I mean ... and just the you know the daily forecast has gotten better uh all of that saves lives and property\nIf that's the mission of the national weather service to save lives and property to do it it has to\nCommunicate with the public uh it it has to let the rest of it as it has to be good at communicating with the public and Barry Myers a has been on a two decade mission to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the public so that accuweather\nCan do it instead and that's how accuweather gets paid and so he has had bills introduced in Congress to sexually forbid the national weather service from from doing anything but warning in ... right in advance of a a a weather event that might kill you\nAnd the problem with is is that well in the first place\nIs that the the the the data that that is required to generate weather prediction\nIs all paid for by the taxpayer I mean that the these billion dollar satellites that are hovering over us the uh the ... the ... the network of radar stations across the country that the national weather service spends the bulk of its money accumulating the data that and then makes available for free\nTo companies like accuweather so they can go and you know\nAdvertise the whether there's no real reason why the taxpayer should have to pay for this twice having paid for the date of the national weather service really should be able to give people forecasts but what he's been trying to do is Oregon ... is actually a kind of exclusive rights\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all he needs to do his business for free\nYou know you're saying that the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons all the high tech stuff that um\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News that the sound of a free press\nTo use that data and make money from it and his argument is that I shouldn't have to compete with the government but it's a very strange argument because the government gives him basically all they need to do is business for free\nYeah you're talking about the weather satellites weather radar weather balloons oh the high tech stuff that I'm\nThat no private company that no private company on its own would have the wherewithal to to pay for that it is a naturally or a government operation and so naturally a government operation to deliver a weather forecast to the public\nSo Barry Myers or had been like one vote away from Senate confirmation where does that stand now\nHis nomination is stalled so he's not in the job yeah\nMy guess is Michael Lewis his new book is called the fifth risk we'll talk more after a break I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Michael Lewis he's best known for his books like money ball the big short and the undoing project all of which have been best sellers his new book the fifth risk is about the federal government under Trump and it examines the energy agriculture and commerce departments\nAfter President Trump\nWas inaugurated he sent in what you describe as a small landing team led by Thomas Pyle the president of the American energy alliance which you describe as you know a group funded with millions of dollars from Exxon Mobil and Koch Industries\nThat basically represents their point of view [noise] so what was the landing team and what was piled tasked with doing\nSo landing team is a grand phrase for what arrived at the department of energy because it was really just pile and he didn't show up until a month after the election\nAnd he would have been in theory tasked with receiving you know hundreds of hours of briefings from people in the department of energy who would prepare them but he what he did instead was met met for about an hour with a couple of people in the secretary's office and listen politely and didn't take notes\nAnd the people who were running department or jihad the impression that he had no interest in what they had to say\nOne of the things he did um as part of the court landing team will send a list of Seventy four questions he wanted answers to Seventy four questions to the department of energy what were some of the questions\nWanted lists of uh names of anybody in the department who attended meetings that were associated with the climate change he was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him a list of names\nBut he ... the bigger point\nStreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu slash I I I\nDidn't meetings that were associated with the climate change he was trying to identify people who might be hostile to the fossil fuels industry I think so the department didn't actually respond by giving him the list of names\nBut he ... the bigger point was\nHe came in in what were they interpret it as a hostile spirit I'm signaling that the new administration was not did not approve of the various attempts the department of energy was making to wean us from fossil fuels and it is you know part of the department of energy's mission to\nEngage in and fund basic research in alternative energy\nSo you know your previous book about the science of of risk and about trying to kind of clout to find a way how the human mind works when it's assessing risk that book was called the undoing project do you feel in a way that your new book could have been called the undoing project because in some ways\nDepartments and you know I in the Trump Administration are getting on ... ... there aren't a lot of people to replace the people from the Obama administration yet and some of the people who have been put in positions to run those departments are antagonistic toward those departments\n[noise] so yes but there's actually there's actually direct connection between the undoing project my last book in this one is what got me into this book in the first place [noise]\nOne of the insights that drops out of the work of the psychologist Dan economist and Amos diversity who are studying the way people judge risk\nIs that when you changed the odds people don't sets it especially with catastrophic risk you take something that is there's a one and a million chance of it happening\nAnd change it to one in ten thousand people don't feel that and I was thinking of that when Trump came in and approached the federal government the way he did because\nOne way of thinking of the federal government is is this vast portfolio of risks many of them potentially catastrophic risk the risk of a pandemic or or the risk of a a nuclear accident or risk of a terrorist attack or the ... one after another and many of these\nAre not risk that most people are thinking about the risk that the nuclear waste site in half or Washington leeches plutonium into the Columbia River and poisons the\nWhole Pacific Northwest and I thought Trump's approach\nIs effectively taking lots of you know wanting to million are wondering how hundred thousand risks and making them more likely making them all more likely\nBecause he's putting people in charge of the risk you don't know anything about it\nAnd I thought the society doesn't feel it caught him and he showed you the people don't really feel this and that insight as what got me going in the first place\n[noise] so you used to work on Wall street way back in the day and you wrote about that experience in your first book liars poker last month mark the tenth anniversary of the financial collapse of two thousand eight the market has more than recovered over that time\nBut some people are starting to say this might

starting to say this might be another bubble um\nHow are you interpreting having written a book recently about risk and having you know been having written about the financial crisis what you've done um I'm actually in what your thoughts are about whether we are now in terms of financial stability and\nEnd world markets [noise] well I'm a big question\nWhat is it a question you're asking me to predict the bad things going to happen next\nWell I I Know that's not really your job but\nYou know it's not my job but you know if I ... that I Would love to have one outlandish prediction on the record not that I think it's going to happen but like it's a sort of thing that if it does happen I think a lot of people will go oh my God that's exactly where we were headed all\nAssuming Donald Trump remains president for a while\nI think there's at least the possibility of the risk that he will try to default on the American debt selectively like he'll say oh the Chinese are trying to sell their treasury bonds is causing disruption and the treasury bond market they stole money in the first place from is we're not going to pay the Chinese back\nThis is a all our way of saying that\nI think the risk now in the financial system is political risk\nI at the banks are much better capitalizing better regulated and they were ten years ago I don't think there's gonna be a directly a banking crisis but I think there could be a crisis in faith in the dollar and in us credit worthiness our deficits are exploding\nWe have a president who has a history of defaulting on debt\nHe's riled up lots of emotions hostile emotions to foreigners who hold the debt\nI'm a ... that wouldn't shock me and that would trigger a financial crisis a so why\nWould if you treat the financial crisis\nWell because the dollar is the world's reserve currency lots of lots of people hold it assuming it's going to be more or less stable\nThey'd be a flight out of the dollar a U.S treasury bonds of the benchmark for a ... of risk a risk was asset in the world would everybody kind of measures themselves off of it's assumed to be\nYou know better than gold ... if that if that is called into question and then treasury bonds are going to collapse in the interest rate which the U.S government can borrow is going to skyrocket\nUm this is the doomsday scenario and just kind of playing with it here\nBut if you asked me to like ... predict\nWhat might trigger a the next financial crisis I think it's I think I Would predict it some sort of political event and it would be that sort of thing and if that happened you know it's fun when you predict things finding sort of predict things where where ... when they happen they make sense of a lot of things that have happened leading up to it\nAh I think a lot of people would say oh my God we should have seen that coming [noise]\nMy guess is Michael Lewis and his new book is called the fist risk and the book is about the federal

yourself\nI think I was I think that that's fair a kind of um\nYou know how did I ended up here I mean her blaming second wave feminism for her I mean it's such a\nDemented thing to do but then I found it understand what she said I remember my producer was trying to follow the the logic of the writing and she was like well um she sort of the leaps to that and I said you know it's buttering this isn't like a rational this is a kind of\nUpsets buttering person then this is what's flying out of her mouth it's not a well thought out argument but I get it on an emotional level I get why she feels betrayed by some notion of like a\nYou know be independent and you don't need you know pursue your career and it's not like Lori is time ever said that exactly you know she really can't be blamed but I Know what Catherine's character is talking about some sense of\nLike a license to pursue your\nAh to pursue the other part of your life not the wife part not the mother part but the other

I mean now there's so many older parents in a way but and maybe the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years younger than your dad I don't know but yeah he he also felt like he was out of time he was sort of\nYou know it was a bubble and we lived in Los Angeles and everybody seems sort of modern and in the seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking as Paul mall\nDreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu slash I I I\nMean the idea of having a mom that was Twenty years

seventies and she just seemed like I said like smoking as Paul malls and his sued and and had a compulsive gambler he was really like a character\nSo you made three feature films two of them are about being a daughter and her new one is about becoming a parent or your first one slumped in Beverly Hills is on\nYou live with your father and he moved you and your brother to Beverly Hills and\nHe was broke basically [laughter] but he wanted you to go to good schools so he'd find like the cheapest places he could possibly find in Beverly Hills for you to stay so you'd have a good ZIP Code and can go to a good school there\nAnd it was just like a weird weird existence your second film the savages is based on what happened when your father had dementia and you had to move him\nTo um a a a nursing home and he was not as usual he was not appreciative of what you were doing [noise] I'm In part because of the dementia in part because he's just not\nYou didn't depict him as the appreciative type [noise] I'm right and there isn't a strange men need between\nYou and between the director and a father and also between the character and her brother so unusual coming together and of course the new movie is about you know a woman in her forties trying to to have a child through whatever means necessary [noise] um and so no matter which way you kind of turn the camera what\nYou've been looking at in your movies is\nUm is family and you know the\nComplications of having one wanting to have one and I'm Wondering if you think having such a complicated childhood yourself because of living several years with your father and not being well parents did during that time has majors so focused\nOn the idea of family\nYeah I mean I I must be I mean it's hard to know exactly what goes in to it but I guess I Am I mean our family was super fractured and there were multiple said you know there's actually four children and\nUm we you know didn't live with her mother lived with her father than we lived with her mother a little bit then we moved to Cambridge and my big brother became my legal guardian he adopted us I mean we were pretty we we did a lot of what what is your mother arrangements\nUm when I was a teenager or at that point I had I was living with my dad for ten years and my dad\nUm ... we moved away from living on my dad's plus he was old PS but anyway and I had a little brother and we moved to live with my mother and that was very unstable and kind of crazy and then my oldest brother has ten years older than me um had been\nA living abroad and he returned he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned\nTo uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and I was working in a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Moran high school for a second and then um she was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to\nAnd he was living in ... he was living in Bali actually and he returned to uh go to graduate school at Harvard\nAnd he came to see me and I was living with my mother and he was concerned about me I was a teenager I was pretty depressed and\nI was working at a dry cleaners in Philadelphia and going to lower Marion high school for a second and then um he was worried about me and he said that he was moving to Cambridge to to go to school and did I Want to\nMove with him\nHe's sort of save my life how did he say I didn't because I he paid attention well than I did move in with him and then my little brother we all lived in Harvard housing and they um student housing at Harvard and he sort of ... became our parents\nHe paid attention to us like we had very narcissistic parents know when we were just no one was paying attention and suddenly and it was very chaotic and\nCrazy and then suddenly we were living with like little monks we're so happy\nMy brother was you know getting his PHD and uh and me and my little brother lived in this Harvard housing and we lived on food stamps and student loans and my brother took out and um\nYou know we our lives improved and we became much better students [laughter] school\nWhich was ironic because of course everybody from the outside thought oh they don't have any parents must be wild over there but we were the opposite we were really like monks we were so happy not to be in a chaotic place that we we weren't like the wild family we were like the we were trying to find sanity\nOnce an example of a chaotic moment in your childhood\nUm well you know the stuff in California would be my father's relationship to every landlord that we had in LA because we there was always some drama with the rent and having hostile relationships with our landlords\nBecause my dad although we didn't know why you know the landlords were nice to the kids but I mean now I'm like oh they didn't like it was because dad was probably late with the rent\n'em so there was that there was a kind of general dysfunction in any building we ever lived in\nUm um and then when we lived with my mother she would I guess she was on her second marriage and her second husband was an alcoholic and it was very chaotic and there was never food and the refrigerator but there were things like cocktail food like olives and\nThings that you would put it in a ... marriage you know cherries and ah maybe some parmesan cheese but there was never food food it was very cocktail oriented and then um yeah there's a couple of examples so when you were living with your brother\nWas it was at Harvard and a on a ... yeah it was Harvard housing it was not on the campus but I'm close to it yeah I was in between Harvard Square and Porter Square off mastiff mhm so what is it helpful to you to be in an atmosphere where there were a lot of college students\nYeah it was really it was so different from our weird like LA Nineteen seventies world like living in the outskirts of Beverly Hills which is just specific and strange and\nUm and then go to a you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs uh of the main line and ah [noise] yeah it was just a Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and\nAnd um and then go to you know wherever in Philadelphia which was my mom lived in the suburbs of the main line and ah yeah it was just a Cambridge itself just felt so I mean it was New England it just had a very different feeling\nUm it was and there were you know there was just so much focus in our house because my brother was doing so much and he was getting his you know he's taking care of two kids and getting a ... like twenty five was crazy I mean it was an amazing sacrifice and\nI'd just an amazing act of love and I mean I guess now that I'm Talking about it with you because you're so good at this you're pulling stuff out\nDr gross I'm not that that that even in the wreckage there's this kind of makeshift family that gets put together by any means necessary and in a way all of these movies are sort of like that [noise]", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)",
