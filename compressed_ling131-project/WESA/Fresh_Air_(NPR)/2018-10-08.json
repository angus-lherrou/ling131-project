father and two thousand six after the publication of a book of his poems and songs\nHe asked to read a poem that he'd just written that hadn't yet been published but it's now published in his new book

think in some way or another if we could have urged people to\nUm to consult the work with smaller samples otherwise it takes a a kind of ... tone that I think she would have been very very reticent to uh to accept it\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of existential\nDistance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is troubling you by the idea of you you reading

reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as the sun but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they have ... that have his work as a life outside of his mouth\nAnd his and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room\nQuietly reading his poems\nSo I go and they want to get on record\nAs say oh I Know and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word hallelujah\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or the ... of course when it's attached to song I supposed to lift and ah and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading the poetry\nThat I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm of a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly some into this book in absorbing in as I say really taking the time with the jewels they're embedded in every line taking their own time\nNot with my meter now with my voice\nSince you've declined to read more pounds that your father I'm going to find not being ... cantankerous or intransigent now it's just\nIt's a ... I I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing\nBut I I can I can live with that so I thought I'd play your father reading enough another problem with his from the interview that we

me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about\nSongs and singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like\nWhat is the son and who's singing it um but but you are you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing was a craft that's something people actually did and you must have been grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them anyway you\nKnow of course I heard them yeah no I was a five year old uh on the side of stages watching them being performed a heartless going out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the melodies and then as I grew older there was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\n[noise] and you grow older than you then you sort of see I don't remember um I remember I myself was making a record at the time and I'd scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you

dad you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain and we were sitting on the corner Wilshire and ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and was expecting him to put his hand on my shoulder and say like that's my boy you know altruistic values don't never stopped continue refining but instead he turned to me and said here's scrap your record that's an amateur move\nSandwich or move he says yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd\nAt that moment I realized that um\nThe la vida always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but it was also about their intention out he was holding up the baton that he had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that ah\nThat baton off the ground [noise] were you and your parents separated um five six and ... the don't remember how much did you get to see a father after that [noise]\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfection of\nA union between two people who has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father\nWas able to stay in his children's life\nDespite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me um I my mother moved my sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow our own whims\nAnd my father would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nVeto he's he always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\nSo ... has like a mobile home [noise]\nOh yeah the like what do you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing mhm yeah I remember my mother moved my sister and I all the way to south of France where we live to\nAnd there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things he put it at the at the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so uh [noise] you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of and\nHow is it that far\nWell he did that and variations of that throughout my entire life and and as I say the the the intent to be part of his children's live um the deliberate dissuade which he\nContorted his own life

rights to your father's side that's kinda like stealing his soul to sell all the publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] yeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry and incredible the [laughter]\nThe to the canon of his work with his devotion to black cutting pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself and um when you experience this uh this episode that you're referring to it actually did compel him back\nOut of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um episode of his life which was to to discover that all this time absence made the heart grow fonder who knew\nYou'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that Kurt Cobain and and others you know would quote him and\nUm but it didn't result in the kind of mass appeal and lo and behold from this economic crisis arose this most unexpected and\n[noise] festive of periods in his life I Want to say
