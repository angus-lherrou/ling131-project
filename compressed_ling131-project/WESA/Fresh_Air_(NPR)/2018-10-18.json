like anti Jewish rhetoric but they're you know really on the fringes um\nAnd it's really been a wakeup call in the last few years to feel like oh not only are they not in the fringes but there are some of them running the country\nAnd they're they have a lot of power and there are a lot of anti Semitic sentiments still floating around out there and doing a lot of damage um and that's been very scary to me but also scary how little I recognize it or was aware that it was happening\nUm especially big some for someone who\nYou know as a Jew you hear the story of the Holocaust over and over and over growing up and the story of the Holocaust is people didn't see it coming they were swimming in it and they thought it was a passing thing\nRight there are Jews who felt like well I'm not Jewish I'm German these are my people they're not going to turn against me who were shocked when their own neighbors started you know throwing rocks into their shops and stabbing them and cutting off their beards\nAnd so it's it is a scary time for a lot of reasons and anti Semitism is unfortunately still one of them\nAnd you know officially one of the Jews who control the media\nI guess I Am right um but even even that kind of joke or I Would feel comfortable saying five years ago and now I kind of feel like oh no there's people who believe that\nThey set up because it's the ... and like I think yeah and I and I would\nSay a couple of years they'll be like oh yeah we do control the media is not hilarious um and now I think yes I Am a Jew and I have some power in the stories that I put out and I'm very glad of that power um but we don't maybe have the power that people think we have\nSo your mother and grandmother ran a bookstore you are diagnosed with attention deficit disorder when you were in high school\nYeah that's about I don't you remember if it was middle school or high school but somewhere around then\nSo it was a difficult for you to concentrate long enough to to read books\nUm yes or sometimes you know I I I could always reading books that I was interested in and some people can't even do that and I was lucky that I had a form of ADHD where if there is something that really interested in me I I could focus and do it you know the problem is in school you have to focus on a lot of things that you're not interested in\nAnd there was a while where I wasn't diagnosed where it felt like something is wrong with me and no one quite knew what it felt like oh I'm just a troubled child I just don't behave\nAnd you know I think there was a misunderstanding at the time that I took a pride or a pleasure in it or you know like oh look at this kid he's you know he loves making a scene he loves being the center of attention and I did enjoy sometimes being the center of attention ensure like any kid you know I loved it audience that I Love making people laugh\nBut a lot of it too is I I had trouble understanding what was appropriate behavior and I just didn't know and I I Would try to fit in and I couldn't you\nKnow and it was inappropriate that you did that you didn't realize it inappropriate\nKnow like one time in math class I remember standing up and dropping my parents are everyone can see my underpants inappropriate inappropriate and\nI remember at the time I didn't do it thinking oh I'm I'm being edgy here pushing the boundaries I did it because I thought oh this'll be a funny thing and then I was mystified that oh now I'm In trouble it like it did not occur to me that there'd be a cause and effect this action that would lead to me

going to say it\nAnd I had a really hard time understanding the distinctions and navigating when it was okay to disrupt the class and save this funny thing and when it was not okay\nI thought that was more of a symptom of being a comic then attention deficit disorder [laughter] well\nI think those things are related a little bit for me at least um I don't necessarily know the difference I mean you know the problem with ADHD and other a mental or or learning disorders is not necessarily a quantifiable diagnosis you know it's not oh you have this thing therefore you're this or we're going to give you this pill and you're going to stop doing this\nPrecisely it it does feel like a science of gray areas and it's hard to say yes am I\nA comedian because I have ADHD or do I have you know comedians disease that was diagnosed as ADHD and and what are the overlaps and what does this mean I I still am not quite sure\nWhat what is TV like a safe space where are you where you can like unless yourself and television and be really comfortable like did you live more in the world of what you were consuming than the actual world and the reason why I ask that is that like there are so many pop culture references\nAnd blow jak horsemen and some of them like just like whiz by you and it happened so quickly you can barely like catch some of them\nUm that made me think like you must have just like absorb pop culture all the time when he was growing up\nYeah well TV made sense to me and you know there is a a correlation and causation chicken or egg conversation to have here but on TV when someone thought of a funny thing they said it right even if it was maybe an awkward situation maybe especially if it was an awkward situation there definitely\nWas a period in my life where I thought of the funny thing even if it was mean even if it was inappropriate\nIf I thought it would get a laugh from an imaginary audience who didn't exist I Would say it I Would make this seem that I was living in feel like the scenes that I was seeing on TV and that was a a real lesson that I had to learn\nUm and I think what's been helpful is being a writer and having an outlet and now\nIf I Am in a situation I think of the funny thing I can write it down and say oh I'm going to hold onto this and I'll have a character say later I don't need to say it to this person in this moment or if I think it was a funny situation you know oh wouldn't it be funnier awkward if I if I did this thing or someone came in here and did this\nI can save and go you know why would I give us away for free in this

Frank combat still own at that time of his death out there to awesome clued all the buildings that had been transferred from ... to the children\nThey included both of the buildings that had been transferred down the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much ISIL empire and it's sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer name or be shown in the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learn through the the the documents that we went through that that sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars than what the banks would value it out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much laugh\nSo it wasn't like the deal of the century that Tom and Donald Trump may it definitely wasn't so the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the IRS\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely got away with it so it's true that the virus actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did\nPush back some and especially on the lower valuations they're placed on buildings and made the trumps pay for a few million more bucks on this returning from three million more bucks on that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nMost families who you know wealthy families who are the most expensive\nLegal and accounting helping Hoon gauge in these very sophisticated maneuvers to to avoid or the taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more\nMeanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of simply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just in a state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video the art or the comeback or The Apprentice\nAnd tell us all it actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public\nWhich one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking\nFree ... read it for the the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nWell for your publishers are coming back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the mark of his casino collapse and through shows grit and determination and why are we negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within a few weeks of the publication of this book\nSo happens to coincide with the time when you actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate tax schemes that we describe in the store it\nSo at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually cause it's perfectly with the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way\nNot a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money money\nThat happened in two thousand and four\nI'm right as the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Trump and yet when you watched that opening scene it's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that Fred Trump belt and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering\nHow you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities and so many people still believe the math and Donald Trump is still putting\nForward in that it's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've reset dot I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first stop in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think the the power of the story is\nYou know I think that how careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true in the documents were there and and a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times says basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access into or locked up in this room [noise] um ... who cleaned it who is allowed [laughter]\nWe uh we did not have the cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come in one day with a with a little vacuum and and [laughter] but we're\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\nI'm with a yeah that's a pretty messy ... it'll claustrophobic too I Would imagine that other people know why you were locked up in this room [noise]", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "18"}
