President Obama from choosing Scully a successor and Brett Kavanaugh who replaced Anthony Kennedy after Kennedy retired\nNow the chief justice John Roberts is also considered the most likely swing vote in a court that has five conservative justices my guest David Kaplan says the court has reached the point where justices are often seen as political proxies of the Republican or Democratic Party\nHis new book is about how the court became so politicized and so powerful that\nAlso includes profiles of several of the justices the book is based in part on cap and interviews with several of the current justices as well as pass justices sixty five law clerks who worked at the Supreme Court and congressional and White House officials dating back to the Reagan Administration\nA lot of the interviews were done on the condition that he not named the source\nKaplan is also a former legal affairs editor at Newsweek where he covered the Supreme Court for a decade his new book is called the most dangerous branch inside the Supreme Court's assault on the constitution\nDavid Kaplan welcome to fresh air so one of the main themes of your book is that the court has become so politicized you can predict how each justice will vote it's become politics by another name elaborate on that idea for us\nWell on those hot button issues like abortion and same sex marriage and voting rights and gun control and campaign finance you pretty much know ahead of time where they're going to come out so the larger question I'm trying to asked in the book is whether the court ought to be as interventionist\nAnd as involved in American Life\nAs it is and during for example the recent Kavanaugh's confirmation hearings you heard questions about specific issues like abortion or presidential power but nobody asked\nWhether the court is properly involved in so many of these political and social issues because everyone pretty much assumes a that it ought to be\nIn what sense do you think that the court is overstepping\nScreaming on WGN supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu slash I I I\nDo often they choose to hear

I think there are a lot of concerns now that we have two justices\nIn the Supreme Court who has been accused of sexual misconduct Clarence Thomas the sexual harassment and Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault and these men might have decisive votes in matters pertaining to gender equality sexual assault or sexual harassment issues\nAnd it questions the credibility of the ... court because they might be very biased in their opinions\nWhether they're a bias or as you know have the appearance of bias is a real problem for the court and there is no real solution I don't for example I think you will see recusal in such areas of the law I don't think you'll see\nScreaming on W.

E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu slash I I I\n... when it doesn't suit them they ignore it I think it's a lot of nonsense and of course the most important thing about the whole original is a a a a trope is that if you look at the constitution and I've read mine a lot\nThere is no cause in the constitution that says thou shall interpret me based on what you thought those who wrote me two hundred and fifty years ago thought it's nonsense\nLet's do something you say about originalism is that because you're trying to literally follow what the founding fathers meant when they wrote the constitution\nA time when there was slavery at a time when women did not have equal rights\nYou say that originalism favor as a status quo fixed in the Eighteen century and it tends to favor the halves of that time and to this favor all other such as minorities and other unpopular lead against and maybe we can add women to that\nAll true but of course the constitution is not written as a set of regulations some constitutions the world are written that way when you use phrases like a equal protection of the laws or due process of law\nOr no unreasonable searches and seizures when you write things in such general terms you necessarily are inviting those who interpret you whether they are judges or presidents or senators I'm to use their own\nJudgments as to what it means that's why you write a constitution\n[noise] do you think that justice is in general have become more politicized in recent years than they've been in the past yes okay why do you think that is\nI think in part because the selection process that we use now and the better if more cynical\nA process that White House is used to pick nominees results in such candidates you know the Brett Kavanaugh is a competent judge show was Neil Gorsuch but they weren't chosen because of their stellar credentials those were necessary requirement for getting chosen\nThey were chosen because I thought they'd vote the right way\nIn the same way I think that was made against ... was chosen by Bill Clinton and it's so do some Sonia Sotomayor for example was chosen by Iraq Obama and you know you can blame presidents that are blamed the Senate but I I think you in the first instance you need to blame the court because it gets involved\nSo often it raises the stakes of who sits\nOn the court so if the court is in effect going to govern the country on so many key issues than you really need to look at how you think individual members of the court are going to vote when you do that politics the role of a politics necessarily becomes heightened it wasn't\nAlways that way when John Paul Stevens was picked by Gerald Ford\nIn the mid Nineteen seventies\nAnd it wasn't for that reason and I could give you half a dozen a dozen other examples those days are long gone I Would like to see the return of those days\nDo you think that politicized politicization of Supreme Court nominees but includes how Mitch McConnell blocked Merrick Garland from even coming to the Judiciary Committee after he was nominated\nAbsolutely and and listen if the Democrats get control of Congress ah this this time round or in two years twenty twenty I\nDreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu slash I I I\nRaised the stakes you know they talk about ... about getting rid of life tenure at the Supreme Court that would require a constitutional amendment but if you want to increase the size of the court pack the court\nAs it were all you need is an act of Congress if the Democrats control the house in the Senate or the White House and twenty Twenty one I don't think court packing is off the table at all and if you want to get back\nThe Merrick Garland seat and if you want to take back control of the court\nJust add to more seats a point to liberals than an eleven member court you have a six by majority do I think that's possible yes\n[noise] being a Supreme Court justice is I'm a lifetime appointment you leave when you say you want to leave and how old is your third against but now eighty five\nAnd how it was a jump ... Stevens when he left\nNinety yeah so it's a you can say for a really long time um so a lot of people already good it's a pretty good gig gig [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nUm so the lifetime appointment issue has been challenged by many people because now that people are living to such\nOlder ages than they used to when the Supreme Court was first created you know and when the constitution was first written\nUm the president's power to appoint a Supreme Court justice that's become a much bigger power than it ever was big cuts in part of the extension of\nThe lifespan of Americans [noise]\nUm so you know some people including you have proposed changing the lifetime nature of the appointment why do you think we should consider changing it and what are some of the suggestions you have\nWell would lower the stakes of any particular nomination if for example there was a single term of Eighteen years as many others have suggested in which I indoors I think that would lower the temperature it would allow once you kicked in the system over time because she couldn't make courage justices leave\nIt would allow every president to get your nominations you'd have a new justice every two years I think that would be a great idea it will never happen\nUm I mean I think the most creative idea that I came across was not so much a single term but by staffing the Supreme Court randomly I'm with a rotating series of nine judges picked among the chief judges\nOf the twelve lower federal appeals court in the country\nIf it was just any bunch of judges picked and maybe it wouldn't be a nine to twelve maybe it will be five of twelve then you might\nActually give forced to the idea", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "01"}
