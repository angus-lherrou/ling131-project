they're one of the things you did you had been home schooled\nSo you were pretty isolated from any beliefs outside of your family is racist views\nUm but then you went to college and from the way he describes it in the book was a pretty liberal college in Florida that were Jewish people there you initially tried to hide your identity and then figured you might as well [noise]\nLet people know a before you were ousted by somebody else you placed a magazine [laughter] you must of publication with an article by you and the gym so that people would find it and realize oh God that's Derek

five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nTo you that you hadn't been exposed to before and you thought maybe there's some legitimacy here\nI I think it's very interesting that I'm Matthew Stephenson and Moshe Asher with the people who invited me to Matthew should buy dinners took the strategy that I think was very very smart of ...\nAre not talking to me about it uh I went to those dinners for two years and the white nationalism never came up well every this other thing that we were possibly interested and did\nA and I think the Matthew said that the reason for that or was that\nIt would have been a not as effective at allowing me to see him and dinners as people that when my family is talking about\nSomething anti Semitic that we're not talking about something after we're talking about him or die but his life and this is very human and he wanted to demonstrate that and even if nothing else came from it it would just be that it was it was a person who we were thinking about when we were thinking about Jewish people\nAnd that effective like actually actually meeting Jewish people and having Jewish friends did you see you know Jewish people in general as being human in a way that you hadn't before\nYeah I think that was actually one of the things that changed about my beliefs earliest um was that the Jewish conspiracy part of white nationalism\nWas a little bit loose and nuts and unnecessary uh that didn't undermined the firm believer in racial differences and there are actually white nationalist groups that are already believe that that oh of course Jewish people or white or so it didn't undermine all of white nationalism but it I think it was actually pretty early where\nEither this is this is crazy when you to stop attacking Jewish people to back off\nIn addition to being the story of decks transformation I mean I I think the book is also the story of the real courage shown by a lot of students on this campus who invested themselves in trying to affect\nYou know profound change and they did that and a lot of different ways I mean there was a civil resistance on campus by a group of students who organized the schools shut down and shut down the school and sort of cast Derek out and made it clear to him\nHow how awful and how he'd for and how hurtful this ideology was and it was also students like Allison eventually his girlfriend who ah who won one is trust built in a relationship but also armored herself with the facts and sort of like\nPoint by point went through in and\nUh and showed how this ideology is is built on total misinformation and and then there were also students like Matthew and most Shea\nWho in a remarkable act invited Derek over a week after week after week not to build a case against him but to build a relationship hoping that\nJust by spending more and more time with them he would be able to begin seeing pass the stereotypes to the people into the humanity and and hoping that a relationship in of itself can be transformative\nAnd I think it's important to note that that did not happen quickly and ended they knew the full horror of a lot of the police this ideology and the things that Derrick had said Matthew in ... in between these dinners\nWould sometimes go back through Derek old messages on the storm front site and they would see the horrible things that he said about you is and and ... yeah\nUh Jews warm their way into control over our society Jews Moscow all Jews Moscow and you know in the white nationalist ideology in like the awful pyramid
