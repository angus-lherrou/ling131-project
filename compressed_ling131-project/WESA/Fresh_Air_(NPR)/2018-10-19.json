including confidential tax returns and financial records given to the times by a secret source\nThe documents reveal that by age three Trump was earning two hundred thousand dollars a year as measured in today's dollars from his father Fred Trump's real estate empire\nFred Trump made Donald Trump a millionaire by the time Donald was eight\nOver the years Donald received today's equivalent of four

was able to build very quickly using a lot of the techniques of mass production um he was described as the\nTelling us his story the famous line that he's always said is that you started with a million dollar loan from his father\nHad to pay it back with interest and then he parlay that million dollar loan into a ten billion dollar empire that remained for the most part the dominant narrative that she sold certainly you know to make themselves a celebrity to gain a power and ultimately it's what he campaigned on very heavily\nTo win win the presidency and said this story really dissect that narrative and I think more than anything else offers\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nAnd based on the actual documents in an entirely new financial narrative the forty for president\nWell let me reintroduce you here if you're just joining us my guess is Suzanne ... and David Barstow of the New

a Donald Trump engaged in suspect tax schemes as he reaped riches from his father and deconstruct the whole Donald Trump myth about how as a self made millionaire a billionaire and it shows like how much money Fred Trump Donald's father\nFunnel to him and his other siblings and how they came up with schemes to avoid paying taxes making Donald Trump a very very wealthy man by the time he was a teenager\nOkay so in addition to some of the tax games we talked about\nUm ... made a lot of loans to Donald Trump Donald Trump has always said that he got a million dollar loan from his father and help parlay that antennas into his own empire so how much money would you estimate a Fred Trump gave Donald Trump inlaws [noise]\nUh we were able to document and real dollars sixty million dollars in loans not one million I'm In today's dollars quits two hundred and forty million dollars\nIn loans um which is\nOn top of the four hundred and Thirteen million dollars and direct welfare we saw transferred to dawn what we what we also saw it was in what is important also is that in many cases um these were loans that were never reported him and he would take her out [noise]\nUm we were looking at one particular year was like every month\nHe's going back to doubt him his barring another couple of hundred thousand bucks and then another five hundred thousand bucks a million dollars it was just like a monthly roamed to to Fred Trump to get more money and we saw especially the the flow of loans increase\nFree ... read it for the the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\n[noise] when she was suddenly in trouble you run into another financial ditch um so it was a really steady stream it went well beyond you know the notion of a guy in those early twenties getting a million dollars from that and then of being off to raise\nThese were loans that actually extended well into his forties and fifties\nSo so how did Donald Trump use the money that was alone from his father\nYeah he use the money for many of his ventures the how Trump Tower um money that he got from Trump was used to support that it was used to support\nHis ventures in Atlantic City\nAnd elsewhere um many of them went under I mean especially if you look at Donald Trump's history in Atlantic City he's got several several bankruptcies at one point he was hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and this is the time he not only on the banks hundreds of millions of dollars\nUm he was in debt to his father was going to his father at these very crucial times for more support\nSo he gets a lot of money from his father tries to build his own empire and ended up in debt and a lot of instances instead of making a fortune from his own investments\nThat also see that when his cell and then when he would fall down the safety net was there for Trump safety was there to catch them\nThere's one spooked just almost unbelievable moment in the store and you see it in Nineteen Ninety and this was a time\nAnd the you know the back of Nineteen Ninety and Donald Trump is incredible financial distress a number of his company as are either in trouble they're facing bankruptcy\nAnd Fred Trump had been there for him at every turn according to the documents we can see he's assisting him with money in one case I'm Donald Trump's casinos that they're facing a debt payment and Fred Trump has a lawyer\nI'm going to the casino and by casino trips and walk out without placing about it was simply a way to give Donald Trump money ... million dollars worth of it was three and a half million dollars worth of casino trips\nAnd at this period his father is there for him at every turn and every document that we can see and Donald Trump at this period\nHas a lawyer or one of his lawyers draft caught us all to his father's will centrally and knew well and it was caught a soldier the will is taken to Fred Trump's house in December Nineteen Ninety and Fred Trump immediately sees\nThis caught us all as an attempt by Donald to take control of his empire and potentially put at risk and Fred Trump immediately says no he freaks out and he makes a call to his daughter who is a federal judge in the lawyer and\nA new caught us all within months is drafted that removes Donald was the sole executor for Trump's well inputs Donald and Robert Trump and Mary and Trump in charge of his affairs and then ultimately a new well has dropped it but you see in the depths of Donald Trump's financial life\nAfter all his father has done for him that he makes this move to incredibly dramatic move and scarring to the family and what he did\n[laughter] so what you're saying I think that at the end of ... life were toward the end of ... live\nDonald Trump tried to take advantage of him for his for Donald Trump's own good to help Donald Trump bail himself out and Fred tromp Donald's father became suspicious of the sun that he had helped with so much money for so many are\nWhat we know for sure is that Fred Trump\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nAnd complete control over his state and potentially to use\nThe the umpire for Trump doggedly and patiently built over many decades to use that empire does um potentially as collateral to help bail Donald Trump out of his own financial difficulties\nI guess or New York times reporters David Barstow and Suzanne crab after a break we'll talk about another scheme used to transfer of wealth from Fred Trump's real estate empire

eight hundred progressive now that's progressive\nThis is fresh air let's get back to my interview with New York times reporters Suzanne ... and David Barstow who along with rescue near published a long investigative article this month but have Fred Trump use schemes to avoid paying taxes or transferring money from his real estate empire to Donald Trump\nMeasured in today's dollars Donald received about four hundred Thirteen million\nSo then after ... died Donald Trump took the lead and decided they should sell off everything that Fred Trump still own at the time of his death why did Donald Trump make that decision [noise] so\nThing about that sale and it's something that we noticed again and again when we were doing our reporting was that\nFor a Trump very much wanted this empire to stay in the family um he had kept it together um through his whole life and he had hoped that after his death they would keep it and I I think well we can never really get into Donald Trump's mind as to why\nHe saw that in in two thousand and three there was a family meeting\nAnd they had regular family beating softer for Trump died they would hand out checks you know for Trump's buildings were very profitable and they would meet every few months um to get an update on the status of the empire and to get a chalk\nAnd then in two thousand and three at one of these meetings Donald Trump announced that it was time to sell and quickly assemble the private sale to a developer in New York\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News station the sound of a free rent\nIn one sale for just under eight hundred million dollars\nSounds so that the the uh buildings that were selling those buildings ... own at that time of his death about it also includes all the buildings that had been transferred from Fred Trump to the children\nThey included both the buildings that had been transferred out in the ones that he owned it was it was pretty much all empire and it's sold 'em you know the buildings that sold in two thousand four were to a New York developer named Sean and the price tag was just over\nSeven hundred million dollars and what's interesting about that as we learned through the ... the documents that we went through that that sale price was was roughly\nJust under two hundred million dollars than what the banks would value at out you know in the months after the sale so it's it's incredible to see that dot empire um was sold for for much less than they could have got for it very quietly and for much laugh\nSo it wasn't like the deal out of the century that ... it definitely wasn't so if the Trump family was involved with tax fraud and tax evasion scheme how did they get all of this past the I. R. S.\n[noise] but um you know the first of all they actually didn't completely got away with it so it's true that the IRS actually did perform some audits on some of the tax returns that\nWe describe in the story and in fact the IRS ours did push back some and especially on the low valuations they're placed on buildings you made the trumps pay a few million more bucks on this returning from three million more bucks\nOn that return but the way it it really works in this world is you have you know you've got\nAn agency that is pretty over matched overworked an auditor who can walk into a session and can extract a few million dollars and that's a really good day's work for that offer but in the meantime\nThe families who you know wealthy families you hire the most expensive\nLegal and accounting helping who engage in these very sophisticated maneuvers to to avoid or the taxes they're playing a much bigger game and they might be more than happy to pay a couple of million dollars more at the request of an odd or they're looking at the fact that for a couple of million dollars more\nMeanwhile they're walking away avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes because of simply that the mismatch between the resources of the IRS which has been hit very hard by budget cuts that especially hit the people who are looking at just in a state tax returns\n[noise] um so then I'm going to ask you to choose either the art video the art of the comeback or The Apprentice\nAnd tell us all he's actually going on in Donald Trump's financial life when these books or the show based on all his fabulous accomplishments in deals\nOn public I'm\nThinking which one to choose [laughter] what are you thinking David or other come back [laughter] go for it [noise]\nAh well said he publishes the or the come back in Nineteen Ninety seven and it's this story of his sort of\nYou know pulling himself up I'm Out of the ... of his casino collapse and through shows grit and determination and Wylie negotiating skills getting himself back on his feet well within\nFree ... read it for the the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nHappens to coincide with the time when you actually took possession of one quarter of his father's\nReal estate empire through one of these very elaborate\nTracks schemes that we describe in the store it so at this moment when he's boasting about you know his daring do of cutting himself off the map it actually cause it's perfectly when the moment when he was just taken possession of twenty five percent\nOf this enormous real estate empire and somehow some way not a word of that made its way into the book the art of a comeback\nI'm also thinking of immediately or the or The Apprentice and the opening scene of The Apprentice and the song money money money money that happened in\nTwo thousand and four I'm right as the sale had gone through the the hundreds of millions of dollars that they had gotten from Trump and yet when you watched that opening scene\nIt's all Donald Trump Donald Trump's plane is there that that the goal tower in midtown Manhattan when in fact it was all the opening scene that fried Trump belt and paid for\n[noise] I'm Wondering how you feel knowing that you have just totally punctured the mess of how Donald Trump made his money and what he did with his money and his great negotiating deal making abilities\nAnd so many people still believe the mess and Donald Trump is still putting forward in that\nIt's interesting when I think about that I think you have to sort of I go back to that idea that ... you know the lie repeated over and over and passed down into history become stocked\nAnd I think that we've reset dot I think it's going to take time for this to to move into the bloodstream of America\nUm but I think that we've taken I think a good first step in and resetting exactly the origins of Donald Trump's wealth but I Do think it's going to take time and I think there's some people who um are always going to believe what they want to believe but I think that the power of the story is\nYou know I think the whole careful we were and how documented it was and the Times' decision to put so many of those documents up I think it's really hard to refute the story um it's harder for you because it's absolutely true in the documents are there and and a lot of them are the source documents of the Trump family themselves\nUm but I think it will take time for this to sort of\nYou know people for people to digest it and and um but I think it's going to happen\nSo you spent a lot of time in the past year and a half in a in a separate room and the New York times those basically sealed off to everybody except that the three reporters working on\nThis story and all the documents that you drew from that you got access into or locked up in this room I'm ... who cleaned it who is allowed\nTo go you know [laughter] we uh we did not have the cleaner I admit I haven't told anybody this I did come in ... one day with a with a little vacuum and and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city":
