minutes we'll hear an accent of the interview I recorded in September with Garrett black and ... but first we're going to hear the interview I recorded with ... this morning\nSessler welcome back to fresh air I'm Sorry it's such a sad occasion that's bringing back to our program when I heard about the massacre at the synagogue I thought about your book\nGarrett black has renounced his white nationalist views but his father Don black is still a white nationalist and still has the website storm front he did not pull the trigger at the synagogue and I'm not trying to blame him for that but do you find done black story relevant to the views that were expressed\nBy the shooter Robert Bauer\nI think you can draw a straight line from dawn views and Don working this movement to the view expressed by the shooter and when that straight line honestly starts with just the ink on the shooters potty yet a tattoo fourteen eighty eight to white nationalist slogans fourteen or first fourteen word\nFor statement of purpose that is central to what star fuss about securing a future for the white race and the existence of white children and saying things like I'm here because of a white genocide and I can't stand by and watch my people get\nGet murdered 'em as the shooter in this case then when he was out to a guy that's exactly the the language in the motivation to exist on star front and that's\nThe way that they speak about this a quote unquote race for that they believe is underway\nYeah the um ... ... hours had had said that um he believed that Jews were committing genocide against his people\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say this is NPR News the ... the sound of a free press\nDoesn't allow for it uh he's he's one of the most popular people I'm gap Richard Spencer the white nationalist spends a lot of time there have there is a very high representation of white nationalist racist ideas I'm gab yeah and I think the danger of a place like gab um and also the danger of of other social media networks is that\nIt allows for people who already have some of these ideas to sort of cultivate their own reality and\nThat was when he went on gab he saw the messages of only the people that he followed which is essentially one long news feed of confirmation bias and that those are the messages that he was getting he was reading again and again about the care caravan about the invaders about the threat to America and\nSo then suddenly saying something like I Can't sit by anymore and wash my people get slaughtered and that's because\nThat's the message is he's been reading constantly on gab on places like it\n[noise] so have you been following reaction on the white nationalist site storm front to the shooting at the synagogue um\nFried was little free to pursue the truth\nNinety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station\nThe sound of a free press\nAbout to hear and we'll be hearing about the founder of it and we'll be hearing from the founders son so she'll ... what are you reading on storm front now\nThere are some really file I'm sort of celebration of what happened uh there are certainly some people on that message board who would consider him a hero and racial or a A R A N and hold him up in those ways I Would say that the largest reaction storm front and\nIs is what I've seen after many of these shootings and unfortunately there had been many uh several mass shootings connected back to people who have spent time on storefronts over over the last decade and and the reaction has mostly that\nWell this probably isn't quite the way to go about it uh he went a little too far and we don't we don't really believe in and going into a synagogue and murdering people at but the people who are really to blame is not necessarily the shooter himself\nBut our our global with and that Jews who have worked to bring immigrants in here and if you continue to bring in all of these immigrants and you continue to have a quote unquote white genocide underway then you have to expect that every now and then somebody is going to get frustrated and act irrationally that's the main reaction\n[noise] so have you spoken with either done or Darren black since the shooting at the synagogue yesterday\nYeah I've I've exchange messages with Derek in particular and and I think that he's\nHeartbroken at and it's it's much more complicated than that for him because I think every time something like this happens he feels and small waist Gulf War and he wanders and how much of the re messaging that he did it in terms of white nationalism\nPlays into incidents like this I'm Derek was central to creating the phrase white genocide and to to popular I think the movement to then have somebody go into a synagogue and murder eleven people and leave that building thing the phrase that you yourself\nSpread again and again on the radio and for years and you're young life is a ... I think it's it's haunting\nYou liked fast slow is the author of the book rising out of hatred about Derek lack a former white nationalist whose father Don black founded the Internet's largest white

pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAbout that movement with Garrett black who had been one of the young leaders of the movement before we now and seeing those views when he was twenty two he helped popularize some of the buzz words used by powers\nBarracks father Don black is a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan and founded the largest white nationalist website storm front\nDerek Black as the subject of the book rising out of hatred by Pulitzer Prize winning Washington Post reporter Eli sass low who we heard from earlier in the show I interview with black also included sassy though the first question was addressed to Derrick black\nSo you were part of the rebranding process from white supremacy to white nationalism white supremacy meaning white people are better than white national not nationalism kind of turned it down to like it's not that we're better than but we're all better off being separated by by race\nIs like my dad popular everywhere and white nationalism is it that was his thing\nYeah he didn't invent it but he was for it was the main group that really popularized in one of the earliest wants to adopted and when he founded storm front and called it a white nationalist community and he saw that it stinks in between white nationalism in white supremacy as being\nOne that he didn't want anything bad for anyone else who just wanted everybody to be forcibly put in different spaces and that was a\nNot about superiority it was just about the wellbeing of everybody that that's the that was what he thought was the difference there and you know looking back on it there's it's totally irrational I how exactly think you're going to forcibly separate everybody and that that's not supremacy\nFor a second I've always wanted to know the early people who rebranded white supremacy to white nationalism what are they saw that as like a smart move to help mainstream the movement and make it more palatable\nOr whether they really believed that there was a difference between the white supremacy and white nationalism\nThey really did believe they were not\nDoing bad things to other people that the uh accusations of violence and a hatred and racism or just insult put towards them and that they really did just want what's best for white people and then by extension other people and it may be unpleasant to do that but really in the long run everything's going to be much better\nUm the the answer for what they thought rebranding it would do was that they believed America was founded as a white supremacist country and that that was not and gone to the civil rights movement had changed the language and it made it much more difficult to speak about race when their job was just to\nGive people a space to say racist ideas in a more explicit proud a confidante way\nInception was everybody is basically all white people are basically race if they're just afraid to express it so let's give them a language in a safe space\nDo they they don't like the word racist I think that's a made up insult toward they lay\nTheir clients to word [noise] um\nRatio is racial out all over the years if you look at the language in terms of how\nMany people in this movement have identified themselves it went from the KKK to white supremacist to white power\nTo white pride to white nationalist and so every time becoming a little bit more subtle and a little bit more pernicious I think that the thing that's complicated now when we talk about white nationalist first white supremacy is that white nationalism I think\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nPursuing and and cause of separating a\nYou know races into into different homeland Sam White supremacy unfortunately is something that's much more endemic and much more structured into what the country is so if we're talking about these people as white supremacists or it it doesn't quite distinguish the movement in the same way because much of much of the country was founded on things that are white supremacist and many of our structures\nAre based on white supremacy so that's the distinction distinction sometimes in the language that I think is still effective and useful for us as we talk about it\nWe're listening to the interview I recorded in September with Derrick lack a former young leader of the white nationalist movement who has since renounced those views and Washington Post reporter ... who wrote a book about black called rising out of hatred we'll hear more after a break I'm Terry Gross and this is fresh air\nKnow I'm\nThinking of our family foundation supports WHYY fresh air\nAnd its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from the station and from Viking dedicated to bringing the traveler closer to the destination by river and by the offering a small ship experience with a shore excursion included\nAnd yet there you are describing that you were trying to emphasize that immigration would lead to white genocide that white people like these other guys coming and they're going to kill all of us that's really violent language it's\nNot about you committing violence but it's about all the other people who aren't white committing violence committing murder committing genocide against you so it's still the language of vines you just change to the actors are\nAnd who the victims of the hour and ... and the and this was a long process that uh immigration was just going to out number white people in all their countries into that with a threat to all the normal why people who are listening to the radio show or posting and the comments section and the quite unlike\nWhat they were being told they were the aggressors that they were the people were making society worse\nHeading back to being attacked it it's not like all the immigrants are going to take our jobs are they going to speak a foreign language we're not going to understand at an American culture you know when the quote unquote cure you're talking about like genocide like they are going to kill all of us we will no longer exists\nI'm a talking point about white genocide was usually a a little bit less extreme let it sounded it was that um immigration was an attack on white and this and white people and white kittens and the future generations wouldn't be able to have as good a lives of their parents had had because\nSociety was trying to undermine their opportunities to hurt them and that far from having white privilege that they were um being discriminated against that every turn and so a hundred years from now that they wouldn't have a place in this world\nI think it's important to note also that the entire ideology the end point to the ideology is built on a fallacy an end for me when I was reporting and spending time with white nationalist I Would press them on\nWhat you mean that you want to separate people have different races into different places like ... percent ... percent white is okay what percent native is okay what percent Jewish they they don't know they don't they have they have no idea at\nSo which I think it's the core issue that and it raises a nebulous thing that's that that is and that even white nationalist when pressed to have a very difficult time defining because\nA really good example from the moderator discussion forums which were never public\nAh and huge debates would come on on the storm front among the moderators about how we're going to handle this is your how are we going to handle feminism a women's issues how are we going to are we going to do this or that and one of those with how are we going to define who is white because only a white person can be a member of storm front\nBut there's no biological definition of white and so that was very clear there's no way to save the what's the twenty three and me by definition even if that had been around at the time and\nThere's no biological line because if you walk from North Western Europe into south eastern Asia you'll never see the line where white in and were something else starts and everybody was very clear on that so the conclusion the only practical conclusion they could come to as to who is white was that you had a\nGenerally be considered vision\nDreaming on W.

teens gave me a real sense of community outside of my home\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\nUp seeing a lot of life through which is you know taste in music close um treatment of authority and just a sense of perverse closeness I dunno just laid an imprint on me\nSo I'm the group uh skaters who you were friends with our aspired to be friends with what was that culture like\nIt was a lot of different things you know I was always terrible I always wanted to be great I think I still would trade a lot of achievements for certain skateboarding achievements that just I don't think are physically possible for me at this point at thirty four I filmed a lot of ...\nWhy do you think it's a natural draw for somebody in that position\nBecause to be graded skateboarding you have to be willing to slam on your face down ten stairs on concrete over and over and over and over and over again and there's something\nPunishing about that in self punishing about that and there was a great reward that is true we earned even if it's just for you\nYou are you willing to do that when you wanted to skate\nVery briefly in a time where I think I invited pain but I quickly grew out of inviting physical pain in my life and more\nEmotional [laughter] good for you [laughter] yeah I'm\nA member of stars aren't have scars are inside [laughter] ... yeah it's just a general recklessness which are related you are related to this kid's loneliness and so even though this is it my story\nI wanted to show someone going through deep pain and a real sense of hope through community even if that community is just has the flaws to it like small mindedness prejudice massage any\nThat for this kid it's still provided something hopeful and perhaps these young men will grow up and I learned some of this stuff\nWould you have a dream of getting on a skateboard now\n[noise] ah yeah I Dream about it every night I honestly Terry when I tell you I Would trade a lot in my life to be able to do certain tricks\nRight okay I shouldn't use the word dream would you unreality [laughter] every considered an escape or now\nI landed a case for it in front of our cast and crew in order just a out of being so exciting exhilarated by everyone skating but be to just prove that this is something that at one point was a massive part of my life\nLet's take a short break here and then we'll talk some more if you're just joining us my guest is Jonah Hill and he's just written and directed his first film and it's called mid nineties and as you can tell from our conversation\nIt's set among a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll be right back and we'll talk about some of the films he

again about all The Simpsons scripts that you wrote when you're a kid did you ever try submitting one of them\nI Know I wrote letters to the writers and I never heard back but I never tried submitting them\nWould you be willing to share a story line or a joke from one of your early script\nHere's where I'll say I think the strongest episode was I was a single file since a young age my parents were incredibly ah let's just say how would I put it\nThey encourage me or let me watch movies beyond my age because they saw how interested I was in film so perhaps ignore the content matter if certain [laughter] but I maybe should have waited to see till I was older so I had seen the godfather to really young age because if my dad's favorite movie and\nI wrote a Simpsons godfather spoof\nWhen I was probably like nine or ten now I think is a I was when I went back as an adult I was like wow that was the end now\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\nSimpsons were clever for a nine year old [laughter]\nWho is who Marge was Don Corleone [laughter] because as a nine year old I was like Marge is so much smarter and quietly smarter than Homer so she would be the chess player sort of quiet low key chess player that would become the Don\nNo excuse me she's Michael so OK okay barges Michael a grandpa Simpson is is Don he dies right away though so Marge is Michael way to Homer fan\nNo Homer see that would be that would make margin Homer siblings so even in my nine year old mind I knew that was not going to work so Homer is\nA K [laughter] like I tell us Diane Keaton like [laughter] where are you gonna go legit you know [laughter] but ah\nLenny and Carl homers friends from work or when he was afraid to do and Carl was sunny and I don't know I mean it's not actually clever but for a nine year old I was like wow it's interesting that\nYou have the um fishing or the or or even I guess\nThe wherewithal to know who would be the character equivalent of\nWho tend\nTo think of that story and character in that way and to make connections between things that I think that's pretty great what are some of the movies that were beyond your age as a kid that your parents let you watch because you love movies so much\nI'll tell you a story that I I find interesting because\nI mean I saw everything I devoured film I continue to I Love it so I'd ran through so many films and I would go to the newsstand and you know your parents take you to the magazine than when you're a kid and you flip through magazines or if there's a magazine see on the corner and they're out another place or something\nI Would look through the film magazines I was just so interested so I Would ask them often can I see this film can I see this I mean most of the time they say yeah so basically it came down to two films that I wasn't allowed to see [noise]\nUm they said we are so mean you you don't even realize how lucky you are you cannot see kids and you cannot see a clockwork\nOrange well kids is all about kids similar to the kids in your movie\nIt's a seminal movie in my life kids is a huge influence on me as a filmmaker but this film is in the opposite of kids were kids is so beautiful and it's ... and it's the world ending tomorrow burn the world down\nAnd this film mid nineties is all about connection and hope even if it's dysfunctional connection and hope and\nThose are the two movies I wasn't allowed to see so of course I made it my mission to see both of them right away I think I was eleven or twelve how did you do it\nUm a friend of mine who ... who is older had both cassettes at his house\nAnd I saw kids and I was like I Love skateboarding I Love New York\nThis is about kids skateboarding in New York I completely was too young to understand the AIDS subplot or main plot I guess and so I completely wasn't affected by that so I was just like this is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life it wasn't till I was older that I understood\nThe HIV aids plot murder film because it went over my head so I just took wow this is subversive and this is dangerous you know [noise]\nAnd then I saw a clockwork orange and I had to go to my parents like a shell of a child and be like you were right I saw it [laughter] disturbing and I need to talk to [laughter] like you know like a lot\nDreaming on W.

course it was to have you so so hard to watch as an adult let alone a kid what are your parents had a reassurance you [noise]\nWell first of all they were like you should listen to us because we're telling you to die for a reason yeah and then of course didn't for many many years and realize they were trying their best I think\nUltimately it did make me braver as an artist in life because I Do think about that and I think ultimately there's something about me that draws me two\nThings that are difficult and maybe I'm uncomfortable with comfort and I think my acting career says that when I really dissect it as well\nMy guess is Jonah Hill he wrote and directed the new film mid nineties about a group of skate boarders in the mid Nineteen nineties we'll talk more after a break\nAnd Marine

nineties and set among a group of teen skate boarders in the mid nineties [noise] you know it's been interesting to like first see\nKind of like um come into manhood\nOn screen because she was started in your teens I'm super bad you a lot in your early twenties\nYeah and and now like in the past I don't know bunch of years five six seven years you start to play more dramatic roles you know in films like Wall Street and money ball [noise]\nHow did you get the word out to film directors that you were interested in making the transition to more dramatically [noise]\nIt's just by choices you know um I had seen the puffy chair which I loved and I reached out to the ... brothers after super bad came out and I was like I Would love to work with you\nAnd they gave me this part and Cyrus which is a film that I Love is that um was a great experience with John ...\nAnd then and Catherine Keener and then Bennett Miller was making money ball and Catherine had talked about me to ban it and then then it's off Cyrus and cast me money ball\nAnd then in the interim a\nContinue to do some comedy films that were funny and fun and then uh I had heard about the wolf of Wall Street and I asked you audition\nAnd um I knew that was going to be a fight to get that part but I I knew I wanted that part really badly\nAnd then when I wanted to write and direct I think I had a lot of opportunities to do that if I ...\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free rent\nA\nAnd when I really thought about it I was like wow things in my life are happening that are intense\nAnd am I going to be happy\nJust doing what is expected of me or what my heart really watch so I have to figure out who I Am I have to figure out how to love who I Am\nAnd I have to figure out what my voice is as a filmmaker and when I looked to my heroes like Mike Nichols or Barry lemon center people that started out in comedy and ended up having great filmmaking careers\nI looked at their first films and a lot of times they came from a really personal place and they weren't just funny they were they felt like life and they felt like all the pain and joy of life\n[noise] why don't we hear a scene from a Wolf of Wall Street\nWhich was directed by Martin Scorsese and written by parents winter who was also the show runner for the HBO series Boardwalk Empire\nAnd so this ... this is a movie that I'm a based on the story of Jordan Bell Ford who was a corrupt stockbroker who made his fortune in penny stocks schemes\nAnd eventually went to jail for for fraud and in this scene Jordan played by Leonard Leonardo DiCaprio is in a diner and he's approached by Donny Adolf played by you\nWho eventually becomes a business partner but this is their first meeting\nUm so you start the scene [noise]\nMake such a gun on\nWhen the only thing I think we live interested in building\nTwelfth floor yeah well for your for shall we will ... [laughter]\nWhat do you do for a [noise]\nFor work wages stockbroker\nGerms furniture for you [noise] so right [noise]\nYeah I Do a referee myself I'm trying to put it together in my car in the same building I'm just I'm not\nUnderstand how how much money [noise]\nSeventy thousand last month [noise]\nI'm sure there are no serious to [noise] to see how much money [noise]\nFor old you are so many thousand so technically Seventy two thousand [noise]\n\nI tell you what [noise]\nYou show me paste up or Seventy two thousand dollars I quit my job right now and I worked for you [noise]\n\nMakes fun it was an I quit\nAnd he he quit his job was a little weird I mean I just met the\nGets officers as a visitor well the things about him to like phosphorus and white T ... I got to do with your wife back to the war torn rooms with clear lenses just look more walks\n[laughter] okay so that's the thing that Leonardo DiCaprio and my guess Jonah Hill from the wolf of Wall Street um what did you learn from working with Martin Scorsese on off of Wall Street\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free friends\nTo just show their behavior as people and the characters in his films often do really ugly things and you still find humanity in them and I like how\nUnabashedly and unapologetically he shows human behavior for better or worse\nWhich is something you've tried to do in your new movie\nWhich is I think something that really speaks to meet in art in general and something I'm going to strive\nTo do if I'm lucky enough to get to make another film and something that I tried to do in mid nineties\nIf we don't want to leave it back to The Simpsons I mean our kind of you as a ... minute terrible father can be viewed but he also in Italy loving big hearted person right so you know it's like I guess I'm interested in the gray area okay\nSo this weekend the Saturday you're going to host Saturday Night live November third\nSo I'm going to play an excerpt of a Saturday Night live sketch that you when you hosted in twenty fourteen and it's the sketch that most took me by surprise and when I say me I mean me personally so you played a six year old who's with a step mother\nHad a vending hunter restaurant seated at a communal table and you're you're acting like this like six year old insult comic with all the insults directed at your stepmother Dr Debbie Wasserstein has played by NASA bear and she's trying to make you stop [noise]\nInappropriate inappropriate she wasn't even beyond the drive over my nightmares will take place in Syria and stalked Terry Gross [laughter]\nMaybe a good thing I don't want to train whistle every once in a while [noise]\nOkay and you say [laughter] I was so shocked as in light of the name check on the show [laughter]\nThere's so many layers to why that is humorous to here at this moment\nOh it's just so funny um I think the idea of a little kid who behaves like an old insult comic the whole thing was like\nHe like an old man but he's still a little kid so the fact that he has to listen to NPR thing were boring to a kid even though he's so aware to talk about the show with such detail and understanding but that actually that character came about years\nAnd years ago I did the first um this'll be my fifth time and I guess I hosted first for super bad so I was probably like twenty three or something [noise] um\nAnd I was at dinner a few weeks before randomly with with um bill Hader and Andy Sandberg and I think a key ... oh Seth Meyers was there and\nA bill Hader and told a story about a go into a Benny ... in his home town and there was a kid who he couldn't tell whether the kid was like six or like forty [laughter] and\nWhen the when the chef did his trick vacated lean back in clapped his one hand against the table almost like Tony Soprano style I think I just started\nDoing the kid is if he was like an old Catskills comedian and then that's where when I got there a few weeks later we were like oh we should try that as a sketch and then we ended up doing it a bunch of times", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "30"}
