formed a few chords but not really and you know frankly learning there's music for this film of emergency listening to it or is probably one of the greatest joys I've ever had in my life professionally or personally I\nLoved this music so much you know a particularly pet salads and smile\nI don't know Brian for somebody who struggled so much she had so much light in him and he met him\nYes yeah and when he when we talked about music he's still felt like a school boy about it you know um you could be quite uncomfortable about most things but if you were with him and got into music you know he he really but but by light inside him I mean\nYou know he's he's really he's giving a piece of himself\nTo us and I think he wanted to help people heal which is such a considering the struggles that he had and you just heard in this scene you know to want to\nGive give that I'm through your music to somebody else who's experiencing you know I'm is just such a beautiful

returned it totally I get it yeah unseen their core changes in love and mercy are so beautiful and so unpredictable and um so what did you have to learn those courts like you to know how to play those ... let alone the sequencing of them\nNo no no no and I really started from basics and um and that was just so beautiful to have the piano opened up to me through Bryan I'm because the voice things did he teach you the court's not Brian a guy named area and isn't as bad as um helped me out and uh you know just started practicing day by day\nAnd same with doing vocal exercises you know and and and that's a really nice routine for somebody preparing for something let's say let me do thirty minutes a day of of singing at first and in this amount of piano and slowly you know learn you learn your chops sort of build them up get comfy\nBut I'm the other really fascinating thing about learning through ... through Brian is his left hand\nThe bass notes really incredible um and that's really what changes the court off and he's not always you know emphasizing the route note um would you would say if you're playing a gee you know she she's often emphasizing a different um note or in the voice thing and that changes the entire sound of the court and it's actually something that I Believe Paul McCartney\nGot from listening to the beach boys and started doing as a bass player which was kind of quite revolutionary at the time\nUm so for him in the music to not you know necessarily be landing on the roof no really changes the feeling behind the cord and uh so I learned so much uh and

of Rick Pitino\nSo in a lot of cases families will move uh they're promising young basketball player to a different city for a high school that's it's known for being competitive so it becomes kind of the family's lives to\nYou write that on the college end of this is the assistant coaches who are really involved in recruiting explain what they do how they're paid\nThe assistant college coaches are the sort of ones who first make contact with a young player and his family\nThey fly all over the country and there's a lot of pressure on assistant coaches it used to be an assistant college coach was a coach first he taught the game he mentored the young men\nA lot of them now if not most of them are recruiters first and they are charged with bringing the head coach the best players it's sometimes set in college basketball but you win\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station\nThe sound of a free press [noise]\nBest players from the tournaments the grass roots tournaments in July in Las Vegas in elsewhere\nBut the assistant coaches that's their job get me kids the thinking in\nThe industry and among journalists and many who follow this world is that many of the head coaches say just get me players don't tell me how you did it just bring them to me there are things I don't want to know\nThese assistant coaches jobs are very well paid they're hard to get their hard to keep\nTheir hard to get back into business if you lose the job the temptation to cheat is extreme\nI'd say you have these kids that are kind of showing their stuff in this amateur basketball kind of network and the street runners sort of pre agents that build relationships and hope to steer them to universities assistant coaches who want to make connections there and the federal government has charged in this case that we're seeing money flowing\nAmong these parties to help to lure kids to universities there's another really creepy part of the story which took me awhile to get which is the street runners not just using you know incentive to get kids to colleges\nBut in some cases paying the assistant college coaches to steer their players already in college to a certain financial advisor at the St runner has a relationship with what's going on there\nWell that's exactly right and I and I think that's the most insidious part of this so in the federal government's case there have been several assistant coaches charged with taking bribes from these runners or go betweens\nOn the grass roots circuit and the attempt of the bribe is to say okay you already have this player he's headed to the pros\nSend him to me I Want to manage his money when he becomes a pro you know put him in my lap\n[noise] All right so if you're a financial advisor at ... this is what you do and you managed to have ... in some way or another and get an NBA player as your client what's it worth to you\nAnd NBA player over the course of a ten year career can easily make a hundred million dollars or more so\nIf you're an agent and get two or three percent of that salary that adds up to a lot if you have five or ten of those players that adds up to a whole lot if you're quote managing the money of one of these players\nI don't know what that might add up to if you're doing it legitimately um you're getting what a money manager might make there's a lot you're dealing in tens of millions of dollars if I were a future NBA player or I were the family of a future NBA player\nI don't think that I Would necessarily send my kid to somebody who specializes in managing the money of sports stars\nBut there is an ecosystem of people who serve professional athletes manage their money or if you get traded there are specialists who will set you up in a new city they will go to\nPrivate schools and figure out what private school your child should go to they will find you designer for your new house\nFree to pursue the free to
