the story a that said that that former national security adviser Mike Flynn had not been honest about his conversation with the Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak\nWe wrote the story saying that he in fact had discussed the lifting of sanctions on Russia in those conversations and then lied about it to the White House or to news organizations including our own and to the American public\nUh and this was the sort of just one of many huge stories that we broke during that time in a couple of others that I was involved in include\nThe revelation that the CIA had reached a a a secret conclusion that Russia was not just trying to disrupt the election what was I was trying to help elect Donald Trump\nAnd then later when Trump was in office I broke several stories about his rough
