I was trying to to defend were legal things they were invisible it was not going to work so I decided that the only thing that was going to work was they had at least some of them had also become legal persons\nNow at that time there was very little\nKnown about or spoken about truly animal rights about the idea of having a legal person or legal rights for a non human on I knew it was going to

the\nOne critical legal move is the transformation of an entity from a thing to a person nothing else matters\nSo back in the Nineteen nineties when Steven wise was just beginning to lay the groundwork for granting legal rights\nTo animals came across an interesting case it's called Somerset versus Stewart and it took place two hundred and fifty years ago in London\nJames Summers that was an eight year old boy when he was kidnapped from West Africa he survived the middle passage and he was sold to a Scottish businessman named Charles Stuart in Virginia now Twenty years later Stewart brought James Somerset to London and\nAfter he got there James decided he was going to escape\nOne of the first things he did was to get himself baptize because he wanted to get a set of God parents because then they ... century slave one of the major responsibility the Godfather's was to help you escape and so in the fall of Seventeen Seventy one James Somerset had a confrontation with Charles

are detained against her will the dictators required to bring the detainee in and give a legally sufficient reason for depriving him of his bodily liberty well lord Mansfield had to make a decision right off the bat because of James\nSummers that was a legal thing he was not eligible\nFor a writ of habeas corpus only if he can be a legal person so lord Mansfield decided that he would assume\nWithout deciding that James Somerset was indeed a legal person and he should have your support person James his body was brought in by the captain the ship there were a series of hearings over the next six months on June twenty second Seventeen Seventy two lord Mansfield\nSaid that slavery was so ... that's a common law would not support in the order James Frey had that moment James Somerset underwent a\nLegal trans substantiate the free man\nWho walked out of the court room looked exactly like the slaves would walked in but as far as low as concerned they had nothing whatsoever

hearing from Brett headache who's advocating for getting rid of elections and replacing them with a random selection of lawmakers so I I Would\nMake a voluntary once you've sent out ten thousand letters to random six of the population you may find that only ten or twenty percent of the population are actually interested in doing this of course if there was a financial incentive that much uh increase you would then\nFor those who wish to interest in that you would do a second random selection of those interests with making sure you're actually match the demographic profile of the country so I'm making sure you've had gender bounds you'd have fifty percent women in parliament this to me would already just change the structure of the lowest\nYou would eliminate the national government wouldn't be millionaires club you would have lots of working class people lots of fulltime cares and\nTo me the the laws that come out of such an institution would be so completely different but so much better for my perspective\nThat sort of wisdom of crowds idea that actually you need diversity bouncing ideas off each other to find the best solution and so if you exclude some part of the population for whatever reason than you are limiting that diversity\nBut I Wonder I mean if only the\nPeople who really want to be part of this are part of it government already create a self selected group of people\nThere is a yeah that would be this on a self selection but it wouldn't be people who want that political power I mean there's also these are famous quotes by John how some people\nI'm not tonight I'm Sorry a contract has got to the galaxy going out Douglas Adams who talked with us yeah this is science got diagnosed Adams saying are the people who want political power a specifically that people who you should not have political power\nUm by randomly selecting people okay there is one step of self selection if it's willing to you could also make it mandatory but I Would also propose that if you pay these people two or three times the average wage\nThe vast majority of people who are substantially less than that would definitely put their hands up for two years is that kind of income\nI Would of course probably want to see it stopped at a small a local level perhaps with a biochemical\nSystems so you would have to change as one elected and one randomly selected and

selected and in fact there's a\nA regional parliament in Belgium who is now looking at doing this and that would be the first ah pollen in the world to instigate a one day like the chamber in one solution chamber once with fish and buddy I wouldn't be surprised if people look at the ... and look at\nThe elected chamber full of politicians basically back stabbing each other and engaging in the typical political power place and go well why do we need that for his chamber a but this is a path to old is the ideal\nRandom selection in politics has become so common likely it is simply too many examples to talk about of course I'm very aware that it's going to be difficult to Institute these in parliament tried to society of friends I think we should populated parliament with randomly selected people\nRely judging what if my neighbor gets chosen the full ... separate whose recycling box the perhaps surprising but overwhelming and compelling evidence from all these Monday examples is it does work if you give people responsibility they act responsibly\nDon't get me wrong it's not a panacea the question\nIs not would this be perfect of course not people are fallible human and distorting influences will continue to exist the question is would it be better and the answer to that question to me at least it's obviously yes [noise]\nI mean realistically is is this something that can really spread on a global scale in your lifetime [noise]\nYeah we have our strategy a and that is yet to to first get these students assemblies happening more and more often which seems to be happening or after the Irish citizens assemblies the u._k. government is now putting aside almost a million\nPounds to a sponsor eight to ten local citizens assemblies in the u._k. so I can see that the wood is spreading once one of these things happens in the in the world maybe other people will take notice maybe ... spreads I could see within my lifetime they're being for example\nA U.S state legislature with the second buddies selected by association that would be an incredible first step\nAnd I guess I guess um you know ultimately it's a huge truly a meal battle is to try to convince people and then in French powers to um to try that\nYes uh yeah it ... it I'm not ...
