is [laughter] this is food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marketing describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat and become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell an easy to process\nAnd the government through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop in endless rows that are all\nCultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen thoroughly twenty century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest their second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown and now you know I was just in Iowa and again you can't believe you drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then the corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contained as many Soyuz corn products as could be crammed into her home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nBecause all of them can be bought an antique

W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News they found a free friend\nI'm I'm not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma it's not actually killed by the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat\nAnd spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home\nAt the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave lights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself lights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way [noise] me junk food cheese the various stuff that will kill you\nGet ... and like what you were saying earlier alive it has to do with with the fact that like one day we ship food all over the world right [noise] yeah I think part of the problem\nIs you know and this could go back to cooking because one of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want it to ... you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need everything but you you are a guy that a lot of people elect to and say okay well you even all these books you or a food to eat like I think of ... men and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat\nWell I Do think you know I did this book called the B. six million before six and a few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan untold dinnertime and then do whatever\nBut I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know a a head of broccoli doesn't need a label because that are broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules to eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n\nOf animals that of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now I there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients and plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene\nIt's the carrots the evidence is very clean\nScreaming on W.

fooled into spelling leaving tasting what they think is a red wine all the ... the tobacco in the dark chocolates and the fruit since I don't even know what they're actually tasting um it is to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients here's Charles stats on the stage\nAhead this morning to tell you about the perfect meal\nWere all convinced we can taste the food we enjoy the flavors and aromas of the wind in the glass\nBut if a lot of what's going on is created by the atmosphere in which we eat and drink\nOut of the question is how to study how to measure is I'm a tendency among the scientists that been your guest strong it is I think people like your eye a brain scanner give them something to eat something to drink and see what you talk to the brain light up the hill that kind of your brain on flavor or New York astronomy is one problem here\nWhich is that in fact if your mattress off one of these brain scan is kind of lie on your back where they had climbed stale with a true when you're married\nThat periodically squid sin or some brick you call what have you put your head all kind of a jolt and that ... that the brain scan alignment but it's kind of tells you something useful but it doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal is one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines\nA perfect meal [laughter]\nI'm actually a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be able to make very very simple it can be a fish and chips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese up and we'll stick in people's minds as as best meals about ... what I guess has to be there is um the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining\nUm I didn't know what is it bad that perfect meal when the fighting with that pot and I say\nPart of the thing about these kind of holiday meals that seem to stick with doesn't resonate in the end you can have quite capture when you get back home he says your mood you pretty relaxed your holiday you're less stressed Tripoli with their family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red wine that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you were\nThinking that phenomenon has a name that we've

you've ever had\nSo great that you want to buy a boat or a case and bring it back to share with your friends and show a good taste you happen and you bring it back\nAnd then you're disappointed and your friend\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... found a free press\nThat when they when they're playing with a cold and not you know sport the wind things not about a tool we never eat or drink no we're always somewhere in a certain environments and certain states of mind\nOn all mental state and the environment both together kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy its missile in a way some\nMyths attributes I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation [noise]\nAnd put some of that pleasure into what we think about food\n[noise] in fact is Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement and these are methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nFor in a good mood to taste good isn't a bad mood I never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the wind the glass but I'll break has brought me everything else the thousands of single the smell of assaulting the at the wall of the San ... all of that is play against the experience\nOn top chef capturing that insight or in the dishes or any of that too much to install restaurant in in Switzerland tuition and star restaurant\nA white tablecloths\nWas not ... on the table was no glasses are nice places and I'm not going to just a plastic car people wait and see what he calls me here seven o'clock hour here and everyone has a restaurant and I can say well we'll tables full nothing will happen until somebody picks up seriously that plastic how I Wonder if they get up you know there\nIs a little ... euro tower and it makes it moving out into the some of those type of it that will be laughing I can guarantee within a minute you'll have a whole restaurant for a million cars\nLaughing Dina's ... is the moment when the first issue comes out because then he had successfully nothing more than one euro table in the mood and he knows that will improve even the taste of a two Michelin star restaurant\n[noise] wow so aside from from a neurological perspective [noise]\nDo we fully understand what's happening like why that's the\nCase [laughter] uh no so we didn't know that it does happen but it is the case it's all of a classic example of just how important the environment is\nWhat we taste I work with a young chef coaches if you have here in London\nAnd he's being I'm sending our question as several weeks have to ... his restaurant I'd say what'd you remember yeah he said well ... flavor was the soup and people are convinced they can remember but in fact when you check was actually on the menu that kind of constructing something\nThey experience but I felt about it and the brain kind of fills in the rest of the details of what they think they thought they were using\nOur most chefs that you talked to are they are bored with with your ideas did do they think yeah it is it is about the experiences right or they or did they say that this is totally absurd it's all about the food and it tastes the food\nUh of course there are still some chefs who say no no it is just what I was taught in Colorado School days just the sourcing the preparation but nothing else but\nSome say okay so I'm In a restaurant or do you serve the food to eat in a plastic cutlery known as a silver cement and where's your restaurant exactly oh it's in the country manor house looking accept nature\nSo they they're saying all these things on the one hand but clearly you can never sort of food just by itself it's always on something in a certain environment and there's going to contextual factors are always that it cannot be avoided\n[noise] so I certainly I think there are a growing number of the younger chefs who are now putting up starting their own Venus who who are really thing for the first time in history saying we don't need to know about the ingredients I'm cooking preparation techniques we really need to know about the
