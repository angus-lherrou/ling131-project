F. N. genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would\nNever have gotten from their parents if it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against their finger you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhanced men or that disease prevention is you know many people see\nThey divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes easier five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what you might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders\nSweeping during that you know you know what I mean like there's a process that just kind of sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be ending that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel\n[laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of of how secret as the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone of course but we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient\nBut when you think about human evolution over the course of

individual children and their children and their children and their children\nAnd so that's where I think you have this very radio issue of directing future evolution\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it ... embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday

very important question which is who are we\nOkay by the way you have the answer deem know who we are\nI Know who I Am [laughter] every year I have a a a an inkling of who we are this is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature [noise]\nSo what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell if there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a fabricated over millions of years by natural selection that equipped says with a set of motives and emotions and other mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just sad and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out so Steven can you can you help us with this okay I'll do my best\nOkay just to get us started human beings have debated nature versus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors\nAre either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialize Asian culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker unattached age back in two thousand and two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century [noise] and it meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from the historian or ... you got that man has no instinct and the anthropologist actually want to give the human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and

written on the slate and some people could have more of the others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnother political fear of human nature is that\nIf we were blank slate weaken perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect ability of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with certainly interesting and perhaps some
