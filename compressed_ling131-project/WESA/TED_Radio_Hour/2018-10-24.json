interest as well and it is [laughter] this is food writer Mark Bittman truth in advertising and marched in describing how over the past fifty years corn and soy and wheat and become staples of the western diet\nOne thing led to another corn and wheat and soy were easy to trade and easy to ship and easy to sell an easy to process\nAnd the government through direct and indirect subsidies encouraged the growth of what we now call mama cropping which means really really big fields or hundreds and hundreds of acres at a time\nPlanted in one crop an endless rows that are all\nCultivated an harvested mechanically um but if you look in the late Nineteen thoroughly twenty century of it what was being grown in Iowa\nIowa was I think the country's biggest or second biggest producer of tomatoes that was a huge producer of apples I mean this is a place where almost anything can be grown now you know I was just in Iowa and again you can't believe that drive drive through miles and miles of corn and soybeans and it's nothing else but corn and soybeans\nOnce you have that stuff you have to figure out what to do with it yeah so now you know the principal uses of those two crops are animal feed\nBiofuels ethanol and then corn and soy oils for frying and highly processed food made out of corn and soy\nSo we got the beginning of the heyday of value added food which contains as many ... corn products as could be crammed into it home cooking remain the norm but its quality was down the tubes there are fewer meals with home cooked breads desserts and soups\nHas all of them can be bought and any store not that they are any good but they were there\nMost bombs cook like mine a piece of royal made a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup cans fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice for dessert\nStore bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so I can say this now\nThis kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself and it wasn't all bad\nBy the seventies forward thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we weren't all hippies either\nSome of us reading on good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial\nSadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma it's not actually killed\nBy the seventies home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets and we all have our favorites actually\nMade this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were surfing at home\nAt the same time masses if women were entering the workforce and cooking simply wasn't important enough for men to share the burden so now you got your pizza night so you got your microwave nights you got your grazing nights you got your fend for yourself nights and so on [noise]\nLeading the way what's leading the way me junk food she is the very stuff that will kill you\n... and ... like what you're saying earlier a lot of that has to do with with the fact that like\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the other free press\nOne is in and this could go back to cooking because\nOne of the problems with the way that we think about food right now is that we expect to have any food we want within minutes\nIf you want a mango you're gonna be able to get a mango if you want it tomato you're going to be able to get a tomato well that is really not sustainable so if we start thinking more seasonally if we start cooking at home more with ingredients that are\nUm I think appropriate might be the right word I'm and I'm Talking about more root vegetables in winter beats and turnips and potatoes and so on were really eating much more in tune with what nature is offering us and what nature is offering us is abundant it's just not everything\nSo I mean you are an omnivore you need everything but you you are a guy that a lot of people that look to and say okay well you you've written all these books you or a food to eat like I think of mock Batman and food and so we want to know what we should kind of eat\nWell I Do think you know I did this book called the B. six million before six or a few years ago and um basically it's a strategy the more plants by saying let's be very strictly vegan until dinnertime and do whatever\nBut I you know I think that the rules are very very simple I think the rules are one defining what food is often it's things that don't have labels and you know of the head of broccoli doesn't need a label because the broccoli we know what's in broccoli\nUm defined what food is eat only that and then within that category eat as many plants as you can as you can eat\nThat's it yeah\nWithin those rules do eat what you like to eat and you're going to have a good diet\n\nOverconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our poultry consumption of plants now I there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that class and I want to make this clear and it's not the ingredients and plants it's the plants it's not the beta carotene it's the carrots\nThe evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bet\nBut back to animals and junk food we don't need either of them for health both of and marketed heavily creating unnatural demands were not orange craving whoppers or Skittles\nWe have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone that's the hard part but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy the simple formula eat food eat real food [noise]\nWe can continue to enjoy our food and we can continue to spend your arms about our favorite meals were reduced not only calories by our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so\nWe have to choose that path thank you

experts the winemakers will get fooled into spelling leaving tasting what they think is a red wine oldie ... chocolate and the stone fruit since I don't even know what they're actually tasting um it used to watch\nAll of this Charles says feeds into a larger idea\nThat how we experience our food is more than just about the ingredients here's Charles stats on the stage\nAhead this morning to tell you about the perfect meal world convinced we can taste the food we enjoy the flavors and aromas of the wind in the glass\nBut if a lot of what's going on is created by the atmosphere in which we even drink out of the question is how to study hard to measure is I'm a tendency among some scientist that been your guest problem is it's a thing people like your eye a brain scan to give them something to eat something to drink\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E essay Pittsburgh NPR News they found a free press\nOn flavor or New York astronomy running is one problem here\nWhich

you thought you had all kinds of jokes on our soil that the brain scan align them but it's got to tell you something to do something useful but doesn't tell you about the perfect meal because no one has had that perfect meal and one of those situations [noise]\n\nWhat exactly defines a perfect meal [laughter]\nIt's probably a different for each and every one of us I mean it can be able to make very very simple it can be fishing trips by the seaside or it could be on your summer holidays by the beach somewhere\nThese often most people's minds as as best meals but ... would I guess has to be that raised them the mood you're in on the people you're with so because of social aspects of dining\nA perfect meal when the fighting with that part in the say\nPart of the thing about these kind of

with their family and all these things come together to help enhance the experience and make it something sort of truly memorable\nYou think about like um how many times have you met her friend is just come back from a holiday and they say oh you've got to try this amazing red wine that I tried in Greece and then you try it and you are sort of thinking\nThat phenomenon how to name it we've all

know sport the wind things not about a tool and we never eat more drink no we're always somewhere in a certain environments and certain states of\nMind on all mental state and the environment both together kind of impacts what we think we're tasting and how much we enjoy it and we saw in a way to miss a tribute I suppose some of the pleasure of the situation [noise]\nAnd put some of that pleasure into what we think about the food\n[noise] in fact is Charles these ideas about how we experience food have actually convinced some chefs to try out certain methods of flavor enhancement\nAnd these are methods that have nothing to do with the ingredients\nFor in a good mood food tastes good if you're in a bad mood I never tastes good is this illusion about flavor we think we're tasting the
