responsible drinking and from the any Casey foundation\n\nIt's that Ted radio hour from NPR I'm Guy rise in Russia Today ideas about who we are what makes us us and we've been talking to ... who's been explaining how a new gene editing technology called CRISPR cast nine\nCould make it cheap and easy to create humans who are you're basically talking like superheroes right perfectly Asian superhuman strength perfect SAT scores right that I got you know that I think that's that's the science fiction association of what\nCRISPR could allow [noise]\nWe had long lists of gene variants associated with certain traits and some of those are silly like whether or not you're a morning person [noise] but we also have long lists of gene variants that are associated with things that might be desirable like having extra strong bones or leader muscles\nOr lower sensitivity to pain or lower risk of Cornell heart disease\nAnd as those lists continue to grow\nWe now have a technology that could in theory\nYou allow an individual to upgrade their genome\nBut why would that be the science fiction version if it seems like the the technologies are promising like if there was a way to make a child more resilient a painter or give us a hierarchy is you can imagine that people would want to take advantage of all those things right\nI think they will I think the challenge then is to is to think about how we can ensure that that technology if it becomes available is used safely because we're certainly not there yet but also I think equitably\nThere is a great example in the world of HIV aids so it turns out one to two percent\nOf all humans have a specific genetic mutation that is associated with HIV immunity because this gene variant they have essentially masks their cells and the HIV virus can't get inside\nSo what a friend you know delivered it into a fertilized egg cell into a human embryo so that that future child even though neither his or her parents have that mutation will still have HIV immunity\nYou might assume of course they would want that but it's still\nA game changing idea that we would be able to make those decisions and not just select the traits still inherit from their parents something we can already do with ... and genetic testing but kind of installing new variance into their genome that they would never have gotten from their parents\nIt's it's like a pre emptive solution for for for something that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against the thing that you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or that disease prevention is you know many people see they divide DNA rewriting a gene editing into kind of\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the other free press\nMaybe that may never come come to fruition like ... like we're just saying hey just in case we're going to give you immunity against their finger you may or may not ever meet\nAbsolutely so do you consider that a an enhancement or that disease prevention [laughter] you know many people see\nThey divide DNA rewriting or gene editing into kind of two different categories one being disease prevention and one being genetic enhancement but I think there are many that far right smack dab in the middle so yeah with the with the HIV immunity genes easier five\nThat's disease prevention but it's preventing a disease that you may never get so in in a way it's kind of conferring a genetic advantage and I'll just state again that's a gene variant that exist naturally but only one to two percent of humans have yeah so it's clearly giving you an advantage above what we might call normal human species functioning\nBut I mean I mean a part of me wonders\nSweeping during that you know you know what I mean like there's a profit that just kind of have sort of happened since the beginning of human evolution and we were completely be up and make that\nThat's certainly one way of looking at it and yet evolution is inherently cruel\n[laughter] for someone that has a genetic disease that's kind of a a crummy hand that they've been dealt\nSo I think this comes down to the question of\nHow sacred is the genome and is it something that should remain untouched on tainted left alone\nOf course but we do in any one patient that's a lifesaver for that patient but when you think about human evolution over the course of hundreds or thousands of years now we're talking about a technology that will not only affect that individual\nBut that individuals children and their children and their children and their children and so that's where I think you have this very radio issue of directing future evolution\n\nYou know even saying that sounds hyperbolic it sounds like science fiction but I think the technology will get to a point where you could use it ... embryos to install things like HIV immunity or stronger muscles and maybe someday gene variants associated with higher IQ\nOr being a morning person if that's what you'd like to be that's where things really take off

are\nThis is Steven Pinker I Am a professor of psychology at Harvard University and I write books on language mind and human nature [noise]\nSet of what what is it that makes us who we are\nWell ... there are some uh intricately complex circuitry in the brain a\nFabricated over millions of years by natural selection that equipped says with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here set to begin to understand what Steven Pinker Jeff ed and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sounds of a free press\nNatural selection that he quips us with a set of motives and emotions and mechanisms for learning and thinking that make us who we are\nOkay there's a lot to unpack here so to begin to understand what Steven Pinker just said and to understand what accounts for the differences between us we kind of need to understand how far we've actually come in trying to figure this all out just even can you can you help us with this okay I'll do my best\nTo locate just to get us started human beings have debated nature\nVersus nurture for hundreds even thousands of years that is whether who we are our personalities are behaviors are either entirely inherited from our parents or whether it all comes from the environment around us that when we're born our minds are basically like blank slates\nAnd that all of a structure comes from socialization culture parenting experience\nThat was Steven Pinker ... stage back in two thousand two in this idea of the blank slate it was especially popular in the second half of the twentieth century and I meant that a lot of us went through high school biology hearing stuff like that\nMan has no nature from historian who they are ... you got that man has no instinct and the anthropologist asked we want to give\nThe human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors and predisposed to non from Hochul a scientist Stephen J gold\n... why should have been such an appealing notion well there are number of political reasons why people have found congenial foremost if it if we're blank slates then by definition we are equal because we're all equals zero equals zero\nBut if something is written on the slate and some people could have more of others and according to this line of thinking that would justify discrimination and inequality\nAnother political fear of human nature is that\nIf we were blind way we can perfect mankind the angel dream of the perfect ability of our species through social engineering whereas if we're born with and certainly instincts and perhaps some of them come down to two selfishness prejudice and violence [laughter]\nHarvard psychologist Steven Pinker has given several attacks including this one about the blank slate you can find all of them at ... dot com\nOr ideas
