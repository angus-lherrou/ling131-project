trash\nI said to my son you know this is not looking good\nWe've got to do something about this\nLater on the Allegheny Front when love turn into activism eighty five years on the river with a\n\n[noise]\nA new documentary Wade into the issues around the pollution and protection of Pennsylvania's water the film from point park university's environmental journalism program and WKBD multimedia in Pittsburgh is called downstream\nI was fascinated by the fact of Pennsylvania has more running water than any other state in the country except Alaska and that statistic eighty three thousand miles of rivers and streams and tributaries but I thought there's a lot of story and that water\nWriter and producer Gina contends are right tells that story through some of the threats to clean water in a state like acid mine drainage seeping from a band in coal mines industrial pollution along rivers sewage overflow when it rains and the lead in old pipes so as a miner and it just\nIt was like a long term problem a lot of us who grew up in western Pennsylvania pretty familiar with those orange streams what did you learn about how these problems are being addressed in the process of making this documentary\nWe worked a lot with trout unlimited and Pennsylvania has one of the most robust trout unlimited organizations in the country\nEven if you're not a very avid fishermen you\nAbuse you care about those resources because the impacts of losing our child population is a signal that there are impairments happening in our water [noise]\nThey said something that struck me as profound they said when we talk about reclaiming streams are cleaning water we talk about success in terms of feet not mouse\nAnd I really had a respect for how hard it is to ensure that these impacts wherever they're coming from if it's industry if it's how we treat our own back lawns and the chemicals that we put on them I kept thinking the challenge of ensuring that that one foot\nIs going to be cleaned and then what we do to make sure that all of the other feet are cleaned\nSo a lot of us have heard about some of these issues like sewage overflow into rivers but seeing it as people are talking about it in the film really as another layer of understanding even for someone like me who covers these issues regularly can you talk a little bit about environmental filmmaking as a medium\nIt's very difficult to make a film that's about the environment and our interaction with it because we don't want to stage anything we know information as we know a body of evidence exists but where do you find it and some time\n... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nThese issues regularly can you talk a little bit about environmental filmmaking as a medium\nIt's very difficult to make a film that's about the environment and our interaction with it because we don't want to stage anything we know information as we know a body of evidence exists but where do you find it\nAnd sometimes how long are you willing to wait for it to show up so that you can tape it and it's really difficult to show something which is a process like this nutrients\nPoisoning that we're basically experiencing with all the human waste with all the agricultural waste maybe I see one\nSure overflowing but was that a one off or how do I convey that this happens over time and I think the biggest problem on when you're trying to convey a long term impact\nIs we're not shooting long term so what is accurate visual storytelling that will be accepted by an audience how can they believe what they're seeing\nI was actually thinking of it the opposite way that it seems like proof to me like you know you hear about sewage overflow but you don't really like know exactly where it goes or what it looks like you know that it just goes right into the river like you can actually see the portals in the film and you're like oh yeah it it's like a becomes a reality\nIt does become a reality and one of the things that I think it's hardest about environmental things is um\nThere's a smell to sewage overflow that we can't capture there's a vibrancy to being on the water that doesn't always translate to this so shooting it feels very different we were with a woman who swimming in the river's\nYou can still get in and enjoy the rivers and I wish more people knew that [noise]\nSo we made the choice to to be on the water with her but how can we be on the water with her and not have the motor boats\nObscuring our audio or and so we said okay how about a kayak well my camera guys going to tip in a ... how about a canoe so we had a kind of operator so I felt that it was really important to be right next to her she swam in this water that people have such a fear of being and\nWe hear from researchers environmentalists citizen scientists and the phone and each of them has their own piece of the story you know each has a sort of call to action whether it's saving trout or inviting people to get to know the reverse better is this film a call to action what do you want people\nWho see it to do I think that the best journalism tells people information that is reliable and has a heart to it so we can understand the motion not just the data\nBut at the end it will let them make their own decision and so if the call to action is learn more about when the water's clean and when it's not clean do just write it off then I feel like that's a good thing that they could take away but I Hope that people become advocates for the water and realize that\nMy vote will matter in policies that affect the water and while I said in the documentary one of the old adage as the kept coming through my mind is no single rain drop ever takes responsibility for the flood\nAnd I think that we are that you know one person everything's what difference could my actions make with the water but every action is cumulative\nBecause unless your homes of the highest mountains [noise]\n[noise]\nThe question that's posed by the narrator in the beginning of the film is well Pennsylvania serve as a clean water model for the rest of the country\nFree ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nBut every action is cumulative\nBecause unless you're home sits on the highest mountains\nSomeone else\nA question that's posed by the narrator in the beginning of the film is will Pennsylvania serve as a clean water model for the rest of the country or will it settles for being a cautionary tale do you feel like you have an answer for that now or a better idea of the way things are going\nI met people who want us to be a success story and at the same time I am from the keys rocks I live right above\nNovel island ... has a lot of industry and a lot of old industry and infrastructure and I see a lot of people who think that there are short term financial benefits and the water can be sacrificed for them\nSo I don't know if we'll be a cautionary tale that really relies on policy and putting those policies in practice and even coming up with stiffer penalties and laws that are a little bit more current because a lot of these\nClean stream laws and policies that were made around them for what's acceptable industrial pollution\nHaven't been changed in decades and fines for violating them or and even that steps so they feel more like a tax for doing business than a deterrent for doing it again so I Hope that were a success story but you know I don't want to sound like the glass as half\nEmpty person every time I met somebody who's doing something great you turn around and you see somebody who is\nYou know
