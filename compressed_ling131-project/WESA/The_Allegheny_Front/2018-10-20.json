we've shown that when these insects are not present the Louisiana water thrush nest and much lower numbers so much a lower density of birds' nesting on these streams\nThey lay fewer eggs and the chicks hatched from these eggs are smaller\nAnd that suggests that they're going to have much lower survival rates as well\nSo how do you know what Louisiana wanted pressure eating to know if it's changed this is the part that I found the coolest in your study\nThis is Brian I'm so studying the diets of songbird is actually pretty difficult in the past researchers have used chemical\nFree to

wouldn't necessarily get great data from that either because you have to identify insects based on semi digestive little pieces of wings and legs\nSo well we wanted to do was analyze water source diet using a non invasive technique just using the fecal samples in order to sort of understand what their diet is in a non invasive manner\nTo look at the DNA of the\nInsects that they ate right the technique itself has called the N a metal bar coding and it's actually pretty straightforward plants and animals all have DNA and so the sequence of bases within the DNA meaning the eighties jeeze and sees that make up the genetic code they differ between species\nThese genetic signatures are actually retained even after digestion so you can identify which insects were in the diet just using the residual DNA president in feces and you can think of this like a crime scene investigation where you can identify species of insects rather than an individual\nThat's really cool is that something that's new to this kind of research\nI Would say that it's really picked up in the last five years or so uh this was something that people were using a lot with bats like around two thousand and ten or so and then our group was one of the first to do it and songbirds\nSo if they're not eating may flies and the things that they prefer what are they eating\nWe found that in a certified habitats they're eating more sort of a mosque crickets spiders those types of Arthur pods that are found further away from the stream rather than on the stream suggesting that the birds are traveling further away from their naps in order to get the adequate food for their young\nSo is that necessarily a negative thing not necessarily negative I mean it's showing that the birds are compensating behaviorally for the reduced availability of their preferred\nPray but it could carry other costs that we're not aware of and that sort of what we're looking at now is what these differences in diet actually mean for the ... but also\nBirds go to pretty great lengths to\nAvoid predators for instance and the more time they spend away from the ... the more likely is that a blue Jay\nOr a raccoon or a snake will see them leaving the nest are coming back to the mass frequently and it sort of reveals that to them where they can eat ... eggs are the eggs so it could affect affect I'm struck by the ability of the of the young but again this is something that we don't know at the moment we're we're trying to investigate further\nTo stave another aspect that we're looking at is that the quality of these alternative food items may\nNot be the same as the quality of for example may flies or stone flies are for for ... thrush or there's some indication that they might not have the calcium that they really need in order to lay eggs and you know the same quality eggs so there's a lot of different sorts of\nPotential ramifications of diet change\nI interviewed a researcher from West Virginia this year who looked at natural gas infrastructure and how it was impacting Louisiana wanted fresh populations so it's a species especially sensitive to development and pollution\nKnow birds are

six inches of rain have fallen in the Pittsburgh area this year on average only thirty inches usually followed by this time in October pathogens like fungus love all the moisture\nLeast diverse is
