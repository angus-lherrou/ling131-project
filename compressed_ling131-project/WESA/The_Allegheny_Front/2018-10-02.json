it sounded like a bomb went off\nIn a sound but I you don't ever want to hear when you and your lifetime it did shut the whole neighborhood it really did\nThe pipeline had only been on line for a week when officials believe a landslide caused by heavy rains led to the explosion the fire destroyed a neighbor's home but no one was hurt Celtics said he didn't like that the pipeline was built so close to his house\nIt is and what are you going to do I mean there's a scene where you live and um you know we don't if we own the property I might have been a different story you know we had no say so what goes on\nTurns out no one no federal state or local government has much of a say so and we're pipelines like this one can go that's because of a hole in the patchwork of federal and state regulations that oversee pipeline construction\nA pipeline route that crosses state lines has to get federal approval but the revolution doesn't cross state lines and only carries gas from Butler County to Washington County\nFor those Pennsylvania only pipelines state regulations only come into play when the route crosses a stream or wetland\nThe Pennsylvania public utility commission is the state's main regulator for pipelines and overseas things like safety and construction standards but it says state law doesn't allow it to oversee pipelines citing\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News station the sound of a free press\nThe stream or wetland the Pennsylvania public utility commission is the state's main regulator for pipelines and overseas things like safety and construction standards but it says state law doesn't allow it to oversee pipelines citing\nBoth if a towel itty rate for oil and gas pipeline construction workers and a national fatality rate with which to compare it with what I came up with is oil and gas pipeline construction workers having a favorite holiday rate in two thousand and sixteen\nThat was three point six times the national average for the average American worker\nAnd that it has reached highs of seven times the average rate and since two thousand and three has average four point three times the fatality rate for the average American\nWorker you mentioned the worker who died during the Dakota access pipeline construction Nicholas genesis which and another worker who died during the construction of that pipeline could tell me a little bit about what happened to them\nJohn and such is death I did a freedom of Information Act request um interviewed a sheriff and other local um parties but there are no witnesses to his death Janet said she was working\nAlone essentially out near where Dakota Access pipeline where it starts and he was working at the very tail end of pipeline construction and he in fact had never worked on pipeline construction before he was only three weeks into the job\nAnd he was driving a tractor so pipe was already in the ground the earth was returned above it and he was retailing the land using something called a ripper to allow vegetation to grow their again\nAnd he was as I uncovered is very typical in this industry\nA sub contractor to a subcontractor to a subcontractor to his up contractors the tractor he was working on had been altered it jammed he got out to fix it himself jammed a crow bar into the river and these guys like blades that are used to tell the ground\nDislodged and struck him in the goal he made his way back into the tractor and was randomly founded by his former new happened to be driving another worker to another tractors site\nAnd he died from a skull fracture less than twenty four hours after being injured and\nJust three days later at the other end of the pipeline in Illinois another worker ... Dolan\nWas also killed and his death had not been reported as associated with the Dakota access pipeline until I\nFiled a freedom of Information Act request and started digging and his was you know just exceptionally avoidable he had been suffering from heat stroke all day moving heavy equipment around he seemed to have\nSought out shade under a low boy truck which is used to haul these massive pieces of equipment and he must have fallen asleep or potentially passed out and the driver of the truck move the truck not knowing he was under it and crushed him to death killing him\n... who was looking out for these workers what are the regulations\nEven though oil and gas extraction and pipeline construction are considered part of the mining sector by the federal government they are not subject to the more stringent mining health and safety act\nWhich requires inspections of sites whether or not there's been an incident whether or not or there's been a reported problem\nDreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university's integrated innovation Institute details on the master's program\nAt CMU dot edu flash I I I\nOil and gas extraction and pipeline construction are considered part of the mining sector by the federal government they are not subject to the more stringent mining health and safety act\nWhich requires inspections of sites whether or not there's been an incident whether or not or there's been a reported problem a death or injury even though oil and natural gas extraction and pipeline construction have among the highest fatality rates in the nation\nBoth sectors fall under instead of mining they fall under the regular OSHA\nOccupational safety and health act and it's less stringent safety requirements so no mandatory inspections and in fact before John and such as death\nIn the previous six months OSHA had not inspected a single part of the Dakota access pipeline at all until he died and one reason for that is how few\nOSHA inspectors there are there's only eight and the entire state of North Dakota\nAnd the CIA has found that it would take OSHA one hundred years in North Dakota to inspect every job site just once\nAnd the sectors oil and gas and pipeline construction are considered low hazard industries which means that they are subject to less stringent OSHA oversight and\nThat was already that condition going into the Trump Administration for example right now there is no OSHA administrator or under the Trump Administration it had significantly last\nStaff including inspectors and the Trump Administration has eliminated and failed to enforce a number of Obama era regulations that were geared at making these sectors more safe and also has rolled back\nReporting requirements including what is posted on the bureau of Labor Statistics website and what information needs to be made publicly available in terms of injuries and fatalities that has gathered from the companies\nIs there a difference between building an oil pipeline like the Dakota access pipeline versus a gas transmission line like the ones we have here in Pennsylvania\nThere is a difference and but not a significant difference so basically it's a standard set of procedures for how you build a pipe regardless of what's going to pass through it there are different regulations in terms of how deep the pipe needs to be in the ground\nSickness of the pipe but basically\nIn terms of the process of building it's the same um I also found that in pipeline construction and this is very important to Pennsylvania\nCompared to the previous decade pipeline spilled since two thousand and ten carrying oil and other hazards liquids or more than twice as likely to suffer incidents and those carrying natural gas are over five times more disaster prone\nAnd that impacts of course both workers whose job it is to install it to maintain it even more importantly and the people who live near those pipelines and so we are seeing a rash of pie plant explosions recently particularly pipelines carrying natural gas that are both\nSuffering failures because they're too old and suffering failures because there are two\nAnd Tony ...

era vehicle emissions standards State Impact Pennsylvania's Amy Sisk reports from a hearing in Pittsburgh\nNew standards to improve gas mileage and reduce tailpipe emissions three twenty twenty five took effect under the Obama administration that President Trump's environmental protection agency and the department of transportation has proposed freezing them at twenty twenty levels and revoking state's ability to set their own limits\nMany members of the public who testified opposed that idea\nPerson after person from city officials to the American lung association and the Environmental Defense fund spoke against it\nKind of came out with the union of Concerned Scientists\nThese car standards that are in place are working really well\nThey're saving people money at the pop they're cutting down our on our dependence upon burning oil and they're cutting in a significant way our greenhouse gas emissions\nAnd the Trump Administration says newer cars are safer and the proposal will make them more affordable which in turn will reduce crash tallies Amy Sisk State Impact Pennsylvania\nThe Trump Administration is attempting to roll back dozens of environmental regulations including vehicle emissions standards which we just heard about a methane role to curb leaks from oil and gas operations on public lands and the waters of the U.S role which helps defined which bodies of water

first wave\nOf litigation in response to these role backs and most of the initial roll backs had to do with failure to implement the rule or suspending the rule pending review by the government\nIn those cases we have done remarkably well but now the Trump Administration is going to\nRescind the law to those rules the question after the clean water was repealed is whether the repeal is lawful\nIn terms of the substance of the clean Water Act and that's a different kind of case and that'll be kind of a second wave of what we call Trump resistance cases that will be stealing our
