E. N. supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program\nAt the end news dot edu slashed I I I\nToo and didn't hear back from any of them and when you look at the surveys of the issues that people care most about among a large chunks of the population in the environment it's always like fourth or fifth there are a lot further down the list in first and that's among the Democrats who are thinking about labor and jobs and so\nI'm the one thing that I think is interesting that is a little bit surprising to me is that one of the core constituencies in this election that everyone's paying attention to this idea of suburban moms that\nWomen in the suburbs are gonna be a really important to side are and how this election is going to go both nationally and locally and we do know that a lot of those women really do care about the environment they care about parks or their kids and and pollution and how healthy their children are\nMaybe this election don't make a difference and maybe Republican candidates in the future if those voters come out and vote on the environment maybe they'll pay more attention but they didn't respond this time\nAnd just for falling apart and it was saying before about um the Green Party candidates did have a lot of ideas but a lot of them were very far till after what a lot of Democrats even are comfortable with democratic voters are democratic politicians\nAre a lot of the emphasis is on really investing money into green energy and so there's some really specific ways you can do that and one of the specific ways\nIs increasing the subsidies at the state level it's currently set to increase sort of slowly the amount of money we get the green energy and so there's some puzzles that you could just increase that a little bit faster that's one of the main strategies and then the other main strategy that a couple of candidates brought up was just setting a really big ambitious target into the future like\nWe're going to have a hundred percent renewable energy by twenty fifty I'm One of the other things I thought was interesting it was like we so we asked them a question about whether or not we should subsidize\nCoal power or nuclear power or or green energy just following up on this and that's a really big issue locally because there have been proposals by the Trump Administration to subsidize Cole or subsidize nuclear because there are local coal and nuclear plants that say that they're going to close without this additional subsidy\nAnd one of the things that I thought was really interesting especially among all these liberal candidate says very few of them called out coal\nAnd I'm not sure if that's because in this area that there's just a sense that you know you don't want to speak badly about\nA an industry that's long held an important place here but we we we do know that the elimination of coal and the way that natural gases out competed Cola's been one of the biggest booms to improving air quality in the region and lowering a climate change that mission so there was only a few candidates it said\nYou know the really made any specific effort toward saying that that is something we should focus on\nThe only the Green Party and libertarian candidates for governor and lieutenant governor responded to these questions you didn't hear from high profile candidates like Jon fed Herman I'm Jeff Bartos Tom Wolfe and Scott Wagner\nYeah I was a little bit surprised especially with John betterment in sort of our back yard I thought I thought we might hear from him I mean the only thing I can think is he's really been an outspoken proponent of labor unions he's recently when they were ... are proposing to strike he he was out in front speaking about that\nAnd when you look at his website you see him talking to a lot about jobs and reinvestment in trying to do things to bring back economic vitality to the area it doesn't really mentioned on this website the environment that much so it's I guess it's just not an issue that he's focusing on that you know that's not his priority\n[noise] do you think that the responses that we got our eliminating for voters will they change anyone's mind or provide a benchmark to hold politicians accountable after the election\nBiggest advantage I think of what I saw from the collection of responses as it is it's kind of a litmus test of where we are what are the different ideas that are out there and\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sounds of a free press\nDifferent debates that are going on in the country right now I I think that most of the candidates perhaps for smart political reasons sort of didn't\nNail down specifics that they're going to be held to at the end there were a little bit more general um but I think in terms of just getting a general sense of all the different issues and and where what are the potential positions candidates can hold it's pretty good for that\nGreat thank you so much for talking with me All right thank you\nAll over more than reports about environmental issues for public
