Allegheny Front I'm Carol holds up all\nI'm sure you've seen the headlines about the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change it's been described as dire and scary\nThe report says if we want to keep on living on the earth that were used to will need to make some monumental changes over the next decade\nCut carbon emissions by half and rely on nuclear ... eighty percent of our energy the author say if we take these unprecedented steps will still face drought monster storm and heat waves that will avoid catastrophe\nThe report was written by Ninety One researchers drawn for more than six thousand studies here's what President Trump had to say about the report at an impromptu press briefing\nWas given to me it was given the man I Want to look at who through it you know which group through it because I could give you a report that are fabulous that I could give you report that are so good but I Will be looking at it absolutely\nIt made us think of the Trump on earth pod cast episode from last year in an interview with the author of the New York magazine article on inhabitable or\nAs the title suggests it portrays the worst case scenario for climate change and he got some flak for it at the time the Allegheny Front Reid Frazier talked with author David Wallace wells about why he wrote it in the way that he did\nI totally I felt it was really easy for many of us to think of climate change or something that was happening elsewhere to other people\nAnd even if we understood that say the flooding of bond with Russia would produce tens of millions or maybe hundreds of millions of refugees we could still sort of compartmentalize it in our minds but also just as a journalist as a storyteller I felt like\nWe had not really reckoned with her looked straight up some of the more dramatic horrifying possibilities\nI mean I guess we should sort of step back and say what some of those impacts are that your research envisions um I'll just read a couple of the subtitles the end of food poisoned oceans there's a lot of bad stuff that could happen kind of outline just two or three\nYou can still get in and enjoy the rivers and I wish more people

and I wish more people knew that [noise]\nSo we made the choice to be on the water with her but how can we be on the water with her and not have the motor boats obscuring our audio or and so we said okay how about a kayak well my camera guys going to tipping a kayak how about a canoe so we had to kind of operator\nSo I felt that it was really important to be right next to her as she swam in the water that people have such a fear of being and\nWe hear from researchers environmentalists citizen scientists and the sound and each of them has their own piece of the story you know each has a sort of call to action whether it's saving trout or inviting people to get to know the reverse better is this film a call to action what do you want people\nWho see it to do I think that the best journalism tells people information that is reliable and has a heart to it so we can understand the emotion not just the data\nBut at the end it will let them make their own decision and so if the call to action is learn more about when the water's clean and when it's not clean do just write it off then I feel like that's a good thing that they could take away but I Hope that people become advocates for the water and realize that\nMy vote will matter in policies that affect the water and while I said in the documentary one of the old adage as the kept coming through my mind is no single raindrops ever takes responsibility for the flood\nAnd I think that we are that you know one person ever thinks what difference could my actions make with the water but every action is cumulative\nBecause unless you're home says in the moment\n\nThe question that's posed by the narrator in the beginning of the film is will Pennsylvania servants a clean water model for the rest of the country or will it settles for being a cautionary tale do you feel like you have an answer for that now or a better idea of the way things are going\nI met people who want us to be a success story and at the same time I am from the keys rocks I live right above\n... island ... has a lot of industry and a lot of old industry and infrastructure and I see a lot of people who think that there are short term financial benefits and the water can be sacrificed for them so I don't know if we'll be a cautionary tale that really relies on policy\nAnd putting those policies into practice and even coming up with stiffer penalties and laws that are a little bit more current because a lot of these\nClean stream laws and policies that were made around them for what's acceptable industrial pollution haven't been changed in decades and the fines for violating them aren't even that step so they feel more like a tax for doing business than a deterrent for doing it again so I Hope that were a success story but\nYou know I don't want to sound like the glass as half empty person every time I met somebody who's doing something great you turn around and you see somebody who's\nYou know

communities and in many other places in America but we didn't talk about it much before Flint\nThe city of Flint, Michigan has become a symbol for environmental injustice largely poor majority black city where the public water supply became poisoned by lead after Michigan officials changed its water source to save money\nThe Allegheny Front Reid Frazier was insolent recently at the society of environmental journalists annual conference and he got a firsthand look at the lead crisis there high rate daycare [noise]\nSo it's been about three years since the Flint water crisis made national headlines what's the latest that's happening with water\nSo Flint changed its water supply back to its original supply from Detroit that had been using before the crisis and its replaced a lot of lead service lines those are the lines that go from the street to the house and frequently like in Pittsburgh and Flynt there they're made out of lead\nThe lead levels in water have returned to below the EPA standard so that's the good news\nBut the bad news is even though the city's water is now technically clean many people still aren't using it they don't trust it a state of Michigan stopped providing bottled water earlier this year um they had been providing bottled water in these drop offs in sort of church parking lots around the city\nBut there are still these pick up location scattered around the city and when we were driving by I saw one of them I'm with people just are heading out cases of water and those are being provided through private donations\nWe heard from one resident of Flint tia ivory she said she takes very quick showers because the water still gives her rations and another problem she says there's a stigma for people like her when folks find out she's from Flint\nWas all places people like are you ... is your water sealed already you know why would not be clean I Would hope that somebody else to think I Will be physically filthy from bathing in our water is terrible we can really hear it in her voice\nYeah every I mean the the\nAnger the lack of trust in the water on the sort of feeling like people outside of Flint have turn their back on them\nIs pretty widespread and you go back to this idea that people don't trust the water multiple people told me they collect rain water to drink rather than use the public water um it's pretty remarkable some won't even give it to their pets or use it on their flowers are still afraid of what's in the water\nUnderstand that a legionnaires out\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nIs pretty widespread and you go back to this idea that people don't trust the water multiple people told me they collect rain water to drink rather than use the public water\nUm it's pretty remarkable some won't even give it to their pets or use it on their flowers there still afraid of what's in the water and understand the legionnaires outbreak was also attributed to the water crisis\nWhen the city changed water supplies they change the water treatment regime\nAnd we Janelle up bacteria that cause of legionnaires disease built up in the water system um they're still disagreement as to why that happens some say it's because there were low levels of chlorine in the water other said the new water source has warmer temperatures and that's better for bacteria build up\nBut the long in the short of it is a dozen people died from this outbreak and dozens more became sick and we met one of these people Jasmine McBride who was in the hospital for months and still struggles with health issues\nI went from [noise]\nFirst off not being able to walk talk [noise]\nI mean it was like having to learn everything all over again [noise]\nShe said she went into the hospital in August and woke up weeks later many weeks later doctors thought she wouldn't make it that's how bad her illness got and this is just one of those under the radar impacts of a crisis like this\nIs not something that we've heard a lot on the national news what is the overall feeling that you got from the people that you talk to their\nMainly people feel that they were betrayed by the people in agencies and governments meant to protect them and uh\nThere's a strong feeling that a lot of this neglect would not have occurred in wealthier wider communities we heard from Deborah for holding she's a public health scientist and director of the ... Center for health equity solutions\nShe says that you know remember this crisis was started by a cost saving measure not by the city's elected officials\nBut by the state appointed emergency manager who was appointed by Republican governor Rick Snyder and did she says deprive the residents of Flint of their democratic rights\nThey fed who they wanted to make decisions on their behalf and that voice was taken away from that and decisions were made and people were died things were done for people and to people that they had no voice fed and no by and and\nAnd you know there's this T shirt that people where Flint lives matter um that I saw people wearing there and I think that that sort of encapsulates what a lot of people are feeling there that the rest of society abandon them and then we still need to pay attention exactly what did you take\nFrom this experience in Flint like as a reporter working on environmental issues here in Pittsburgh\nI gotta say none of what I saw in Flint seemed all that far fetched coming from Pittsburgh you know we had our own led crisis a beginning a couple of years ago and I mean the cities are are remarkably similar you have this historically depopulated industrial city\nCity that's heavily racially segregated city under state supervision for its finances which Pittsburgh was for a while\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet the Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press", "show_name": "The Allegheny Front", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "16"}
