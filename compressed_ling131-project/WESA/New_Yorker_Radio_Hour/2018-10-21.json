Nazi lore we've seen a lot of this on the Internet but it's been ...\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAnd the United states of America when did this all started what did the origins of it it's never really not existed but in terms of the most recent resurgence of it um you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely note that Democrats have engaging that Republicans have engaged in it\nBut it's not even really a dog whistle anymore it's kind of just a whistle you know there's there's there's more and more openness with people just espousing white nationalist views and that has a lot to do with Trump\nWill people would point out that when Ronald Reagan was for his campaigning for president he campaigned and give it a big speech in the show but county Mississippi and he talked there about nothing less than states rights and this was at the very least a dog whistle to the far right is that something different and why because he\nVoted for tonight it when people asked him he said states rights doesn't mean that when people ask Nixon what do you mean by silent majority what do you mean by law and order he vociferously denied it\nThey're not really denying it anymore so people like you know Steve King who is a congressman and Iowa he's not flirting with the line he he doesn't believe that these lines should exist\nSo what does what does Steve king's history what does he said and done\nSo Steve King is a congressman from Iowa he's a represented the western part of Iowa for Fifteen Years at this point he's running for re election in November\nAnd he he's very clearly into you know dog whistle racism he talks a lot about western civilization and European heritage and that kind of stuff but he always in the past would leave some plausible deniability\nAnd then just in the last couple of years partly because of Trump's and partly because he has a Twitter account\nHe um has been saying things like demographics our destiny and then he says we can't restore our civilization with someone else's babies\nThere's no way to read that that doesn't take our civilization to mean white people there is no plausible reading of it other than a white nationalist reading to see tonight well not really I mean he kinda gets called to the mat and says\nNo I don't regret saying that he doesn't take down to Haiti doesn't delete them he kinda says oh this you know PC culture everybody gets called racist all the time you know you guys are always pro clutching and stuff but he never walk back the actual substance nor does he ever like explain how that could mean anything other than white nationalism\nWell let's talk about what we're talking about let's listen to one of Stephen King statements about diversity this is from an interview that he gave to in Iowa radio program\nAnd when you start the differences then you'll end up with people that are at each other's throats than adding up this panic than black and he predicts there'll be a greater number that whites that America I'll protect the panic then the blacks will be fighting each other before that\n... what do you make of that uh I mean there are there are much more extreme examples of his rhetoric than that but basically it's that's kind of a turning the tables of saying by talking about\nUh you know the black voting block or the Hispanic voting bloc\nAnyone doing that if they're for the race is Paul Ryan the speaker of the house was asked where do you stand on this and he waits three days or something and then I forgot how long he waited by Paul Ryan puts out this very carefully worded statement that doesn't mention Steve king's name at all that just says we abhor racism so\nIn other words it's not like he's such an outlier that the rest of the GOP can very comfortably wash their hands with him and say he's not our guy he is there a guy there not pulling funding from him at least not in a way that they're making public\nTo what does it suggest about American politics that the most powerful leader and one of the houses of Congress Paul Ryan feel they cannot afford to reject somebody like\nKing it's terrifying it\nScreaming on WGN supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation [noise] detail on a master's program [noise]\nAny dot edu flash I I I [noise]\nPort based to give up on\nYou spent the last year marinating in the juices of what one could call a cyber predator fascism yeah fortunately talking to a lot of people who are are the very most active players and voices in what you're going to fascism and\nWhat does it tell you about American political life\nLook I think it's not that everything has utterly transformed and you know we weren't\nWe weren't close to the brink and now we are I mean we're closer now for sure but um what is the brink well it can't happen here you know that that notion that you know yeah ... ... fascism could have happened in Europe but it can't happen here\nI think we're now all starting to see that there is no law of nature that says that the walls of the United states that we we we are in extremely flawed\nSociety with a extremely a dicey racial history that I'm perhaps a uniquely so among the countries we're talking about\nDemocracy is a very delicate tricky thing right if Steve King is now going out there and just essentially saying to the people of Iowa hello I'm a white nationalist do you want to vote for me or do you want to vote for the other guy there's no guarantee that they want to vote for the other guy\nWell let's talk about the other guy his opponent kings opponent is a Democrat and former baseball player named J. D. shoulder to shoulder and have a chance and what are the dynamics of that race look like\nHe's much taller so that's generally a good thing about sixty six six and he's driving around the district in Winnebago and you know shaking everyone's hand and being very folksy he's out fundraising king\nHe's still down in the polls incumbency is a very powerful thing in house elections and king has been there for six terms with the district thing it's deep deep red as they say and king you know it's it's you you might not know this from looking at his Twitter feed but racism is not the only thing you know he also\nYou know once ethanol subsidies and he also you know says he wants to support farmers now he's been in Congress for Fifteen Years he has sponsored exactly one bill that passed which was to rename a post office in Iowa so he's not the most effective legislator\nNow that we live in the age of ... are there new politicians on the scene who seemed to be entering the stage or coming onto the stage in a way they might not have before\nYeah I think someone like Stewart he was someone who the Virginia a GOP just thought would fizzle out and he's running for Senate he's running for Senate against Tim Kaine who will probably win but you know what's this level of support\nHe's doing better than one would expect I mean he he won the primary and his whole national image is based on being standing up for these Confederate monuments we can't turn them down there our heritage\nHe was born and raised in Duluth, Minnesota so not the heart of the confederacy are to the confederacy Steve came by the way it used to have a Confederate flag on his desk in the Capitol building which by the way Iowa sent a lot of soldiers to die to fight against the confederacy so it's like gee I Wonder what that flag means to you\nIn New Jersey and the state of New Jersey or New Jersey congressman Seth gross was dropped by the Republican Party after saying that diversity is crap is that an outlier incident is that a very rare instance of the of the party standing up to some of this extremist voices\nI think he I think the set Grossman thing was a bit of an anomaly I mean you have even more in most cases than that you have a guy named Arthur Jones in Illinois who is literally a Nazi who stands in front of Nazi flags and give speeches and he won a GOP primary in a district where it's heavily democratic and so they don't bother to\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E s say ... NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\nIt's very scary that a literal Nazi is is running for office in Illinois and that and that this guy ... is running for office in New Jersey but those are outliers I mean so I don't want to paint the picture that you know this is happening everywhere all the time\nAnd then the course of that discovered that Mike Flynn who was going to be the incoming national security adviser um had been having discussions with Mr Kislyak who was the Russian ambassador\nUm essentially imploring him not to do anything in response to those sanctions but then the situation got a lot worse\nBecause people in the administration starting with Sean Spicer and others and ultimately come the culminating a vice president Pence\nUm went out and were telling the American people that there had been no such discussions we knew because we had recordings of these conversations that we weren't the only ones who knew\nThat General Flynn was providing false information ostensibly to ...\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet the Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nThe Russians knew that too and because this had become such a big public thing this is precisely the kind of information they would love to be able to hold over the head\nOf the national security advisor which made him potentially compromise compromise it's so it's a black male so what does what happened to 'em so I contacted Don McGahn who White House counsel 'em and told him that I needed to come see 'em right away\nTold him what we have learned that\nYou know the vice president have been on face the nation and saying you know I've talked to General Flynn personally and here's a sure that there were no conversations about sanctions so you got the the pay out there saying this step so we told\n'em Mr McGahn how we knew that it wasn't true how we happen to have recordings of these conversations and why we thought it was a problem\nAnd and you go see him a second time on January twenty seven yeah he asked me to come back and ... was that different are the same or what it was it was a little\nDifferent in the sense that um he was a bit more combative I guess I Would say in this discussion and I you know testified before the sort of one of his first question was what's it to the department of justice if one White House official lies to another\nAnd and what did you make of that [noise] um well I tried to explain to him that it was a whole lot more than just one White House official lying to another which\nGod that would help people would be concerned about any way but that it was more than that that the underlying conduct here that General Flynn having these discussions to begin with is problematic but beyond that again it's the issue of compromise that the Russians notice it provides potential leverage and this was a problem\nAnd we also thought you know the vice President Pence was entitled to know that the stuff that he was saying when he stood in you know in front of of the public\nThat that wasn't true so we were trying to help them\nSo your second meeting with Don McGahn is January twenty seventh also on January twenty seventh I'm an executive order is issue yeah um\nBanning travel from seven Muslim majority countries did you know anything about that until there was this you\nKnow and that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there and Don McGahn office talking to him at length\nAnd he doesn't tell me that the president at this point has already signed an executive order as you said banning immigration from these countries and that the department of justice is going to have to be in court the very next morning defending this\nSo how did you find out about the travel ban um I was in the car I was literally in the car on the way to the airport\nAnd I get a call I was able to keep one aide with name on a system my principal deputy the top deputy the whole time and so ... calls me and he says after you left you know I went online I was reading the New York times\nAnd it looks like President Trump has issued some sort of travel ban\nWe spent the weekend\nI'm trying to get our arms around and communicating with the White House of what is it that you're trying to do and by Monday morning I was told that we would have to take a physician on the constitutionality\nOf the travel ban the next morning and in a case so we convened everybody in my conference room and spent a very long time in there\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nOr what the White House position was in terms of the scope of the travel ban we talked about the different challenges by the constitutionally and statutory laying otherwise that have been filed [noise] um\nAnd at the end of that conversation\nI was not satisfied that it was lawful or constitutional and\nWhat troubles me beyond that was it became clear that to defend the constitutionality of this I was going to have to send department of justice lawyers and to take the position\nThat this travel ban that applied just a Muslim majority countries had absolutely nothing to do with religion\nAnd this was in the face of all of the president's statements that he had made both on the campaign trail and after he had been elected and\nThat did not seem like the truth to me\nBut isn't it usually been job the department of justice to defend\nActions of the administration even if you personally would not have ... you know issued that order or you hear the president's you're the executive branch's lawyers writer why wasn't that good enough for you to say I'm going to defend this\nWell it wasn't just that I disagreed with this on a policy ground perhaps the appropriate thing than to do would be to resign if you can't be part of that [noise] um but not directed apart but not to defend it but here's what's different is that\nI happen to believe ... should go into court and make an argument that is not grounded in ... but the department of justice [noise] I mean\n[noise] if the O. J. stands for anything it's supposed to stand for what is true and what is just [noise] so what did you do [noise]\nI knew that I personally couldn't be parked I'm defending this an argument something that that wasn't grounded in truth on but you know I thought about what may be the thing to do was reside and that would have protected my personal integrity I wouldn't have been part of this um\nBut I was like just the head of the civil division or you know some other component of the department\nI was the acting attorney general of the United states and I felt like I had a responsibility to protect not just my personal integrity but the integrity of the department of justice as well and I thought back to my confirmation hearing\nWhen I'm there were some senators including Senator Sessions\nWho they were all over me and my confirmation hearing about\nWhat I Would do if the president asked me to do something that was a mall for wrong and I think Senator Sessions said you know even if it's just something that would bring disrupt ... to the department of justice you know you're going to be asked to do that and we'll use saying that\nYou know none of them were asking me will you resign they were asking me will you saying no and they were right about that it wasn't my responsibility in that position I think to resign I think it was my responsibility to sign up so how did you say no they\nI mean it wasn't like a state public statement it was just a communication that we\nBoth we had there were communications going on at levels below me and between me and Mr McGahn and I actually the directive to the department and then what happens [noise] um I was fired\nYou were fired by Donald Trump before it was fashionable [laughter] hired by Donald Trump\nDreaming on W.
