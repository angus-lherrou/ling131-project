stay\n\nThere's somebody more five WBFO Pittsburgh is NPR News\nWith voice and say I'm stories all over the world at right here right now you'll find a streaming a W E s I taught I found [noise] this is Ninety play at five as am W E essay\nAnd Ninety point five a ski once for the Pittsburgh NPR News [noise]\nI mean at that the fake I Am\nOh [noise]\nHave\nOne world\nTrade Center in Manhattan is just a New Yorker radio our production of ... studios and the New Yorker\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nThe big story going into the mid term elections\nHas been the possibility of a blue wave a democratic upsurge that's notable for the number of women running and for progressive candidates like ... rock in Texas in Alexandria Ocasio Cortez in New York but another story in this election is the very opposite\nThe candidates who are running as extremists on the right openly white supremacist candidates even neo Nazis Andrew Moran has been covering the movement known as the old right\nAnd he's watching how it influences mainstream politics\nInjure you've been reporting on the fringes of right wing nationalism and all the associated movements people like Mike ... for example who was involved in pizza gate\nAnd you've also written about the Nazi website the Daily Stormer which is built on disturbed Nazi lore we've seen a lot of this on the Internet but it's been many years since really far right white supremacist had been running for office in the United states of America when did this all start what are the origins of it\nIt's never really not exist but in terms of the most recent resurgence of it um you know Trump has a lot to do with it I mean there there's always been dog whistle politics right and we should definitely note that Democrats have engagement Republicans have engaged in it\nBut it's not even really a dog whistle anymore it's kind of just a whistle you know there's there's there's more and more openness with people just espousing white nationalist views and that has a lot to do with Trump\nWill people would point out that when Ronald Reagan was first campaigning for president he campaigned and give a big speech in the show but county Mississippi and he talked there about nothing less than states rights and this was at the very least a dog whistle to the far right is that something different and why because he\nWas the first thing tonight it when people asked him he said states rights doesn't mean that when people ask Nixon what do you mean by silent majority what do you mean by law and order he ... he denied it\nThey're not really denying it anymore so people like you know Steve King who is a congressman and Iowa he's not flirting with the line he he doesn't believe that the line should exist\nSo what does what does Steve king's history what does he said and done\nSo Steve King is a congressman from Iowa he's a represented the western part of Iowa for Fifteen Years at this point he's running for re election in November and he he's very clearly into you know dog whistle racism he talks a lot about western civilization\nScreaming on WGN supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation [noise] detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu slash I I I [noise]\nCouple of years partly because of Trump's and partly because he has a Twitter account\nHe um has been saying things like demographics our destiny and then he says we can't restore our civilization with someone else's babies\nThere's no way to read that that doesn't take our civilization to mean white people there is no plausible reading of it other than a white nationalist reading to see tonight well not really I mean he kinda gets called to the mat and says\nNo I don't regret saying that he doesn't take down to Haiti doesn't delete them he kinda says oh this you know PC culture everybody gets called racist all the time you know you guys are always pro clutching and stuff but he never walk back the actual substance nor does he ever like explain how that could mean anything other than white nationalism\nWell let's talk about what we're talking about let's listen to one is Stephen King statements about diversity this is from an interview that he gave to in Iowa radio program\nAnd when you start the differences then you'll end up with people that are at each other's throats than adding up Hispanic than black and he predicts will be a greater number that whites that America I offered this panic then the blacks will be fighting each other before that\n... what do you make of that\nUh I mean there are there are much more extreme examples of his rhetoric than that but basically it's that's kind of a turning the tables of saying by talking about\nUh you know the black voting block or the Hispanic voting bloc\nAnyone doing that is there for the race is Paul Ryan the speaker of the house was asked where do you stand on this and he waits three days or something and then I forgot how long he waited but Paul Ryan puts out this very carefully worded statement that doesn't mention Steve king's name at all that just says we abhor racism\nSo in other words it's not like he's such an outlier that the rest of the GOP can very comfortably wash their hands with him and say he's not our guy he is there a guy there not pulling funding from him at least not in a way that they're making public\nTo what does it suggest about American politics that the most powerful leader and one of the houses of Congress Paul Ryan feel they cannot afford to reject somebody like ...\nIt's terrifying it's yeah it means that they've read the tea leaves and they know that this is too big a part of their support base to give up on\nYou spent the last year marinating in the juices of what one could call a cyber predator fascism yeah fortunately talking to a lot of people who are are the very most active players and voices in what you're going to fascism and\nWhat does it tell you about American political life\nLook I think it's not that everything has utterly transformed and you know we weren't\nWe weren't close to the brink and now we are I mean we're closer now for sure but um what is the brake well it can't happen here you know that that notion that\nYou know yeah ... fascism could have happened in Europe but it can't happen here I think we're now all starting to see that there is no law of nature that says that the walls of the United states that we we we are an extremely flawed\nSociety where the extremely a dicey racial history that I'm perhaps a uniquely so among the countries we're talking about\nDemocracy is a very delicate tricky thing right if Steve King is now going out there and just essentially saying to the people of Iowa hello I'm a white nationalist do you want to vote for me or do you want to vote for the other guy there's no guarantee that they want to vote for the other guy\nTalk about the other guy his opponent kings opponent is a Democrat and former

E. N. say is supported by Carnegie Mellon university's integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program at\nThe end you dot edu slash I\nNeither which God that would help people would be concerned about anyway but then it was more than that that the underlying conduct here that General Flynn having these discussions to begin with is problematic but beyond that again it's the issue of compromise that the Russians notice it provides potential leverage and this is a problem\nAnd we also thought you know the vice President Pence\nWas entitled to know that the stuff that he was saying when he stood and you know in front of of the public\nThat that wasn't true so we were trying to help them\nSo your second meeting with Don McGahn is January twenty seven also on January twenty seventh I'm an executive order is issue yeah um\nBanning travel from seven Muslim majority countries did you know anything about that until there was this you\nKnow and that's the remarkable thing I'm sitting right there and Don McGahn office talking to him at length\nAnd he doesn't tell me that the president at this point has already signed an executive order as you said banning immigration from these countries and that the department of justice is going to have to be in court the very next morning defending\nThis so how did you find out about the travel there\nUm I was in the car I was literally in the car on the way to the airport\nAnd I get a call I was able to keep one a with name on a system my principal deputy the top deputy the whole time and so ... calls me and he says after you left you know I went online I was reading the New York times\nAnd it looks like President Trump has issued some sort of traveled path\nWe spent the weekend\nI'm trying to get our arms around in communicating with the White House of what is it that you're trying to do and by Monday morning I was told that we would have to take a position on the constitutionality\nOf the travel ban the next morning and in a case so we convened everybody in my conference room and spent a very long time in there I'm Talking through what the challenges were\nWhat the White House position was in terms of the scope of the travel ban we talked about the different challenges by the constitutionally and statutory laying otherwise that have been filed um\nAnd at the end of that conversation\nI was not satisfied that it was lawful or constitutional and\nWhat troubles me beyond that was it it became eminently clearer that to defend the constitutionality of this I was going to have to send department of justice lawyers and to take the position\nThat this travel ban that applied just a Muslim majority countries had absolutely nothing to do with religion\nAnd this was in the face of all of the president's statements that he had made both on the campaign trail and after he had been elected and\nThat did not seem like the truth to me\nBut isn't it usually been job the department of justice to defend\nActions of the administration even if you personally would not have ... you know issued the order or ... years the president's ... the executive branch's lawyers writer why wasn't that good enough for you to say I'm going to defend us\nWell it wasn't just that I disagreed with this on a policy grant and perhaps the appropriate thing then to do would be to resign if you can't be\nDreaming on W.
