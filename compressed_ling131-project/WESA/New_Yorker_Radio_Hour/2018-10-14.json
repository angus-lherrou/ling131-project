election security\nAnd what she's found should scare us all\nLogan lamb is a security researcher in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy\nI enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free\nTime in August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election he started poking around the Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems\nWhich ran all the elections in Georgia\nOr in the course of doing that I did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... elections documents all dot edu or Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website\nAnd generally that turns up reports or public presentations\nAnd this this particular search didn't\nTurn that up instead I found it very curious links and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or name in some sort of a dinner fire next to their name and I immediately thought wild but that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and and what he found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor password to be used on election day there were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected\nImmediately I thought to myself while this this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on this Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen ... gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself will be a huge story but on top of it lamb also found security hole through which you could download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their address birthday last four digits of their Social Security number and their driver's license number\nAnd then there were also gyms databases and uh gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which does the final vote count\nIs Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would have been a bone and so that\nThe scariest scenario I can think of would be\nAn attacker implanting malware on the programs that are placed on the electronic poll books or altering the voter registration databases to disenfranchise\nVoters an attacker could have compromise the Web server and used it as a beach head to get deeper into the center for election systems networks [noise]\nThis is right around the same

election system to protect it from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\n[noise] it wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched\nThen more information started to trickle out\n[noise] the intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked about Russian cyber attacks election systems in the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to election servers in a number of states including Georgia [noise]\n\nLook we have no idea of the Russians made alterations to Georgia and election systems and twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know but this is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms\nA few months ago the director of national intelligence that the warning lights are blinking red some states took this seriously but others seem to have left themselves wide open\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that their authority but they're not cyber security experts Susan green hall is the policy director of a national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right\nUm so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their machinery and perhaps even elsewhere since the same machines are used a cross country\nSure that the machines used in Georgia are computerized touch screen voting machines Georgia is one of five states that entirely had machine that don't have a paper ballot\nAnd then there's also other machines which can paper about those are all the computers and those machines can be hacked and have digital records changed within them and that's why\nHaving the paper ballot it's so crucial because it it's that linked to what the voter got to see and say that's how I voted and to be sure that that's what's counted correctly\nElection security folks are on the ground and people who are the vendors that these machines insists that they're not really ... because they're not connected to the Internet\nAnd I wonder if you just explain why it is that there's this discrepancy in in um the explanation for the safety of these machines\nWhile many of the machines that you and I might interact with on election day at our polling location whether it's a touch screen voting machine or an optical scanner on may not be connected to the Internet\nIt has to get programming information from another machine which is essentially desktop or regular laptop computer that program here are the candidates here at the races here is how the ballot should lay out that information has to go from that computer to the\nVoting machine that's in the polling location by some sort of removable media and it's well known that if the device that is doing the programming gets infected with me\nDreaming on W.\nE.
