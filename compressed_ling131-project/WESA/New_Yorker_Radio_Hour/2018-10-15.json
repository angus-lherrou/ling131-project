[noise] this is Ninety five FM W E essay\nAnd Ninety point five eight feet one for the Pittsburgh for NPR News [noise]\nCame in at the fake I Am\n\nSomeone in Manhattan is certainly a lot of covert action in the New Yorker WNYC studio ...\nWelcome to the New Yorker radio hour I'm David Remnick\nWhen we first began learning of Russian interference in the twenty sixteen election which seemed absolutely mind boggling at the time something that just couldn't happen he was often said that Russia had hacked the election we quickly learn to more specific\nMore accurate way of putting it Russia had influence the election by manipulating political messages on Facebook and so on but they hadn't exactly gone into election computer systems an altered the results not exactly now if foreign agents could actually change the outcome of an election that would be and you can say this lightly\nAn existential threat to American democracy\nBut what we've learned since twenty sixteen is if somebody really did want to ... election it wouldn't be impossible not at all to help her and has been writing for the New Yorker about election security and what she's found should scare us all\nLogan lamb is a security researcher in Georgia I'm generally a curious guy I enjoy the poking around part I like to do that in my free time in August twenty sixteen at the height of the presidential election it started poking around Kennesaw State University's Center for election systems\nWhich ran all the elections in Georgia\nIn the course of doing that\nI did a very very simple Google Search 'em I said for the ... election dot an assault dot edu or Google please give me all of the PDF documents on this website and generally that turns up reports or public presentations\nAnd this this particular searched didn't\nTurn that up instead I found a very curious link and I was presented with a very long list of what appear to be a vote or name in some sort of done a fire next to their name and I immediately thought wow that that seems a little strange\nAnd then he crafted a simple program to download what was publicly accessible from the George election website and lay found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor pads were to be used\nOn election day there were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nYou don't need to be a cyber security\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nThe Georgia election website and what he found in all of that data astonished him\nThese documents contain supervisor password to be used on election day there were also windows programs that are placed on electronic pull books\nYou don't need to be a cybersecurity expert to know that supervisor passwords should absolutely not be sitting around on line unprotected immediately\nI fall to my book while this this doesn't look like sort of data they would purposefully put on the Web server\nIn total lamb downloaded Fifteen gigabytes worth of data from the center for election systems this by itself would be a huge story but on top of it lamb also found security hole through which you could download the entire database of the state six point seven million registered voters\nI had access to their full name their address birthday last four digits of their Social Security number and their driver's license number\n... and there were also gyms databases and uh gyms databases are used by the um gym server which is the central tabulate er which does the final vote count\nIf Logan lamb had been a bad guy this would've been a bone and so the\nThe scariest scenario I can think of would be an attacker implanting malware on the programs that are placed on the electronic poll books were altering the voter registration databases to disenfranchise voters\nAn attacker could have compromise the Web server and used it as a beach head to get deeper into the theater for election systems networks\nThis is right around the same time that the Georgia secretary of state Brian Kemp rejected an offer from the department of homeland security to help the state harden the election system to protect us from hackers because Kemp said that the system was secure the way it was and that the state didn't want any help from the federal government\nIt wasn't until march of twenty Seventeen so seven months after lamb's initial finding that the system was finally patched then more information started\nTo trickle out [noise] the intercept published the NSA report that had been hacked about Russian cyber attacks election systems and the lead up to twenty Seventeen and later the more indictments found that the Russian hackers had looked for vulnerabilities to elections servers and a number of states including Georgia [noise]\n\nLook we have no idea if the Russians made alterations to Georgia's election system and twenty sixteen and if they did we probably wouldn't know but this is a critical moment we know that foreign actors are interested in our election system just as we head into the midterms\nA few months ago the director of national intelligence set the warning lights are blinking red some states took this seriously\nBut others seem to have left themselves wide open\nWe're in a new world now we need we understand the states need to run elections that their authority but they're not cybersecurity experts citizen green hall is the policy director of the national election defense coalition\nSo you know you and I met at DEF CON where people were hacking lots of election machines left and right um so I Wonder if you could just talk a little bit more about some of the problems in Georgia I'm with their
