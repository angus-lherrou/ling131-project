your experience just to show the explanation of how Mr ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than the kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president\nFree will read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News they have a free press\nWas directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both Washington and we were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual\nBut we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a of right for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior in the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French who do supply weapons as well or to the to the Saudis to\nSuspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies or to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen\nWhich by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior\nMain argument of your book is is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership or in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid an foreign society's\nWell yes the export of a democracy to foreign countries on to a point of a ... and that is not the most effective way to do it\nBut there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries\nThat are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet this administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues and one would hope that a president of the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it does not the only factor we have other interests\nAre and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the in the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just expressing outrage there practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are a used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work together to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arm shipments\nA that would have real leverage over the Saudis the president keeps on talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us we're at twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy\nAnd that make clear that the kind of behavior we kept two weeks is unacceptable ... thank you thank you\nSo during for profit is a new you probably remember hatred mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War that American mercenaries working for foreign powers that\nSomething that they were in Boston has been looking into his investigative reporter for buzzfeed news\nFree with law read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station at a free press\nOr us retired special forces which is what you're talking about your investigation and such demand\nFor the last Seventeen years seals special forces and other parts of the U.S government have excelled\nAt this modern style of warfare at uh the sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that said the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is\nMhm but your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them as the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden in twenty fifty\nThese special forces a an emcee all veterans Navy SEAL veterans' day deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the Aden branch of Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen as soon as long as the party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes hired this company to kill this local political leader does he only\nAnd Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you use your guest in this story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was reservists and he was a seal reservists\nHe he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had a ... a top secret clearance sources told us\nEven when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know and I guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal that us citizens couldn't do that there are laws that govern whether the U.S whether us\nIndividuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nAre you seeing how Americans have served in the French ah well I've I've mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces and these are not ...\nA lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during World War short\nRight yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries but I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you're enjoying a foreign military just for the money now and by the way this doesn't apply to people who join ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that as as it gets a little ... this is a buzzfeed story\nNot an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it [noise] um is this an anecdote or a trend\nIs this an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend or they're the only ones who've done this or the other countries who try it's um are there other Americans other than the ones that are other Americans are going to leave you've uncovered yeah
