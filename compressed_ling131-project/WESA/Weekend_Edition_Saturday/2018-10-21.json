I'm a great\nWell is another referendum even possible I mean we have these very chaotic negotiations um the prime minister they're really struggling to hammer out a deal um is a vote possible\nSo ... it's possible we could have\n... uh the prime minister Theresa May have said\nThat is not going to be another ... but that could be one technically however it would take months and months to plan a second to get all the legislation in place and he's had a beginning what ever sneak you to leave in March they probably weren't going to be some kind of people's votes it would have to then\nThat the day in March would have to be put back so the British Government would have to agree to that and all the other countries in the ... say twenty seven other countries [noise] yeah it would have to agree to during that so it's a it's a big asking this amount of time reading\nThat's the b._b._c. Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and truly local concerns and that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule\nI'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me\nAll right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats\nAnd that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there is some kind of blue wave that developed to President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket it's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nThe millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or a U.S house seat might have\nSaid they're just going to maybe ... just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidates\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves than ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin are two states that were really important in twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix your car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle and if the situation\nWould reverse would Republicans hammering the same issue\nYeah I I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states say that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip in one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they are talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election\nIt's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that soon as much trouble is Connecticut because again those national tides just can overwhelm everything yet but taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases\nHave traced a lot of uh Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere is something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census is coming up in twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the ... the state legislators who were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections\nDemocrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs and a lot of these states where state legislatures draw the line now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships\nThere'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks are going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nLead Wilson national

Navarro head of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians express or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz laughter Hispanic nickname his rival that overlooks has long used\n\nWas cruising self hasn't escaped scrutiny here from Chris Cuomo on CNN\nPut your name is Raphael you know you go by kid that's an angle sized version of it he was the other way and just this week\nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for claiming native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA tests\nDeprived Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU who's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarized says that we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nUse identity sometimes in a in a very good way reside dusting for example here's our American identity\nDreaming on W. E. N. quoted by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu last I I I\nAnd when they don't do much good and also I think when we do bring them in were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people to different from each other so that the idea that you\nFix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading at best\nStill matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on\nBut I think we can taken too seriously and then many political context I'm\nThe most important thing isn't that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them is that they should be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that isn't necessarily the candidate who's best view on other grounds so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the role of identity politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or co opting\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer your question directly gingerly carefully [laughter] I I think you you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently doing\nIs mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that leads down a terrible road because once you've created essay racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to heal the wounds and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know well through the ... century\nThey're drawing people together a through making them feel ashamed of hostility to some other\nAnd in our country right now I'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is a political identities right now the labels conservative and liberal\nAre associated with sort of tribal feelings of a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody of the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means that you lose the sense that in an election we vote and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order that they should run the country\nThe Sandy you I mean I'm hearing a real concern that identity and and the politics around it it has been weaponized and and it certainly\nYeah I think I think it is worrying I mean look the fact is you know countries today is that we're more divided around identities then we are around policies\nSo that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come to reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things where there's a sort of sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because of the people who are most engaged in politics I think that every concession is not coming together but losing losing to the other side\nAnd in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it's it's about making sure that your bases satisfied making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're part of the common caught\nYes now the question is whether you can do that without what your cold Rodney recognizing identity and I think you can I think you can talk for example more about the actual policies\nDemocracy needs the capacity for compromise and telling everything into an identity issue makes it very hard to compromise Kwame Anthony\nFried ... free to pursue the truth
