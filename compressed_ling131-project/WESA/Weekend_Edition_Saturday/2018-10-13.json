division and is a contributing editor of Oxford American at a professor of English and creative writing\nAt the University of Mississippi joins us now from Oxford, Mississippi thanks so much for being with us thank you so much for wanting to talk to you [noise] when someone says do you tell me about your mother [laughter] it's not a simple question is it\nOh not at all not at I look forward to it on my mother's incredible model and like most Americans she just had\nA rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patches she had me when she was a sophomore Jackson State university and she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty\nAnd Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life\nI think her from a ride on the practice that I still have now but they're right on the practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the chair that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nWell um [noise] and we do have to get to that don't we\nFace up to the outside world your mother a progressive voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know when I was around ... she started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police white people would be even a harsher\nAnd those beatings just started to get progressive way worse\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town from her partner also started to get progressive we worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing to us\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the ... from your mother the ... the she endured\nAll of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOne of the things that I was going to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cost just traumatic thing but I Will say\nThe layers of\nParticular kinds of abuse really personal and structural thing led to me\nEating way more than I should have I was a very very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kids so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women have to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nAn eventually I started to start as a way of attempt in ... in a disappear yeah\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station farms have a free press\nVery very big kid luckily I was a big athletic kids so I didn't have to deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and that a lot of really big women have to deal with but I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding 'em\nAn individual you have started to start as a way of attempting to hide and tempted to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours at night and I play a lot of basketball and the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days and there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation\nAnd I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police about it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay with people when they see me a such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how does that enter your life\nOh man I'm by the time and my body broke my body literally wrote from overused and wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me some sort of feeling was gambling and so every cent that are made from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt's hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I've talked about in that book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way yeah you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely the perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe aren't able to keep right and especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through\nMy gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win though I told myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home that two hours filling absolutely like trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experience in but I Know they were and that's actually do the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse\nThe addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI I don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now what do you care what she thinks\nI Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher and my mother not love me enough to instill a practice at an\nEarly age and this book in some way is like her investment coming full circle she really believes that reading and writing can save and I don't
