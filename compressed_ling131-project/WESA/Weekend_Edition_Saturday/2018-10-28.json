to tackle the problem and a boy co why rocket why rock of finding fixes podcast reports how that works\nBack when ... was the police chief stand would Washington population seven thousand people he thought rural communities like his were immune from the opioid crisis until one day a mother walked through his door\nAnd basically said gee if you have a heroin problem in your community and I I remember thinking most impossible standard than heroin is in big cities you know with homeless population does not in\nRural America for decades heroin was a big city problem but no longer in the recent NPR poll about half of rural Americans said the opioid problem in their communities has worsened in the last five years\nNow ... agrees a few years ago he was elected sheriff of ... county he toward the jail and saw this\nVery very sick very very sick people because the talking from heroin is like having the worst possible stomach virus you can have people around out there you know they're just they're just suffering\nThe county jail had become a de facto detox center at any given time around half the inmates were withdrawing from ...\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet the Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nIt took becoming the sheriffs to see the impacts inside the jail with heroin abuse to see the impacts on the community across the entire county for me to realize that we had we had to change a lot about what we're doing\nSo they did last year ... county where I stand with is located declared the opioid epidemic a life threatening emergency now they're responding to the opioid epidemic as if it were a natural\nDisaster the same way they'd mobilized to respond to a landslide or flu pandemic snow how much county is the first county in the country to treat it this way [noise] the idea grew out of their experience with another tremendous disaster in the county [noise]\nTwenty fourteen the town of Oso, Washington

which is like fifty\nCoordination life safety what they used that system of everyone working together across government agencies to tackle the opioid epidemic\nCounty leader took the idea and ran with it is now the response to the opioid epidemic is run out of a special emergency operations center a lot like during the Oso landslide\nEvery two weeks representative from across local government meet people in charge of everything from fire trucks to the dump\nThe technical name for this group is the multi agency coordination group or Mac group it come straight out of FEMA's emergency response playful six ten is completed may talk through PowerPoint slides I think family virus kind of the numbers refer to items\nOn there to do list there are seven big goals like reduced opioid misuse and reduce damage to the community\nEach school is broken down into smaller pieces like distributing needle cleanup cats and a project to train schoolteachers to recognize trauma in addiction\nIs to do list is over one hundred items long some of these goals a really long term I'm not going to take years decades I or ten is also the spokesperson for this group she says the key is to be realistic\nSo if you set an objective for yourself to just end the opioid epidemic you're probably never going to be successful in in either in any of our lifetime um by breaking it down it's like eating an elephant you just kind of eat one piece at a time breaking it down into a piece that you can actually digest\nThey make transportation easier for people in drug treatment they train family members and

E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program\nAt CMU dot edu flash I I I\nWe attack on a Jewish community on us soil I'm like in a loving people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all this mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America\nAt a rate unprecedented in decades\nYeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like every one is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the at the edge of the synagogue up to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun laying flowers memorials I'm just at the edge of the there's sort of a shrub a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner [noise]\nUm and it's just you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and uh people are\nGrappling as they as they do and and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the the grieving is really just beginning here\nI think we're expecting this conference momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding or they mentioned\nThere will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a that's of course happened out of house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight local children's museum opens its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place\nIt's so hard to talk to children after something like this happened so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's um and ... and so uh that's just one small thing the community is doing to try to help families\nA Jewish and otherwise uh throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around the country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now\n\n\nYeah incredibly moving and somber\nUm what has been the response from elected officials so far\nWell it depends on what your elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence as a normal part of American Life\nI'm as something that has become more and more common place in American Life nonetheless\nThe president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside of the Senate\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet very Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nSickly and and they did engage with the shooter and several of them were shot in the process and\nThe president also suggested that perhaps bringing back the death penalty would help deter such attacks\nWorth noting that the death penalty is still on the books and in Pennsylvania I'm although it's been a a couple of decades since it was carried out I'm at the same time you know there are several other states where there'd been mass shootings in recent years think of Texas that that actively carry out that's at sentences but unless the president is calling for that to be more of the conversation\nAnd obviously President Trump has a personal relationship with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime\nRate and and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was you know sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out um [noise]\nUh of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that when you\nWalk around Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with\nThis and and trying to make sense of it uh what are they saying about um why this might have happened well I think\nIn these situations and and I I've not been on the ground here if it's for too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there is there's a search for why after the Las Vegas shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motor for crimes that they can prosecute investigate and so that they can maybe try to reduce that\nThere's also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we've said\nIndications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant of motives\nThat tells us something about why this might have happened again that's still under investigation but um it is being investigated as I as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a press conference get started pretty soon here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting I'm we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities and Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happens and also we'd like to know more about about the victims soon\nWe're going to bring in ... or Mara Liasson now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the terms um and a lot of people are looking at this and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections Mara good morning It's MORNING\nSo set the scene for us the president's response and and basically how oh\nA western Pennsylvania is blessed to have so many a law enforcement agencies that work together that train together\nA N yesterday just showed how that works city colleagues state federal agencies working together no egos working together for what's right and uh I Can't thank them enough for that\nUh and just a we're going to get through this and we're going to continue on and show with Pittsburgh is made up so thank

Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters or the Tina voter are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely meant and their race at all unless it's a story about race\nWe talk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are very identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class voters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not things that concern voters of color and the voters of color are somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true yeah\nAnd somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so I have tweeted frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after ...\nDreaming on W.
