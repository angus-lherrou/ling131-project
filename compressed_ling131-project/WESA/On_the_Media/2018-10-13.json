we heard earlier\nLife today is too complex people are too dependent upon each other jobs are too highly specialized for us to do business five ... that's why we depend on money as a quick and easy medium of exchange\nOnly problem is says now we're no matter what we learned in school the anthropological record offers no evidence of simple barter anywhere in history\nYeah so the barter story is a an origin story for money that you know has a a very long history Aristotle actually use that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what the kind of good and bad functions of money could be\nAnd in the nineteenth century as economics is becoming professionalized economists picked up\nThis barter origin story for money and kind of set it for the into the world [noise]\nUm the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if you go to a New Guinea village and the highlands and see people exchanging shells for pigs you might think a ha there it is\nThis is for instance a yet to hack a plate of string decorated with calories and other precious objects which was used by the ... people in New guinea to determine and to pay for the exact price of a pig\nThat's barter but but what you're really seeing is part of a much more complex series of relationships that people are engaged in that generally you have to do with some pretty serious social concerns concerns over birth over marriage over death\nOver the continuation of a lineage or a tribe where the pig in this case isn't just any old pig being exchanged and I always think of you know Charlotte's Web in this context some\n\nSome get some tickets a special pig that indicates a relationship between families it's not just a commodity that value can be set by the price mechanism the way that the ... story assumed so how did this barter a mythology or become so nearly universal why is this news to me\nVery often origin stories are serving contemporary interests so if we want to believe that the market as it exists today and that money as it exists today is natural normal inevitable\nThan something like the barter origin story helps us justify it continued existence helps us able look\nYou know this is a rational response to the problem with a double coincidence of wants which is what economists call that problem when you know I've got fish and you've got apples and you

current conditions but when you start kind of\nCracking it open and start sort of peeling back the layers and realizing that\nThat's not really how it happened in that how it happened was you know actually a lot more interesting in a lot more complicated and involved things like record keeping accounting systems of measure uh states and early state control and shaping of markets and so forth well then you're in a whole other realm\nThe real story is told in Mesopotamia and tablets and other artifacts record keeping dating from the rise of agriculture and settled communities in the ancient Near East phenomena that demanded the invention of book keeping\nWe're dealing now with people who aren't just hunting and gathering but are growing grain\nAnd are taking care of animals like sheep and goats these commodities have seasonal cycles I plant the grain and it takes a while to turn into stuff that I can read and turned into you know do and bread\nAnd sheep and goats only Cav during certain parts of the year you know if I'm planting grain and I'm going to give some to you after a period of time and you're raising goats and you're going to give some to me after a period of time we both have the built in ... analogy of those plants and animals to deal with\nAnd what we start to see in those situations is the emergence of central authorities\nCentral clearing houses which had some properties of temples observe spiritual authority and some of thanks\nSo this is going to kind of over simplify it but we basically right little contracts to each other that say things like okay

crescent millennia ago it's from a different temp to Chicago\nBoard of trade so it'd be trading floor from two thousand and six [noise] but you get the idea and in both cases every promise was recorded\nWe have scribes in these temples keep track of these contracts and that's where we start to see something like money\nThat's kind of a time deferred contract for the settlement of a debt recorded on that clay I'd like to joke that you know in the beginning was not the coin in the beginning was the receipt and that's essentially what you've got in those clay tablets\nAnd other slightly
