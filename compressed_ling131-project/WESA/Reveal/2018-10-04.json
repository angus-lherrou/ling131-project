what he ate\nLunch [noise]\nJust something for\nCheese sandwiches with lettuce for breakfast lunch and dinner [noise]\nWith water or maybe apple juice and sometimes they threw in chips and by the way

[noise]\nSomething else I asked Wilson to do with to draw a picture of where he was kept so let me show you a few of those [noise]\nThis is Wilson's first trying for me I'm In this is what he describes as where he slept in the office very abstract children's art but you can sort of ...\nThese are like uh the sleeping bags or with a bunch that they were in\nRome yeah those are the maps are mattresses that they had on the floor and there are eight of them\nIs actually good drawings I'm a child or comments or because I have four of 'em so [laughter]\nI've had to go through this many times

sink\nAnd\nHe says at the office where he slept with the same place where he watched his hair in in the sink and he washes here in the sink because there wasn't a shower there [noise] so how long was the in the office so he was an office for two days and on the third day he got moved to a shelter he\nDrew me a picture of what it was like when he prayed for his mommy told me that he needs to pay for his mom all the time and the way he did it as he would\nTalk and self into bed and play some self under a blanket and then under the blanket\nAs I say let them or whatever\nIt was almost three

accent\nOf the people that are familiar to him his his family uh we we walk through his whole garden and he's pointing out the name of every plant every single everything and I'm pretty good with

and you know walking into the classroom just reminded me that we slipping as a first grader he he really is that little\nIs is so great that this was this story started off so hard now you're just making me smile the whole time it's so good to hear\nIt's really hard for reporters to get into immigration detention centers to do interviews but it's different if you're a lawyer and at the height of the family separation crisis lawyers were flocking to point Isabel\nOnce you're going in your sort of in a different world\nRudy powers is an immigration lawyer who specializes in asylum\nThere's cameras everywhere there's barbed wire papa trunk show your insurance show your ID I mean do you feel like you're driving into a prison basically when you go to the course of course I mean it definitely looks like a jail is Joe\nRudy went to port is about to meet with about a dozen parents whose kids have been taken from them I asked her if she could meet Sandy too\nIt was a really busy day I had to wait two hours to get a visitation room and then they brought me her\nSandy was a scored it into the room she was wearing a blue jumpsuit or because she was friendly well composed\nI think I said my name is ruby an immigration attorney I'm here to help you\nIt was one of these last meetings before heading back to Houston\nAnd I thought I'm just going to talk to her for a little bit and then I'm going to go but when she started telling me her story I it's almost like time slowed down and all I could think about was what she was saying\nWhat Sandy said is that back in Guatemala she'd been abused her life threatened local police and gang members targeted her and her family [noise]\nI've seen records from the Guatemalan national police step back some of this out\nFor her safety were not disclosing her full name or her kids' names [noise] years ago Sandy had tried coming to the U.S illegally and got deported\nBecause of that it's unlikely she'll be able to get asylum now but she is eligible for something you can call asylum light which could allow her to stay in the U. S. and work\nRuby says Sandy's case to stay here as a strong one one of the strongest she heard during her visit to port Isabel Sandy also told ... about her four sons she hadn't seen them in about a month she described a moment her baby was taken from her\nShe told me that the card so they had to take her baby away\nShe said but I'm Still breastfeeding him you know and there is it doesn't matter

able to interview Sandy in person but I did get a chance to talk to her over the phone Sandy happened to call while I was visiting uses apartment\nIn Southern California she was calling from the detention center to talk to her mom\nAnd important [noise] ... how are you my daughter\n[noise] get on\nLine Sandy says she's desperate to leave out ... did you talk to the kids money\n[noise]\nCindy tells the older that whenever she talks to her kids on the phone they tell her they want to be with her she asks if you live and able to talk with him\nHe may have to get all NBA at ... am now a lot yes\nBecause on friday they called I spoke with one of the kids and he said mummy he said mommy I Want to leave here I Want to go with you mommy\nSandy says it's not just hurting punished if the children to [noise] when Sandy says this year the looks like she's about to cry\nNow that that may have nothing will the truth me I don't have words for you and I understand you as a mother\n\nAnd he tells you that there's no one there to hug the baby no one to make him feel the one of his mother\nDo say has to see them in yes that was something else the children complained about that they don't let the kids hug the baby money not the twelve year old eight year old or five year old almost all the way how is it possible that they don't let them hug each other you\nKnow I might be an ... they are brothers they have never been apart [laughter]\n\nWould torment Sandy is that the baby finally getting old enough to recognize people but the only people he seeing are strangers\nGet they ... you have to have faith my daughter can go in because it's the saddest thing for a mother to be separated from her children payoff I don't mean us\nOkay man what ended up a at that and then I think I Hope that anything that you\n... now that I might have a good night we'll talk to more okay Gary ... okay blessings make me feel good and they're having in a minute by makes me grow\n\nYou'll have got her own story to tell you just have one that connects to Sandy's to hit us and the\nWay she says her family's been persecuted in Guatemala for generations to come in and she loves her shirt to show me a scar that runs across her stomach and he's ... well ... it looks like she was cut in half and sewing back together and what are you going for years she's avoided looking at it in the mirror every sick\nWith ah with the same news maybe ... ... put out ... to me that I did and\nShe tells me it's a reminder of when she was kidnapped raped and tortured and you'll just family it was in the military during Guatemala's bloody civil war she thinks that has a lot to do with why she in Sandy were targeted it's ill to who encouraged Sandy\nFreezer was full free to pursue the truth Ninety five double

family was in the military during Guatemala's bloody civil war she thinks that has a lot to do with why she and Sandy were targeted it's ill to who encouraged Sandy to ask for asylum do everything legally\nBut now that Sandy and the kids are locked up in a part you'll just says it feels like the whole asylum thing was a lie\nI reached out to ice and customs and border protection but they couldn't answer my question why did the government takes Sandy's kids this summer when there's no evidence that she cross the border illegally\nAnd it wasn't just Sandy many parents who were never prosecuted for this we're still separated from their kids there are dozens of examples lifted in a lawsuit against the government\nThe American civil liberties union is suing the Trump Administration over for separation of asylum seeking families\nThe lawsuit was filed back in February months before family separation was really in the news\nThe cases famous now it's called miss el versus ice in court documents\nThe administration has to try to explain why it's separated those parents parents who hadn't been accused of entering the country illegally reading through you can see the government's arguments shift burst and says it's separated the plaintiff and child because it wasn't sure they were really related\nBut they were that was proven by a DNA ... so then the government argues different reasons about why they needed to be separated those arguments worn enough to persuade the court\nThe judge ruled that this type of family separation went beyond it's lawful reach\nIn the end I Can't tell you why the government separated children from parents like Sandy all I Know for sure is it wasn't about a crackdown on illegal immigration it wasn't about the Trump Administration enforcing the law\nBecause many families didn't break it [noise] [noise]\nYes they are those California judge a Bush appointed by the way issued a nationwide injunction ordering immigration agents to take several new steps first\nIn late June the judge in that court case issued an injunction now there was a deadline a ticking clock the government would have to reunite families who've been separated whether they cross illegally are not kids would need to be back with their parents within thirty days the youngest even sooner\nTo reunite the yoga through my grandchildren with their families and our less than a week away\nSeparating families was one thing but could the government put them back together and wasn't clear there was ever a plan for that it was a massive logistical challenge we're talking about thousands of children and shelters across the country parents locked up thousands of miles away how is this going to happen\nThere are reports of max confusion surrounding this process joining us now as Alex is are the health and Human Services secretary Mr Secretary thank you for your time this morning there does seem to be a lot of confusion on this matter what can you tell us that foreign and declare some of that up\nAbout ... thank you uh first off there's absolutely no confusion on our part uh we have the kids and we're working to
