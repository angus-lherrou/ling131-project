are short on numbers and morale corruption as well as the insurgency undermined the authority of the state\nWell my guest is President Ghani has recently appointed national security advisor having to do a lot more easy formally Afghanistan's ambassador in the U.S a technocrat with little previous security experience is the Afghan government really in a position to shape the future of the country\nWell I'm dilemma he joins me now on the line from Kabul welcome to talk ... good to be here\nWe speak of course after the parliamentary elections would you a shame that the\nWay those elections works out with so many Afghans are facing the possibility of going to the polls because of insecurity and the lack of government control of key parts of your territory\nThey brutally exposed ever thing that is currently wrong with Afghanistan and its politics\nThere were multiple threats by the Taliban or al Davis precedents of attacks on polling stations the African people defied all of that and came out to vote I think that speaks for itself on what the Afghan people's verdict on democracy is and what it is that they want in their life\nThis was the first election that was completely organized by the Afghan government and security provided by the end is F\nA I think they did a tremendous need a good job compared to what we had in the past\nUm even from the number of attacks that that ... that were um launched on on the election day in two thousand fourteen when we had foreign security assistance and the elections or had a lot of support from the international community ah we're much larger scale than we had this here\nLet's look at reality I I Do not mean to belittle the bravery of those\nThree or ... million Afghans who didn't go to the polls in face of Taliban threats I Do not belittle that bravery for one second but here's the reality of your own electoral commission and say that at least a quarter of polling stations across the country\nOr mostly police Afghan police were killed in in that assault one of the policeman who survived afterwards said look we fight for our country but we do not get the benefits and respect that I gave them even to Afghan soldiers we suffered so many casualties so many policemen were killed\nBy the government paid no attention to us he said we haven't even been paid yet what does that say about your government\nAs a national security adviser that is exactly what is on Monday to change I I Do realize that we have a lot of challenges because I knew was one of the reasons I accepted into this job it hurt\nMe personally as an Afghan to know that we failed our security forces from a policy standpoint and I'm dedicated me and the and the national Security Council will be working to resolve all of those issues\nI issued a statement our people our security forces that what I Would be doing is to reflect their voices in our policies it's true we haven't been able to deliver the kind of services that our soldiers in on the front line deserve they have not failed us\nBut I Want to make sure that we also do not failed and when it comes to policies in the United nations that that protect their lives and their families\nYou know what I'm mindful off I'm half mindful of something that Hamid Karzai's former president said as he was leaving office it was something that deeply upset many people are in the way in NATO particularly family members of those who lost their lives because he said this he said\nThe NATO exercise all of its operations in Afghanistan have been ones that have caused Afghanistan a lot of suffering and loss of life unknown gains because our country is not secure\nHe said that of NATO's operations and of course the operations costs more than two thousand American lives more than four hundred and forty British lives one\nCould almost say the same thing today to Afghan veterans the families of those who lost their lives in uniform serving the Afghan government all of this loss of life either from NATO forces all from your own Afghan forces unfold waltz because this is a war you can't win\nThat's again um something that you have the luxury to say as Afghans

and protect ourselves while I'm I Do not want to comment on a on colleagues from previous government\nUm they have their own opinion what I can say to you or is this is a changed country as a result of your investment in those are fewer and fewer than one of the reason I came on this show\nIs to tell you and and your viewers that this is not the Afghanistan that you only see t._v. there is so much more to that context I understand that there's only so much news\nA space for one is on and it's usually covered by the spectacular events which are unfortunate\nBut this is that transform country whether you look at it physically or you look at it socially I'm a ... a generation Seventy five percent of this country ah grew up in the war\nOur aspirations are to end this conflict and bring peace to understand where extremely proud of our country and what we have but we also realize that the challenges that we ... we face are also hours we're thankful that we get support from our allies\nTo help us along that way and know that your investment in this country has not gone to waste\nYeah we are at war it's not an eighth it's not a war that we have brought upon ourselves it's a war that we must end\nA and it takes a it it it takes more now than just a statements to be able to uh to end it there are we are taking measures every day and thanks for ... support who are being helping and equipment and training our security right is\nTo provide the kind of security that the Afghan people deserve\nWe we don't have so much time has to move so let me ask you some quick questions or a pivot thing to what you just alluded to that is the support them allies in particular the United states and of course you a former ambassador to the United states on behalf of Afghanistan or let me ask you this\nDonald Trump has said of course that he will keep troops in Afghanistan advise and training fourteen thousand all them but\nHe clearly wants to end this conflict in America's commitment to it as quickly as possible one thing moved to America is privatizing\nThe U.S military commitment in Afghanistan I spoke reason they were friends for many of the head of Blackwater who wants to get a piece of that action how would you feel if the Americans offered you instead of the U.S military privatized contract to force\nWe have a a decision by the national Security Council and we should a statement this is we will not allow a business is to ah to make to to turn our war into profit\nA it's an honorable cause we're proud of our partnership with our allies we're fighting terrorism a and counter insurgency in this country and and that's not for profit\nA second and more important point about the diplomacy right now it turns out that in October I Believe October the twelve Donald Trump's Afghan envoys ...\nHe had talks with senior Taliban officials yes or no did you know who the those talks were taking place at the time were you told beforehand\nKnew he had talks there Steven ... this I Want to clarify there is a lot of confusion about this people confused talks with negotiations the Afghan government has the initiative\nScreaming on WGN which included by emailing university integrated innovation to the town I'm a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I ...\nProcess to bring regional countries on board on what we're doing on peace and security we are also had the initiative on the ceasefire wet well I'll\nTell you how could we have now is yeah I I don't think it was made a straight on said who are very important question 'cause it's about who really is driving efforts to engage the Taliban right now the New York times reports that sources saying quote\nFills that I have these meetings with\nUh the officials from the Taliban just uh he flew to the Gulf states have ... he quietly met them on Ashraf Ghani your president your boss and his government heard of that meeting only afterwards through news reports is that true or not\nAre you asking me a question that you just one can formation for or or what is going on it's a lot more detailed than what you see in a news report\nAdjust because few words were not said in a meeting doesn't mean that was intention behind a hiding that it was a quick meeting a and a ... of the you know he has to be very exhausted from his trip\nYou didn't have to be clear then I think you've cleared it up first you didn't know who the ... the special envoy was talking to the Taliban and it just strikes me that the signals we're getting right now is that the Americans have decided\nThat far from this position in the past where the Afghan government always says we must own any political process with the Taliban now the Americans seemed to be saying no we're going to engage with the Taliban ourselves\nNo you you cannot have one incident\nUh dictate an entire policy or that's not what the Americans are saying and that's not what the American stands as we are are in ... I mean in constant contact with our American partners\nThat's not their policy and let me let let me tell you one other thing it's not that Afghans must own and drive the peace process of guns do\nOwn and drive the peace process and that's the only way\nFor its success it's not that we we won the ownership just for the sake of ownership we think that without it there will be no peace in Afghanistan and it would be a shame that all your investment in our and mess investment in sacrifices go to waste\nI'm asked by a ... through a process why on that process and it's very clear\nOur final thought we've discussed and you've been quite Frank about the degree to which the Taliban has a ... a real presence on the ground in many parts of Afghanistan but what would it take\nMuch to national security advisor for you to formally recognize the Taliban's right to a stake in the governance of your country what would it take\nWell the Taliban contend elections\nThere more than welcome to participate and see that the Afghan people want that process despite their threats\nThey participated in elections if the Taliban really feel that they have a place in Afghan society other than driving fear into them then they must come and content and see he wet weather the Afghan people really vote for them or not\nThey they can only be a force of military force that um that dry fear can they provide governance and and the Afghan people accept can only be known if they participate in a in in a democratic process and let the\nScreaming on WGN appointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nDistribution of the b._b._c.

see the link or he might have been intrigued by the fact that sex robots Brussels\nHave popped up in some cities on this subject it's fair to say that science fiction films haven't inspired optimism from the Nineteen seventies this step for wives where ambitious women are transformed into do style husband pleasing automate\nAnd more recently the British movie ... which a female robots stabbed the city is create to the city is having used that word for a while to death so\nRobots are going profoundly to change our lives and all sorts of ways but how will they affect on sexual behavior\nChildren

you make of the concept ... very briefly of the sex robots before we go on\nWell I find that really striking that human beings can do all kinds of things with technology and this is why we put a essence\nRice sex robots kind of feel Kate and you know divorcing the sexual act entirely from feeling comes with risks or does it\nI I don't think it necessarily does we know that sex toys for example have been around for hundreds if not thousands of years the difference here is that the current form of ... is a humanoid form that's that's the problem because it tends to be a very productive stereotype of female body\n[noise] and and that's the problem why are we talking just about the female body on the sex robots for women on the sex robots for gay women\nKnow that we're not yet there are not yet at doesn't add a male version of a sex or will it tends to be I'm straight men that are buying the robots that doesn't\n... because on most sex toys build those which suggests that they could there possibly don't would be a you know deal do based sex robot\nSo that is All right so essentially the something else here and I think there's two streams what this two lines of development one is the sex toy like you say there's this things like Elizabeth I breeders around for years on the other is the sex all the sec still has always been a fan in the market for manned\nOkay entitlement by some men in in sexual to you know this is an area that brings huge alarm bells\nUm the compliance ever willing female figure is in policy isn't it in the form of the

course which always the hinges on a dystopian plot where the the woman gets a bag of potato and the female robots or takes over it as a threat to men so I think there's a\nCertain power levels is with real life than not fear a but yes it is it's just this past the female form that we have and I I strongly asked me if your wife not because we have technology that could do wonderful things in terms of\nHelping relationships so in terms of bringing pleasure and it doesn't have to be in this form\nIt's open field for questions Matthew\nI'm kinda nervous the venture into this month filled up to

of those it affects how we how we ... it's we've kind of a fundamental driver to humans because the the whole point is whether we like or not we want to replicate our our genes Chitra [noise]\nYes I mean we've touched on this slightly ... I Want to explore more I'll be not worried about what six robots would mean for human sexuality particularly given that that as we mentioned already designed by men Forman says Gen did straight men\nWhat are the implications for women especially when it comes to attitudes of an agency consent and lights and and also a link to that is not perfect an allergy but when you look at pornography\nThat particular racial stereotypes um that uh uh put fluids in pornography as well and I'm just wondering about I guess the the race and gender implications of a move towards um sex robots I left the Yale ideas ...\nYeah that's right I think it's very problematic at the moment it's very much a a male straight while I'm ...\nI'm at last word has her normative so the idea that people um are in relationships are straight on on the ... and I'm featured gender in this case um it's it's a month and a woman and it's it's um sex that will be the sort of China [noise]\nUm I think that that sounded problem I think um we know that the ... the ... that we have today all tend to be in this um\nSalmon I type of sexual form and they all tend to be why does while on whether they aren't where there there are it's all the different skin color they are as you say they're kind of exhaust sized um this is problematic and and I think that we do have to really address stop and look at new ways of doing these things I'm\nJust a check or are we at the technological stage of development where robots can really accurate to imitate a ... not ... the other problem we're very very bad at making human like robots word so amazed how sexy can they possibly be wow ... ... it's a quiet it'd be nice and I think it will stay incredibly nice for quite some time\nBut we can can you know integrate virtual reality now these they I mean showing the technology is changing so quickly this also official intelligence as hyper realistic ... I mean\nThe ... or at least a robot can talk to you convincing not somebody so they these are not in the mood give you a bit [laughter] for\nThese robots have add personalities that are being developed that you can carry around a standalone app on your phone tablets you have a virtual girlfriend in your phone they're working on a a meal version as well partly um so I think that's that's probably a more realistic convincing human than any robot\nWas being reception for your book case so sorry to interrupt quick point realize you're going to\nSay just hearing you Kate makes me wonder why people need but she'll go frames\nAnd whether it is is this does it say something about\nYour boyfriends and girlfriends don't let me let's be honest it's not boyfriends it's such a good friends that were talking about and just to say something about masculinity I'm In an era that you would rather have a vet she'll golf and who doesn't it's not a real human being with her own ideas and ...\nI don't know how ... yeah I think that's\nProbably lost and I think ... sort of the ... the idea that women are the emotional gatekeepers those so we of course you know we are able to go out there and and bomb socially but perhaps may have\nMore problems without the devil and author of turned on south science sex on robots many types of coming on the program big thanks to our guests to turn I cannot garage on in Lagos Matthew Green\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\n[noise]\nDistribution of the b._b._c.
