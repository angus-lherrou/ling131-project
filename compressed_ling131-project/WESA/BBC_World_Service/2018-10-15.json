Hussein is having the ability to get angry and still be taken seriously and who's not given that a\nA same luxury that that's the politics of patriarchy playing out in society today\nAnd I get the same so but you don't just from this conversation from your writing student\nYou are angry euro angry about the way America works and and your view of of water is a patriarchal society who go to ... groups including women and minorities is something that makes you angry but to change it\nYou have to you have to reach out beyond your own group whether it be women or whether it be African American you know to build a winning coalition\nYou're going to go national and you've got to obviously you include men and you've got to include a a range of of ethnicities so how do you go about building those coalition that cooperation\nWell so I guess I have to roll back for a moment and just things just that as you mentioned you're familiar with my writing in my writing the whole point\nOf intersection analogy is to talk about the kind of ... coalitions that are necessary in order to realize are\nA state of values and objective um there are many applications of intersection alley across any number of differences and cross any number\nOf forms and discrimination one of the points that I made and the New York times article that I wrote two weeks ago was to say that the failure of a coalition between anti racist and feminist was one of the factors that led to the elevation of Clarence Thomas\nAh over in as against the ah claims that were made by Anita Hill I'm the what I argue there was that there was a common history of anti racism and feminist and found and the fact that the very term\nSexual harassment at the very knowledge that the sexual harassment is in fact discrimination\nWas largely step forward by African American women plaintiffs who are experiencing discrimination when they when they were working there is a long history of African American women bringing gender into anti racism and bringing anti racism into ...\nBut but some African American activists women feminists and civil rights campaigners\nHave looked at the history of looked as you say the failure of the times of of white feminist to make common cause with the black sisters\nI'm frankly some of them have enough I'm quoting one who ... who says I find myself at the end of my into

think the point is you know ... and ...\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sounds of a free press\n... into sexual feminist rude it's time to halt back into survival mode due to the dumpster fire live by a\nBlack feminist agenda and\nI Am I mean I could just laying people who actually\nUh say the opposite I think the point is you know and I find this very interesting um folks who are concerned about too much group lists\nUm respond to moments like these by showing that there are a few individuals who are at things differently of course we don't all think alike\nAnd so having a quote from someone who hum is exasperated by um the lack of allies ship of of white women is not surprising I'm often frustrated by it\nIn fact I'm only forty eight percent white women actually believe doctors lazy Ford there's a far greater racial gap\nIn American society now than a gender gap that doesn't mean a gender isn't significant that doesn't mean the patriarchy isn't working through it doesn't mean that we don't need an intersection of politics to fight and both of them at the same time and I know this guy is a problem\nI I get I get the industry right now the argument that you could bring different groups with press people together to make common called them I can make a very big difference I get that I guess what I'm\nI'm moving to orders are asking you how you reach out if you can reach out at all to those particular groups are particularly maybe white working class people men and women interestingly because let's not forget a majority will be on a majority of white women voted for Donald Trump\nIs there any way do you see that you can use your arguments and your powers of persuasion to make inroads amongst those groups if we pull into groups\nOr many of us are I think one of the challenges is to recognize when we're hearing the talking points from the other side\nOf the idea that there haven't been efforts to reach out across groups the idea that the civil rights legacy wasn't always a a movement that was a\nMultiracial and in fat and bipartisan so um our our challenge today is not only maintaining and building those ties but resisting the narratives that suggest\nThat that we're all just separate groups and we're not really engaging in efforts to to reach across many of the difference is\nI think in fact uh the last a week opens up even more possibilities are every thing that women things ingest that many women\nAre particularly those of that fifty three percent that and that in fact voted for Trump or may be rethinking that but\nLet's let's not you know see pie in the sky here race has always been a determining factor in American politics so it's not surprising that this is a challenge for us\nDo you feel now there's a little bit of time distance between his presidency and the and the President's Day how do you feel about Iraq Obama because he's with the midterms coming up is going to the political fray making so much more pointed political speeches in recent weeks saying things like this quote\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose

quote\nYou know this whole notion of the sprung up recently about Democrats needing to choose between trying to appeal to the white working class or voters of color and women and oh gee beat the Americans not as all known since I said I go vote from every demographic\nDo you see Obama or some body that you know Democrats need to\nListen to and be mindful of because he had the right approach or do you think in retrospect Brock Obama actually walking rather cool enough he he didn't do enough to actually change the structures of American politics\nWhat they can stop for a president to actually change the structures of American politics um I have my disagreements a with a ... on on a range of issues some of them having to do with uh the failure to actually even have a rhetoric um\nIdentifies some of the structures that continue to create any qualities\nUm I had took issue with him for example on my brother's keeper it was a program that was a racial justice program but in excluded women and girls but that was a minor I'm sort of a difference of within a broader reality\nWe are a country that shapes ourselves around certain values and I think he\nTried to perform that and it is true that he was able to win the support the votes of uh the white working class he was able to win those districts in Pennsylvania\nI'm In Michigan that were really important so it is true it is it possible to win votes and to create coalitions across race and class and he's in good reminder of the fact that this is an inevitable dimension of American politics\nAnd just the final thought on that as we go into elections that we're in an election season and the Democrats are trying to create a winning progressive\nCoalition it is interesting isn't it when Ron Brown steam reflected on this with some figures from the Pew foundation recently said\nOr the ... democratic votes as you said a clearly divided he said Democrats must weigh the culture of liberal instincts are mostly secular wing of upscale white\nWith the often more traditional inclinations of African American and Latino supporters that again in this world of of of sort of into sexuality and an ... group based politics it is a very complex a complex set of relationships and the attitudes and values isn't it\nAnd I don't I make the complexity even greater I'm the most mobilize piece of the Democratic coalition is African American women they're the ones that gave the vote that the victory to Roy Moore a\nA U.S senator who was the first Democrat to the elected from Alabama and a generation on their black women all over the ballot so the real question and challenges how can we not only use black women\nAs the wheels on the bus but how do we actually put them in the driver's seat what are the agendas\nThat actually speak to them if we can figure that out will probably be able to figure out how to sneak across the working class because black women are disproportionately working class will probably be able to build those ties that at one point made the Democratic coalition a winning political global mobilize\nDreaming on W.\nE.

Web created back in the seventies he believes the molten Internet's very structure has outgrown original design\nWe are taking an Internet that was set up for an earlier today and when there was many fewer malicious operators and actors than there are now and there was many many many orders of magnitude less data and in particular data about you\nI mean we're getting to a social crisis over the uh very Internet that is generated so much economic growth and the last several decades\nBut still people die necessarily\nPanic about sold at someone else's harvesting that data and particularly if they're getting a free service and Rita and if it's a social platform or something else\nOr they may not be concerned if they haven't had their identities stolen but if they have they are in one of the worst situations in their entire lives and getting out of it can take many years it's the worst possible thing that can happen and it can happen to absolutely anyone\nSo what is the ... it was this architectural weakness well\nYou're seeing people like Tim burners ... served timber initially who invented the Web particles back in Nineteen Ninety who's spent many years now developing a much more decentralized Web\nIt's fundamentally to put to control over the data about view that you generate in your hands period\nYou have got to own your data and if others want to get that data from you you may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person ones that are corporation wants that our government wants but\nWe're a long way from that but I think that\nScreaming on WGN

from you you may sit down and negotiate with them whatever price for whatever person ones that are corporation wants her government wants to do\nIs we're a long way from that but I think the fact that someone as influential\nAs timber nervously has publicly not only developed these capabilities but it's set up a new start up to actually try to grow it scale it or to economically important a scale that's a sign and I think we have to have this\nSort of the most simple level it is forcing Internet users regular citizens like your eye to opt in to the data harvesting model that Facebook Google and everyone else is using rather than opting out is is is now kind of ... being posted that's absolutely\nCorrect and we don't want it to be a so time consuming that you're sitting around doing legal intellectual property negotiations all the time [noise] but I think\nIt's starting in medical data you know there's a huge societal gain as our bodies become digitally read out to the sharing of that data because you can only understand you relative to other humans\nBut right now you're in danger if you share your data from insurance companies from your employer from all kinds of things\nSo it's a social good to protect the individual so that they will make a socially generous donation of their data because they're not afraid that there will be things that happened to them that are bad in their future so\nI think the European Union in some ways is further along than the United states but I I think the scale of the uh catastrophes that are happening on the net including the various tax on the foundation of our democracy have open people up\nInternet pioneer and would be reform Larry small no of course you know human isn't just about identity theft and data harvesting there is another problem some reckon demonstrated by the emergence of so called information warfare fake news\nThat Anderson is the founder of scout hey I it's a media company focused on the future of technology and she's been studying the way the both of them ... nipped electing the way we talk and debate on social networks\nI've done a lot of analysis especially at Twitter date in the last year and what we found is that generally if you're looking at a conversation on Twitter about a large cultural phenomenon so\nFor example the Colin Kaepernick Nike controversy or a lot of the conversations around Robert Mueller that go on online I very very large percentage of those conversations are often driven by pots you know I did a quick search this morning and found you know one tweet by Trump that was promoted\nBy sixty percent Bob but generally the percent\nOf the people retreating what Donald Trump said we'll machines\nYes yeah it's important to keep that in mind when you're encountering what seemed to be really angry or to visit comments on line is that\nThere is a very good chance that those comments could be written or constructed with that deliver intent to anger you or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left and the idea is to divide those two groups of people further and harden and calcified they believe so that it in order to change their

or to garner your support right and it happens on both the right and the left and the idea is to divide those two groups of people further and harden and calcified their beliefs are that it in order

physical community we'd be signing a in a crowd of people\nSeventy percent which would be machines\nYou know it would be like walking around in your daily life and Seventy percent of people that you meet are real people right they looked like real people they talk like real people but they're actually just actors who are trying to change your perspective or beliefs about the world kind of like living in the Truman Show\nIs told in the living dead might be another movie but I I just people presumably don't understand that they still don't understand that I mean you are under another political commentator without having that conversation and telling people these things but regular folks don't get that presumably cause us to talking to each other at least they think\nWell yeah I mean I when you observe these kinds of conversations on line you see that they work right people responded to these people or box or algorithms whatever they might be and the retreat them they'll use their messaging they'll promote their messaging they'll get angry at them\nThe way that you create news stories in today's media ecosystem is by creating a trending topic\nAnd so the ... century act as like the kindling or the spark that lights the fire and then normal people get involved and it takes up steam and picked up steam and at that point media companies are looking at what's trending on Twitter Google News is based on off and on what's trending on Twitter or Facebook\nAnd those stories then become mainstream news right so that then becomes an accepted story and it's all essentially been architect id by a group of fake accounts on social media\nFor you say the mainstream news meter of complicit in in that eventually as everyone else\nI Would love to see a major media company out them take a stand about reporting on Twitter controversies I think that'd be a very powerful statement to make as a media company\nBut it has and you have not yet buried under the new suggests the variety of ... to fixing these problems one she reckons could be using encrypted technology like block trying to help verify people's identities on the Internet I\nThink one of the reasons that people are so excited about the idea of the block change generally are very you know it creates this arc de centralized architecture where you can actually verify someone's identity\nUm with Rosie ... pretty reliably yeah I mean nothing is perfect I'm sure that there are ways to hack into and and get around that but the whole idea of the ... is that every person has a node right and I know the epicenter identity but all of those notes are connected and every other note also has a copy of who that first note is\nSo decentralized yeah there will be in a decentralized attack there's no two other on it if he centralized\nBut it's also you can't delete essentially a ledger right so there's a record of every transaction or interaction between different notes and therefore you can see oh this is the same at butler that has been talking over here to someone else and you can tell it's the same guy because he also did this interview over here and they hear this conversation or exchange that they have\nSo that is the future that is a potential future for one way in which we can at least improve the architecture the social social platforms absolutely yeah are you optimistic so this is going to

look like to reinvent an Internet actually built to do what it does today there are a lot of people out there that are very passionate about doing that so yes I'm absolutely optimistic about it",
