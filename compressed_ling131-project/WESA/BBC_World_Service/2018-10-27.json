she first got the idea for the film nine to five which also start Lily Tomlin and Dolly Parton\nOf my friends was an organizer of women\nFree ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet very Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nYou saying that they had to put up with and finally one day I said I Want to make a movie about this and then was my idea to cast Lillian Dolly how much convincing did they take to take a year to convince ... to be in a movie which is pretty amazing given that nobody ever Abdel in a movie before\nLooking back on the film do you think it stood the test of time\nAbsolutely the issue with me too movement which began just about a year ago is very much front and center and of course nine to five very much dealt with the issues of\nSexual abuse but not just that also the fact that uh the character of led by Lily Tomlin would train young men and they would be promoted past her\nAnd the salary differential boots dealt with so plenty of material and when it comes to making a seat for which you looking into yeah well it's different now in a way it's worse the sexual harassment still exist\nThe men being promoted past women still exists but now many of the workers will be\nSubcontracted which means that where do they go when their wages stolen by their boss where do they go if they're fired because they're pregnant so we need a new movie whether the script will turn out I don't know I hate to get my hopes up too much\nAnd when in the wake of ... winds dean the allegations that came out about him did not present personal dynamics for you about what to speak house on those\nNo I've never had too many difficulties speaking out\nWhat was important for me me too was the survivor's coming forward and telling their stories and being believed the time's up movement is now what are we going to do about it\nLike having more women on boards of directors having women and more positions of power\nBut right at the beginning of

allegations about ... cat but haven't spoken to them\nWell no you can't it's the survivor that has to speak because this was before it became public that Rosanna told me her experience and the experience of other women as well and but she was too scared\nTo come forward but she knew that it had affected her career that she had rebuffed him but I I couldn't override her and speak do you think\nThat the whole controversy around Brett Kavanaugh and his appointment as the Supreme Court justice do you think that that can be seen in the context of the me too movement in the sense that Christine Blasey Ford herself was willing to come forward and speak about it\nWell Anita Hill came forward and spoke about it before there was a me too movement in fact African American women have been coming forward and speaking about this long before white famous white women in Hollywood have been doing so\nBut I think the behavior of the old white men on the Judiciary Committee and how they

actually what we're talking about as liberal democracy so the democracy park refers to people voting\nBut the liberal park refers to the rule of law to a framework of constitutional checks and

identity politics is this feeling that we all have\nThat we have this inner source of dignity that's not being adequately recognized and that's why we go into politics because we want political

done they are talking about the fact that by the middle of the century we need to be removing about twenty billion tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year\nAnd that's some of these techniques would get us about halfway there if they worked really well and everybody did as they were told and everybody did have some joined up thinking\nThey are optimistic about some of the newer

actually saying well we don't know about them right now but we think about ten years time they can get down to about a hundred dollars a ton if they do that\nThat's a very successful and we could beat this problem the big problem with that is this what they philosophically called the moral hazard\nIf you have machines that can remove comments and that was why bother reducing your use of fossil

industrial challenge of you know poultry on big pieces of technology to coal fired stations\nThey're all they're in theory but very few in practice is literally a handful around the world and the big problem with that because all these big bits of case cost lots of money and nobody really wants to put their hands in the park has to pay for all these things\nSo what's interesting about this report that's come out and saying that actually you know there's lots of other things we can do new carbon as it's called for one thing which is effectively mangrove swamps and marshes Neal to see if you can protect those there may things source of our sing for common they soak up more common than anything else\nAnd you can do it for about twenty dollars a ton per common and that is really really cheap

and all the rest of the world you're letting your extremists dominate the debate you got a group of them and ... them sending all these five messages\nAs soon as a referendum results were announced I under our society argued very strongly that use citizens here who are already here should be given a unilateral right to remain from the start Vancouver\nI'm a Christian and and his colleagues at the royal society the highest voice of science in the u._k. foresaw problems it\nTook two years but finally the government has said that regardless of what happens with the negotiations view citizens will be allowed to remain here\nBut the question of why you citizens felt particularly bad is because their situation was different from mine I came here on a work permit I had to apply for permission and then I came and then I had to apply for indefinitely to remain and apply for citizenship eventually\nBut when you citizen came here it was under the understanding that this was simply another part of the European home and suddenly they were told that one part of their home wasn't really that home at all and they were really outsiders and that psychological transition\nMust have been very hard but what we in the science community want to do is to make sure that conditions are such that they continue to be welcome here regardless of any change in their legal status\nOne of the things I suppose most told the BBC earlier this week was the visa system we have is not fit for purpose I mean do you agree and all that sort of later you can point to\nAbsolutely I mean it is atrocious for example I hate to be addict do but I had a postdoc\nWhom I was paying on a grant and on her own initiative she got a fellowship from the national institutes of health\nAnd the U.S because she's a U.S citizen and in doing so she said my lab a huge amount of money but because her funding source was different she had to change and apply for a new visa and because the procedure was so onerous she\nFell into a gap where her old visa was no longer valid and her new visa had not come through and she wasn't allowed to even enter the building she had to sit at home for several weeks twiddling their thumbs and Cambridge is completely outrageous the system has become more and more onerous\nFor non you citizens and if we're going to apply that to everyone in the future of both you and non you we absolutely need a much better more streamlined and efficient system\nThat advice about easy movement was reinforced by responses season Guthrie around Europe heard in that survey of international science
