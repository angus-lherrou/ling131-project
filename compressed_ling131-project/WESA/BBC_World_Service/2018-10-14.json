Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAnd they could be the second part in the various for the first time\nRunner I can really you want to jump in Egypt I was just that I'm speaking to burn friend in Germany a couple of days ago and she was looking actually about the rise the greens but she said this is not the green policy of you know you're the Fisher the old foreign minister from ten years ago there were other sort of ... this is the role of the more radical fundamentalism type of green movement\nAnd why didn't I don't know that there certainly I I Would have actually it's often just with a different place the Green Party they have two very charismatic leader or they've gone and they worked very hard\nAnd um they're they're at their pro you know where they're\nAt anti racist I mean and they're part of a large movement in Germany I mean it was a huge demonstration in Berlin yesterday\nTo uh you know for tolerance they expect forty thousand people turn up in two hundred and forty thousand people turned up so they're they're pro tolerance or pro environment\nYou know ... you know clean energy and and and they are they want a fair deal for a you know migrants and refugees to come to this country\nSo I think a lot of people at are more interested in that kind of humane politics I've also heard people say you know I mean they see a few times for the Christian social union and the people are saying the Christian and the social union they missed the humane policy and politics that you'd be in that those parties\nIt's interesting isn't it there's a migration is now a big policy for the Green Party\n[noise] and it's because that migration has since two thousand Fifteen in particular it has really divided that the ah the country\nIs divided the way people think there are a lot of people who don't want people coming and in order to people who are doing very well particularly pensioners is also another issue in the election they don't I mean they're feeling the pinch\nAnd they don't know why people are coming in and taking their money toasty [noise] they're also worried about a loss of\nAnd their their sense of German is over there in us you know their culture and they're afraid at part of the things that the ... they say they're against an immigration particularly from Islamic countries um that this is a theme with a lot of people who are worried about the uh\nThe flavor and that caller on the sense of their own culture\nChristian mountain a journalist in Munich thank you very much a rope toe\nJust looking back to that report from James no country from Texas I noticed you raise your eyebrows just sticking with this topic of immigration but the the last speaker was George ... founder of the Hispanic Republicans of Texas coast you grew up in the United states as a migrant well she'll take on that\nI did I thought it was particularly ridiculous I mean quite often migrants or people who have migrant I'm a lineages tend to be some of the most conservative um people across the globe so when he was talking about the fact that we needed border controls in detention to ensure that those people from across\nIn Mexico don't come over just made me think\nYou know the complicity of all of us in these discussions um and the fact of the matter is you know border controls high borders detentions actually create more clan to sign forms of migration where people feel like they have to go to smugglers\nWho you're simply what you're doing is you're giving smugglers and people who engage in ... forms of migration I'm

I think what's\nInteresting is that the divide and conquer the divide and rule sort of a you know notions across the globe of have done a ... I had made a fundamental impact on how people see this as an us and them kind of perspective so migrants who assimilate into places like the United states\nUm tend to be very wary of those who are coming across the border um because the senses you know there's a finite set of resources that we need to really protect\n'em and people who looked like me I'm may some sometimes subtle that particular perspective or my place in the United states so there's a sort of threat that people feel not only domestic citizens but those who can't have migraine ... which for me it's very warm psychologically but that's that's the way the world's\nMost of your professor of history and politics of modern China just how big an issue\nIs immigration and China will the really big issue there is no immigration the sense of people from outside China coming in but in terms of migration something like a hundred and fifty to two hundred million people I mean you know the size of more than most European countries\nEssentially moved from their home villages throughout China to build you know buildings were on high speed railways and essentially provide the labor back to China but those people were not properly documented they can't claim for Will Ferrell pensioner education rights\nFor their children and that's where the single biggest problem facing trying today the question of poor people wanted to move to where the money is\nThe city's weekend from the BBC well service with the electorate some German his foot bowling side has continued they've lost free now to the ... six that fate in ten games Alistair Ross joins me from ...\nHow much pressure is that for a change of manager how you ask a question of first defeats the Muslim since Nineteen Ninety two first time ever that Germany I've gone three games without scoring that bought some of the three team European nations league with to match is to go I'm facing a trip to world champions from snakes so\nGiven this all comes off they finished bought some of that group of the world cup of coffee angry and very public international retirement of ... despite the fact that he's won the world cup on a confederation scalp and his twelve years in charge manager at your your love knows the pressure to perform is growing\nVoluntarily just with all their own to harden disappointing much to lose three ... in the first few minutes we have control and created a few chunks says\nOur biggest problem is we're not taking them the situations but was wet and training didn't work in the matches disappointing the way we played in the last ten minutes when we can see two goals or this level that I shouldn't have\nChosen amount of hours in the first thing\nI was the big match in Europe on Saturday and the Africa Cup of nations qualified\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friend\nI'll biggest problem is that we're not taking them the situations but was wet and training didn't work in the matches disappointing the way we played in the last ten minutes when we can see two goals at this level than I shouldn't have\nUs so I was an amount of hours in\nThe first thing I was the big match in Europe on Saturday and the Africa Cup of nations qualified symbolic poised to win in the Congo I might have gas cars one they'll win or why at equitable real guinea provided the shocks well much area and South Africa both both posted it very big wins\nThey put themselves in prime position now to be the two sides to qualify from groups\nPay and in tennis should we be surprised that Roger Federer his failed to make the final of the Shanghai than\nI think a lot of people will be surprised to Roger Federer ever loses the match but it will just fast events since the U.S I've been a month ago so in that sense perhaps not but being in the semi final against the Twenty one year old\nWho never reached the final Adam office event before federal was all basically going to be the favorite in the end on a charge posted a surprise six ... six for when he spoke to his final place against ... but federal though still happy with how he's performed in Shanghai\nI'm happy ... to ... this week I feel like I'm explosive out there I'm returning well and they're serving you know I think it's it's okay could be even a little bit better um I don't think that played a match where I didn't get broken so that's something [laughter]\nBut it's more unusual for me but um this week I felt like I was hitting the ball well and I think that's something that I can definitely take along with me\nOn that final charge against jock itch gets underway in around two hours type\nAlistair Ross thank you very much you're listening to weekend from the b._b._c. World Service most from my guests Ron I mentioned professor of history and politics of multi ... China and robbed tell need Shiite Haley\nPanama there's a lot of money sloshing around up there\nYou were talking here about corruption of the other end of the scale is isn't just bribing a local official you're talking about really big sums of money and really big organizations\nYeah that um I Know well them or the author and I can talk about for the local level which is extremely important\nAt the global level we're also trying to look at how do you make sure there are banks for for a lawyer just don't get caught up in these huge amounts of money billions of dollars that go into ...\nD you taste laundering or into a binding contract so he's one of the biggest of their schemes was in Latin America will billions of dollars were spent ... real told you you wanted to come in\nHere yeah I mean I'm Glad that you brought those up because those examples up because I mean although Transparency International has a corruption perception index with with which looks mostly at corruption perceptions\nI'm a United Nations economic commission for Africa is actually looking at illicit financial flows particularly from the continent of Africa you've got billions and billions and billions of dollars that leave the confidence through\nYou know evading taxes through transfer pricing I'm mostly from Poland for multinationals and you have you know the the wiki leaks are all these leaks that are coming out that are um exposing these sort of higher level multinational flows of of corrupt practices\nUm and what's interesting is that your neck of the economic commission for Africa actually has a financial secrecy index which is more evidence base has more robust and I think perhaps transparency should be tens fancy international should be thinking about looking at those evidence based forms of measuring corruption\nRona you mentioned corruption\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nFlows of of corrupt practices um and what's interesting is that your neck of the economic commission for Africa actually has a financial secrecy index which is more evidence base if more robust and I think perhaps transparency should be tens fancy international should be thinking about looking at those evidence based forms of measuring corruption Rona\nYou mentioned corruption in Africa and the second biggest economy in the world and yet we don't know very clearly what the rules of the game of that was what you mean China that rocket sorry I did meet John it you know I think\nOne of the reasons this is so much in the news is in the last few days there's been one of a series of high profile arrest for this time ... away who was the head of into pole may seek to being picked up at the airport in Beijing now charged with bribery and innocence what China's been doing particularly in the last year will say with the setting up with something called the national supervision commission\nIs what you might call auntie transparency there's this huge crackdown but it's very much the product\nOf an ... state very little openness about what's going on you can be held on the up to six months I think without access to a lawyer and just basically putting the frightened there's a large numbers of people not just officials but movie stars even the Chinese movie star who was\nA hidden away for three months until she came out in the great ... tax\nI'm Wondering what the effectiveness actually ease of this kind of very state driven very author Terry and kind of anti corruption move and whether or not it's terrifying but effective or actually if it's just simply the wrong way to go\nSee well from my side I think in part an atmosphere [noise] Casey this isn't about either Prieta can you hear me just try again yeah [noise] uh\nOur embassy international called her or the national supervision finishing the systematic threat to human rights in\nChina which we agree with that ...\nPeople without trial without access to a lawyer for six months or having an organization that you can appeal to the Supreme Court\nIs probably not the way to go from ... I'm Sorry I think the light as little cut off here yeah it it it's not the best I I I was a question for all of you um and in fact rubbed\nTill we have so much about these bits of legislation to foreign corrupt practices act of United States the European Union has similar legislation this was supposed to stop corruption to make it pretty well impossible for any international company to pay bribes in a developing country or anywhere in the world do the work\nI mean I think there's there's a lot more robust kind of enforcement that we need to talk about um I think they are small cabal of very small group of elite people who benefit from these sort of transfer pricing or less a financial flows and they're incredibly powerful and they've got a lot of clout\nUm but I think there is a way to fight a in it across the globe and particularly in the developing world is to put some people in jail I think there needs to be consequences and punishment\nI think those will serve as the parent beyond just moving around the changing of practice of corruption and changing the value systems we also need to create systems of accountability and systems of punishment across the globe\nSo that people really face the full weight of the long\nRun up and I think it's very important that liberal governments exercise that kind of transparency in the anti corruption because if you don't have that kind of effect of anti corruption it opens up the uh the waterfront for countries like China to say well actually our anti liberal and in many ways very known transparent ways of cracking down on corruption\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five ...

E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on the master's program\nAt CMU dot edu flash I I I\n... which are two kinds of beliefs come from do you think that we have them for some kind of evolutionary like reason\nI think that they are building on psychological process to ease and those are functional and they exist for a reason I don't necessarily believe that the superstitious beliefs are here for a reason\nSo for example we're always searching to understand\nWhat's going on in our world and trying to predict what's going to happen\nWe are creatures who are thinking in causal ways and our search means that sometimes we see things as causal when they're not so even when things are random even when things are correlated we see them as actually being caused really related\nThat ends up leading to superstitious beliefs that is especially powerful in moments when you're experiencing uncertainty and tension and stress\nAnd so in those moments you're going to be desperate for anything that you can do to potentially control a scary environment right yeah that makes sense or another example is the way that she respects or sort of the rules of thumb that our mind will rely on so\nIt's a a rule of thumb that we use that when something comes to mind easily\nWe use that to determine how likely are common it is so lots of times things that are recent or emotional or vivid come to mind very easily and so we think of those things as being more common and more likely than they are\nWe went to a museum for this program ... there was a bit of everything about voodoo and um but producing military cruelly brought along some pictures of my son loved ones and I was off default would like cutting them up or just she couldn't bring myself to do it I was just so chasing it with the outcome of anything but happening to them\nWhat you're describing now is building on a different ... which is known as either representative Nasser sometimes called similarity which is just it's because of The Likeness if you're just drew a smiley face and said could you cut this that doesn't seem so problematic it's that it's the actual representation\nOf your loved one it's so easy to imagine a causal connection between\nTwo things that look so much alike\nAnd that is part of where the voodoo believe comes from it's again building on basic building blocks of the way our minds work\nI'm sort of asking the question why do ordinary people have these beliefs even in pretty ordinary circumstances right they seem to show up and lots of places lots of the time\nAnd so that's why I've been very interested in seeing how\nA very basic kind of dual process model can be used to understand superstition too which is the idea that there are two sort of sets of mental systems are in our mind one that operates\nVery quickly and automatically and doesn't require any cognitive resources or sort of working memory load and and another that is slow and deliberate and does require are sort of attention and deliberate working memory\nAnd the fast process can kind of give rise to an intuition and the slower process can then come in and determine whether or not it makes sense and correct the air\nAnd what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking\nFree ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nThat working memory and the fast process can kind of give rise to an intuition and the slower process can then come in and determine whether or not it makes sense and correct the air\nAnd what I suggest in my work is that when it comes to superstitions and magical thinking that that's not always the case sometimes that slow system recognizes the Arab recognizes that the intuition is wrong and then maintained that anyway\nTo illustrate how these two men two systems ... we're going to do a thought experiment I Want you to imagine this I have three of ... on the table and one of them you know which has the money inside that you can win I Want you to pick one of the envelopes one two or three\nChosen okay good now you can keep going for ... oh you can swap it for the remaining two envelopes what do you go full\nYou should go for the two [laughter] there is no question you're rationally what you should do but a lot of people have the feeling well I chose that first one what we find is that it's not that people think that there are ... more likely to win but where this tempting fate believe comes is that people believe that if they were to trade it\nThen it would become more likely to win a okay this is where the magic comes and so\nThey're torn between an intuition where they shouldn't traded their ... and the rational knowledge that they should we find that a large minority of them I said around like forty percent of them will stick with one novel up\nWhile thought to like a really high number and so what you're saying there is that that kind of choice the between the intuition and amend the rational kind of oversight they kind of represent these two different systems\nIn our brain and I'm sometimes rational system will win out but other times we kind of I guess given to the first ... system just because\nJust because of some kind of a rational belief\nThat's right and that's what we refer to as acquiescence when they follow that\nIntuitive belief even while recognizing that it's not a rational thing to do what we do know is that the more powerful the intuition is the more likely you are to follow it so another thing to consider is the cost of ignoring your rational side or ignoring your intuition\nSo much ... than the idea of the costs I explain my experience with the new do so you know the cost of ignoring my rational system is very small I mean maybe I sound like Saudi irrational person on the radio but the cost of ignoring the intuition she this is going to be really positive I
