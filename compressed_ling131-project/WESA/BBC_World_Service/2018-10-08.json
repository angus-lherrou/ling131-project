think there's something wrong with a comma\nLet me issue with me I Hope I Hope because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic and the tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event that turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average just slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but I woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got to know she ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before Florence made landfall as it raised with scale full wins the Atlantic sunk Clinton expect Kevin read of Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nOur key findings was that in these forecasts simulations that we did which are very similar to a a global forecast that you would do for any type of a weather event or we saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most participation overland after impact of the storm with fifty percent increased due to climate change\nI'm very interested in the description is different from the kind of description I've heard from friday also which is as a great the likelihood of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strength of the event is being changed\nYeah so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of this event to occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously bloom Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in the natural beauty and you could ... Pacific Ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in sea surface temperature and that's been something that that an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so there's warmer area than cooler area of basically were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initial education so that when we run these modify forecast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that that had on the atmosphere temperature as well as an affair temperature changes that have on once you're in the atmosphere\nMe that's very interesting because\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nOr cast without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction in the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point a degree Celsius as well as changes that that has on the atmosphere temperature as well as at a certain temperature changes that have on once during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific package ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for it so we're not just doing a uniform a changing of the uh the we actually have the pattern change of the F F T that comes from the fact that\nThe kind of system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included and it's set up\nThese patterns of geographical variation can let's just look under the bonus of climate change so to speak look at the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they sent me interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the light the Florence and several other storms picked up a lot of energy to see it while still far out in the Atlantic\nA large part of the tropical Atlantic is right at the margin for when you can start to form a tropical storm we think that somewhere in the range of twenty six to twenty seven degrees Celsius so there is a very large region in the Atlantic\nThe sort of marginal waters that are almost at that sort of critical threshold of twenty six and a half to twenty seven degrees Celsius where you can form tropical storms\nAnd that as the Atlantic warms up with global warming\nThat region where temperatures are high enough to form those storms is actually expanding quite a bit it's expanded quite a bit because you have so much of that marginal territory that's right on the threshold a little bit of warming\nCan suddenly create a much larger region that is warm enough and we think that may be why some of these storms are intensifying earlier we're seeing storms turned into\nMajor hurricanes much farther over in the eastern part of the Atlantic than we used to see and that could have some interesting potentially dire implications as\nWell is marginal changes to the Atlantic potentially dying then rapid changes in the Arctic ... even greater along they may have been implicated in many of the events that have mocked the past few months\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five ...
