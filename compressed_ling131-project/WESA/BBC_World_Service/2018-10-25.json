platforms and then they're going to start talking about that piece of information and you'll see them\nJump onto like Youtube video and they will run commentary talking about in this case it would be anti social justice warriors and then they would also come in with the pros social justice warrior account\nSo the idea here is that if you divide countries over these controversial issues that will lead them to be weaker on the world stage\nThat's right let me put it in these times man's spreading may not be the most divisive issues but by staging such a strong radical protest against it and as we do provoked very strong feminist and anti feminist responses\nAnd some of them would actually quite extreme just have a look at it on a social media accounts and you'll find that\nRather aggressive comments violent threats pornographic human genes et cetera\nRight but I kind of feel that we've heard a lot about these kinds of tactics only in the context in politics though particularly regarding the last us presidential election [noise] what's the case to say that these tactics are being employed beyond the world of politics oh Mike I'm so glad you asked [noise]\nThat would come by itself as somebody who is a fairly uh engaged with the star wars universe on a daily basis\nThat's Dr molten ... he's a research fellow at the center for digital future at the University of Southern California but more importantly he's a big star wars fan\nLet's just say that I have Star Wars tattoos on my left arm I have three circles one is the imperial insignia one is the rebel insignia and then I have a early version of what are we in the west know as the union yang symbol that's basically sort of a way of showing a sort of an evil and good imbalance\nWhen Star Wars the last jet I came out last year some ... with the casting choices you seat never before had a star wars film have so many women in ethnically diverse ... prominent roles and fish is gone some fancy evening\nAt the time questions were raised about how genuine discontent really was molten curious so he decided to look into the profiles of the people who were tweeting directly at director Ryan jumps and\nSome of them executed behavior that looked a lot like trolls what we called trolls in social media research basically people who somehow hide behind a fake account and try to create havoc and out of those I found a small number that looked a little bit like they might be from Russia\nThere were sixteen out of nine hundred and thirty seven which isn't a lot actually it it seems a little bit to me that that would be the norm to expect these days now that Russia's influence campaign has been\nAround for at least you know a number of years and the Russian trolls have been served themselves in American discourse on line for a number of years and all kinds of situations\nThat you're probably wondering why would Russian trolls have any interest in contributing to a conversation about a star wars film isn't that a bit

people you kind of have to get them where they are and that means going into pop culture which is what they engage with on a daily level whether that Star Wars or whether it's sports or whether it's\nSomething else that doesn't really matter and you know it's it's kind of a divide and conquer tactic that's the kind of idea just a generally destabilize the harmony that normally exists between people so that the nation is just not coming together at all\nLet's stick to digest that's it's not the divisions haven't always existed in society ... example whatever people's thoughts would about the constant choices than would always be some people who would agree and some who disagree\nBut if ... all rights what is happening here is that Russian operatives thought infiltrating these spaces and sending up the volume as each of those disagreements and of course a fractured society as a society that struggles to take action\nAs your says anger leads to hate and hate leads to the dark side and I think that there's a lot of anger out there right now this is a tactic as old as war fanning the flames of anger and the populace as a very very easy way to start uprisings\nBut Marco again how does this man's spreading video that we were talking about earlier fit into that broader picture\nWell from a domestic points of view you could argue that because a large number of Russians already liquid skepticism at a western feminism\nThen what ... does is to reinforce the views of the majority view that can often be found on Russian state media in the context of conversations about the me too movement and so on\nThe confidence is is provocative so that people react negatively and we'd intensity against it okay and that's inside Russia but what about in international level from the moments to video gets picked up by media around the world and uh because if you were so provocative\nIt's only bound to increase the divisions in societies that all well already divided\nIf you are sympathetic to honest points uh you know there was if you believe that man's spreading needs to be repels\nThen you're likely to be shocked by the aggressive response she received it will only confirm you view that a rabid conservative righty is just spinning out of control on the other hand if you already have an anti feminist bias\nThen divvied year will only concern is in the strongest possible terms you're very likely to see it as an example of this senseless political correctness brigade inaction [noise]\nSo back to the question that we raised at the beginning of the program Ken we conclusively say that and as video on demand spreading wasn't active staged Kremlin propaganda as the ... campaign against this information suggests\nIf you're looking for a smoking gun here then we don't have one but what we can say is that whatever the truth is this whole episode suddenly fits into a broader path and one very similar to people studying the way Russia drives it's they seem to ... campaigns\nBut at the end of the day does that really matter does it matter to know whether or not and as video which raises a valid point I suppose is an active propaganda well\nI'm going to let

the sound of a free press\nMonths following the crisis\nI asked him whether this has made banking safer\nOne reason why Britain had a particularly bad crisis was that we have these gigantic institutions doing ordinary high street banking which we will depend on small businesses depend on day today and all sorts of global investment banking and they got into trouble on on all those friends\nThen the second heading was how to make the banks more resilient in the sense of being able to absorb losses if we're more likely when the next crisis hits we recommended a kind of separation cooled ring fencing so this is the idea\nThat the ordering high street banking retail banking current accounts I dropped it was cool things which we all the individuals and small businesses depend on which a government can't let full life without title calamity\nThat those activities in major banks should be in a a self standing powder the bank separated from the global investment banking

will tell you that they did the favor of swallowing the weaker institution but there's really nothing natural and nothing efficient about the size and complexity of these institutions if they lived in lock it they couldn't actually live like that at all not one day it just that they had the privileged existence why they keep getting\nFunding despite being sold risky insult pay\nTheir too many privileges of too many subsidies that come along with the status of being sort of that big and dominant and so all the counter parties want to deal with you because they know you can't default on your

animal and not that they're still alive when we checked them I was jumping up down because he just totally unexpected and how long did some of the ... about fifty percent longer fifty percent yeah\nThat's extraordinary so you had most of the ones who are living for three weeks and there were some that live to fool four and a half four and a half yes I'm with that much more than you would\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nWe do research it's kinda like Campbell and [laughter] so we have some crazy idea than you know wait wait that's ... way to test them but you never know why they idea is ride around\nAnd those moments where you find that rates out that's the best moment\nAnd so they went on to other things would have different microbes by him give one well Tony a longer life for the better quality of life in that final days\nSo they're way way way way can look at how well they if they have when they're older they called worm when that getting older their physical activity ... so they move slower and also become a little bit ...\nShe's got a video of some of these elderly ones [noise] and she's right you can tell their own blog younger ones regal energetically around them the older ones moves loaning the skin sucking if they go [noise]\nI don't think they show rank habits that they can tell that ... is not as good as they used to be\nThe ones with the new microbiomes those tiny wrinkles around will quickly and their old age but they were less susceptible to disease to [noise]\n... now carrying out test some nice to see where the changing then micro biome extend their life and so there's a chance that one day don't just might be able to prescribe pills which do the same for us\nSome my colleagues say okay you know I think people can lead to two hundred say ... so personally I think why jak for me is already the number [noise]\nSo how long can we live for\nAbout ... to ... get up to a hundred and Seventy five [noise]\nAnd how it different micro biome could give us fifty percent more time on us\nBases inventions er about dressing the symptoms\nOf aging not the cold [noise] well then if we can go straight to the tools [noise]\nTime for a final expert witness oh\nPart for\nWhite and you're so budget oh\n\nYou wouldn't believe the number of people have had got in touch with me that Sloan Harry's professor of molecular genetics at the University of Exeter in the u._k. scientist whose work on aging is because a lot of people excited\nBefore now it's been a bit of a holy grail actually and I failed now people are beginning to realize that this is a possibility and not wanting to get them that I think it's going to be huge\nFickle begins with the building blocks of our bodies ourselves\nSo basically the organs might have different type of tissue your tissues tomato different types of cells now cells get hold of some ... and say your liver kidneys whatever will be dividing to replace some cells to kind of dynamic I didn't want to know the more time to cell divides the greater chance of becoming what we would call ...\n... comes from the lesson would send a scary which means to grow alone and that's exactly what happened to these cells they've grown old income to the end of life cycle but instead of dying they hung around acting in a destructive ...\nThey can actually communicate with the cells run them so it's innocent so we'll basically throw out to a bunch of chemicals which affect all of the cells run them so it's almost like a self thing I I'm an old south and you guys have been around here about ... ...\nFree ... free to pursue the tree Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nIt's almost sort of contaminating them with with age\nExactly so it's basically sending a message which can drive the cells around ...\nThat'd be grow older more and more of our cells becomes innocent until up ... is overwhelmed\nTiny did they make the cells around them age found that these innocent cells still functioning as they should which is still to be one of the things that leaves to diseases like dementia consent type two diabetes\n\nSuperficial Harry's wants to know whether she could get these cells to still behaving like a little cells behave more like young one\nWhat happened that was I had a new is that true in my lap and she was finding ... seats and we have some old south and I have some chemicals\nAnd she suggested ... percent ship it some of these chemicals on these old skin cells and see what happened\nAbout a week after she came in with the dishes cells and showed it to me\nAnd when you look through the microscope what were you expecting to say\nThat they would still looked like also said they look kind of lacy under a microscope and we have a particular die that we can put on a fellow coaches at times blue if that's the lesson\nSo when I was expecting to see if that's the south would be so blue and still looking old and she went they went blue and they had gone back to looking more like young south to professor Harry said oh no you've got the wrong se young sales go through to get\nInto it and she did and she did it again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again she brought about me and I still I wasn't convinced because we were not truly quite suspicious scientist yeah they were taught to to basically throw rocks that you're right there and if it failed at that it probably ...\nHow many wrote to search for about nine [laughter] she did it about nine times and finally I kind of look to to ask them to actually maybe you're on to somebody has\nShe done something that no one thought possible\nShe'd effectively rejuvenated on south in ten minutes young so\nAnd that's just why loan Harry just now getting phone calls from scientists and invested from all over the well is the first experiment this reverse aging and human cells they think a discovery could be the secret to a much longer life\nSo when it comes to a lifespan sink low in a hurry to be the most ambitious of on our expert witnesses instead\nOf human beings I think we have enough true maximum lifespan especially what I Want this research to end up paying you the new generation of empty degenerative drugs it was sort of way off yet but in the future for things like dementia and cardiovascular\nDisease what I'm hoping is that this will allow us one treatment which will address several of those at once so that people who would have died on each will then go on to live than not to a loaded lifestyle\nSo how long can\nWe live\nWe know the answer is at least a hundred and twenty two someone's already got that song and from what we cut that fake I like to write\n\nThe discoveries of on expert witnesses alone one day we may be able to replace a damaged organs\nTake supplements that give us a useful micro biome and still plus cells aging how many years ... what if we go to him bound makes predictions if you're a millennia like me\nBorn in Nineteen eighty one you should be able to get to a hundred and Seventy five [noise] by the time we get ten and Twenty one sixteen who knows what else will be possible [noise]\n[laughter]\nJust inquiry was presented by me having a merryman ... my best to take a sentence and if he wants to listen to more
