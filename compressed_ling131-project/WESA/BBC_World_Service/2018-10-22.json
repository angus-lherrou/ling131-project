sense of students being very perplexed and what they would come and say is can you help us understand what's going on\nWe're not learning this and our classes and they were right that we're not getting in their economics tosses a set of tools that was helping them to understand the day by day dimensions of the crisis\nAnd Christmas with a good sort of catalyst because at Christmas people are thrown together with their relatives and one typical question is well your studying economics you can tell us about the global financial crisis and the students having to say well we're actually not covering that knocks off is\nThe fact that students around the world continue to be two courses which has seemed to weigh a financial crisis was actually raging all around them brought home to many out of touch the professional have become Wendy colon is the most widely used university textbooks\nIn retrospect she admits these books must not subjects but we usually imports them in terms of understanding the crash\nThings as basic as how finance works\nI can put my hand up I had to spend a lot of time writing macroeconomics textbooks\nWhich we're addressing particular issues in the macro economy started to the one published in\nTwo thousand and six was all about inflation targeting and there was no section on banks all the financial system and this was very typical of the way I'm not correct comics is taught in universities around the world\nAnd has that changed it has changed I write in your textbook that that really catches it in other words with my co author we felt really challenged and I think this is true not just about that of many others\nAnd if you're wondering why we should care\nWhat's going on economics classrooms remember these are the people who graduate and going to steal the financial systems in which we all depend if they get bad advice and can wreck your economy\nThe growing frustration filled by students and their teachers around the world has given rise to a number of new initiatives to overhaul economics courses in one of these Wendy and many others are building a new free online curriculum known as cool this was a concern I feel passionately about\nAnd so I have to put my own hand up here I chaired the core charity\nBut will it different curriculum be enough\nIn finance in so many other areas the person who pays the piper cool to chew bankers and politicians sounded convenient to listen to those economists who argued for deregulation and who's morals allowed them to justify the housing bubble [noise]\nAnd that's a much easier comics professor at Stanford University in the U.S she's frustrated by economists taking refuge in theory and seeing what people want to hear well turning a blind eye to the bathroom even criminal behavior by bank because that can freshman financial stability\nIs definitely a problem it is very very shocking they remain really fantastic early in the sense of how they explored\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nRoom and all the flawed incentives and all that deception and fraud and all the excessive\nEndangerment that's entirely unnecessary it's just taken as a given it's just what they accept the system\nAnd does she think this is changed following the crisis\nWhat you were here is the law and out you know the very shockingly you know stuff happens and you know we're doing our best and it's going to be sort of the big oil crisis just wakes you up because you notice it and then he's like oh you know we really had terrible the regulations before\nLet's fix it but then the fix is really not quite right but then you just kind of move on and said well I did my best can be prevented stuff happens\nIt's not much of a comfort to think of the economists could be happy with the idea that stuff happens some things clearly going wrong for professor Joseph Stiglitz\nComes down to the continued reliance recount endless on the totally unrealistic notion that the market is always right he dates this right back to the founder of modern economics Adam Smith\nThey were blinded by the same ideology that had blinded the central banks and other policymakers\nThe blind belief that markets work well on their own unfettered markets will deliver for wellbeing for all citizens\nHas been at the center of you might say conservative economics sings Adam Smith\nAdam Smith actually understood that wasn't true\nI think it'd be horrified at the abuse of his ideas he recognized that ah whenever businesses get together that conspire against the public interest to raise prices\nBut somehow and the two hundred and some years after Adam Smith the conservatives that miss used his ideas\nEven more astounding was the fact that beginning in the Nineteen fifties sixties seventies and my own work or in the seventies and eighties advances in economics explained why markets often don't work the reason that this will hand often seemed invisible was it wasn't there\nThe notion of indivisible Hamdan supremacy of markets is based on the idea that if everyone buys themselves things in their self interest in trades freely without government intervention everyone will be better off\nJust sticking that's one of the Nobel Prize for economics by them to find some of the ways in which the key assumptions about perfect markets offload the presumption that everyone has all the information they need to make the right decisions just isn't borne out by experience\nThe notion of asymmetric information is very simple it's just that somebody knows something that somebody else doesn't know and the banks obviously knew some things that\nOthers didn't know about their bad behavior the banks knew that they were engaged in market manipulation\nOthers didn't the fact is that the people who want to believe that markets were perfect close their eyes and in Dr needed their students the markets basically worked perfectly\nWider economists expect humans to behave like rational calculating machines despite all evidence to the country\nFor some this tendency indicates a key problem at the house of economics which is to explain human behavior as if it were a science only works if you imagine all humans are the same responding in the same way an old contributions to be\nFree to

least they failings and not relevant to his economic decision making he's this sort of rational big calculating brain that is always acting additive self interest and all of that sort of characteristics or characteristics that we have been told to view as a male\nAnd even more of it is sort of all the characteristics that economics guys to great lengths trying to exclude from these models like\nEmotions family the faulty feelings compassion and altruism and all of the things that we have been told that these are not economically round event is not anything that we need to studying economics they like sent to the same things that we have been torched view as female\nI nobody the off to the Chrysler people saying\nThis great it's a good philosophy and is very narrow idea of what human beings are it's not good we need to bring these other values back in\nWe can't solve our economic problems without the courage to the U.S health with all that makes that human and failed economic models in economic theory that is actually based on that\nI agree with Katrin Schumann that people are simply rational ... mentions of what makes us human that this was an important reason

about this because people realized eventually that she had two white parents it became a fascinating and difficult debate about who is to say\nWe want being black is and she said look I I've never identified as white I feel myself to be black so therefore to that extent I'm black\nWell I think she's a very good case to think about because you ask what's the relationship between self ... and
