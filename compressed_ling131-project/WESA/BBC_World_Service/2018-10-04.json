a couple of hours that we can to help get them income would not be All right [noise] uh [noise] the steps\nThat rain debatable I Know these families want their children and worked to bring some income

you and your siblings hadn't watched Oh absolutely my two younger sisters still live at home\nThey've never felt like they've had to go out in the field to work and that's because you know my family

rotten them should be watching on child labor but she is in India for the past ... years and she's now director of advocacy and fundraising it's concerned for wasn't children that's\nA charity the combined glow charging that says the ban on child labor isn't working\nThere is a lot of pressure on countries like mine to insist that easily child labor anymore in most sectors certainly in exports that is the idea is to say that these products to clean their not touched the hands of child labor\nBecause if that scene is connected with child labor they wouldn't get any money for them they wouldn't be able to sell them\nExactly we don't even acknowledge their presence\nSo when the authorities come across child labor as she says that instead of helping them they will look to dissipate in\nAnd he'll if children are found working the state's response is come in white ... put them in and take them away to China's gate homes where they're locked up but you know one of the way from their families and the state cause the family and then the child should never ever be seen like this again\nAnd when they're released most of the children go back to work because the problems that drove them to work in the first place haven't been solved\nAnd this is where it could be threatened is organization comes in they meet child labor as an advantages and other than that parents why they walk\nSome talks about the whole meal they get to the factory some said they didn't get the support they need it at school oh they said they had to look for the younger siblings so fetch water all of them had different reasons but they had one thing in common\nThey will not willing to try for the burden on to the family for instance if they ... they would not or given seeing that your mother fish water and you'll be in school because they were seeing my mother has a lot to do on ready\nThey have to find solutions that wouldn't put more pressure on their parents and so it could be threatened the charity tend to what's known as the chance India's local councils\nAnd a lot of the work of my organization has been to walk with these local government which she lives in sitting with them and

that\nIs how we were able to create try to label the communities that a country like India\nAnd by labor free and she doesn't mean these are communities where no children was what she means is that the work that doing no longer interferes with school like to avoid and she can somewhat can be a good thing\nGets children useful skills and money for textbooks so school uniform so what about making sure they can choose the right kind of work\nAnd to do that they create children's councils\nI give you an example is the religious we work with we talked to children and they actually come up with a document called the work we can and cannot do for instance\nMilking the cows most of us might think it's OK harmless et cetera but these kids said if you're ... the coast which are very temperamental and which are very happy kicking they said nobody should be doing it because it's hard for look it's dangerous\nInstead of lists drawn up by international organizations or central governments they find out what the children want some like being ... hours of household chores and thought to spend two hours working for a local shop\nOthers might choose factory what milking a temperamental Jersey cow it's down to them and it gives them a little control over their own lives\nBut can you really expect children to make the right decision for themselves\nI'm yet to find a child who really wants to be exploited\nBut a child to perhaps continues to walk because they feel the pressure to help that family\nWe have to give that child that choice in fact this kind of walk actually increases are responsibilities when they're working with children directly you don't let them take that one decision and then forgive them you're still in touch with them you're part of their life [noise]\nThan our children's council throughout bind alone it's time consuming and expensive\nBut it's having results so is it time to rethink the ban on child labor [noise] see I Alone the organization behind the

debatable continue [noise] but when you take a step back pay the deal like human isn't just about policy\n[noise] it's about something real fundamental to some degree in the west the child under a
