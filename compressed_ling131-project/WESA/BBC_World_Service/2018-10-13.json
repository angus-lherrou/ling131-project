E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nThink we cannot mitigate we have to me to get the short term ... cases I can just bring you about it for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between at one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nTeasing there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in that sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rides um when I looked\nTo sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier around you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started on the television we're seeing massive increase in the months of\nRenewables that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we aren't yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition that we have been able to use the parents agreement incredibly effective used greens working on European policy so you know for example I work on the sustainable finance area we can say the oil financial products or pension products have to be aligned with the one point five\nPowers target for example I can argue that now in the parliament's no gain support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and they mentioned the world of these climate change the climate is breaking down and they see how unmanageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes not\nYou know it just went to us today is that when asking the question who is going to pay to for\nThis one we should not see this as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual trajectory one\nDoes this reading an investment in a safer and sustainable group and when asking the question was going to\nPay for it for just one station today one should also balanced is with the question was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already recount observing today they're projected to increase significantly already read one point five degree of warming\nAnd recruit degree or form in ... in the far future this is um one point five to ... levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees you have to learn about twenty five years later so does this really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who is going to pay for that\nDown the road and find them eat the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefree managed and they have to be carefully managing managed so that they she the poor of the impacts of this so that they can be compatible with sustainable development and and general welfare\nLaw where he wants to come back and yeah I think I wanted to bring together that comment that money made and and I do or you just made a lot has been done we have Ninety nine countries we ... the entire Seventy three countries with\nAuctions fifty eight countries that are that have other places to see that when you both and thanks to all of these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mediation coming down significantly\nSo he says making it easier there isn't a global carbon price for instance there's a great no but ... is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most efficient solution I can economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have\nTo realize and there's been um scholars and political science working for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which have traditionally\nDreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on the master's program\nAt the end you dot edu slash I I I\n... section but I think what do we have to realize and there's been um scholars and partly because high and working for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... what we've had is domestic level policies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which have traditionally been\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications unconscious indication they're beginning to be competitive so it's these investments ... it is changing and that's the only said again we are doing and we have\nBeen doing is not enough as they say the report is reminding us okay but I Do think this point and he's made all the report about making sure that the most vulnerable are not hurt is not just necessary for ethical reasons\nBut it's also necessary for political resent okay only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nYeah so when we talk about coffee it's important that we remember the global economy is not stopping and there were three big trends are going to happen\nRegardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty cents even down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period in the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to double\nNinety shortly and we'll be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we might the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it sustainable infrastructure the global economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at a ... rates of about three percent a year and the\nPopulation living in cities around the world is like it's a double in the next for two years they all trends in\nThe global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our\nCurrent growth model which was delivering US cities the dock congested polluted unpleasant places to be not productive\nFor we designed our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new ... it's about us choosing to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that so I Want to wrap up this how fast the now thank you to a panel throughout the as an adult ... Julius ... case as\nAbsolutely so I I think for a you know when you look at those grass where you have a very sharp decline it's clear that is a big departure from the status quo and I think getting that requires all these kind of action all these factors and also a different way of uh\nOf going about not pushing for but arguing or four different policies\nMulti I just wanted to bring you back in I touched on the idea of nuclear fuel viewed as nuclear power it's ready to be clean energy or does it have a place in this picture\nOne of the world's nuclear energy report for this year shows the upside joined the nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck up I mean we can now in Studio offshore wind about forty five dollars and make a wartime unknown show when the twin daughters and make it whatsoever and she ...\nI think the point which is a hundred and twenty dollars and Michael we'll tone that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economic so nuclear just cannot compete with renewables and what we need to do is is electrify our energy supply\nStreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nStill wind about forty five dollars and make a wartime unknown show when the twin daughters and make it was ... I think the point which is a hundred and twenty dollars and make a little tone that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economic so\nAnd you just cannot compete with renewables and what we need to do is is electrify of energy supply and make it to low carbon as quickly as possible damage deficient in cheapest way to do that through a new bills\nSo in some evil and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the contested Enterprise Institute is funded by the energy industry and he was on Donald Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them wanting from multiple viewpoints for one of them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an imminent crisis because that's their charge from the United nations about his level but I I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything\nThat the scientists could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this seriously\nUh no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are a pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's Evan Davis said they had nothing to scientists say is going to make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea time back with us effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and uses science to argue for the fact that use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think fat\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for weaker\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have a particular view on science what they do have a view as they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nFull board wants to come in for you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this report line by line in South Korea last week they have not discern that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how but how do you decide to date and of course that is true how do you desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all fact we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I wanted to states\nI'm importantly when President Trump gives you a reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nWithdrawal from Paris there was a huge response from states from city some companies all say we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI'm importantly when President Trump gives reasons he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it simply cheaper to generate power from other ... chess shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut he's in the ... the facts are becoming separated from the optics and this is a president who wants to project a very particular and there's one that appeals to his electoral base and what she's at odds with the kinds of conversation that we've been having\nHere it is he's appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including ... industries and we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people of a job she's\nPart of coming up the solution here but the the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them Florida it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is big up because it's C level rise and there's a good chance the warmer than average waters in the goals were partly poma because of climate change I think people would say it's an increasing cost of burying the impacts of climate change in the United states\nNorth at one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S has gone way this has been in the support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years the narrow try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right to zero at sea route investments that three\nThousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know kind of an energy technologies that Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to

some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it's up\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have got right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda there's much more talk about renewables but the thing that made me just give you a small example\nIn the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas

the deal sea congested thank you for making time for us on the program this morning Jonathan ... is with me in the studio here in London Jonathan you will not particularly vigorously when Louis was talking about how easily this disease is spread\nYes and particularly around the area of safe burial is one of the most infectious things is a dead body unfortunately\nAn of course there's lots of a local culture and an an local uh practices that involves quite close contact with a dead body and so\nIn past outbreaks we've seen that this is an incredibly efficient way of spreading the virus and that's why it's it's crucial to get a lot about the buried as quickly as possible but of course it's very difficult to do that\nIf you can't get access to the communities and of course the other elements as well as as a lot of mistrust\nBeing being building and unfortunately again you can't use the usual measures which you're we rely on to control these outbreaks which is that they're very simple measures you you identify people who are infected\nYou isolate them and then you monitor the contacts that those people and if any of them becoming cited you isolate them and by just doing this isolation ... contacts monitoring can very quickly bring a an outbreak under control but of course you can't do that\nIf it's in a in an area of great civil unrest\nAnd the coolest wet actually there is distrust of modern medicine\nAbsolutely on this huge mistrust and and again we ... we had from Louis that there's a very effective vaccine works really well in the in the twin cities you know breaking guinea which is really where it was a given its first opportunity\nUm this is a very effective vaccine in these sorts of outbreak conditions but again you needs to be able to get into the community says you need to have been willing to be vaccinated so this is an incredibly challenging time\nThe world Health Organization is saying it may be another three or four months before this latest outbreak is brought under control just how bad could things get in the timeframe\nThe worry is that there are cases which was a a cropping up in in very disparate parts of the the region so so at the moment the outbreak comes around two hundred square kilometers and I'm not saying the whole of the areas got a boat or infections but there are a little so sigh of outbreaks\nAnd of course if you then spread your resources over great geographical area becomes incredibly challenging to try and do something about so whether it's two months three months or even longer who knows at the moment\nThis question one last one is ... this is a disease which so far has been largely can find to places like that they all see but the the war\nScreaming on WGN right it's appointed by Carnegie

war is a way that it's going to somehow get on a plane and then be spread around the world how big a risk is that briefly\nThere's there is a a risk that it can be taken to to other countries as we saw in the twin cities you know break but it then is unlikely to spreads too much unless those places haven't got great self um infrastructure\nJonathan we'll come back to you during the course of the

one of those moments of true I mean if you look what's happening globally we are miles from the project power that the I PCC recommend\nAnd we're a long way the kind of measures they have in mind so we have a in China nearly one thousand gigawatts of cold now ...\nThey're building two hundred and fifty new power stations in China and they're supporting two hundred coal plants outside China as part of that development programmers and they're growing at about six to seven percent parental which means China will be as an economy twice its current size\nWithin a spice about ten to twelve years

O. two in the atmosphere I don't think this is a reason to abandon when power but I think it's important that the community began to take this research seriously and consider this as part of decisions about how we do carbon eyes\nSo there's been debate over\nDecades about what the energy or power density as of winter brown a race basically how much power you can get from a single square kilometer of land with wind turbines and\nPeople have suggested it's a very large numbers tens or hundreds of megawatts ... kilometer we've now done with wonderful new public data that shows you the location of every single us wind turbine we've been able to get an average value for the entire us fleet\nAnd we get a number it's more like a half a watt per square meter and that's you know a factor of\nBetween a few and even ten times less than some important estimates by the U.S department of energy or the BCC and that means that you're generating given amount of power it takes more land than people thought with wind and that has more environmental consequences\nWell less important because I Know that you were very interested in some of the power and I believe that the ... ... square me to you can get from solar power a bigger than that\nYeah solar power is roughly ten times more was per square meter and that sounds like a very abstract thing that you you know only them often would care about but the point here is about how much land\nHumans have to dedicate to the energy system which will you know have environmental and social impacts nothing we do at the scale of modern energy is going to be impact free burning coal is probably the worst thing we can do we have to stop doing that\nBut as we transitioned we have to think about the relative impacts say of wind or solar of nuclear power or what have you and the big important are finding I think that\nThe land footprint of solar is something like ten times smaller than the land footprint of wind for the same generation and in addition wind has this climate impact and these climate impacts are I think not enough to say you should forget about wind power that but there are enough that we have to start paying attention to them\nHarvard's David Keith roughly said is that with these new thoughts on wind power you can get a sense of how ruffled if you look at this time going on at deep Keith climate there's a link to his papers by his blog site to borrow a Web page at BBC World service still call them\nThat like most scientists they was happy to talk to us because he wants to publicize his work and the process of sons go something like this\nFind something out tell everyone else about say by publishing the details\nFree or low rate of ... the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nIf the climate that's I think to his papers by his blog site to borrow a Web page uh BBC World service don't call them that like most scientists they was happy to talk to us because he wants to publicize his work and the process of science goes something like this\nFind something out how everyone else about it by publishing the details\nBefore the digital age publication was generally done through a profit making journal and a half the volume that was delivered to your door by post we still call them papers\nBut in the digital age and with increasing emphasis on open songs that model is breaking down last week two major publishers to counter lawsuit in the states against the sons sharing site ... skate complaining about violation of copyright\nAs soon as it has been rumbling in Europe for a year and ... has been following the disputes he told me first about the participants\nAlso be the biggest science published in the world publishing over two thousand scientific peer reviewed journals\nI mean that absolute jars if there's a disciplined his sons so have more of a ... oh yeah ...\nDefinitely eh also there is no small company you know like you said if there's a ... they also have probably has a ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "13"}
