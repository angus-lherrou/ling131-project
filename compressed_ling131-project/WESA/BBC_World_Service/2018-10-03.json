recognize the shrill attention tone that broadcast from the regular tests that have been going on right foot tomorrow's is different because tomorrow will be the first time\nA system that was built over the last few years to allow it broadcast or directly to cell phones is being used\n... it's interesting because cell phone's been around for a while this is if the government is catching up a little bit late\nRight this was actually implement it as a couple of years ago during the Obama administration as a way to say the civil defense status that is the emergency alert system\nNeeds to be modernized and now that we have this new phenomenon which is to say everyone in America more or less has a cell phone on their person um wouldn't it be nice to be able to reach them immediately\nOld television and radio channels would come together and we'll broadcast from wherever the president was or do a a sort of a pre recorded broadcast\nEssentially yes there was um a FCC\nScreaming on ...

to be able to reach them immediately\nOld television and radio channels would come together and we'll broadcast from wherever the president was or do a a sort of a pre recorded broadcast\nEssentially yes there was um a FCC requirement um the Federal Communications commission\nOr in the U.S that you had to participate if you are public broadcast or a private broadcaster for that matter ... so if you are one of the primary channels for your city or your region you would be made to carry a message or the or more just see it where it would go off\nAnd they would say this is a message from the White House stay tuned for more information stay on this channel\n... they would they would do tests so Americans with ... with the sound but that would be told that this is a test of the system of the of the emotions you Brokaw system\nYes there was a required a monthly test and some places the weekly tests as well that often you know it was a midnight or a little bit later so I'm a lot of people found out by when they snoozing on the couch or it would make them up in a very ...\nThat sounds like a cultural thing this is a Trump to learn the Americans know the outside of America wouldn't know that is that's in great detail I Love that [noise] so do people talk about this\nThere's been this rising tide of awareness where people are realizing that this is something that's going to happen this is coming straight to everybody and I think the part that's really getting people burn is the fact that it will say it will be labeled at the top of the the text message that arise as presidential alert\n[noise] yeah I'm a social media message from President Trump um that wouldn't be confusing which [noise]\nUh no I I think at some point or another\nThat is what everyone is fearing is that the system will be taken away from its original purpose and that will suddenly get an emergency alert to the entire nation that says no collusion but there are also to road blocks I think having that happen right the first one is that is it legal they did set this up to say\nThere is a way to you this is only for emergency situations and anything else especially politically would be illegal now a lot of people say well maybe that doesn't slow you down the legal part won't stop someone who has already done so much to a scandal as the country\nUm but the actual activation procedures it would go from the White House and and Trump's authority only but the procedures would be handled by FEMA so the officials there would have a modicum of oversight to say the least I don't think that it would be like his Twitter account where he has on constrained access at any time\nRight so it is slightly filtered by the emergency management people presumably Yukon reply to this text right and [laughter] I I Want\nTo think of what would happen if someone else took control of the system though and sent some message either in farce or in you know ... to the entire country in the wrong moment right that that would be a a worse situation almost than having a real message come through a at an untimely time\nYeah reply old would lead to trouble wouldn't it address to see any of the ... center at the Harvard Kennedy School or just to spoil your anticipation that message or we're going to get says this this is a test of the national while this emergency alert system no action is needed\nComing from the you know are we going to get all caps luck for example well this is this is the thing I'm I'm In fact well what a hundred other people are interested in Aden is the kind of the fact that many people who have a positive attitude to the current occupy as the White House will just kind of go I don't want to miss the president's going to be\nScreaming on WGN recorded by

the thing I'm I'm uh in fact well what are under and other people are interested in Aden is the kind of the fact that many people who\nHave a positive attitude to the current or ... of the White House will just kind of go I don't want to Mr the president is going to ignore it even when it could be quite important uh likewise if somebody else we're in the White House\nThe other half of America would possibly avoid it as well as he was saying um it just feels as the president ... really send a personal message but bear in mind that these false alarms do actually happened to me the Hawaii that it was like a ... there was a a a false alarm of a ballistic missile attack which went home for thirty minutes before\nBut also it kind of uh we should understand that because there could be a loss of trust in terms of health care system want to understand why that is the weekend or mitigate um that and approve of the care people get\n... on sending text messages that allows things to read them much quicker than traditional methods\nExactly so you're just looking at new data sources how they can complement a existing public health sources and of course in a rapid situation you can get text messaging for like text messages in real time so that isn't appropriate weight to um we figured it's inappropriate weight kind of understand healthcare and seeking behavior in a in a rapidly\nHow can you make sure that you can do the right people you get simple terms of numbers of the people you need to get hold off to cover a broad enough ah sway the community presume\nThat yeah that's very good questions so these days number is actually not a problem because like you can imagine so many people have mobile phone even in a low means our study like Liberia urban even rural areas of Liberia but they're still an issue because the people who use mobile phones\nMight be of course a little bit different than the people who don't use that and so we had to use some\nMash and techniques after to make sure the sub and look at some samples from the the people got data from from the mobile phone to make sure that makes sense for the you know the larger population\nYeah cause I can imagine in a place like Liberia there's some pretty remote rural places where people either don't have a cell phone network in some cases people who are illiterate maybe some of the people who need to help most are the ones you find the most difficulty reaching\nYes no that's of course very important especially in the situation so we have to be a kind of approach in a little bit systematically meaning the wood for example over sample and places where it's more under developed there'll be less access\nAnd then we took a cat into account characteristics of people not just um what they were funded in terms of their health care but you know what their socioeconomic were and other things to make sure we're getting information on it at a good a distribution of you know kind of good representation of the population\nAnd I wonder about these text messages because in many places it seems to me the ... the taxes the way of getting information around quickly\nExactly you know these kinds of things are always changing what people are using for our\nCase technicians were okay me ... a really good at it you know samples people because it's still possible for the ... you know people to get text messages that we send me given incentives so people answering the survey they would get some amount of air time so that kind of was a little bit of incentive to respond to this\nKind of message but definitely people you know it's I think in terms of research exploring these different modes like ...\nFreed with law free to pursue the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of
