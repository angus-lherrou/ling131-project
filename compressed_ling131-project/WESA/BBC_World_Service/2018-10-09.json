notion of being sort of a rebel loner\nThe tough and stoic and stylish and brave and your art and style this was not really associated with women for quite awhile first time I saw a woman\nReferred to

I see it applied regularly to the women who are merged and the seventies and rock and roll Patti Smith\nDeborah Harry Chrissie Hi and and uh so I'm just saying that of course there've always been cool women but the term cool has never really been associated them until recently the newest rebel persona I specially in music for example are all women and so to some extent\nWell I guess whatever we think of no one may I say it did help cement the idea of the rebel as who agree with you this was in voted in a new type of cool I come on the big screen listen to it I'm thinking of Marlon Brando and James Dean who quite different from the Nineteen forties film law here is of Humphrey Bogart and Robert ...\nYes in movies Marlon Brando James Dean and also Montgomery cleft made rebellion attractive their style is disaffected a sensitive vulnerable and even plagued with self styled\nJames Dean was easy for why teenagers to identify with he became a superstar a legendary I kind of cool when he died in a car crash at age twenty four after having made just three films only one of which had been released east of eating\nThe other two are rebel without a cause and giant were released after his death\nHis disaffected attitude struck a chord with young people worldwide\nWho saw him their own unhappiness at growing up among hypocritical and narrow minded adults\nAnd this was during a time in the United states when being a non conformist was actually dangerous this was the period of the house committee on un American activities and the McCarthy hearings in the Senate people were persecuted

I'm doren and Virginia ... in rebel without a cause from Nineteen fifty five directed by Nicholas re according to this was a film at stake for an entire generation of young Americans as you said but there's also point here that these were the new teenagers very much opposed full phenomenon\n[noise] yes in fact we're teenager was relatively new at the time or to some extent it was a luxury to be a teenager at a time when the economy was doing quite well and a young people didn't have to go to work and become just like their parents at a young age so they had a leisure time\nFor perhaps the first time in American history and uh they were also board\nUm this was a time of white flight from the city is after World War two people moved to the suburbs um and there wasn't much to do their so you've had this phenomenon of adolescence I'm at a loss for how to spend their time\nHaving the luxury of a rebellious attitude not wanting to be like their parents because they didn't have to\nUm countless style that these films the fashion chain to be seen as crucial to didn't as well as the actors\nOf color yes and it gave license to teenagers across the will to make use of everyday objects to say something new something different about what it meant to be a teenager so the classic of course the the tea should ... these everyday object which has started I'm\nA part of the un nasal unit farming around Nineteen sir teen was seen on the body of Marlon Brando in streetcar named desire than warmed by James Dean in rebel without a cause this\nDreaming white T shirt under red jacket so some things so ordinary coupled with a pair of jeans could say some things so radical\nOne of the other major she goes from the parents we mustn't forget about it that the rebels spirit was a singer Elvis Presley\nDog\n\n[noise] Joe\nSo wedded Elvis fits into this pantheon of cool\nWell Elvis fits in in both directions first of all Elvis worship Marlon Brando and James Dean are actually in the movie could grill plays a role that was meant for James Dean except that he passed away and when he first ran to Marlon Brando commissary on the studio lot\nHe shook his head and walked away and said oh my God I just shook hands with Marlon Brando so that this was a fat boy from Marlon Brando was kind of a shock\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five ...

and when he first ran to Marlon Brando commissary on the studio lot\nHe shook his hand and walked away and said oh my God I just shook hands with Marlon Brando so that Elvis was a fan boy from Marlon Brando is kind of a shock looking back\nBut the second thing is coming out of African American music Elvis basically gave white Americans permission to love African American music because he was white\nHe grew up in the deep south he grew up with rhythm and blues and gospel music and it is important to remember that Elvis his first hits were also heads on the black charts on the rhythm and blues charts he was doing something somewhat a rich you know with\nThe African American rhythm and blues tradition\nAnd so although he has often sort of seen as an appropriate or and you could say he is or is not but a lot of his African American peers at the time also enjoyed his\nSinging and his take on NASCAR contrition so Elvis is seen as a rebel because he goes on stage and he is rockets and energetic he's in control of his performance\nBut he knows what he's doing any once said that uh every time I get a reaction in the audience to a certain physical gesture I remember it and then I Do it the next time so we have this real knowledge of how pop were\nThe people like James Dean into Elvis Presley and popular culture has of course being huge and it's transmitted is such an idea of crude across the landscape but I Wonder what you will see in Kobe really talking about American cultural imperialism here is that what cool is in the end Joe no\nIt sometimes is a certain way it's the power of American culture but\nTen years ago there was a poll thirty thousand people on line a global poll among the questions were what is the coolest nationality and to my great surprise it was American\nAnd the second question was why and this is the important part for cool the answer was because of the coolest people live there and the people they named where I ... we actually consider cool and so there's a real sort of unconscious\nOr understanding that cool is an essential concept in American culture and in self definition now I'm not by any means saying are apologizing that there is an American cultural imperialism about consumer products and about capitalism that is of course true\nBut I think that there's both and there's a cool that's attributed capitalism and buying things that are associate with America and then there is that cool is a concept for self definition and rebel cool in America\nClose your what's your view on the American concept of cool inspired young people around the world this is in part because American music and Hollywood films permeate the globe and advertisers aggressively marketed James Dean and Elvis memorabilia\nThat cultural imperialism is not the whole story in fact there's a constant cross fertilization between cultures adolescence internationally creatively reinvent the rebel icon for their own purposes\nAnd for post colonial

imperialism\nTo me they're not just about the kind of a tough thing down if you like but it was that what ... have been saying is that making use if those references to create something new and to say something new about their own experiences in particular a particular geographical space\nI suppose that's what we've been tracking throughout this program the way one started the coolest being taken by another generation and turned it into it saying I'm not as we've been hearing coup hasn't remains static concept\nJob today everyone wants to be cruel and we're so things on the premise that that

believe in the community we just sat there and you're like wow indirect let me think about it so let's get the pie in the end of it yeah\nSo what about cartels by building these area waterways shelf though is moving into that territory in a big way and that's where Kenny experience in states is in Kibera comes into play it sounds like you've got an enemy the cartels yes are they trying to stop you\nWe're we the people I mean it's just that's the way we think of them are criticizing now have you had any interaction with them yes admitting that they started cutting the pipes I trust they started cutting you'll pipes yes so that was really terrible so what I did for some of them will really be Oh nice to be a wife or their children\nTo be the one thing they want to you know a kiosk

they said for Penn\nSo you will say it's clean I might have clean cheaper and cheap compared to what they must be worried about your expansion fence yeah so yeah so I I Will find a way to work with them will find a way without too you know to put them part of the system so that's your what's your ... [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] just listening\nTo Kenny tell his life stories or some makes me realize that he really is the key to this solution\nHere and we sell always in our program it's about the

don't want to paint shelf though as a one man band Kennedy just up on his own and doing this in Kibera\nIt's a large organization now that does lots of different things they've got that call school like I mentioned in the health clinic football team is always and there are other people involved so Kenny runs they together with his wife and for those that was that they do that very well rewarded

delivery\nYeah exactly and the Kenyan authorities themselves they're not doing nothing they do have some pipes going into the slum they're trying to improve that situation\nBut several experts told Mayte the cartels can still be involved with those processes maybe the most will be held legally during the daytime but then illegally at night so it's a complicated picture\n... different players involved as you said it's a ... fits into that\nWell it's interesting one expert I spoke to said that this ball health system might actually be quite limited because at the amount of water you can produce this way and he said that ultimately the real solution was what with governments and private utility companies to convince them\nThat you could actually make a profit by building ... piped infrastructure out in the stomach itself so\nThat means working with the big guys but as we know that they can be a bit slow sometimes that Congress and people are shocked co in Kenya but mostly to circle you know fast to doing things on the ground they know how it works\nYeah exactly and that is the whole point of shelf pay their grassroots organization that led by ...\nThey didn't want to hang around waiting for help and that's why they're trying to solve this problem themselves why did I leave you with us from my interview with Kenny when he talks about how all of those mental it's been

I'm very much talking about the western European tradition and what will say get sort of taken up in in America older interesting you they're all more opportunities for women in what is a very new university system in\nSay the nineteenth century so we do find for example\nMurray and it shows an astronomer he was able to teach astronomy in women's college so what was in the U.S in the in sort of mid to late to nineteenth century so you have a ... system\nAnd often novelty gifts brings the women I mean potty often it's a sort of reforming wells and that includes the idea that women should be educated and have a more public voice perhaps\nSo we do find women there and the way that if we're thinking of the traditional university system in Britain you felt for the Cambridge in England and\nWomen's struggling for very long time to be given places I see\nThe thing that you said that when a field is new and\nDreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university's integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nDidn't have a more public voice perhaps so we do find women that are in a way that if we're thinking of the traditional university system in person you've got to look for the Cambridge in England and and women's struggling for very long time to be given places I see\nThe thing that you said that when a field is new and it coincides with the development of women and an education then you do see more women entering those field I think I can let it interesting that in when you look at the desk of figures on women in\nScience for example that some of the countries that have the highest proportion of women in science are countries like Bolivia Venezuela those kind of as a worst of the lowest\nOnes are the Netherlands surprisingly enough I'd love to know more about the ... and what kind of rolls and you know are we talking about private companies doing but such or are we talking about investing systems when what is the kind of funding that goes into research with any investigation there's different countries so in some cases\nI suspect there may be longer if I could sum of women being at higher education and so on but in other cases it may be that it's a system that's not terribly well funded and whether a places that aren't very well funded or not seen as being particularly socially prestigious then you tend to find\nWomen finding an opportunity because men are not taking the option to get there all the things that they would rather be doing and certainly we find that in different scientific fields where a field is no full say they're a good example and the ... century of geology or in the late ... century of astrophysics so and you kind of way of doing astronomy\nWomen over from being quite early pioneers in those areas because they haven't necessarily be competing down\nFollowing the traditional education system they all competing with a lot of established individuals' usually male who publishing in those areas and some interesting they we sometimes find that that gets women an opportunity until then often historically there\nThan push that so far a typical an iconic ... computer programming which early on was very much seen as a female role we sort of such as you look for ... years old punch cards and things that were often seen as almost secretarial work and I'm In a very narrowly retiring euro so you know it wasn't necessarily well paid\nAnd often it was left to women to do this work but when it was under ... just ... to ... she was going to be\nWe find that it stopped being paid more scenes they will ... on women have them being so slowly chef Dr phil [laughter]\nRebecca get lecturing history of science at the University of Ken's\nJust how much wouldn't get filtered out was brought home by so then you pay a few years ago they found that two thirds of the British public\nWas unable to name a single famous female scientist so to end this program we've compiled these women working in stem subjects and awesome to name that stuff female scientist you'll hear in a pig every time a name is mentioned [noise]\nMy name is ... ... their engineering hero if I really have to take charge of delivering the Brooklyn Bridge father in law died in an accident on site and her husband was really unique and Joe\nHello\nKnew I\nMain concern\nTo how I Know in the news around him [noise]\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sounds of a free press\n\nMain mission\nThey they designed to how I should not news around him [noise]\nMy name is Kelly [noise] this is the experiment to say we need to get a ton of time spent second to the gate the fundamental building blocks of", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "09"}
