a gas station in space there will be used ... ships will be great but I Do see a problem in the in the in the medium term surely because\nWe talked about economics rockets the now going up and down

overall mission so he's he's few really good deliverable everyone is waiting for\nAbsolutely what we will find over time is very cheap rockets are going to get extraordinarily efficient at going from the surface of the year just into space into earth orbit\nAnd from that point we'll have a different type of vehicle your your taxi or your tug that never has to feel the weight of gravity never asked to feel the force of the atmosphere it'll be permanent ... in Italy permanently in space and it'll it'll be that shuttle that takes you from where the rocket drop you off to the next point\nAnd

that is one of the challenges of working with asteroids as opposed to the moon or Mars and this is part of the economics of space mining we see similar challenges in remote activities in the tundra where the roads literally freeze over and you have to work with the seasons\nSo with asteroids one of the challenges is to work with the seasons of their orbits so if it were easy it would already be done and these are the things that we're exploring to find the next solution for how soon will this happen\nIt's happening now so you know you're going to have a pro bono starting to prospect on that particular restaurant in the first commercial resource exploration mission is probably still four or five years away it's a matter of the funding for doing these things NASA does billion dollar missions\nThe commercial sector still needs about a hundred million dollars to do these types of projects so it's a it's a financing challenge as many things are\nAbout five years from now we can tell you which is the you know the first place in the solar system that will be the the source of the resources send you think the finances that yes absolutely hundred million dollar projects are a dime a dozen around the world but or five years away from knowing where the mine is and probably five years after that from starting the very first small scale my\nChristmas ... here on business daily from
