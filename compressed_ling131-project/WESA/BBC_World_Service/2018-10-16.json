Saudi Arabia\nFried ... free to pursue the truth ... double your very Pittsburgh NPR News the sound of a free press\nA and cook possibly even intensify as the details become more publicly known\nWhen you say fallout do you mean the fallout between the United states and Saudi Arabia the international community in Saudi Arabia or the international economic uh and financial community and Saudi Arabia\nI Do think it it includes all of those areas particularly the the United States because it's at least\nLike many thanks cofounder of Microsoft's software giant Paul Allen has died of cancer at his home in Seattle He was sixty five and had been suffering from non Hodgkin's lymphoma\nSince two thousand nine found Hampshire is on the big news desk and fail unlike some of the famous names in the tech industry Bill Gates Steve Jobs jak bases pond and it's actually less than a household name\nI think that's fair if you're in business economics low tech you know poll Allen but he's probably a little less known in the wider world unlike say Michael Bloomberg go eat lawn mosque there are a lot of these tech names\nPeople just know because they've bonded about a lot however without pool alimony computing would not be what it is he and Bill Gates with childhood friends and it was him the convince Bill Gates to drop out of Harvard so they can focus on doing Microsoft together\nTo give you an indication of just how important he was in two thousand seven and two thousand eight he\nWas named two times one hundred most influential people in the ... list\nA it was estimated at the time of his debts very mind that they've been spending a lot of money on philanthropy over the course of his life at the time of his death he was the forty six richest man in the world with ... with a twenty three billion US dollars easy and understand the founder of Cicero communications\n... says taken all the headlines of the Microsoft story that I was there starts ... said appeared kind of fell I over um the direction but also share holding in the business can often happen in business and that\nBut it ... listening to Bill Gates has said about his his friend and they remained friends older life\nVery very warm tribute to him this morning I'm Alan ... groundbreaking not just in terms of compete say but I actually and his future um life often Microsoft supporting wanting to scientific endeavor\nSo that in ... in there which means that I wasn't just the Microsoft\nMan certainly not in fact if you like this this may explain partly why he's less of a household name Microsoft's was founded in Nineteen Seventy five he left the company in Nineteen eighty three\nSo he did a lot post Microsoft he was the founder and chairman of a a group called the vote can it's a complicated entity because it does bugs his business ventures and also his feelings from ... uh stuff as well\nSo basically I'm going to run you through this because there's a long list but he ... to professional sports

Vulcan bills have to hear about is oh to basically\nHe redefined what big thinking was for me I've never met anyone in my life who\nWant to do so much good in the world has such a big way is average one was wider than anyone I ever met [noise] that's that's something I'll never forget or one of the reasons I again or for\nBill hills the chief executive of all to\nKill Hampshire many things more business who's coming up on you the next hour\nAnd a is twenty two minutes pasta and others we Harvard University in the U.S\nIs facing a lawsuit brought on behalf of Asian American students who failed to gain admission athletes houses the policy notice affirmative action which many universities choose to adults to give disadvantaged groups a better chance of getting in\nThis means that they're not letting just on academic ability the Asian American students say they were good enough to get in but what kept out because African Americans and Hispanics have that chance is boosted by some direction racial balancing it's cool\nThat we hear from someone in favor of affirmative action in the moment but first the testimony of one student Kelly about civil\nI come from an Asian American background and a student at Harvard and I think I should have privileged tennis university and that's a ... many other Asian Americans will have to come I think that when you look at the case here of affirmative action\nWe should just be looking at whether or not affirmative action is right or wrong but try to have affirmative action is impacting different communities and so the point of affirmative action has been to support communities that has historically than underrepresented are excluded it seems like it's valid Asian Americans right now as it looks like Harvard\nAdmissions policies are discriminating against Asian Americans systematically keeping their numbers lower it's hard to say what Microsoft ... looks like a sort of how it affected me but I think the interesting thing is to look at it on the aggregate and how the Asian American population has been increasing in an ac rapidly\nBut the amount of Asia and I can admit it to Harvard has been saying around the phone I have yes\nSo they have the idea that the students don't mind that speak to Gregory Davis who's a grad student at Harvard or an who's in favor of the affirmative action as it stands Gregory thanks for coming on what's your reaction when you hear arguments such as those just made by Kenny ...\nA ... a her stance makes a lot of sense and I am happiness she's here um but I think she's mistaken about what the point of affirmative action in support of affirmative action is not as she said to\nMake a underrepresented groups uh be more pressing the point of affirmative action\nIs to increase diversity of course the benefits of diversity one\nThing that's been does not have been talked about as much in this\nLawsuit is what it means to have a critical mass\nHere at Harvard and many other colleges and universities are across the country there are a critical masses and quite frankly Asian students um don't have to walk on campus I feel like they're necessarily represent those are the group um or that they have to speak for every person from that background on this is particularly true of Chinese\nStudents are are students have Chinese backgrounds\nFor African Americans for working on Americans for indigenous Americans is is not so this is simply not okay so you're\nScreaming on W. E. N. pointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation in the town on the master's program\nAt the end news dot edu slashed I I I\nThere are necessarily represent those are the group um or that they have to speak for every person from that background I'm this is particularly true of Chinese\nUm students are are students have Chinese background\nHowever for African Americans for Latino Americans for indigenous Americans is is not this is simply not\nOkay so you're saying that even ways affirmative action as it currently works in in in most areas of higher education I mean you just tell us about your experience but just before you're ... you were UCLA among other complications to this fact is is that in California\nAffirmative action isn't allowed so what was the effect on the view of walking into class being one of the very few African Americans I presume ... that's how you felt\nOh absolutely and it was the case um I entered into a class of about two hundred and fifty are entering law students and I was one of twelve African Americans um this is\nAnd the state of California which\nIs as much more than just a four percent or ... or ... three or four percent African American and this was in an environment in which I was you know in classes or what their painting highly intellectual and highly social issues that involve things like race um in history\nAnd I was one of two African American men in the room this how the huge effect on my ability to um\nTo judge the issues to be able to voice my opinion without feeling like I was speaking on behalf of everyone\nI I can see that so it becomes it becomes personalized it becomes emotional and of course what you'll you'll have to study principles and argue about a sort of intellectual facts are without being muddied in that way [noise]\nI Wish that was the case yeah unfortunately it very rarely happen that\nWay for example in your class with and not one or two Asian or a Chinese and Marilyn how did we should define them or have failed Reggie managed to establish numbers in the education system that means that they have support an critical mass of that kind\nI Believe they do now this is not to say that there aren't underrepresented sub groups within an Asian Americans are among the means uh south east Asian Pacific Islanders students are absolutely underrepresented um in all facets of higher education but if we're going to talk about Asian Americans a\nAs a general group um they're representing well both at schools that don't practice in front of accident and I argue schools that do\nAnd why would that be\nI think has a lot to do with the caliber students applying um the number of students applying\nUm and what are they decide to Atlanta applications are obviously I I think it makes a lot since a lot of Asian Americans apply to harbor um one interesting fact about this entire lawsuit that was not discussed as much\nAs that I'm twenty two percent of the entering class of Harvard every year or roughly\nAs Asian Americans but also twenty two percent of the application pool is Asian every\nWeld they ... up affirmative action two sides of the student argument is now given that is being taken to the court case are taken to court or against Harvard University at the moment I should say as a little bit of background in this um many places um and you had that for example California actually bans affirmative action\nBut ... as a private institution or because of the state level and under its own a constitution decides that they want to do that that's why they go ahead and do it\nIt's a private institution that they can make that goes on you know lessen the\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free

state level and under its own a constitution decides that they want to do that that's why they go ahead and do it and\nIt's if it's a private institution there they can make\nThat goes on the last movie that you have to be in a state where you can have affirmative action uh and uh many people are interpreting this is a really significant court cases over the legality of affirmative action in many of the ... not just in the academic\nSphere and I'm a there's lots of accusations about who's on behalf of whom and\nNow the Trump Administration which had been reducing American overseas assistance has now announced a new agency the international development finance corporation it's going to provide loans and insurance companies that want to invest in Africa\nAnd counted Chinese influence Ruben Brady was US ambassador to the African Union is this new agency about delivering aid to Africa or about investment\nI think it's in the early about recognizing the current reality of Africa or which is that Africa is not a place that it was twenty five years ago in terms of a a place there are there are many states that are fragile where there are\nNo it was a massive pandemic disease and\nAnd where there is a need for a massive humanitarian intervention certainly aspects of that exists but what does also changed is that there are you know seven to ten fastest growing economies of the world or an African ... fastest growing economy are in the world is Ethiopia\nA which is something that uh those that would remember the famine at like maybe four or would find quite surprising\nSome uh some you know nearly a delay thirty five years later so this new development finance corporation is recognizing the reality\nOf that the future of Africa wise in private sector led economic grow a and I think it also recognizes a the the desire to the United states to play a significant role in that regard\nOr what sort of companies will be interested in taking advantage of the help of the development finance corporation who are we going to see looking at African Business then\nWell I I very much hope we will see large American infrastructure uh companies sort of the ... or ... or\nA help to build American roads airports are the ports et cetera I suspect that we'll see I'm an American I'm a white manufacturing everything from a consumer goods electronics to 'em or other sorts of your peril things of that nature that can be a bill\nOr in in Africa and then shipped to the United states or other export markets are\nVery competitive labor costs a mile so I'm frankly hope that we will see a substantial growth of American health care companies as well\nUh uh that will be able to invest a not a way out of a charitable but also the for profit basis or to help develop or help tourism et cetera because of\nHow will the off or the American office of the confidence look different to the Chinese one because\nUh critics say that the Chinese model ends up settling African countries recipients with a great deal of debt and not much in return for the infrastructure\nOn the other hand many African governments around the please not to hear a constant west in an American going on about governance and rights and those kind of things which the Chinese um understand around the less concerned with so\nFree to explore free to pursue the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh
