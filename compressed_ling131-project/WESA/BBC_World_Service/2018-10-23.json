must see the tourists from around the world and in many African countries the abundance of wildlife brings in the business is a huge amounts of revenue for much of it is under threat\nIn addition to well known problems like poaching of logging a new study has revealed the menu for confidence protected areas such as national parks are mostly underfunded Jenny middle of the University of California is a co will so it's a study\nAbout Ninety percent of protected areas with lions are underfunded it's a pretty dire situation we found that these parks require\nBetween one to two billion dollars annually in order to adequately protect lands but they receive only me about three hundred and eighty million dollars annually and so that's just about ten to twenty percent of what's needed\nSocial fool or just another part of the most protected areas and went over a billion dollars across the continent\nThat's correct I'm not going to change anytime soon as it\nNo in fact it may get to be a higher number as lions continue to decline in the pressures on protected areas become worse but it's not all bad news because it's only one point two billion dollars I mean relatively\nTwice as much on the management of its national park system or you know that might be equivalent to a purchasing a U.S up all team like the Detroit Lions so relatively small cost we really can save lions and their ecosystems\nAnd secure the backbone of Africa's parts\nIn the report you make the link or that if there isn't a major increase in funding that will be a decline in the population of lines that were you focus your social minds why what's the link\nSo because lions are the top predator in the ecosystem\nAnd so their survival is linked to the entire food Web all their stuff as well as a solo them so they're basically a proxy for the overall health of the ecosystem and we know that strong resilient ecosystems benefit people directly through ecosystem benefits like clean water\nHealthy soils and so saving protected areas saving wildlife is actually saving people it's an investment in people as well\nBut my assumption would be to this um the funding for talks he's a long term problem and yet the lines are still there yeah\nFried ... free to pursue the truce Monday point five double your yogurt Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nThere now at a tipping point for their species so unless we act now they're species will continue to decline and so that's why we feel like the timing of this study is particularly\nUseful because we are at that tipping point the actions we take now will determine the future of the lions and they're larger ecosystem\nBut will cause is used to be bought now as opposed to five years ago ten years ago\nWell I have decreased about forty percent in the last few decades and so we're really at that at that point where you know their populations have declined to the point where ecologically speaking they're just gonna keep heading south when a fishing it reaches a certain point in their population there's really just no turning back\nSo we feel like we're at the point now where there are still enough independent populations that are resilient enough and strong enough and there's enough protected areas which is what we focus on that have good populations of lions that if we invest now we're going to prevent falling off the cliff\nAnother argument you made in the report is saying there's a case for investing developments from doing in protecting parks now if I'm In charge of advocating looks or money for development on thinking first of all hell for ... some schools no better funding for talk so how'd you regret cars\nRight that is because a lot of people don't associate conservation with benefits to people and so they tend to invest in human focused development like infrastructure\nLike education but really investment in parks with wildlife is investment in people because of the benefits ecosystems and human health but also tourism so it's important to realize that the wildlife watching industry in sub Saharan Africa generates an estimated thirty four billion dollars annually prism\nMore broadly has
