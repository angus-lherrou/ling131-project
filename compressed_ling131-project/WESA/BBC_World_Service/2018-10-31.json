press\nSmall problem and one that has been exaggerated I think that you see cases here are cases there there might be a county here or a county there where it's very problematic but the kind of widespread fraud where president Donald Trump says\nThree million people have voted illegally that just doesn't occur and so I I think there\nHas been a pretty committed movement of people on the conservative Republican side of the aisle who have exaggerated this threat for political purposes and had made it seem a much more widespread in severe than it actually is\nBut if you accept as a problem with voter fraud even if it's possible and spread out truly need to do something about it\nI think it's a very very very small problem and there are targeted solutions to the problem but I think rewriting all of American election laws is not a targeted solution a lot more people have been prevented from voting and fraudulent votes cast\nThat there are many many more people that are being blocked from the polls that have voted illegally and I think you have to scrutinize all of those cases very clearly to see if if there was actually\nFraud and and there's been a lot of really wild claims that have been made by people like Hans von Spakovsky so the bigger problem is that a lot of people can't participate in the election or choose not to or to sway from participating because of barriers that have been erected to the ballot box of what evidence do you have\nThat they actually do I think there's been a lot of study there's been numerous studies that have found for example that\nVoter ID laws reduce voter turnout and that they reduce voter turnout most sharply among young voters the first time voters voters of color these are studies that have been done by\nAcademics in states like Wisconsin these are studies that have been done nationally\nBy government agencies and places like Kansas and Tennessee I think if you look at the intent of Republicans have claimed many different occasions that these laws have helped them politically that have helped him carry key swing states like Wisconsin for example I and\nI think it also just makes sense that you know if you reduce people's access to the process that fewer people that are going to participate\nBut also the last election in North Carolina the state board of elections did a careful review and they found ...

I Would disagree with that for this reason when you think about our immigration policy it's always been embedded in a larger context\nIf you look in the Eighteen hundreds for example the early Eighteen hundreds\nThat was a time when the birth rate in the Arab states with about seven per woman it was an extraordinarily prolific birth rate compared to today and that really made the context very different because immigration was not a hugely important part of population change in the United states and Europe\nIf you look at later you're us this was still a time when the journey to the United states was arduous and you did not have instantaneous communication\nThere are many different changes another is that you used to have an enormous appetite for low skilled workers who could fuel the growth of the manufacturing sector the agricultural sector which needed desperately needed large numbers of new body is if you look at a post industrial knowledge intensive highly urbanized economy\nThen the situation is quite different and it creates new class stratification\nEntail new social programs and that also mean that we have different pressures and challenges when it comes to integrating folks\nWho come from very low income very deprived background so I think that when you think about the story of American immigration it's important to remember that it was always changing it was always evolving in response to larger global economic changes\nRe ... Saddam editor of the national review conservative magazine in the U. S. curbing immigration as he suggests would spell the end of a classic American narrative that is at the Pentagon is immigrant who arrives to seek a new life and through hard work determination goes on to cross the and thrive\nSo would that be a dramatic change to America's history of immigration after all the United states is often described as ... the largest immigrant population in the world\n[noise] it's a question I put two of these that Trump ski she's professor of history at Salem State University in Massachusetts\nYou look at the history of integration and how immigrants who've been treated in the United states you see a big change happening after the civil war\nPrior to the civil war citizenship was restricted to white people in the United states it was our racial citizenship and immigration grants were welcome to that is white people were welcomed there were no restrictions on immigration at all\nBut the restrictions were placed on citizenship\nFree to pursue it for free to explore we're Ninety point five W E essay whispers NPR News the sound of a free friends\nWorking class people from Africa who were enslaved and brought here who did the manual labor the agricultural labor but they were not eligible for citizenship and they were not considered immigrants\nSo when we say this has always been a country of immigrants it's really a very racialized narrative and it's connected to labor and the idea that white people are citizens and people of color are workers to be exploited and not eligible to citizenship\nNow after the civil war African Americans are granted citizenship citizenship by birth is created\nAnd this is when we start seeing restrictions on immigration and these restrictions are absolutely racialized the purpose of them is to prevent workers of color from becoming citizens so we have huge categories of people defined as racially ineligible to citizenship\nAnd they are not allowed to immigrate in order to prevent them from gaining citizenship by birth\nThat would imply that the American dream is a myth\nIt's a very racialized myth that is it's been a dream for white immigrants it's extreme that was created for white immigrants and the people of color have always been excluded from\nThat in that sense what President Trump is doing today is not really that much different than what happened previously\nNo it's not and I think that we make a mistake when we talk about the idea of the American dream and the myth of upward mobility that this is something that when we look over the nineteenth of twenty of centuries\nHave applied to primarily to European immigrants we look at the period of the late Nineteen to the early twentieth century of large European immigration where this suppose it American Dream was created\nThis was not a period of the American dream for Mexican immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for Chinese immigrants it was not a period of the American dream for immigrants from Africa\nNow people of color have also accepted this mythology that is the idea that the United states has a country of opportunity the American dream but if you look at how the economy functions today it is still heavily reliant on the exploited labor of people of color\nThe immigrants who are coming into the country today it's a bifurcated immigration that is there is a very elite immigration of highly educated uh people in technology but the majority of immigrants do not\nFall into that category the majority of immigrants are poor low educational levels and they are filling a very important role in the U.S service economy there are jobs for them but there is not upward mobility for them\nI have a bean a theory in American immigration history when the opportunities for say an Asian or African or a Latin American immigrant with the same as those for European no there have even more recent on\nThat doesn't mean that there has never been Asian or Latin American or African immigrants who have succeeded in gaining upward mobility and I'm becoming very successful in the United states but if you look at it that historically those populations have been permanently marginal\nI'm clear that your own a different and the political spectrum to Ron salon the editor of the national review who had from the other what do you make of his ...\nThat in order to safeguard democracy in America at the moment and to allow the current population to adapt to changing economy will needed is a cook on immigration because what is happening is that the economy in America
