experiments where where simulating the earth as we see it right now\nAnd we run another parallel experiment in which we simulate the earth before we have climate change okay so what we do there and simulating before climate changes we make estimation of what we think the climate may have looked like prior to humans producing an effect\nAnd we compare those those sets of simulations to one

will be Hurricane Florence which wrote so much damage in the Carolinas just a few weeks back\n\nWell\n\nIn last week's program climatologist Michael Mann explains the central ways in which climate change should exacerbated the events but as the hurricane season started his models was suggesting we I think there's something wrong with a comma\nLet me issue in the ... Copa because our group was one of numerous groups that predicted a fairly\nInactive Atlantic hurricane season in that production was based on the fact that sea surface temperatures in the western Atlantic into tropical and some tropical western Atlantic where these orange tend to strengthen\nThose temperatures were not unusually warm we were headed and still are probably headed into an El Nino event and it turns out when you're headed into an El Nino event and that usually leads to wind patterns more wind shear in the atmosphere that's adverse for the formation of these storms\nSo for those reasons basically all the groups including our own a predicted an average to slightly less than average Atlantic hurricane season but at woke up in a hurry and what happened is we got an ... heat wave this extreme warming of several degrees Celsius over a large part of the western Atlantic\nThat warm is what these storms feed on so all else being equal if you really warm up those already warm tropical in sub tropical ocean temperatures than you are likely to see more and more intense hurricanes and that's what happened\nEven before forest made landfall ... rage with scale for wins the Atlantic sunk clinics But Kevin read at Stony Brook University in the U.S did a rapid attribution assessment\nKey findings was that in the forecast simulations that we did which are very similar to a

saw that with and without a climate change signaling the model that the area where um there was a most pacification overland after impact of the storm was fifty percent increased due to climate change\nComes very interesting that the description is different from the kind of description I find from friday also which is as a great to likelihood of this kind of event ... this is very specifically giving a number to the amount that the strength of the event is being changed\nYes so what we're doing is slightly different than looking at what was the probability of at the Ventura occur our approach is different because we have an event that is occurring and so we have a storm that is in\nThe north Atlantic that is bearing down on the east coast and so our probability of occurrence right now is is one and we're trying to look at if we can attribute any part of the characteristics are intensity of that storm as it makes landfall to climate change\nBecause as Michael Mann has already explained it was the enormously Atlantic temperatures the field the hurricane I was curious how in in that tradition you could pinned down the Pacific ocean changes to the effect of global warming\nSo we basically are able to calculate the increase in the sea surface temperature and that's been something that that's an estimated as part of path research by climate scientists and that pattern isn't uniform overall the ocean even in the north Atlantic and so they're warmer areas and cooler area but basically we were able to account for that\nDifference between what the temperature would have been without greenhouse gases warming and were able to remove that large scale signal from our forecast initialized ... so that when we run these modify forecasts without climate change a large part of it is due to the reduction\nIn the sea surface temperature and the north Atlantic which is about point eight degrees Celsius\nAs well as changes that have had on the atmosphere temperature as well as an affair temperature changes that have a choice during the atmosphere\nTo me that's very interesting because global warming is more than just the general warming everywhere and a belief that particularly in the north Atlantic they are very specific ... that's ... associated with greenhouse gases\nYeah absolutely and so that's something in our analysis that we account for so we're not just doing a uniform or changing of the tea we actually have the pattern change of the F F T that comes from the fact that\nThe climate system as a lot more complex than everywhere just increasing or decreasing by a uniform temperature and so that that characterization that you just mentioned is something that has actually included in the set up\nThese patents have geographical variation to less is look under the bonus of climate change so to speak the engine parts that are driving some of the new extremes they said the interest Michael Mann\nParticularly in the
