give in to a reality that I Believe would be bad for my children and I have four of them and in fact I warn them I say to them you have\nTaken for granted pace on this continent because it's there nothing is a given and my biggest worry and I do some that are within sometimes is that we will squander put the European Union\nDid which was developed ... on the continent of Europe for the idea that you can have your own individual policy or you can be a popular when all you have to do is say something but not take the responsibility for us I take responsibility for what I Do and what I say\nAnd I hope that in the European Parliament elections we talk about you are I'm not national issue because they tend to be a button\nAnd I appreciate you all historical perspective but here's a question from a man widely respected around your Pasco Lyman former commission without change and reform the eating you will remain\nAs it is today in his view it relevant to a majority of its citizens that it was an extraordinarily worried that calling from uh Europe file\nYeah it is worrying I mean you can wear yourself to death he used to do something with us I mean the first part where he's saying reform and of course that's essential I mean the thing about being a rather than just hold on a second in art and for example many of us took for granted the single market customs and without understanding what's meant his breakfast\nRight across Europe because of the debate people are beginning to understand the single market the customs union\nHow drugs or regulation chemicals

stuff that Europe does but frankly and I was a journalist no media is interested in the good things and you're right to focus on all of that and that is difficult and needs to be challenged because that's my job to do that but it not time it's no harm to remind people that would do\nThe European Union would my country be we would not be at the table but we had he's get respect them have a word

the safety margins it would've been familiar with in the past so in other words the performance that we say is excellent\nThe issue is trying to make that happen over a long period of time since ...\nProfessor Steve right will pioneers in the industry say these limitations could yet be fixed a new generation of batteries in the next year or two could do\nScreaming on WGN pointed Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation to to the town on a master's program\n... dot edu flash I I I\nHave a bunch of stock top ... era uh playing it safe for now using ... technology to power that threatens\nWe're working on both battery based solutions because we've got a lot of expertise with batteries but we're also very focused on hybrid electric solutions where you've got an on board generator and the reason for that is really to allow our customers who are the aircraft manufacturers\nTo not have to design for the batteries of now but rather designed for the batteries that we may have ten or Twenty years from now\nAnd then use the hybrid system as a bit of a proxy for what that battery will be and what that allows us to do is really get these aircraft into surface safely and reliably right now or as soon as possible and then upgrade the batteries as soon as the battery technology is there\nDescribe who is in this game\nIt's really a combination of the major multibillion dollar aerospace companies then you've got a lot of interest from these very large scale aerospace companies in the ... that can absolutely you're thinking of the right people\nAnd then you've also got a lot of interest from New start ups that are taking new angles to developing these aircraft and new business models actually where you know the traditional aerospace companies if you will are mostly looking at providing aircraft\nSome of these start up companies are looking at being vertically integrated where they developed the aircraft but also operate the service for example so they combine airline and aircraft manufacturer\nRegulation it's the big one isn't it particularly in big western cities how soon can we expect any of the regulators to say okay you're good to go you can fly across New York\nOr London or Paris if you're talking about a piloted aircraft let's say it's not so much an air taxi but maybe an Airbus although not the Airbus that's in Europe you worry of maybe a pilot and four to six passengers on board\nThere is a road map for that right now and with the technologies that we have right now what I expect to see is you're going to see the highlighted versions of these aircraft and the ones using hybrid electric power train like the ones that very goes developing\nHit the market first and then you're going to see an evolution over the long term as autonomy technologies come into play eventually as new battery technology has come into play and the diversity of aircraft types that grows\nWe took about taxes I think the taxi is going to be picking me up from my office and taking me to my home I mean that does human believed in the first thing we're going to see with this kind of new model\nThat's correct you're not really talking about flying to and from your house you're more talking about flying let's say from London Heathrow to the city center or from JFK Airport in New York to Manhattan directly places where you have large amounts of traffic congestion\nAnd if you think it's a nice traffic choked cities in the world a lot of them are in the developing world on that you use it might have been also they have passed laws regulations that that they are the most likely places to see this kind of technology says\nOh absolutely and we're seeing a lot of interest in cities like Delhi Mumbai Bangkok Sao paulo Mexico City and it's really interesting because all of us in this industry are actually watching the Sao paulo market very carefully\nRight now today and so although there are hundreds of helicopters operating to and from hundreds of HeLa ports on top of the buildings around the city and so this type of transportation model isn't something that's theoretical it actually already exists in one city busy\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station I have a free press\nYourselves in the cities where\nOkay my flight was late getting there and I really need to get to a meeting in the city center and at that point it's very easy decision to say I'm going to put this on my expense report I Need to get there now on those few times a year when you really need to get somewhere there's really valuable to you to get up and over the traffic how soon\nAre we going to see this revolution you're describing so I think we're going to see the early services around twenty twenty five and all ... out by saying that I think those are going to be the piloted aircraft it's perhaps more like a bus and lots of like a taxi\nOr going to see a few cities in the world where you're going to start to have service let's say from the major international airport\nTwo two or three of the major business centers around the city so that you've you've started to deliver this rapid transportation option and then it just starts to grow from there\nEvery batch of vertigo arrow hair on business day from the BBC\nThat really for the new tech will be when these flying drones but come\nOn just a

hardware and ride sharing tech but I'm\nAlso is investing millions of dollars in infrastructure in lobbying Steve tape it says there's a public relations effort underway to persuade ordinary citizens that this could be that future transport model as well\nI mean they're doing a great job in galvanizing industry employing everybody together to go after a common goal to get air taxi ride sharing on parity with owning a car which allow it's a brilliant goal and they've got a lot of technical hurdles to get there but really but realistic\nUh you know people would argue with the realism but even if they're close you know there are still going to be people that have a meeting across town and there's going to be no other way to get there and they'll spend the extra money to to make that meeting and so I think that there's a market there even if it's not on price parity with owning a car\nThere are technical hurdles not just safety but also noise and other things and simply finding places in big cities to land I guess but it's going to start in Europe and America where's it going to start somewhere else where about half the regulatory hurdles so that's why\nI think probably the number one city in my estimation is is Hong Kong right it's water water bound in super crowded and there's a lot of money there and it just a natural fit\nYou know a lot of islands to jump over ... less dangerous for that reason because I mean you're not going to crash onto onto a house if you did come down\nRight over the water most of the time but you know if you look around the world a lot of a lot of the most popular city to live in our water bound so there's an application for this type of transportation\nSays it's hyping top pilot flying taxis and a number of western cities Los Angeles Dallas New York or Paris as soon as twenty twenty five\nBut is that actually unrealistic sheds you'll give them the technical and psychological obstacles we're gonna have to become a professor Steve right from the University of the west of England well is this the worry first time we have an accident which can be attributed to a machine\nAs you can imagine people kind of release their minds to pay it\nAnd say we're getting very very carefully because one major accident and they could shut this down in an afternoon it's a real worry and stops providing pulls facility for the rest of the
