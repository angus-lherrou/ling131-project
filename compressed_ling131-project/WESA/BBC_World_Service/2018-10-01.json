La Nina setting and the other matching the twenty eighth team was going to be comma\nEvery year has some extremes the world is a big place after all about so many my impressions being that this is remarkable\nThough that impression is absolutely correct and that's what made some are twenty Eighteen so unique and so unprecedented\nThis is Michael Mann director of a system science center at Penn State university\nIt wasn't just that there were these regional extremes in heat waves floods wildfires droughts um it was sort of the large scale\nCoherence to these events where they were breaking out around the entire northern hemisphere and there's some interesting connections there that may hint at certain aspects of climate change and how climate changes impacting extreme weather events that aren't actually well captured in the climate models yet\nMichael Mann is well known as the author of the original hockey stick jobs a gr off tossing global average temperatures over the centuries and revealing the dramatic increases in recent decades the ... was released Twenty years ago in Nineteen Ninety eight yes fired up by another dramatic El Nino event\nBut which now ranks at least ... among annual average is a ... degree behind twenty sixteen\nBut Michael Mann admits that these global averages Ernie parts of the climate story and not the pop that matters to us\nToo often we take a narrow view and I say we\nSort of climate scientists and in our efforts to communicate to science to the public into policymakers too often we take this narrow view that climate is about averages and yet we expect average temperatures on earth to continue to increase and\nThat has huge ramifications for global sea level rise for melting of ice sheets et cetera but climate\nMore generally refers to the statistics of the weather and the statistics can be the average is because averages are statistics but it can also be the extremes\nAnd so it is relevant from the standpoint of climate to talk about how many are logical extremes are changing and indeed as you allude to that's where the rubber hits the road um when it comes to\nYou know people becoming aware and concerned about the impact of climate change uh there's no greater way to connect the dots than to help them understand that these extreme events that are impacting us now it isn't just about polar bears up in the Arctic it's about\nUnprecedented heat and floods and drought and wildfires that are impacting us that are unfolding in real time on our television screens in our newspaper headlines that is the face of climate change this is the face of climate change\nNevertheless I thought it was to be cautious weather of some kind of group does happen every year\nYou know right let one entail what Iran is not necessarily harming our what we can say the reason why won't do any of them are\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nDoes the face of climate change\nAnd that's what it wants to be cautious weather of some kind of drove does happen every year\nYou write that one and it entail what Iran is not necessarily harming our what we can say the reason why do you attribute any of them are\nAnd I think this summer and it's right to say this is something different something that you can be quite rare and is now ready to call in and then\nNot just the fact that there were heat waves and droughts and floods and wildfires we expect those to become more frequent around the world\nAs the world warms up a world warms up well of course you're going to get more intense and long lived here it's of heat to heat waves the atmosphere gets warmer can hold more moisture so when it does rain you get more of it at once you get bigger floods at the same time those warmer temperatures cause more evaporation from soils you get worse droughts you take\nExtreme drought you combine it with extreme heat\nYou're going to get wildfires so this is science there is pretty basic as I've said before it isn't rocket science as we say here in the states but what is interesting is that there may be something more than just those factors those factors we understand they're fairly well captured in the models\nWhat isn't well captured in the models is defective climate change may be impacting the behavior of the northern hemisphere jet stream\nIn a way that actually causes these weather systems to become larger in ... and to get stuck in place\nChanges in the ... jet stream wins one reason the Europe stood baking for so many weeks they also put another high over Siberia with high heat that and over North America\nWhere the most dramatic effects were extensive wildfires in British Columbia Canada and in California west seasonal conditions on combating a multi year drought says Michael Mann\nCalifornia it's getting warmer and warmer it's warmest summers have been the last few years um is getting\nA drier and drier in part because those weather systems are getting pushed to the north denying it the winter precipitation that would help suppress\nUm those summer droughts are so you know you've got a drying conditions you got warmer conditions and all of that uh feeds into the potential for worst wildfires and what we saw happen for I Would say the first time\nWas the disappearance of the notion of a fire season used to be that summers fire season to California Winter isn't\nNow California appears to have a perpetual fire season because the worst wildfire it ever had seen as of last winter was the Thomas wildfire last winter in Southern California\nOnly this summer did we see an even worse wildfire in in the Mendocino Complex fire northern California and some of the other wildfires that broke out so California now has in essence a perpetual fire season and that is indication of the\nThe profound challenged the climate changes already posing\nTo us\nThan I Am now I have ... the largest fire forty now bigger than the

storms\nIn some parts of California we had a hundred and eighty percent of normal for graft production so I think a lot of fire people were thinking\nYou know that's just isn't looking good and all it's going to take is an ignition on the right day with the right whether to cause a real problem and so when the Carr Fire started I was over here I live on the coast and then buffered from some of the hot weather and things like that but\nPretty immediately that fire was raising hairs and my husband actually went over and worked on that fire and um I I think we we're all feeling tension that we're not used to feeling around fire in California we've had it you know the last\nTen years we've had unprecedented fires almost every every year every other year but the Carr Fire felt different\nThe Carr Fire affecting a major residential term walls in itself Turner find but the big one was the fire in Mendocino hills actually a pair of funds that started on July the twenty seventh and ... only finally confirmed extinguished last week\nThere was the ranch fire and the river fire and those were burning nearer to each other on the north and west sides of clear lake which is one of the largest lakes in California\nIt was during the height of the summer so the hottest days over a hundred degrees solid winds blowing to those areas is just all the right conditions for fast fire spread and extreme fire behavior and so the spiders grew so quickly\nThey were sometimes burning twenty thousand acres in a twenty four hour period or or more maybe\nThat the rate of growth made it very difficult for Cruz to to get a handle on it and they ended up burning four hundred and ten thousand acres and I we all have heard that that's the biggest fire in California history I think that the next biggest was last year in Southern California at two hundred and eighty thousand acres so\nA very large area\nOf course is not just being heat waves and fires while California bunt in Canada

all of this is full will China actually deliver on the dream of showing and the new green city Professor Yoo and saw him again from the University of North Carolina\nThis is a really top down planning project in that practically the has high profile\nYou have studied over the last two or three decades all of the range of these infrastructure project caliphate yeah and there's another one isn't it a port in northern China champion by Hu Jintao or a former prime yet but it's come to nothing I mean there have been white elephants as well as success stories in China\nYeah tell the din wants to become an ecological zero is sort of an emission poster child but it didn't really succeed are there are many reasons behind it\nBut the shoreline this case just keep in mind that we didn't the next couple of years I think the government definitely has the capacity to relocate many of the state owned businesses\nTo this new area so it's a little bit different from the other big new projects in China this one is really really top down\nPrevent the young film and that report came out a year ago no much seem to be happening just then since those days are the government has issued more plans for the development prove that does seem to remains slow though\nIn Jersey City planner folks on a new district uh he he's so he's the city the plan I mean she he said that they will range of

basically this is the point is that the China has this record has done for twenty thirty forty years it's been to spend its way through rocky times it will spend money on the big planning projects and it's gained a large dividend out of doing that\nIt has a historically um something changed in a two thousand they actually use the financial crisis in the west started to send ripples through China\nUm and uh it was actually a time when the Chinese economy itself was actually going through a little bit of its own kind of tipping point\nSo really what's happening in the last ten years in

is about the missile allocation of capital in the short term which actually can lead to you know empty apartment blocks go cities and I'm actually quite all of the problem\nAnd it can also lead a goal is to a huge amounts of public debt where how biggies Chinese public debt\nWell uh it is about ... at the end of two thousand Seventeen was around three hundred and fifty percent of its national
