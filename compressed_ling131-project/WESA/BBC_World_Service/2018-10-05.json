Norwegian oil and gas which is an industry buddy\nAnd their Christ office and associate professor of political joke of the University of Trump's they will come see will I Want to begin by asking each of you how strong would you say a new ways green credentials\nCarry it into the ... well I Do believe\nThat although we have the oil industry and that we are exporting a lot of oil and gas our green credentials are quite a significant and should be taken into account especially I Want to mention\nWas the various political parties have done the wreck or several years transforming that the um transportation secretary that we have here in in our way\nAnd we have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across the highway and that's something that I Believe that we should be quite proud of Ken Goodman\nYeah that's a very uh special area on the whole lot of volleyball courts so do you think the tipping point as far as public opinions can said no I mean it's quite a nice you know because we have a political ... from other government where we have\nTo agree to let this area and be left as it is but it's very important that we have activity on the other parts of the of the country because\nWe produce a lot of oil and gas that's are very important for the European production of electrical power\nAnd the is actually part of making Europe more green\nGay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe screened battery than region hydro power in the region hydropower is one tenth in energy of what we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from Norway it will be other countries will take place in Europe I don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and and just relax and said sit back and say that nobody will replace it of course it will be replaced and\nCarry the cascades NASA view that shed by much of the new age in public that actually better that new way does this we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from Norway we take it out cleaning from the ground and where the good guys none\nI think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in a way over the past\nTwenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in LA\nAnd what we're seeing now is the ticket shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big energy transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being depended on ... ... in in many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of renewable energy and that's a whole new transition that we are\nDreaming on double you say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nDig energy transition now from fossil fuels and being depended on importing ... in in many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of renewable energy and that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in the right person it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets to which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far\nAs you can sense should the new ... new exploration licenses for it in places like the ... seats in the up\nTo I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about here because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing and twenty seven\nTwenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero climate guess ...\nWell I think we have to see it on the great escape because if you're going to shut down all the power pounced based on coal in the works\nBut I don't know oh yeah we're talking about oh yeah\nBut my point is that if you have replaced coal plants root for example gas or even oil\nThat will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener re first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving toward agree in this society I'm totally agreeing with that but we have to do it in a way that actually it's yeah ...\n... Christopher in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense and driven the Baron said because actually it might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than say many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited how long are camped here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the tragedy and we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw on the ... when I was next sense and and I came back a few years later and my mother told me in Seattle that now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I thought so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said\nNo China should do something about it because they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in office for last week and that was at the summary of the whole conference\nEvil thing that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students I when I talk to them today and pulled them out what's going on and say well we are the richest country in the world why can't we afford making a plan to get our fault that feels good sunny stuff\nWould look at the time frame\nBecause college but says well it could be draining until twenty Seventy yeah it will and it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency does have to still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers and they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of Norway globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nAbsolutely Energy Agency they say that still in twenty fifty\nOne third of the energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers and they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of Norway globally so we have to replace production until we're able to\nMake shift without it and remember that is based if we go to do a big big job we do to increase renewables about six thousand percent another huge huge job ... ... on on how well do you want to just to mention also\nThat we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this looks true we're not going to reach the climate targets the Paris Agreement the target is that you know it's not yeah and and we've been debating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut he's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how far they've seen bills how fast new investments are being made into when you've all energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil in competition with the whole as a politician and in a country like no way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself is green\nIt's still difficult to sell this idea is\nHow does anybody else can I buy and\nWell it's difficult in a way that it's become easy I've I've been working environmentalists should for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment then\nIt's become you see here but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and important to understand that why why do you think that well because we have been producing country for so long and it's so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves and it's been I mean a lot of people has been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince them that\nWe have to look on what are our options what are the renewables\nFor example where are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our airplanes to make their more renewable\nBut where do you have to do so well uh you get to perhaps if you're lucky from or organic waste and it's part of the circle but ah if not you have to produce it by making some of our Lance part of\nThe ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf you want to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry\nAnd we see that the ... that's called at the new now they changed their name it's part of the stresses they because they understand they are also part of the green shift so my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green is a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more\nGreen gay or at the same time we have to address CCS since his view because carbon capture and storage on carbon capture and use it as both a central themes in the transition into\nThe ... down of which have successfully than no trial with ... again it's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to this is one of the great things that we could use\nFree to pursue the re to

to\nThis is one of the great things we could use our universe dues for the ... from the burned sees like ... on the other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere's a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we are carry you wants to\nCome back and see the ads is definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway ... effort political party actually agree on is just ... yeah what we need cash or sorry it's essentially\nThe idea that you could somehow take a call them for the environment and and put it away the underground or\nUnder the ... yeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now and I think the technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable\nAnd making it possible for companies ... and the government didn't know what our shifting government suspend quiet all of a lot of money to try to make that tough but fair is\nGetting down to the details again and the south has been focused on in our right for Twenty years I think the also an to challenge to politicians here with a greater sense because I don't think when you were saying the solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm it's doing to climate change is if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nIf you're export the power you don't use it for industrial production in no way and that's the discussion above your work about where you live what you're going to do it's a problem\nThere is I just want to come with an axe awful again and we have this island big island outsider call Sam now which is very beautiful and it has a lot of seafood production and it's expected to increase for two hundred percent in terms of how much power the need for all this new production\nAnd we're working there with the local uh energy company here are the regional and we're actually looking at put together with the communities and the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for a couple of solar power will be beneficial and I think it's kind of way so creating viable energy future it's it's really the way to go if you can see how it benefits their own society if they think more locally and regionally about the way we signed\nUp with energy I don't think we will be in that situation that he's growing up with that we have to pay so much more for the energy I think actually we can make really good energy future it's here\nI'm interested all these solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nYeah I should think that we should find certain area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries and what we've done in they\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nWell for anybody else yeah I should think that we should find certain area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing back new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical ... with creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because we're a shift nation that always seems so there because of\nAn I'm an engineer why would I Choose to ... other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because you want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security is of supply will come from renewables not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this exploration stuff we talked about some of my two developments and then to reach an architect to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries for really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway you have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of towards ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of his other it's just we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of a known in Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in the interim so I think he would rather a study of renewable energy at our university which you can\nFor other than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it can come into\nFault no no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the American business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift to even do if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expense and the amount of time sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to have money I think you've made it out there and I know but it's it it sounds like it doesn't ... sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got a good answer on to\nAll temp mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and the ... now in the end the sector\nReally happening and they just happening in other countries at the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds\nOf ... of ... new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well what a coal fired power plants absolutely but my argument is that you will see now that you and you will and that will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's a problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by\nProducing and exporting petroleum will that which brings me to another\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nBy investing in renewable energy so I mean we're gonna keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time and we already made those commitments that but this is about what kind of view do we have for Europe ... twenty states and Europe is committed to have\nSierra ... get greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector of the twenty fifth day so that's the picture that we're looking at\nI won't touch a little psycho drama for you which you may disagree with new way but it's a very poor country Nineteen sixties discovers oil becomes a very wealthy country a country that many people that ... that the way in which treats citizen says that he gets involved in international affairs and you have peace deals and so on\nIf it was on some time scale rather to withdraw from this oil and gas market there is a a big ... this country that's going to keep it wealthy but with no way somehow lose some of it stasis is no way\nAfraid that from some level that it it might become that pull relation once again you\nKnow you you you you painting a far too short picture because no it was a will for states before they all came\nNowhere made a welfare state based on industry on hydro power on maritime shipping so we may develop a state's long before we discovered oil and gas\nRemember your along the coast in Europe or the has visit only plays in Europe which hasn't been any comment during history because we're always has easy accessible ... so we built the welfare state early on we had a lot of food do you and thank God\nWe didn't have an ability we we have a terrier since I've been looking\nAt a lot at the history and one important objective that sets and an incentive to keep a moderate pace of the construction\nAnd when they hit that limit ... in Nineteen Seventy five in Nineteen eighty eight bit triple production within Fifteen Years and then the ten years afterwards the almost doubled the workforce working in the oil industry so I Would say in many ways it's sort of became patrol independent states\nThe real story and you'll put
