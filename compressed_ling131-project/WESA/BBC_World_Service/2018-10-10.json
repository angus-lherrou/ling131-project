of the policy she was echoing what Donald Trump\nSaid but equally she was a single minded person that I think it was part of a the agreement when she got the job that she could speak our minds and

same time\nOne of the things that helps us as\nA this game is translated into a lot of languages including German which is a very precise language so we will finish our rule book and we'll send a

might be illegal but it certainly heavily frowned upon and put that on the cover you just won't sell in Germany so it it'd be a thing of the culture you have to think of the language you have to think of how people played\nSo we kind of postal German ... games and things like that did not feed into the creation of cooperative games like that [noise] it fit into\nWhat were called German games in the nineties and then you're all games which was the interesting thing because of the post war fatigue and cultural sort of a version to direct conflict they added design games where you really didn't

view must be used more delicately Sam should win is the dialogue the ... the cartoonist in this case is claiming to establish to send it to many dangers do you actually are defending the rights of Muslims in Denmark not to be offended and will not defending the rights of the cartoon now\nNot on the other hand I with you on the debate I said that we have to understand that we're living in a globalized fault and if you're living in a globalized while you have to yourself what ... what do you want to have a dialogue with people\nAnd Eunice past and they said that they wanted a dialogue with Muslims and then like so if you really truly wishes a dialogue\nYou have to understand you have to ask me sensual question what is important to you and why freedom of speech is an essential value to the majority of Muslims in the world\nAnd the sacredness of the Koran is also and the Central Valley too many Muslims and the wall so we we have a group of friends who have different principles that they value at the same time so my point is that we have to understand that we have people among us who have\nA values who are essential to them at the same time so it's not a mattress as favoring the sacred that's off the crown over freedom of speech it's a matter of understanding that if you want to enter the dialogue outside the stunt that people they have different principles of what is valuable at the same time\nAnd and I I I Do a ... century ... to ... that that you are trying to find a very fine line to conduct you're working your butt but you've written a book\nOn and it's all

man who you kind of choice is a good man says that he was of Pakistani Danish origins his view of his religion was different from yours\nHe felt that you'll find for what you believed in was dangerous to your family and in the end it seems that ruined your marriage wasn't worth it yes it was worth it\nBecause I think that that so many people they want the rather than shirt they support the revolution and they want the changes but they just don't want that to alter or their wife to be ahead of the rather the ship and somebody has to be a head of the show so to me it was not a matter of choice I didn't make a choice\nBecause I placed myself a head of the revolution and it's impossible to withdraw when you're just started it\nBut that has a cost that goes beyond you your husband the
