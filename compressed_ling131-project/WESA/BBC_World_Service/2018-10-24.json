got a hundred and sixty four countries around the world all trading together it's really difficult to keep an eye on what's happening now right everything's technical now\nAnd that brings us into the second point which they need to modernize trade rules for the twenty first century so we're talking everything from digital trade\nTo international investment state owned enterprises that's code for China by the way\nUm and the third thing is that they want to safeguard and strengthen the dispute settlements system to right now it's really tedious lengthy and inefficient to try to resolve disputes between countries\nWhich is why we're in the current situation we're in which is that the United states and China are breaking the world Trade Organization rules and having their own private

to be very good at it but under US President Donald Trump we've seen him on to renegotiate the north American free trade agreement which he has recently done and he took that right to the wire he's pulled out of the Paris or he didn't want to sign up the United states the Paris climate accord he doesn't like\nInternational agreements and he says complaining that the United states spends too much on NATO for instance which isn't true by the way but he likes to say that and to paint the United states as a victim China\nSimilarly also is saying you know we're really happy to be part of the world Trade Organization but we are really against we oppose anything that's got penalize our state owned enterprises because that's a huge part of how they operate\nOne of the main functions of the WTO that have a lot of tunnels that they're looking at international trade the U.S has actually been withholding appointments to various different tunnels\nWell this is so you've got the United states and the one hand saying that you know\nWe're going to withdraw if the WTO doesn't shape up and then on the other hand making it really difficult for the world Trade Organization to function by blocking

to stop illegal so\nHe has said that we should have a heart policy but he doesn't always a carry that out in terms of showing or they clearly plane desperate situation\nThat sort of a policy line his

are not just important but that that'd be the only thing that can help them when\nDoes this reflect than a cynicism in American political culture a desperation to see somebody who is not taking money from the ...\nI think that's because there has just been assumption that it is very easy for a small number of people to donate a lot of money and then in effect by the government's what's better O'Rourke and other candidates that accept small dollar donors what they're saying is that it's possible that we can have a government that\nIs elected only by people making small donations even

that it's possible to run for president by rejecting corporate pacts and superPACs and better our work is making a very big play\nTo try to win his Senate race and he's doing that in part not just by making his campaign power by small donations but then asking those donors to become volunteers to knock on doors make phone calls in turn people out to vote\nSo this is being mobilized obviously on the one hand by the Internet the fact is you couldn't have done this ten Twenty years ago because the architecture wasn't there for people to just click and and make a quick to nation but also you're saying that the money\nIs actually only part of the strategy here it's almost like you get buy in from people financially but at the same time he's getting buy in from them in terms of boots on the

their neighbors and ask them to vote for the most remarkable things that I think better or works campaign has done\nIs they have ten different offices throughout the state of Texas that are officially

official intake points for people to come and volunteer\nAnd help turn out to vote if not just about asking for money it's not just about having people involved in the system\nHe's having his

traditional assumption of who's going to vote and nobody's going to do that until November sixth and I think that Beto O'Rourke is making a good place to try to prove the polls wrong here\nWell the fact is that everyone not just the journalist and former Democratic fundraiser Michael Whitney all watching this Texas Senate race very closely indeed this year it could be crucial to the Republicans keeping them majority or losing it\nBut despite the fundraising hype not everything is going the Democrats' way of them and\nGet out and vote in the mid term\nEnsuring our forty president Donald Trump [noise]\nThe Republicans led by the president himself have been leading their own major efforts Donald Trump remains a big fundraising drawers events like this one\nAnd anyway it is important to stress that while Democrats are raising more than they ever have before the Republican National committee's war chest has generally been better stalked from previous years\nWhich means that spending

focusing should they be spending on online advertising Michael Franz is a professor of government and legal studies through his Wesleyan Media project he tracks political advertising in the U.S\nMoney is incredibly important to winning an election because you need the money in order to buy the communications to voters and so most candidates spend a lotta time raising a lot of money in order to be able to buy advertisements and to fund all the things that needs to happen in order to reach voters\nWhere would you spend your money if you are running a campaign\nWell I Would certainly spend my money if I were running for say the U.S house on television because I Would want to reach older voters who are much more likely to vote and who are much more likely than younger voters today to watch traditional live television\nBut I also would spend a fair amount of money on a digital media so that I could reach younger voters and so that I could build email lists and donor distribution lists\nOr what digital allows a campaign to do is to target effectively and so if you want to reach particular sub groups of voters you can do that very officially with digital media\nAnd so I wouldn't want to I wouldn't want to miss that opportunity but at the same time I wouldn't want to disarm on television because that's where the most likely voters still are and probably will be for the next election or so\nJust TV advertising still work\nDoes work in the sense that if you out advertise your opponent and have more messages on TV than the other side than we've seen evidence
