E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute detailed on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu slash I I I\nAm actually feeling that no loss of privilege as outrageous though is that rather an important point age and how does it simply that the majority are finding themselves challenged by any number of minorities\nOr I think the problem is that you have on the one hand very technocratic lead spending abstract things that doesn't resonate with a very sizeable number of people on the one hand and then you have lots of minority majority responses to that and I think none of his very healthy\nIt's not healthy to engage in victim and whether you up like a wise or whether you're a venue ethnicity or any gender and sexuality whatsoever ... victims those real oppression exploitation\nBut the way to get over that is to name it as an injustice die affects everyone because it violates human dignity so it's always appealing to what we have in common ... just to say I'm a victim because I happen to be ... that\nThat doesn't have to see if you like a commonality of belief that may not exist if you think about algae Beatty writes could you have complained that you'll suffering your impression was an offense against humanity many people would have some don't recognize the address exactly in fact what the tea movement did they said look\nThis is love we love like everybody else so don't discriminate against us don't distinguish between us and that was actually realize\nThat what we ultimately wanted ... exactly the same as what ... and that's part of the reason why the movement has been so successful we agree I think all of us in this conversation but the Israel discrimination real injustice and that we want to fight against it\nBut I Do think that more and more it is also a distinction about how we visit with them will justify it would look like\nLast summer I watched a romantic comedy called the big stick\nA very nice movie which is autobiographical about a Pakistani origin American stand up comedian who falls enough with a white um outcome goal and sort of dramatic life story they have no spot is\nUm I was amazed by the way in which movie which tells in a mainstream romantic comedy a story of an interracial marriage started to be attacked from the left\nSaying what isn't it problematic that this round protecting this has to find a wide wife couldn't you have found a brown and why couldn't you found a wife who's also from Pakistan and I was struck by the idea of a sudden in that debate the writer was saying\nWho has if you find somebody who have with enough of who's of a different race we should celebrate that and was parts of the left\nBut some of food that was problematic exercise leaving me\nIs the crux of disagreement about what society we want ... I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures rather than one where everybody has to stay in the lane and devoid cultural appropriation that I needed a picture and in a movie of interracial relationship is probably my identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the Ron Paul has come up\nI find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along well why can't we all just share the same value as\nThe way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... like a kind of cheesy a wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left all my life\nWho even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of higher optical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people\nBefore we can all thing from the same him sheet about all falling in\nFree to explore read it for the the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nOh Hollywood wrong call light all I Want to bring you in 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on that issue they'll GDP rights and the way that change but feel free to comments on what pre as well I think\nThe what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian and all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not venture off even buy a millimeter and\nThat's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful illness on a an an order a social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally much more anxious about socializing with\nPeople who are different from us and be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and ah you know if you're at a party and there is somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani but you've had a couple of drinks maybe\nYou're going to think twice about approaching them a leg or I dig it flies fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong\nBecause you might use the wrong word me might express something that's a little you know not all perfect there's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful\n... it's the intolerance outline will just mentioned it's also political correctness on old pots and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow the differences defined as more than the chronology of close to a real differences out to be celebrated\nBut they also the coming out you know we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus and they shouldn't be warm but the memories simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump\nEverything else and that's the way that politics has become\nSo do you go on strike I I really would like example is I mean I I I'm hearing all these kind of a generic I put her hand wringing about authoritarianism and\nLack of commonality and differences but I'm not hearing an example of the only example that was given was black lives matter which was immediately contradicted by they lie that was played on the radio just now\nSo let me give you a couple of examples of what I wanted to make the but I think a black lives matter in many ways is an important movement and one that has actually contributed significantly to an understanding the death of a problem of police violence in the United states\nAnd I think there's one argument that back I met a mix but it's absolutely right which is that there's a disproportionate police violence against African Americans and the this is a huge scandal\nNot when you look at the numbers are those are true but the majority of people who are killed by police in the United states on fact not African American and that's not surprising given the reds be small portion of the oval American population but as black so I think actually this conversation would be\nA more fruitful and we'll put it to the vacation if we sat there is a specific problem with police violence against African Americans and this is a particularly deepen justice\nBut you know what if you are a teenager or a pound of a of a white teenager who likes to go out to parties you should also be worried because actually ... white people who got shot by the police as well\nI Want one last quick question to you before we wrap up this off ... people have never lived in

first kind of bishops opened its doors in British Columbia\nIs an unassuming sore from the outside very simple design and what I saw of course when I got there in the morning before it opened with people starting to line up and we saw that across Canada people lining up outside of these new legal stores are waiting for it open to be among the first customers of legal cannabis in the country\nSome of them said you know they've been waiting for this for forty years for fifty years\nAnd you know other said they never thought they'd be something like that in a lifetime so when the store opened a cat in the morning first customers walk in you know big Shearer updated and throughout the day as people were coming out they were showing off what they thought they were really just excited to be part of of that day that legalization than Canada\nCanada goes is only the second country all the euro ... to to legalize cannabis why legalize why this decision well the reasoning\nBy the Trudeau government is that prohibition has been a failure in their view that Canadians we're still heavy users of the drug especially Canadian use minors teenagers and so on so they said look we're going to try and bring in this new\nStrict control regulation framework instead and in doing so they hope to reduce what they see the failed system with a more\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nOr the hands of criminals and and would reduce that some of the health and social harms that they've seen with the drug use and you talk\nAbout strict controls that are regulations will still be in place then well just briefly\nWhat it looks like what is legal federally 'cause it's a bit of a patchwork across the country depending on the province the federally an adult so that's about Eighteen or Nineteen years old depending on where you are\nWill be able to purchase from a license producer\nAnd possess thirty grams of the drug and dried form or its equivalent in Cedar oil form and you'll be able to use it again it's a bit of a patchwork he signed someplace and you'll just be able to use it in a private residence and others like Ontario for example ... most populous\nProvince you can use it a sense the the same way you would if you were smoking cigarettes huge youth tobacco so that's roughly what it looks like now\nIt is regulated so a you have to buy it from a license producer it's still illegal to buy it on the black market to possess over thirty grams there are actually some new and fractions around selling minors which carry a charge up to fourteen years in prison\nNow of course the Canadian Medical Association journal called it a national uncontrolled experimental everybody is thrilled with this development older\nNot everybody is thrilled a lot of especially health organizations health groups\nPutting out press releases urging a lot of caution so there was that organization that you noted an organization representing psychiatrists warning about use of the drug\nFor people under twenty five so their concerns around developing brains issues around mental health a society representing gynecologist an obstetrician saying there was a growing body of evidence that there was risk of using the drug among pregnant women concerned about the development of the fetus so again\nBoth organizations were saying be cautious make smart decisions\nNow we're hearing a lot about a green rush up on all the possible boon to the economy that this development could have more to people thinking about that in the months up to legalization here in\nCanada I mean one of the headlines that you saw almost every day it was just talking with the stock price at some of these big license producers just rising and rising and rising a lot of speculation a lot of people really interested in joining this legal market to give you an idea a candidate statistics agency it's national agency\nCrunched the numbers they tried to figure out how many people used it what kind of market there was an aide twenty Seventeen they found that Canadians used or spent rather\nAbout five point seven billion dollars on campus\nMost of that was in the black market so that just gives you a rough idea\nAnd of course because Canada is doing this and it's a it's amongst the first to do it all the countries will be watching very closely way absolutely\n... and across the world is just been a bit of a shift around the attitude towards marijuana we're seeing obviously\nCanada is taking a very big step of the kind of a bold step I Would say and it is an experiment into this full legalization model but a lot of in the U.S of course a lot of states were ahead of us in terms of legalizing the drug on the state level it remains illegal federally in the United states\nAnd we're seeing other countries bringing on line medical marijuana frameworks for seeing other countries looking it decriminalization so having this experiment in Canada seeing whether or not the Trudeau government is able to realize the goals they put forward and if that is a successful thing I think\nBe you know obviously other countries looking at that and seeing how that plays out I was Jessica Murphy in Canada and that's it from the well this week from now if you had any thoughts on what we've done what
