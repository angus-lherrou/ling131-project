have the oil industry and that we are exporting a lot of oil and gas our green credentials are quite a significant and should be taken into account especially I Want to mention was a\nVery it's political parties have done the wreck the several years transforming that the transportation sector that we have here in in our way\nAnd we have at the moment a lot of new electrical vehicles coming into and driving around all across the highway and that's something that that I Believe that we should be quite proud of canned goods and sit\nYeah that's a very special area on the whole Silicon Valley as far so\nGood for you to tipping point as far as public opinions consent no\nI mean it's a quick or easy now because we have a a political platform other government where we have to agree to let this area and be left as it is but it's very important that we have activity on the other parts of the of the country because\nWe produce a lot of oil and gas that's very important for the European production of electrical power\nAnd ah it's actually part of making a Europe more green\nGay we have to remember the sheer scale of this because if you take in consideration the Europe screen ... hydro power in the region hydropower is one tenth the energy of what we export natural gas to Europe which is important because\nIf we don't export from Norway it will be other countries who will take place in Europe\nI don't think that you can take out twenty five percent of the natural gas coming into Europe of the equation and and just relax and said sit back and say that nobody will

public that actually better that Norway does this we do it well it's not safe policing when the power comes from Norway we take it out the new from the ground and where the good guys note of it\nI think that's been a very important part of the story that we've been telling ourselves in the way over the past twenty Thirty years or being an oil producing country at the same time that we're trying to frame of cells that the climate friendly country in a way\nAnd what we're seeing now is basically a shift because we're also taking into account both that the consequences of climate change that we are seeing today but also what's really going on in other countries are in the world and in Europe we're seeing this big energy transition now\nFrom fossil fuels and being depended on importing ... in in many countries\nTo want to be energy independent and building more and more renewable energy in the in a lot of renewable energy and that's a whole new transition that we are seeing and and that's happening in the ... and it's happening in Germany and that's going to change the markets to which we sell our petroleum at the moment as far\nAs you can sense should the Norwegian government be granting new exploration licenses for it in places like the ... seats in the up\nTo I Believe that we shouldn't be doing that and the main reason for that and that's a perspective that I Believe is sort of missing in the debate so far and that is\nThe timeframe that we're talking about here because if we accept and say yes to new production and new oil fields being developed for example in the ... today they will be still be producing and twenty seven\nTwenty eight days and that is a couple of decades off the twenty fifth day when the world should really be toward zero zero crime it gets ...\nWell I think we have to see it on the great escape because if you're going to shut down all the power pounced based on cold in the works\nBut I Do not oil we're talking about\nFirst of all my point is that if you have replaced coal plants root for example gas\nOr even oil that will be more green in the total world my point is that if we want to make the bird greener re first has to start stopping the coal plants and when we do that we need to have something to replace it with um when I Want to buy our electric car for some in Norway I have to wait two years because they don't produce them false enough\nSo we have to be realistic of course we're going to have striving to worse agreement society I'm totally agreeing with us but we have to do it in a way that actually is yeah ...\n... Christopher in this in this movement of transition it probably does make sense then driven the ... seat because actually might be environmentally sensitive but it's better than so many of the alternatives that are out there\nI think it's very limited have long ah cats here and others can argue that gas will replace coal and that we should just continue and look can develop new oil and gas fields because that's the tragedy and we've had over a hundred and fifty explorations in the ... the hundred and fifty more are kind of on the table and uh\nIf I can draw ... find out what's next sense and and I came back a few years later\nAnd my mother told me in Seattle\nThat now I Know what you're talking about the climate change because now we're seeing it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said\nNo China should do something about it because they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was in Oxford last week and look at the summary of the whole conference thing that Norway is the bad guy\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nIn it and I said so do you think the u._s. should do something about it then and then she said now China should do something about it because they are polluting much more than enough and if you go to international conferences where we are discussing climate change and plus I feel if I was an Oxford last week and look at the summary of the whole conference\nIt was saying that Norway is the bad guy and to put it into words of the students and when I talk to them today and pull them out what's going to say well we are the richest country in the world's why can't we afford making a plan to get off that feels good to\nUh would look at the time frame because clearly but says well it could be draining until twenty Seventy yeah it will and it will be like that if you base your numbers on I ... a international Energy Agency they say it's still in twenty fifty\nOne third of energy production globally will be from oil and gas and that is the big numbers\nAnd they say that we will have a decline every year for the total production of noisy globally so we have to replace production until we're able to make shift without it and remember that is based if we go to do a big big job to do to increase renewables about six thousand percent\nUnless it's a huge huge job ... ... on on how do you want to ... I just mentioned also\nStuff and we will also double or triple nuclear power globally\nIf this was true we're not going to reach the trying to target the Paris Agreement the ... you know it's not yet and we'd be debating and those are those numbers before but it's important to understand that we don't have a lot of time and it's going to take a lot of drastic measures\nBut he's also important to understand that the speed of the renewable energy at the moment how sauce it's being built tough new investments are being made into renewable energy and it's so many different types of renewable energy which are cheaper\nThan gas and oil in competition with the do as a politician and in a country like no way which you largely agreed is environmentally conscious thinks of itself it's green\nIt's still difficult to sell these ideas\nHow does anybody else can I buy and\nWell it's difficult in a way that it's become if they have I been working environmental issues for for ten Fifteen Years at the moment then\nIt's become ... but I think it's easier in other countries actually done in Norway and it's important to understand that why why do you do that well because we have been producing country for so long and it's been so large part of\nWho we are and how we identify ourselves sudden it's been I mean a lot of people have been working and are working in the petroleum industry and I just want to underline that we're not talking about shutting down production that we have today it's about whether or not we should invest in more oil fields for the future can convince kind of\nTo look on what are our options to all the renewables\nFor example we are discussing to mix in a more a bio diesel into our place to make their more renewable\nBut where do you have to borrow do so well uh you get to perhaps if you're a lucky from or organic waste and it's part of this circle but uh if not you have to produce it by making some of our Lance part of\nThe ... de Soleil production instead of making foods\nSo I mean we have to be realistic and\nIf he wants to have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineer's stuck the now have the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that the ... that's called at the new now they changed their name it's part of that strategy\nStreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu flash I I I\nDo have a more green unfriendly environment you also have to have the technology and who are going to develop that well it's the engineers that they know how the the jobs in the oil and gas industry and we see that the stuff that's called at the new now they changed their name it's part of that strategy because\nThey understand they are also part of the green shift so my point is you can't just have a switch and say let's stop with oil and gas and now we're going to turn green is there a long process\nAnd oil and gas industry is actually part of it and the first thing we have to do is to shut down the coal plants to make the word more green gay\nOr at the same time we have to address CCS as his view because carbon capture and storage carbon capture and use it as both a central themes in the transition into but now we don't have which have successfully than no trial yet again\nIt's a lot of the things we have to do at the same time and this is one of the great things we can use our engineers to\nThis is one of the great things we could use our universities for the ... from the burn see is like ... regions big stack them up on the other and they thrive when it's cold it's dark so this could be one part of the solution\nThere's a lot of things we have to do or we can do because we are in the situation we are\nCarry you wants to connect with CBS is definitely important and we are in the situation in Norway where every political party actually agree on is just explain yeah what we mean by that cash or sorry it's essentially the idea that you could somehow take column for the environment and and put it away the underground all under the ...\nYeah that we've been trying to develop that technology in no way for for some time now\nAnd I think technology exists it's a matter of making it profitable\nAnd making it possible for companies to actually use and the government in no way are shifting government system quite all of a lot of money to try to make that tough but fair is\nGetting down to the details again and he's here has been focused on and All right for Twenty years I think you also need to challenge the politicians have with a greater sense because I don't think when you're in saying that solution is more oil and gas I don't think when we know what the harm is doing the climate changes if\nYou're going to spend a lot of money and preparing for more oil and gas than how are we going to deal with the transition that's taking place sooner or later are we going to plan for it or not\nThat season to unions because of if you're export the power you don't use it for industrial production in no way and that's the discussion above your work about where you live what would you go to do it's a problem\nThere is I just want to come with an axe southward again and we have this island big island outside of your calls from now which is very beautiful\nAnd it has a lot of seafood production and it's expected to increase for two hundred percent in terms of how much power the need for all this new production and we're working there with the local uh energy company or or the regional and we're actually looking at put together with the community is on the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for a couple of solar power will benefit show and I think the it's kind of way so creating viable energy future it's it's really the way to go if you can see how it benefits their own society and be if\nStreaming on double you say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu flash I I I\nIt is on the company is how we\nDon't have to put another long cable to supply them but actually for a couple of solar power will be beneficial and I think the it's kind of way so creating viable energy future it's it's really the way to go if you can see how it benefits your own society and if we think more locally and regionally about the way we plan\nWith energy I don't think we will be in that situation that he's growing up with that we have to pay so much more energy I think actually we can make really good energy future it's here\nI'm interested all the solutions for rich country a country where the citizens feel comfortable and secure is there any sense in which no way can be a model for anybody else\nI should think that we should sign sudden area certain specific areas where Norway should be leading in terms of developing new technology in terms of\nBringing that new technology to the markets and make it profitable make it something that could be used also by other countries\nAnd what we've done in the in terms of electrical ... with creating a market for a new technology\nWe should do that also in terms of the energy positive house buildings we could do it in in producing and manufacturing electrical boats and chips because for a shift nation that always seems so\nThere because of an I'm an engineer why would I Choose to academic thing other than oil and gas in a way\nWell I think because he want to be part of really creating the future and I think the future energy security of supply will come from renewable not to develop new pipelines with gas\nAnd I would like to bring attention to the development in order to Norway because with all this exploration stuff we talked about there's only two developments and then to reach an architect to oil and gas fields\nWhen the oil price plummeted and twenty fourteen\nThan it meant that the other industries for really growing so within the fisheries now which is the second biggest export of Norway they have a lot of innovation and developments and we have a lot of tourists ... actually have so much towards mental him so that people are starting to complain so we sort of this other issue is we're dealing with\nAnd I think of all of northern Norway and nobody's really thinking that's new oil fields to benefit them so they're looking at other things to work on so if you are an engineer in the interim ... I think he would rather a study of renewable energy at our university which you can\nFor other than oil actually developed a new we have established a new renewable energy center because the students ask for it can cause fault\nNo no this is the opposite to each other I mean you have the development in the uh the American business so I mean\nThis is something we have to strive to shift to have the green shift to even though if we have a increasing tourists man I'm a I'm a great expansion anti American sector or because they weren't picture is that the international Energy Agency has predicted\nThat if we're going to be more green and to close down to coal plants\nWell then you have to have more gas you have to I don't think I think you've made it out there I Know but it's the ... it sounds like it doesn't actually sometimes when I listen to ... because she's talking about a gradual change well\nIf you're going to have a gradual change you have to have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got the growth on a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a

have a plan how do you meet those challenges and I I haven't got a got them a good answer on the\nWell Ken mentioned before the break that he was at a he's a technology optimist so and my and that is why I I truly believe that that shift and that turned ... now in the end the sector is really happening and they just happening in other concentrates at the moment I mean look at China that the the speeds\nOf ... of new installment of renewable energy it's it's really amazing and and you have the paradox there as well what a coal fired power plants absolutely but my argument if you will see now that you and your ... and then she will indeed be more cost effective\nThan fossil fuels and that's the problem for us that's a concern for us because we really live at the moment today by producing and exporting petroleum\nWill that which brings me to another point you mentioned China new ways role in energy security isn't this a country that much if Europe is Jolie grateful to buy new ... twenty five percent of your supply because actually that pull away a little bit from Russia gave\nDoes it does a good story about interpreter in Lithuania there's the port city there is an elegy terminal which taking natural gas\nIt's named independence by the president there because it makes them independent from Russian guys an older guys\nOn board ducked terminal comes from the barn and she comes from Homer fest comes from ... from the plant there so this is what makes energy security another thing in Europe than on not only to get energy but also the right kind of energy\nThat she can argue that new region energies plane as some people might not reason to buying it but it will say that it means that new ways a counterweight to leave powers that are trying to explore the Arctic trying to find new routes round the north pole and so on new ways a counterweight to Russia China and ...\nAnd the parents said they had drilled about twice as much just Russia and we have sort of this\nExpression ever that we need to drill before Russia to set the standard in the air and sea and I don't think it's necessarily get that normally go to Brussels and law bits for better conditions for gas because you have this problem in Europe that gas and renewables are competing so that it's not a black and white picture\nYour cat that ... that is according to the carbon browsing on if you see the current price hasn't been originally seems to summer it is a totally different picture coming up now so if the carbon prices high and Europe gas will exclude cold wave to a quarter lay on what you mean by that call them ... the\nPrice you pay for the admissions you'd you produce energy by\nOn the market inside Europe and the prices are being artificially low for a lot of years and that has made it possible to run coal plants in Europe to a low cost when those prices starting to rise then you guys will push out cold enough push out renewables\nThat he's still a to have to understand that renewable and gas are competing in Germany they are afraid somebody called the carbon pricing no but also the way the energy system works\nAnd seems to nibble energy is so much more cost efficient when it's producing electricity that coal fired no gas\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nTo have to understand

mean\nObviously Norway count we come take Russia's place when it comes to two guests and an expert of gas but that is also why Europe and so many European countries today are wanting to be more energy independent an are investing in renewable energy\nSo I mean we're going to keep exporting gas to Europe for quite some time it's a we already made those commitments but\nThat this is about what kind

that average I wait for it right here put it to him that digital IDs hadn't been fully embrace in developed countries so why should they do better elsewhere\nWhen you look at developing countries as a starting point about fifty percent of children in sub Saharan Africa still I'm registered as being borne by that fits the stay so it's about a billion people out there who don't exist basically\nSaid it's just the kind of way as we've seen with other technologies in Africa and other developing um places of leap frog gang existing ways of doing things and gang straight to ditch tool tentative\nIt is absolutely a pipe is still quite important to many of these places but if you're going to end Sestak I've into West African countries all across the Asian countries and they've been trying to help them to register\nChildren being bowl which is the best starting points to register the being bowl and then they tightened if you have an identity going forward so that's the that's the point that

ideas kind of vying for the mainstream if if you should say so recently had a well bank event that I attended looking at digital identities there are people looking at block chain and centralized versus decentralized solutions\nI'm centralized solutions work well because you can control everything in one place and you can avoid duplicate identities and so on\nBut at the same time that our favorite pulse of cool for hackers an odd how recently got a ... a again reactor number of times but recently got hacked and that's the system in India was over a billion people before registered so absolutely there's concerns they're all\nUm you know some ideas about using cell phones for an identity is way you have your identity on your mobile phone\nOnly you hold it and then you can choose who you present that to when you're interacting with a service and that's the way we look at the icy we actually have it on your smartphone so it's actually held by you rather than being held in a central place it can be hacked\nBut at the moment there's a number of different solutions that are vying for a time um but the centralized ones which is the most common at the moment all the most

researching the growing energy use self video streaming which now accounts for the majority of Internet traffic\nThe Internet the data centers the digital devices all account for about eight percent

five percent of all into that traffic um ... you could say that around three percent perhaps of global electricity demand goes towards video streaming and supporting that\nBut how does streaming video compassion energy use with good old fashioned broadcast TV Chris praised is professor of computing sustainability at Bristol University\nI think we can definitively say that broadcast TV is definitely more efficient than video on demand a but on the other hand video on demand is a more sophisticated service the broke us TV broke us TV effectively you're providing the same for everyone\nAnd if you can provide the same for everyone then you just need won a system to dispatch shapes to broker cost effective it where it's a video on demand you need to a point to a point\nDreaming on W E n J

whereas a video on demand you need to a point to point relationships with each individual who's consuming figure any given time so inevitably it's going to use more energy\nIt doesn't use as much a

Mike has us from Lancaster University\nIf you're concerned about the environmental impacts of your everyday life are the main thing to think about with regards to streaming is whether that stream video is really being watched as a lot of times uh our research has found that\nVideo is used to provide a just background noise and and as it turns out a broadcast radio is an excellent way to provide that sort of that same sort of ambience and does not require that extra energy that that streaming video does\nThe professor Chris priest in Bristol says we shouldn't be too hard on myself\nI
