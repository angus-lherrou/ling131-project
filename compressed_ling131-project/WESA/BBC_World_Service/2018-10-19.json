I went to society whether it's more interracial marriage whether it's more contact between cultures rather than one where everybody has to stay in the lane and avoid cultural appropriation those and you get a picture and in a movie of interracial relationship is probably my identity politics just becomes another form of intolerance\nI think that you know it's interesting that the Ron Paul has come up I find some of the discussions off why can't we all get along why can't we all just share the same value as\nThe way in which it's presented as a bit like a whole ... like a kind of cheesy\nA wrong call and I never met anyone on the left are really my ... and I've lived on the left all my life\nWho even for some form of commonality but what people are saying is that the idea of commonality is very different from the reality of higher optical differentiation and exploitation\nAnd we have to address the fact of political oppression and structures which disenfranchised people before we can all sing from the same him sheets about all falling in love and living happily ever after we caught stone politics into a kind of button all Hollywood wrong call light all I Want to\nBring you in 'cause he wants to coming out of there I think on that issue they'll GB T rights and the way that change but feel free to comment on what pre as well\nI think the what has been so alienating about the texture of the conversation and identity politics is that it has become increasingly shrill and authoritarian\nAnd all about imposing an orthodoxy from what you may not venture off even buy a millimeter and that's a turn off it also creates a social atmosphere of fearful us\nA an an order a social level not necessarily just on ... special little social media boards I think that we are generally\nFree to explore read it for the the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nFrom us shouldn't be that a sexual preference or race or ethnicity and ah you know if you're at a party and there is somebody across the room you're white person there is someone who looks interesting they're black or they're Pakistani but you've had a couple of drinks maybe\nYou're gonna think twice about approaching them and not a big ... fly because you're afraid of saying something wrong\nBecause you might use the wrong word me might express something that's a little you know not all perfect there's this sense that there are all these new rules out there and they keep changing and they keep multiplying and they make people socially fearful Asia\nIt's the intolerance that line will just mentioned it's also political correctness on ... pops and it's the fact that we simply keep on saying\nWe'll so different that there's nothing that binds us together that somehow the differences defined was more than the country of course they're real differences out than that to celebrate shifts\nBut they also the coming out and she says we are citizens we are human beings and we don't really bring that into the Democratic political contest enough even those notions of citizenship and she might she of course contested there's no sense of of a consensus that shouldn't be warm\nBut the memories simply thinking that gender or race religion and other differences somehow Trump everything else and that's the way that politics has become\nSo do you live in ...
