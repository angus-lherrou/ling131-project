able to operate ... funds despite the scandal and many people might be a lot of money to come to ... young he's behind the film an optical released yesterday by the public and time magazine\nSo this is an organization that was that was set up by American ponder um was marketed as basically they've been golfing sexual exploitation but in the background or come to our than made not on the ground\nWas exploiting many of the girls and then what we were looking into it was like well what happened to the Gulf spelled it to buy widespread was what happened then went back and post Johnson died and I'm twenty six the ... what were the circumstances of the death of what was the implications\nNow Macintosh that you speak all these the the men involved the ... the man who's actually exploited and abused these young women he was in Liberia and himself\nAnd he was one of the people instrumental in that and she needs finding bill for the school wasn't tea which in itself was quite amazing\nYes so am I going to go jumping on you or to find these multiple girls ... support or scholarships that late there in our school or he describes himself as a former child soldier well I think that in the in the context of West point with the highly vulnerable girls all of a sudden any power he had\nMultiplied as a consequence of the international they found a scholarship to the public ... the more than the academy which\nWhich was really something that but when the news over over Liberia\nHe managed to get to the east coast to the school and then it was found out that he had been

dozens of girls um\nAt least ten of them they could be more ... some actually um well it may take in by this man named ... by him and that to to jump out of school why is it they were still allowed to operate\nI think it's challenging I think that because any time there's abuse there's always a community there's always an enabling element from the people who either knew or should have known that those who are benefiting and and then didn't take the steps to safeguard those who are more vulnerable but one of the girl to report on march ... story\nWhen we spoke when he spoke to her she had she probably should have been abandoned by the organization that's just like all that at a very hard life a lot of the girls who had gone through all of this must be brave enough to testify\nThat that she

primary energies and\nEvery kilowatt hour every message will is among those is going to have to be allocated so I think we really have to focus on the areas that are the most important and you say

these changes who will lose their jobs who will be the people in a sense that the ... will be some jokes that simply and\nI think here it's useful to differentiate between short term costs on long term cost I think it's no longer possible to say nobody anywhere is going to be losing\nFrom from switching or from transitioning to a lower carbon economy this something that maybe in two thousand and five to seven and ten thousand people were saying that these ... and they said we know that there are some costs however\nShort term cause that's an equate long term\nCleveland I'm coffee I'll give you some examples we know that the increasing in extra practice and that you cannot another country and in other countries have heard the most a low income people for a larger share of their\nIncome is going into energy so we cannot say that there are no do says what we can say that these losers from this transition could be compensated so there could be policies that could be putting face to compensate\nFor the short term in office but who's going to pay for that well so uh you know government programs is the role of governments to think of the distribution of impacts of different policies I Will give you the other example we also know that the\nFossil fuel industries you know people in those jobs are going to have a hard time however we the appropriate policies of training and we've\nUh emergence of the it's all their high technology sectors that were saying it may be the case I think the long term there will be better off so I think there's a difference between short term cost an overall benefit seen the longer term I think we kind of mitigate we have to mitigate the short term\n... cases I can just bring you about it for them and you read was telling us about the report essentially talking about the difference between a one point five degree rise to degree Celsius rise\nDo you think there's an element of of politics and that to help people light you sell this because in a sense if we can persuade people that gosh there is there a real real things to worry about it might be easier to sell the two degree rice um when I\nLooked to sort of questions some of the assumptions that are behind that point on some of the discussion earlier round you know is it too late to get started I mean we really already started in the terms of ... increase in the months of\nRenewables that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I didn't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see action right now and I can totally that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition to we have been able to use the parents agreement\nFried ... free to pursue the truth\nNinety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nWas that we thought in the world you know both wind and solar so we are starting to make the change we own yet reducing our carbon emissions\nAnd so I don't think to me you know it's good to have the ambition of one and a half percent but the main thing is that we see\nAction right now and I can tell you that since the Paris Agreement to Lou I'm sure everybody in this discussion was disappointed by the lack of ambition to we have been able to use the parents agreement incredibly effectively as greens working on European policy so you know for example I work on the sustainable finance area we can say the\nOil financial products or pension products have to be learned was one point five powers to get for example I can argue that not in the parliament's ... support for that was previously I didn't\nAnd I think the reason politicians are on board for this is they look ahead and they imagine a world that is climate change the wick limited breaking down and they see how a manageable and how difficult that will be politically and so my perspective is a real political will to make these changes now\nYou you just want to us today is that when asking the question who is going to pay to for\nThis one really should not see\nThis as a luxury something to redo now because otherwise we could just go on a business as usual project wants\nTo just reading an investment in a safer and sustainable group and when asking the question was going to\nPay for it for distribution today one should also balanced is with the question what was going to pay to go for future climate impacts if you don't do anything so climate impacts are here today already returned observing today they're projected to increase significantly already with one point five degree of warming\nAnd read to degree of forming this is not in the far future does this um one point five to ... levels of emissions is projected to be reached in around twenty forty two degrees you have to learn about twenty five years later so this is really not that far into the future so we really need to think about who's going to pay for ducked\nDown the road and finally the report actually also shows that this payment and and\nAnd the policies that are put in place have to be carefully managed and they have to be carefully managing managed sewed up the issue the poor of the impacts of this show that they can be compatible with sustainable development and entering a rogue welfare law where he wants to come back and\nYeah and I think I wanted to bring together to that comment that money made and and that they were just made a lot has been done we have a nine to nine countries we ... the entire Seventy three countries with\nAuctions fifty eight countries that are that have other places to see that when you both and thanks to all these work over the past three years or so we've seen cost the cost of mitigation coming down significantly so he is making it easier reason to global carbon price for instances agrees no but do is that what do we need and I mean it might be the most\nEfficient solution ... economically speaking however what we're seeing is that he's politically viable I Know we're talking about politics in the next section but I think what do we have to realize that there's been um scholars and partly because high and working on this for a while is that we haven't gotten to the best policy of a global ... price what we've had is domestic level\nPolicies are subsidizing their renewable energy technologies which has traditionally being\nMore expensive but what we're seeing now is that in an increasing number of applications on countries handle patient they're beginning to be competitive\nSo it's these investments ... it is changing and that's what he said again we are doing and we have been doing it it's not enough ah as they say the reports he's reminding us\nOkay um but I Do think this points out he's made all center report about making sure that the most vulnerable or not heard is not just necessary\nFor ethical reasons but he's also necessary for political reasons I guess only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nYou know so when we talk about cautious important we remember the global economy is not stopping and there were three big\nDreaming on W. E. N. say it's imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute detailed on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu slash I I I\nHeard that the most vulnerable or not heard is not just necessary for ethical reasons but it's also very far political resent okay only in that situation do you get the support you need both\nYou know so when we talk about coffee is important that we remember that the global economy is not static and there were three big trends are going to happen regardless of whether we make this transition which involves reducing emissions by fifty percent by twenty says to him down to zero by twenty fifty so over that period\nIn the next between two thousand and Fifteen and twenty thirty the world's infrastructure is going to\nDouble Ninety Chilean will be invested in New infrastructure that infrastructure will be built regardless of whether we make the transitional not we have a choice whether we make it's sustainable infrastructure the\nGlobal economy itself is likely to double in size in Twenty years if we grow at the rate of about three percent a year and the population living in cities around the world is likely to double in the next forty years they are trends in the global economy that are going to happen we have a choice of whether we continue with our\nCurrent growth model which was delivering US cities that are congested polluted unpleasant\nPlaces the bay not productive for we design our cities more effectively so that that's the real choice we have it's not about us having a whole bunch of new costs on it it's about us choosing to make investments in a more sustainable economy\nRather than the one we have at the moment\nAnd with that so I Want to wrap up this how fast and now thank you to a panel throughout the as an adult ... Julius ... cases\nAbsolutely so I I think for a you know when you look at those grass where you have a very sharp decline it's clear that he is a big departure from the status quo and I think getting that requires all these kind of action all these factors and also a different way of uh\nOf going about not pushing for but arguing or a four different policies\nModi I just want to bring you back in I touched on the idea of nuclear fuel viewed as nuclear power to ready to be clean energy or does it have a place in this picture\nOne of the world's nuclear energy report for this year shows the outside China nuclear power generation has been declining right across the world and the the prices just stuck up I mean we can now in Studio offshore wind is about forty five donors and make it will I ever known show when the twin daughters and make it was ...\nI think the point which is a hundred and twenty dollars to make a little tone that's actually in my patch there was a ... that one very ... because it's just totally on economics so nuclear just cannot compete with renewables in what we need to do is is electrify our energy supply and make it a low carbon as quickly as possible in the most efficient and cheapest way to do that through a new bills\nSo when somebody will and I want to think about the politics which was the gums touch on another more fundamental problem is that many within the U.S administration still didn't actually except the science\nThat's here from Myron evil he works for think tank called the ... it's funded by the energy industry and he was on the little Trump's transition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's PCC report five\nInvestigated the claims and I find them watching from multiple viewpoints one of them is that what\nStreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nWas tradition team for the U.S environmental protection agency so what does he make 'cause Monday's PCC report\nI've investigated the claims and I find them want things from multiple viewpoints wanted them is\nThat what they are proposing needs to be done will have much more deleterious effects on the planet and on humanity then the problem that they have identified I have also tried to show you that the problem is\nIn slow motion compared to what they're claiming it is and I believe that they're claiming it's it's an him in a crisis because that's their charge from the United nations about his level but\nI I mean okay so you're saying they've been instructed to say that they can you imagine anything that the scientists could say that would persuade the administration that it needs to take this seriously\n[noise] ah no I Can't I I think that the administration and the American people are a pretty convinced that a pro energy agenda is much more viable and will have much better results than an energy rationing agenda\n[noise] Myron evil talking to the BBC's as David said they had nothing to scientists say it's gonna make any difference to this particular a U.S president Judea time back with us effective leadership isn't this battle lost\nI think there is effective leadership including in the United states it just happens not to be in the office and the president I'm so happens that the Trump Administration has said they believe the science and uses science to argue for the fact that use the fact that they believe that global warming is happening so fast that they don't think that\nEfficient car policies will be effective so they actually use the fact that global warming is happening really fast to argue for weaker\nA vehicle emissions just last week so we know that they don't they don't have that particular view on science but they do have a view is they have a view on staying in the pocket of the fossil industry and um automotive industry\nFull board wants to come in and bring you in the United states government was one of the governments that approved the summary of this ripple line by line in South Korea last week they have not decided that it is something that the American government has signed up to\nSee how that how do you decide your date and of course that trait howdy desegregate that from if you like the public statements of the president the kind of leadership the United states is shutting on the world stage\nWell it is very important to understand that after President Trump announced his intention to withdraw from Paris there was a huge response from states and cities some companies all fact we're still in and we're going to move in that direction\nSo in a sense what happens at the federal level you've got to separate what happens at the at the national level I don't in the states\nI unimportant Lee when President Trump gives you a reason he talks about the coal industry in the United states ... states is in long term decline because it's simply cheap to generate power from other sources such as shale gas natural gas and renewables\nBut isn't the points the facts are becoming separated from the optics and this is a president who wants to project to very particular image one that appeals to his electoral base and what she said on with the kinds of conversation that we've been having\nHere it is appealing to the problems that they have in the United states of the many other countries of what to do with ... left behind communities including coal mining industries and we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people other jobs she's part of coming up the solution here but the\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety forty five ...

what to do with ... left behind communities including ... industries and we need to talk about the so called just transition giving people of a job she's\nPart of coming up the solution here but the or the other thing is I think President Trump's going to come under increasing pressure on this issue because Americans can see for themselves the evidence of climate change all around them forward or it's just been hit by the strongest hurricane\nTo hit the Gulf Coast on record\nThe storm surge associated with that is big up because it's sea level rise is a good chance the warmer than average Walters and the goals were partly poma because of climate change I think people will say it's an increasing costs to varying the impacts of climate change in the United states nor\nAt one of the few areas of the\nTrump environmental or climate policy where Congress and the U.S has gone way this has been in that support for innovation and low carbon energy technologies President Trump at two years in a row try to cut by sixty percent by fifty percent some programs right the hero at the route investment that three\nThousand a million dollars a year more or less that the u._s. government or has been spending\nYou know carbon energy technologies but Congress didn't go along with that Congress actually increase I think we're seeing that in some areas the idea that there are benefits to investments in low carbon technologies are actually something that uh brings bipartisan\nSupport we've talked ... about the first world the very developed well let's see if we may\n... to ... the world that a growing I won't speak to treat the ... the he's a professor of environment and development in the global south of the University of Amsterdam and she joined us today from Cairo joy to I Want to about India because India in a way is an interesting example of an economy that's growing\nSoft but also a country that has taken its climate change commitments fairly serious the just described to some of the changes that are underway\nWell India is trying to invest a lot in solar panels but I don't think it's doing as much as it could possibly do when I was growing up in the Nineteen seventies we already knew that renewable energy could have a future but since then it's up\nIt's not getting as much attention as it could have gone right now there is much more energy efficiency on the agenda there's much more to talk about renewables but the thing that made me just give you a small example\nIn the Netherlands where I live we are just starting to phase out the use of gas in the houses whereas in my mother's house last year they did a connection\nAnd I think that the developing countries should not following the footsteps of the north they have to find a short cut to development so in some ways what I'm seeing is some action in India but it's not linked fast enough\nAnd what I also wanted to see over here is that I have been studies which show that if India would actually invest in some more additional book in relation to energy they could actually have huge savings in help\nAnd so uh that itself could be a reason for taking action on a fossil fuel and doesn't this come back\nThe politics because then the cost Indian governments of all do that a country that's growing is simply not positive it wasn't positive the industrialization process that if you like caused the problems of climate change and then\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free friends\nIn help and so that itself could be a reason for taking action on a bus with you and doesn't this come back to the politics because then the cost Indian government ... that a country that's growing is simply not positive it wasn't part of the industrialization process that if you like caused\nThe problems of climate change and therefore it's contribution to the solution should reflect that it shouldn't pay for it in its economic growth now\nAbsolutely but you see if you look at the beat it Nineteen Ninety two thousand and five at that time the developing countries are doing the knock must take action fist\nNo it's very difficult for the developing countries to actually force the U.S and Europe to take action\nThe problem is right now there's a limited space the action so it's it's no longer a viable argument to save that going to wait for the U.S to take action I think India China and the rest of the developing world\nHave to quickly try to figure out ways to buy bonds the mistakes of the north you'll be talking about the fact that we could ... tried to convince off ancient funds to stop investing in fossil fuels\nBut the question then is one of the pension funds going to do with the fossil fuels are they going to sell those also the rules or the investments to the south and I think that for the very good idea to shifting the problem is that great and so I don't even developing countries should try to buy those technologies all those fossil fuels\nThey should try to bite off that but it's going to lead to some sort of economic disruption do you think for a country like India that democratic that this is more difficult or easier to push through as an idea\nOf a democracy is a false is that everyone talks and it's very difficult to come to decisions relative to perhaps the dictatorship on the other hand I think that there's a lot of knowledge in India there's a lot of science\nAnd we love to hear your thoughts email us the real story at BBC don't Kendall UK for me with

when she arrived she she basically partnered with a man in the community who describes himself as a former child soldier it was well connected there and essentially she was very talented that raising money internationally and\nHe was the one who was on the ground that's like and girls often and managing scholarship program but sadly in the background over the years the organization that existed

challenge with this story is that while ten girls testified according to multiple accounts there were many other students who had been named as also his victims so\nWhat we know is that to students who are named lessons that can spot them die that tested positive and we also know that one of the ten victims who testified tested positive so so very sadly there's that there's a strong public
