nuclear agreement [noise] I go out and so we're not allowed to wear one said in there for him and I we bought it for Russia is not going to terminate all out\nIn response to Russia's foreign ministry was quoted as saying the U.S decision was made debated by the dream of a single global superpower but President Trump also pointed to China which isn't bound by the treaty for more on what it means I spoke to crisp up in Washington\nThe ... treaty was a very big deal when it was signed buck in Nineteen eighty seven it was signed by Ronald Reagan on me called Gorbachev and basically it led to the elimination of hundreds of missiles from both of us I'm from Russia and it was one of those moments during the Cold War when people felt\nThe relationships were really improving hardly ever it has to be said over the last few years there have been real concerns in Washington but the Kremlin had been ignoring this particularly with woman cruise missile that they have been testing and the deploying\nAnd they've been trying to put pressure on Russia to try to hear to destroy say\nAnd it seems like patients whose real night\nPresident Trump saying very clearly that they are not going to withdraw from the street they unilaterally and not probably will not be accepted with a great deal of heart by some within the international community they feel that this treaty still has some value and therefore there will be some concerns that Americans decided to get rid of us\nHe also mentioned China and he said the U.S is going to have to stop developing the weapons that were previously bound by the treaty\nAnd that is probably the worry in a in a sentence because the truth is is a worry for other countries and I suspect many within Europe for example he said this could potentially lead to an arms race of some description\nBut the U.S has felt for some time not when Russia has been ignoring this there was no being pressured coming in from other countries like Europe\nTo tell Russia you need to abide by this now we already knew that the national security adviser John Bolton was going to Moscow in the coming days and then he was going to have meetings with the Russian
