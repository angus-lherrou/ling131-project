a need for repair cafe in Bangalore because we in in in Holland we would think that's in India people would still have repair skills\nAnd are we mistaken\n... because the older generation of bad is getting lost the ... living in um [noise]\nA nuclear family and uh uh via not seeing a A R people repairing it around us so that's why we found that does it need to bring this concept again yard\nThey

you say you're taking a long have you been away from us [noise]\nSo in this case you have professional to better since I think along with us along with volunteers [noise] uh so uh it's the first thing is that we are not competing against the professions are better than not taking the business of age it's\nFair but I like to point to go ahead what we find is obviously politicians of it is about saving the planet but it's also by saving people money\nOn what we find is that people and all that kind of the day they called a fool to take something along to a professional repair and get a PSA test tend to be told to calm the retired\nSo what we do is we do at least the assessment for free and then maybe we say it's worth taking a tour in Paris so we take out some of the expense and the person who's going to the professional repair knowing that it can be amended but are we in the ... cafe down have that just goes\nOn but I think one of the things that should change in the future to get to repair back in to our daily lives\nFree to pursue the troupe re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburg NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nNine maybe we say it is worth taking a tour in Paris so we take out some of the expense and the person who's going to the professional repair knowing that it can be amended but are we in the ... cafe down have those countries\nBut I think one of the things that should change in the future to get repair back in to our daily lives is that a professional repairs who become cheaper\nAnd now for many people report professional repair is too expensive because you have to pay for the labor\nAnd ... so we believe I Believe that uh the tax system should change and that labor or should be taxed lower so that a professional re ferrets would become more attractive\nIn in more cases and that would enable professional repairs to run their business\nAnd of course there will be to\nA labor costs in different pulses of well so\nWhat you're talking about that might have a different impacts depending on where you are on the\nAfter listening to have\nOne thing I wanted to talk about that I was you know for the solution to work it doesn't cost rely on people going out of their way to get stuff man who's in the first place for whatever reason a lot of people just don't think like that as I found out when I paid a visit\nTo a landfill thought the other day how about some to this white water\nBecomes today and I'm checking some topics I made a half [noise]\nThis is the gold and she'll just broke yeah yeah he found that tax break at the yeah I mean you say totally broken beyond repair all well I don't know if he's a so frightened ... holes in the ... so but he's out at home and I wonder when someone could replace a missile POWs [noise] it might be able to have 'em\nBy people even though there are just I just think it's just easier to get rid of it so they may they might have been able to take is it is it the time as well during the time yeah oh yeah I've got two kids that don't have to run and not just ... sometimes it's just no price cold ...\nWhat's in it that was\nKind of stuff from cameras stuff you know when you put on a ...\nYeah um yeah that will be on the unfortunately um Georgia a point where they can't use because they got fungus in general things wrong with him so ... in a bind them could you repair them all\nThat you could drive but that's not really much point they don't want anything to take it to patients cleaning around would cost a ridiculous amount of money it's a perfectly good bad now and then put when it's just that\nIt comes down to the fact that that were in the ... about twenty quit in ... or somewhere like that answer was real Harry ... ten times that much so you've got your your\nYour legs and say we're going to put them in the well this is a little bit I've already been up here not looking good guys\nWe should we be doing things to\nReuse things but it comes down to ... county is does only says let's say the seed\nThan you can hardly blame people for buying the right to stuff especially if they knew something was going to be generally cheap and nailed equipment and he does a better job\nSo there are a couple of issues are raised the I Wonder you know ... people have good intentions when it comes to this sort of thing but like often gets in the way that you know the they just don't have the time\nYeah obviously people are pretty busy day to day life but uh there is a lady informed community\nDreaming on W. E. N. courted by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu flash I I I\nKnow there are a couple of issues the race that I Wonder if you know ... people have good intentions when it comes to this sort of thing but like often gets in the way that she's busy they just don't have the time\nYeah obviously people are pretty busy that day to day life\nBut ah there is a lady informed community of people around\nOr whoever he conscious about their environment that saying that we get in some thoughts beget vague was just fun because people want to do that bitch in ah in their surroundings and so that the things that actually doing a lot of their thoughts so that things don't go to lunch and\nMust you know I Wonder if you could kind of a ... some of the people here in this for a cafe or you you would kind of preaching to the compared to the head for reasons because they're they're already on board with the environmental movement without ...\nHow'd you get to the other people have you ... the other people who as we heard from the people look at the tip who are quite happy just to throw stuff away\nWell that's the challenge of course but we hope to get them into the repack cafe when they have something\nThat they really want to hang on to win that when it's a fresh is broken object that cannot be easily replaced by the cheap you type and we know that that's what happens when people come to the ... they don't really expect things to be read that\nThey come here and when they see that it can be done it really opens your eyes and I believe it opens your mind\nA more sustainable society\nPolitically running short time now this RIMPAC cafe in Holland is still still going to some people that are fixing a coffee machine they've pulled apart as a chapter with a large Sean again into the workings of the device some final thoughts and from ... in a way to start to it can be ten Fifteen Years time\nWell I think that will be more repack cafes because they'll they'll they'll be needed\nBut we also hope that manufacturers realized that product should be re bearable and that they should be a produced in a more sustainable way so that they can be repaired inappropriate way and maybe you might have a three D. prints are in in RIMPAC cafe so you could principal suspect pause to\nTo fix the things that you don't have the baseball strikes a way\nThat will be challenging but um maybe in the future you love that Christmas you\nOh yes I mean I think the future preparing cafes is as much around bringing people together\nAnd I think coming to RIMPAC cafe yeah it does create a sense of community that togetherness it creates friendships I'm kind of slow people down for a little bit while they actually learn a little bit about more about that product somehow that can be amended\nSo I think it has a much wider role to play than simply connecting broken always comes with Paris hits it hits connecting people with each other\nMy thanks to everyone to most Tina I'm Petra hairs but some to Chris in London and Chevy ... bank a little\nThank you for this thing too will attack if you want to see ... cafe in action and making a pretty broad\nBased so it's it'll be soon will tax away back next week for most of the nation from around the world but for now I'm all for most a clause in how to repair and electronic say to them or I'm now I'm going to get a hero's welcome\nDreaming on W.

his campaign ethics right to Henry James admitted a bit of a mistake that but she said the campaigns will not about to stop\nObviously we took a huge amount of backlash which you know I had a personal cost to us and stuff that same time it called the issue talked about in the u._k. attend level that it had never been talked about before so I guess that in some ways we just have to view the emotional impact on us as collateral damage to a greater good\nYou have all kinds of campaigns not just that one of course campaigns ... animal testing you both campaigns have a phobia trends phobia of fracking folks hunting nuclear issues plastic packaging the list goes on how does that relates to selling ... products\nOr what we try not to relate it to solving boss products because oldest I say she said you just mentioned the things that we will cap I'm passionately ...\nBefore we became a company that made so we were all campaign as an activist before we came and went\nTo Russia and that includes the people who started lash so obviously there's a whole host of things that we will care about and we built a business that suddenly became big enough that we could use all shop fronts on our website to actually talk about the things that we were campaigning about not private lives so for us there's a huge buying on those issues it's not marketing thing\nOkay so this is all just heartfelt stuff it's not anything to do your saying with the commercial end of the business know how's it affected the commercial end of the business\nWe have to ... when he first started campaigning publicly that we would never judge a campaign by its sales figures that we would never looked to chew up at the same time because he would make you hesitate to Institute when he can so that was sad to and we largely stick to it at the everybody\nWants to be right now how is it affects is you'll say oh I can\nTell you they don't want to because actually surprisingly it puts sales op\nSo when the campaign people came to you saying that sales were up this was during the spike ups campaign that was getting all the negative publicity\n[noise] uh yes yes during the spike up campaign and yet it wasn't on campaigns people it was actually our accounts people came to us and made a phone call in and said you know don't worry sales are actually up you're not going to believe this you know an tang
