save the environment they should have\nEnvironmental policies that ensure that our natural resources from Maine in the public good to that effect that people here this week on the Allegheny Front the socialist are coming to Harrisburg Saturday afternoon at four thirty Ninety point find that well you you have to say\nThis is hidden brain I'm Shankar Vedantam we start today with an account of two communities one is liberal the other conservative\nI Want you to gas which is where\nThe schools with stress [noise]\nPatriotism and respect and it would be a very rural face an educational system how is\nThis would be fairly similar the lawns would be a very nicely kept in a beautifully bringing them mode of the town of each class with lots of churches that town one\nHere's town to the schools would be based more on story actual kinds of things rather than than real memory\nPeople would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting [noise] um they would take the yards natural um lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those and churches and that was easy right\nConservatives like order liberals embraced ambiguity now you may be rolling your eyes are even getting angry at these stereotypes but we all know there's more than a grain of truth to them so how did these two towns which I guess today refers to as liberal bill and conservative and\nGet this way when most of us think about how we came to our political views we tend to have a straightforward explanation we use our upbringing and life experiences as a basis for a political beliefs we imagine\nThat our parents teachers in friends shape our views on everything from taxes and the economy to immigration and national security but what if I told you there's something deeper into those attitudes drives that shaped the music we listen to the food we eat the politicians we elect\nThis week on hidden brain how the partisan divide in our country might arise not just from our upbringing and lived experiences\nFrom biology [laughter]\nOn a regular basis right before an election someone was Sharon article with me\nHow science proves that the brains of liberals are stunted or a post on Twitter was say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\n[noise] these claims obscure something far more interesting and far more accurate there are genuine psychological differences between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts\nJohn ... is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln he has spent many years studying the psychological and newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives he is co author of the book predisposed liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences\nThe word Laura or heard the word ... but this idea that you know the way that we see here's something must be the way everyone else sees it and there's just this feeling of auto disbelief that other people might not see and hear the world the same way\nYeah it's just what we're used to it makes sense to us so I Do think that's something we need to continue to pound away on that that we really are wired up quite differently\nLet's look at how this plays out when it comes to the subject of immigration here is Republican Donald Trump\nThey're bringing drugs they're bringing crime their rapists and some I assume are good people\nAnd here's Democrat Nancy Pelosi\nWe are constantly reinvigorated by immigrants coming to our country and their commitment and courage and commitment to the American dream which drew them here in the first ...\nNow it's important to stipulate here John that it's entirely possible these politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nI really think or you know immigration defense or police law and order but I think that's what's really at the core of of who we are not the core of political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us and it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police or I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nExtremely vetted as the president wants to so you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know the ... they only makes sense that they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place\n\nNow there are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the actual legal considerations that are difficult to disentangle from psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings\nJohn one showed liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures and he found they reacted very differently\nA positive picture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house or just been leveled by a hurricane um or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe had people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a electro journal activity or skin conduct ... which is a common way of saying if somebody's just having a reaction having a physiological arousal to that a stimulus\nAnd what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of images because they're they have some emotional content but we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who is conservative\nThat is true then a a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different\nAnd the one that we did it goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we had the most luck with a pictures of mutilation ... uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people\nYou know without knowing anything about that with all of a good look at was the brains can result and we could be incredibly\nAccurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the basis of that\nLiberals brains when they looked at a mutilation images were much more active in a at a part of the brain called the ... to ... matter of sensory too\nAnd that's the part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I take him in the ... century true with the active but it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of somebody stepping on a rocky now goes right through there ... years some that are censored too it'd be active\nAnd what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation matter of sensory too conservative\nDoesn't mean that conservatives are hard hearted or just means that that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents like my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics the shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how you all\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nRight there's a really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment and think about fraternal an identical twins\nIdentical twins have identical genes fraternal twins has similar but not identical jeans if you follow a group of fraternal an identical twins each twin parish raised in the same household each ... each the same food listens to the same conversations watches the same movies\nNow if you find differences between identical twins as it grew\nFraternal twins as a group that suggest that biology not environment is the driver\nI asked John what some studies revealed about political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to a data set a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda Neves how long ago it's fairly dated data set a but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views and when we subject\nThese data to the standard twin design approach we did and did you find that there the political views were quite heritable [noise] um although people oftentimes misread the our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent\nOf our political views or come from a genetics but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science so many people didn't like that at all\nUh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was less genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic\nThat obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not in zero but apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that\nAnd so you you basically you're able to tell in some ways that there is a closer link in the political orientation of identical twins than in the political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you that there is some element of the biology some element of genetics that is driving political preferences\nExactly no that's well put an end again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things like for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nA heritable when you see these you know when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say\nOne of the big implications of all this this work besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have\nWhich fresh inside a and and you've made the case that in many ways the more we were able to see the difference is between groups of people as inherent or biological\nIn some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talk to me about that idea\nYes when other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like handed us you know we used to think that uh if you were left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits\nMy father was left handed and the teacher you know this long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to to write with his right hand so we do that as as a ... something that need to be driven out\nUh of course now we understand that being left handed is very biological this is something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people are realizing that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do a then people are much more tolerant of that so we were wondering if perhaps the same thing happened with regard to politics\nScreaming on W E n J appointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program\nAt the end you dot

they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions\nWhat would you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath our deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because\nWe didn't always have this deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives there was a time when\nWe had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was often to the left of the more most conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a sorting of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years\n[noise] what I Would say to that argument is that I Believe we have always had\nDreaming on W.
