minds with this way tunneling into something makes you focus on it everything inside the tunnel becomes crystal clear the problem is you can't see anything outside the top\nPeople in the poverty ... are actually very good at figuring out how to stretch the money they have to make it to tomorrow or the next week studies show that the poor tend to be better than the rich at knowing where you can find the best deals the cheap tube of toothpaste\nSomeone who is poor as often consumed with finding solutions to immediate problems how do I get food on the table today I'm not thinking about problems that are a few weeks away like the eternity bill or gas money or a credit card payment\nAs your as your checking the prices in among bring the prices and figure out if you took care of all you have enough money for breakfast you are forgetting things you're paying less attention to your rent your kid's homework to all of the other things that make you know life complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words is attract the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow\nAnd we think it's something that poor people do many people do is another example we think the lonely do this so people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJust as the poor focus on the money they do not have the lonely tend to focus on the friends\nThey do not have the result is they try too hard to be locked in a conversation the lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't pay attention to watch actually being set the conversation\nFalters instead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward are flat footed what happens as a result people know

minds\nHow do we know this isn't some leading hot ferry to excuse irresponsible behavior and out in ... wanted to test that hypothesis\nOf all this is true one thing that ought to be true is the same person when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich\nSo how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor

they get that income they're pretty rich\nBut like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once that the money gets spent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor so now we have the same person a month before harvest poor and the month after her this well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next ... tested the farmers on their long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched other research that shows for example that farmers who are well off tend to read their feels more regularly than farmers who are poor\nFarmers who are poor mostly focused on how to make it to the next week short I'm thinking\nTo be clear it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about it's all they can think about scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually look or how you perform on an IQ test\nPut simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's

us to use her middle name for reasons that will be clear in a moment\nFor as long as she can remember Judy has been driven really driven\nUm when I was in high school I was determined to be valedictorian so I took a sophomore level on our biology courts as a freshman in high school and I studied around the clock I had no cards I walked through the hallways with the note cards if there was a holiday party I bought the new cards and I'd also studied until two or three in the morning\nShe says she wanted to be perfect at school she eventually got to medical school where she felt she

you round with the team that means you go to all the patients and checking on their plan and adjusts medications et cetera is necessary\nAnd then there's usually a lunch conference where we have education and then in the afternoon we might take new patients in and keep following up on our patients\nAnd on some days that we get to leave at four pm some days we don't leave until one AM [laughter] and then you usually start the next day at five thirty or six in the morning and again [noise] um and you get one day off a week usually work eighty hours a week\nAs Judy's workload grew she started to feel she couldn't afford to waste a single moment instead of spending anytime relaxing she started to focus only on things directly related to her success at work\nWhen I first started it was just like really busy so I Try to come home and I felt like you know I just don't have a lot of hours so I Need to make the most of them was like okay I Need to make sure I'm exercising keeping my body healthy and they need to read and stay on top of things so\nI come home after pretty long day and I might go walking for half an hour and then I had read and then I go to sleep um but then as time went on I decided to\nTry to get in more exercise than like I never know and I'll get enough exercise and so I started spending all my free daylight hours\nIt's taken time and little steps but

explore the secret lives of billionaires\nStrategy become a wealth manager [noise] roof discovered that in order to manage money for the super rich wealth managers learn a lot about the private lives of their clients and they're very different set of rules that govern their world [noise]\n\nReal Cancun welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show\nFor wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance\nFinancial life but everything about their life give me some examples are the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kind of issues they bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth has managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager\nI Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins the series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing it to me um maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you started it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about there can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets\nPreferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSo it's really interesting because these professionals in some ways get to know their clients better than the clients own family or friends or even their own spouse\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that\nThe average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children\nBut they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nSo I understand you've conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book I'm Tony Little bit about the people you're meant to be a wealth manager you have to understand financial the law but this kind of world also calls for a certain psychological makeup about what

wealth manager you have to understand financial the law but this kind of world also calls for a certain psychological makeup about what kind of person becomes a wealth manager\nWill several of the people I spoke to describe themselves and only somewhat joke in terms of social workers for the rich [laughter]\nSo you you have to have a empathy and a desire to help people but also a very high tolerance for people who would otherwise seem to be so extremely privileged that you might be otherwise inclined to smack him around and say snap out of it you're lucky\nYou write in your book about the extreme lengths that some managers go to ... or to provide services to their clients or you write about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva who said that one of ... called her from outside a restaurant in London told me that story\nSo this is one of the first stories that I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was a while I was training to be a wealth manager\nEleanor told the story over lunch of receiving a phone call from a client who was in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant helped me find it and the client didn't identify the restaurants by name [laughter]\nSo imagine having someone call you from another country I mean obviously the country was identified but not anything remotely approaching a location\nSo you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix the problem like this but Eleanor somehow did she she determined where the client was\nAnd what exactly had been lost and got the local authorities on the case found the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy to pay\n... there are sometimes a client's do make requests like this not because you're acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test the loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management Hong Kong named David\nYes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client in which the clients said that he was in Japan and he was meeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed a desire for smoked salmon and that this client had promised him I think a thousand sides of smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David saying get me the salmon and David said on on your wealth manager not your fish monger and the clients I'd well today you're the fish longer and so David happens to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory in Scotland and he he fulfilled the clients wish\nAnd the client later told him I basically made up that story I wasn't sitting across from a Japanese\nFellow who wanted a thousand side to smoked salmon I just needed to see that you had the connections and the will to do what I wanted one I wanted and not ask any\nQuestions one thing that I got from your book is that there are important
