kinds of things rather than than real memory\nPeople would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural um lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those in church you know was easy right\nConservatives like older liberals embraced ambiguity now you may be rolling your eyes are even getting angry at these stereotypes but we all know there's more than a grain of truth to that so how did these two towns which I guess today refers to as liberal bill and conservative and\nGet this way when most of us think about how we came to our political views we tend to have a straightforward explanation we use our upbringing in life experiences as a basis for a political beliefs we imagine that our parents teachers in friends\nShape our views on everything from taxes and the economy to immigration and national security [noise] but what if I told you there's something deeper to those attitudes and drives that shaped the music we listen to the food we eat the politicians we elected\nThis week on hidden brain how the partisan divide in our country might arise not just from our upbringing and lived experiences\n\nOn a regular basis right before an election someone would share an article with me about how science proves\nThat the brains of liberals are stunted or post on Twitter let's say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\n[noise] these claims obscure something far more interesting and far more accurate there are genuine psychological differences between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts\nI remember one of the things that broke the Internet recently was the big controversy about whether people heard\nThe word Laura or heard the word ... but this idea that you know the way that we see here's something must be the way everyone else sees it and there's just this feeling of utter disbelief that other people might not see and hear the world the same way\nYeah it's just what we're used to it makes sense to us so I I Do think that's something we need to continue to pound away on that that we really are wired up quite differently\nLet's look at how this plays out when it comes to the subject of immigration here is Republican Donald Trump\nThey're bringing drugs they're bringing crime their rapists and some I assume are good people\nAnd here's Democrat Nancy Pelosi\nWe are constantly reinvigorated by immigrants coming to our country and their commitment and courage and commitment to the American dream like shoot down here and at first ...\nNow it's important to stipulate you know John that it's entirely possible these our politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nYeah I really think ah you know immigration defense or police law and order I think that's just really at the core of of who we are not the quarter of political differences\nSo you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us then it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police\nOr I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted of the president wants to\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know they only makes sense that they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safe from like\nAll right\nThere are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the actual legal considerations that are difficult to disentangle from psychological and biological trades will join another study these differences\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\n...\nPositive and negative pictures\nAnd he found they reacted very differently\nA positive picture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house or just been leveled by a hurricane um or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe had people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a electro journal activity or skin conduct on which is a common way of saying if somebody is just having a reaction having a physiological arousal to that a stimulus\nAnd what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of images because they're they have some emotional content but we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who was conservative\nThat is true that have been a a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different and the one that we did it goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we have\nThe most luck with a pictures of mutilation ... uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people you know without knowing anything about them all in all week would look at was the brain scan results and we could be incredibly accurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the base about\nLiberals brains when they looked at a mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the U.S to matter of sensory to\nAnother part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I took him in the ... century would be active\nBut it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of somebody's stepping on a rocky now goes right through their fucked you're some at a sensory too it'd be active and what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation and matter of sensory too\nConservative doesn't mean that conservatives are hard hearted or just means that that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find are consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents like my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics the shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you\nKnow\nA really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment and think about fraternal an identical twins\nIdentical twins have identical genes fraternal twins has similar but not identical jeans if you follow a group of fraternal an identical twins each twin parents raised in the same household each ... each the same food listens to the same conversations watches the same movies\nNow if you find differences between identical twins as it grew fraternal twin\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nI asked John what some studies revealed about political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to a data set a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda needs a long ago it's fairly dated data set a but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views and when we subject these data to the standard\nTwin design approach we did indeed uh find that their political views were quite heritable [noise] um although people oftentimes misread that our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent of our political views or come from a genetics\nBut known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science so many people didn't like that at all\nUh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is\nYou know fifty sixty Seventy percent comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not zero but apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that\nAnd so you you basically you're able to town in some ways that there is a loser laying in the political orientation of identical twins then in the political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you that there is some element of the biology some element of genetics that is driving political preferences and\nExactly no that's well put and and again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nA heritable when you see these you know when you subjected to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say\nOne of the big implications of all this this work besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have\nWith fresh inside a and and you've made the case that in many ways the more we are able to see the difference is between groups of people as inherent or biological in some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talked about that idea Jon\nYes when other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like handed us you know we used to think that uh if you were left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits\nMy father was left handed and the teacher you know this long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to to write with his right hand so we do that as as a ... something that need to be driven out\nUh of course now we understand that being left hand it is very biological this is something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people realized that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do\nA then people are much more tolerant of that so we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics if we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather oriented to the world and a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them\nThat this was the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions\nWhat would you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath our deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because\nWe didn't always have this deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives there was a time when we had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth\nNinety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sounds of a free press\nShorting of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years [noise]\nAnd it's not a newspaper and express what many will feeling in the country at the time [noise] southern states\nWere starting to the seat it was the eve of the civil war while the civil war brought the liberty to an end David show things of this moment as an example of destructive conflict that's because the conflict wasn't resolved to the Democratic process but through the bloodiest war in American history\nAnd a fence the southerners those who are are going to favor the fashion they're more committed to the institution of slavery than to the national democracy and so when Lincoln is elected and he poses the expansion of slavery interestingly he didn't oppose\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free front\nSeat slavery expand and that was a very controversial issue and many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand to maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize he was elected and a science fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see if they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery\nThey put that head of the democracy so now the conflict just defense into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength that they can also be in a credible source of weakness\nIn the question is do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history the answers been yeah and that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no\nAnd\nI'm Wondering if one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually\nWent in to say I believe very strongly that I'm right\nBut I Want to have these conceived the possibility that maybe there are others who have something of value or it may be that\nHistory will show in the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know and I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future I think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think that could be wrong there's a sense that if you believe in democracy so much there's only so far\nYou're willing to go and so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family who writes a family we have every family people fight they quarrel they disagree about all sorts of things but if there is love and the family the conflict only goes so far the love breakdown than actually the conflict convinced the family part [noise]\n\nIn the twentieth century the bonds
