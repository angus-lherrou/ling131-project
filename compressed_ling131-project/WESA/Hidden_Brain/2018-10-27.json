are designing the programs and of the political elites to make sure that Americans know that and they have seriously dropped the ball\nOne of the things that people have often noticed is that there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book\nIs that the gap is really between people who are cosmopolitan and their outlook and people who are

W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nExplaining partisanship as opposed to vice versa\n[noise] let's step back for a second and just paint a picture of how you've arrived at this thesis or you say that since two thousand the United states has absorbed an extraordinary number of immigrants and in some ways in will be very surprising if the sewage did not have a profound effect on politics\nExactly as states like California Texas we already are majority minority states meaning that the majority of the population are made up of\nOf people of color and most of whom are an immigrant descendents so the U.S census predicts that by twenty fifty one out of every four Americans are going to be of Latino or Hispanic origin I mean that's that's quite astonishing\nSo while there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do these families as you point out a calling for a relatively small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of the friction intention that's at the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public uh the fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that\nFor the average American voter or you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without proper documentation and that is a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected we'd walk polls show Marissa half of white Americans seem to believe that immigrants are a burden to us society and it's like majority saying that Latinos out to the\nCrime problem that's right and again if you actually look at the data itself right those those perceptions are not the reality particularly when it comes to crime so\nJust like many things that's happening right now in politics what people perceive what the truth is and what the facts are are very different from what the actual evidence it [noise]\nRapid demographic shifts ... and high not argue have created feelings of threat among white voters especially the white working class ... come in different forms [noise]\nEconomic threat as far as I'm concerned they're stealing draws political tract\nWhy don't Republicans on the hill understand the threat advanced all she has posed to the country and to them\nYou have multiple trends happening at the same time on the one hand you have these\nRapid demographic shift you also have views increasing feelings of threat among many white voters and simultaneously you also have a situation where one political party is seen as being more responsive to the anxieties of white voters than the other one\nThat's right I think the Republicans have really taken all of these multiple factors into consideration and used it to capitalize on a central message and theme that can really again mobilize their voters\nAnd the fact that their base is overwhelmingly white means that they can have a central message such as immigration that can activate and mobilize their voters into not only supporting their candidates but also supporting the kinds of issues that they want to advocate for\nThere's been some criticism that well this is a short term strategy and if they're gonna they're going to suffer in the future and that may be the case but for the president it's an extremely successful strategy as we've seen you've also looked at\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free

have increased you start to see the shift in the political behavior of white voters to support the Republican candidate and uh\nThat would be consistent with the theory that immigration is explaining the voting preferences of white voters you know we wrote this book before the twenty sixteen elections so [noise]\nFor better or worse somewhat say that it was ... to the ... of the outcome but it was just remarkable to us that when we were putting together this this book and our analysis is that\nFrom all these different angles not just of you know I'm cool white\nVoters supported but also the
