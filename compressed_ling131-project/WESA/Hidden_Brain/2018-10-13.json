general tendency to explain behaviors in terms of purpose or intent or [noise] or meaning is often quite a successful thing to do\nTurns out we live with other people who do have intentions and goals and foresight and planning and meaning behind their actions and so by and large that tendency to make those kinds of attribution to other people it's a good way to learn about each other is a good way to explain why are the people that something in the past\nTo predict how they're likely to behave in the future but the problem with\nAny kind of good tool is that sometimes we use it a little too much and that's what happens in these cases where you're trying to explain the behavior of something that doesn't really have\nA sensible explanation for some random events some chance occurrence some physical anomaly some weather pattern a that crops up that might not in fact have have a mind behind that\nThis is why we're fascinated by robots that move in unpredictable ways\nWhat we found was that when people were given a description of an object that made it sound unpredictable like you couldn't anticipate its actions that\nWhen people described it reported that have had more mental states they were more willing to say that the object has a mind of its own that it has intentions for instance and I don't think this is totally counter intuitive that that is a mind if you if you see for instance uh billiard ball sitting on a table\nAnd other ball comes along and hits it and that ball rolls often they're predicted direction where you don't you don't need anything to explain that but if you've got a ball sitting on the table and suddenly starts rolling around randomly\nWell then you've got something to explain in these cases\nSometimes people look to the inside of an agent give it a mind maybe the ball is possessed\nMaybe there is a demon controlling it a moving it around the table sometimes people attribute a mind or something when it's not there but they do that as an effort to explain what's going on in this uh autonomous and this autonomous agent and they're more likely to do that when an agent behave somewhat unpredictably\nI was over at a friend's house and my friend has a wonderful pool and he had set the\nThis underwater Roomba for lack of a better time to clean the bottom of the pools are the rules around the bottom of the pool\nAnd it goes into this completely random fashion right so just runs a couple of hours of cleaning the bottom of the pool and I find myself fascinated just watching it because the fact that you can't predict what it's going to do next makes it just more interesting and more a lot even away then something that moves in a very predictable fashion\nAbsolutely something that moves robotically very predictably that is just a mindless machine but when you're rumors going around randomly well\nNow it wants to go over there a little bit not wants to move over here and now it\nRealizes that didn't clean that side of the pool

room buzz having perhaps a little bit more of a mind than it really does\nI Want to talk to that have been about the subject of coincidences and I thought of you and your work because it feels to me that when something unusual happens to us and we stop and we say\nThat is weird I was just reading this word in a book a second ago and someone in the room around me mentions the very same word and and it makes you stop and look up just like I stop and look at that underwater Roomba\nAbsolutely that's a case where something unusual happened was unpredictable and you try to explain it you can explain\nThese kinds of random coincidences in lots of different ways there are lots of ... different kinds of causal structures we might be able to put on it um but some of them involve giving it more meaning that it actually has\n[noise] [noise] this is hidden brain I'm Shankar via down to in Greek mythology the hunter nauseous says was so enamored by his own beauty then he fell in love with a reflection of himself modern psychology shows\nThat we all have a little bit of noxious is in most of us like people who reminders of ourselves whether that's someone with the same name or someone with the same birthday [noise] most of the time such south love is amusing and harmless maybe even beneficial a sign of good self esteem\nBut there are times when falling in love with ourselves with people who remind us of our cells can be a real problem [noise] read them as a professor of psychology at Montgomery College in Maryland He studied something called implicit eco tourism\nWhich is the idea that many biopsies are unconscious and one very well studied bias was you get to some value in the self favorably protecting the self and so forth and so we simply got the idea that there are several different things that at least to some degree reflect the preference for the self an attraction to things that resemble the self\nLike having an affinity for someone with the same but stay or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo off your name\nSo we were originally looked at whether people named Dennis or Denise gravitate toward dentistry\nBut we learned pretty quickly that it's really hard to get data on those things so you know there aren't great direct rays of medical professionals\nThere is a guy named able who was able to document that was a review on this paper and now every time you say this I'm going to jump in and say a guy named able who was able to do something he was able to do a lot of things he showed that people whose last name is Dr or whose last name is the word lawyer named lawyer gravitated toward those two professions\nThere are lots of other examples Brecht looked at a massive database of millions of Americans names from the recently released Nineteen forties senses joined salmon if they were brought patterns like\nWorking in carpentry bakers working as bakers butchers working as butchers miners working as minor masons workings Mason so we looked at every\nSurname there is a currently the top two thousand surname that happens to be a career name and we looked at all of them they're laughing at them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forty cents us with something like a\nI think it's a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to grab it\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nTwo thousand ... names that happens to be a career name and we looked at all of them they're laughing at them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forty cents us with something like a\nI think it was a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names\nSo the obvious thing to say of course is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be carpenters is that the name carpenter probably originated from families who were in carpentry and so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both names and the choices\nQuite possibly but if you do the math you pretty quickly say it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people so if you assume that even over ten generations\nThere's a fifty percent chance that you did what your dad did and a fifty percent chance that he did what his grandfather did which is probably higher than reality you're talking about a a probability of less than one thousand already over ten generations in other words surname are so old\nAnd they change hands you don't want a woman named carpenter Marin County farmer for example that that's really it really just can't account for an effect anywhere near this magnitude\n\nRent them as looked at large data sets and public records that the Social Security death index or state marriage records databases with information about millions of Americans\nAnd he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds of funny effects like for example one listener called in to say she and her husband we're both born on the twenty fifth day of different months this isn't as on communist you might think\nBeyond what you might expect by me a chance\nThere's about seven percent biased in that direction so if you should have a thousand people doing that you have a thousand Seventy people doing that\nIf that doesn't sound like a lot you're right you should think of emphasis eco terrorism as a tiny invisible nudge it won't shape what everyone does all the time but it does shape what some people do some of the time it's when you multiply these smaller effects over hundreds of millions of people that you start to see lots of examples\nBrits says that if you really love your butt day the effect gets even larger\nOr operational definition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number so have you got married on the thirteenth of the month you were quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number Thirteen as his birthday number\nAgain Brett calls this an implicit bias for a reason you may not be consciously choosing things as important\nAs your spouse or your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name or your birthday he thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names and our butts days and have positive associations with them\nAnd so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that uh and the the best bit of evidence I have that I've never bothered to publish this there's one part of people's names I don't like that much\nAnd that's their middle names you know the the joke about that as the sole purpose of a child's middle name it's a no when he was really in trouble and my additional come as no if he might be a serial killer someday right in the middle name is not nearly as loved us the first or the last name people feel very ambivalent about their middle name\nThey can be other reasons for ambivalence sometimes we dislike it with another person has the same but day if you were born on April twentieth you might hate the fact Hitler was born on that day to rectify instead of a consumer product happens to have your name on it but it's ...\nScreaming on double you say it's imported by

sometimes we dislike it with another person has the same but day if you were born on April twentieth you might hate the fact Hitler was born on that day to\nRead fines that if a consumer product happens to have your name on it but as poorly belt you are more likely to hate that product people dislike seeing something inferior in the world that has that name on it\n\nAs Britain and I were talking I realized something a little uncomfortable die myself\nHad fallen prey to him ... you know as you're talking right now I'm realizing something about myself for the very first time there is a there was a philosopher in India whose name was Shankar out my name and he actually taught a philosophy that is known as a dancer and I I've always being drawn to the fact that\nI find the philosophy of event that it'd be very interesting and the fact that Shankar I taught that philosophy\nI thought was just charming but now as I'm listening to you said this I'm realizing that this could just be implicit equal to I've\nRead his work very well and it truly is wonderful it's brilliant so I think in the objective leave a message and\nAt the same time it does make you think though that absolutely yes has this ever happened to you breath you ever think about yourself and for the ... the fact that we're getting a little personal here but uh I I I Can't resist being a little bit personal I Would say the probably the most dramatic example is that my son Matthew\nI'm his his last name as Poland his mother's last name was pulling my lesson is Pelham\nAnd I enjoyed her relationship with her before I developed this did not after I developed the theory to validate the so Europe Harlem and you got into a relationship with a woman named Poland\nAnd we are very different in most other ways that's about as much as I said are you saying that the names played some kind of a role I I have to think that I have to think and we were from different backgrounds different um\nDifferent religions I mean where we come from very different worlds and yet I was very attracted to her\nAt a worse yes she was attracted to me right yeah [laughter]\nI said I as I understand why you would sort of called this charming and I think if you do this work for a while there is a certain smiled at comes to your face as you sort of look at these connections and you sort of see you you understand sort of the choices that human beings make but I Do think there's something disturbing about it because I think\nThere is a very strong sense that I think most of us have I have the sense even though I've been covering the world or the unconscious mind for the last ten years\nI have the sense that my choices I deliberate choices that I've thought about them I've actually I'm making them intentionally and the idea that you're coming in and telling me that they have these hidden factors that come in and change how I think about myself it is a disturbing idea\nIt is a little bit disturbing and of course most people do what you and I did which has said well of course that applies to the rest of all but I in particular would never fall prey to re implicit racial bias room solicitor you get to them so most of us do tend to sort of separate ourselves from even our own findings\nBut I've become in the past decade or so comfortable enough for the study that I have to admit that I really never know for sure exactly why did something I mean sometimes I have a pretty good idea\nBut I don't I certainly don't kid myself anymore to say that I even usually know why why do what I Do I mean there's just too much research and much of what you've documented and reported on that show that buys these were completely unaware of no just sometimes powerfully drive us in very\nParticular direction so I think

least raise is tough questions about the degree to which we have free will so I think some people who have pretty negative reactions to this work are very threatened by it and the sense that it
