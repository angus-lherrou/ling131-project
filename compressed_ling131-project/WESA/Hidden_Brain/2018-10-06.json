us to use her middle name for reasons that will be here in the moment\nFor as long as she can remember Katy has been driven really driven\nUm when I was in high school I was determined to be valedictorian so I took a sophomore level on our biology course as a freshman in high school and I studied around the clock I had no cards I walked through the hallways with a note cards if there was a holiday party I brought the note cards and I'd also studied until two or three in the morning\nShe says she wanted to be perfect at school she eventually got to medical school where she excelled she graduated at the top of her class and quickly started her residency the new schedule was grueling\nYou can get in at five thirty or six in the morning and you round on all your patients and then you you round with the team that means you go to all the patients and checking on their plan and adjusts medications et cetera is necessary\nAnd then there's usually a lunch conference where we have education and then in the afternoon we might take new patients and and keep following up on our patients\nAnd on some days that we get to leave at four pm someday is we don't leave tell why am I [laughter] and then you usually start the next day at five thirty six in the morning and again [noise] um and you get one day off a week usually work eighty hours a week\nAs Katie's workload grew she

related to her success at work\nWhen I first started it was just like really busy so I tried to come home and I felt like you know I just don't have a lot of hours so I Need to make the most of them and it was like okay I Need to make sure I'm exercising keeping my body healthy and they need to read and stay on top of things so\nI come home after pretty long day and I might go walking for half an hour and then I had read and then I go to sleep um but then as time went on I decided to\nTry to get in more exercise than like I never know and I'll get enough exercise and so I started spending all

to be rich\nAnd all of our talk ham handed I had to really fast and\nReally rich why are you wearing a tax\nCuts after six without my farmer private jets you're either in the state of the Caribbean rich\nI mean it's one and then what would it cost ten dollars\nMost of us would never know what that's like [noise] but if you've ever being at least a little curious about the lives of the labor will face this next segment is for you\nBroke Harrington is a sociologist at the Copenhagen business school in Denmark several years ago she decided to explore the secret lives of billionaires\nOr strategy become a wealth manager [noise] roof discovered that in order to manage money for the super rich wealth managers learn a lot about the private lives of their clients and they're very different set of rules that govern their world [noise]\n\n... look up the hidden brain thank you for having me on the show\nFor wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance\nFinancial life but everything about their life gave me some examples are the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kind of issues they bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth has managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if you were to come to me I was me acting as the wealth manager\nI Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins the series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing it to me um maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you explored it it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial or is that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial west that your wealth manager needs to know about there can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets\nDreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program at\nThe end you dot edu slash I I I\nWas that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that's a financial with that your wealth manager needs to know about there can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets\nPreferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSo it's really interesting because these professionals in some ways to get to know their clients better than the clients own family or friends or even their own spouse\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that\nThe average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children\nBut they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nSo I understand you conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book um tell me a little bit about the people you're meant to be a wealth manager you have to understand finance and the law but this kind of world also calls for a certain psychological makeup but what kind of pushing it becomes a while the manager\nWill several of the people I spoke to describe themselves and only somewhat joke in terms of social workers for the rich [laughter]\nSo you you have to have a empathy and a desire to help people but also a very high tolerance for people who would otherwise seem to be so extremely privileged that you might be otherwise inclined to smack him around and say snap out of it you're lucky\nYou're writing your book about the extreme lengths that some managers go to ... or to provide services to their clients or you write about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva\nWho said that one of her clients wants called her from outside a restaurant in London tell me that story so this is one of the first stories\nThat I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was\nA while I was training to be a wealth manager Eleanor told this story over lunch of receiving a phone call from my clients who lives in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant help me find it and the client didn't identify the restaurants by name [laughter]\nSo imagine having someone call you from another country I mean obviously the country was identified but not anything remotely approaching a location\nSo you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix a problem like this but Eleanor somehow did it she she determine where the client was\nAnd what exactly had been lost and got the local authorities on the case found the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy to pay\n... there are sometimes a client's do make requests like this knock because the acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management Hong Kong named David\nYes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client in which the client said that he was in Japan and he was\nMeeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed a desire for smoked salmon and that this client had

and David said Milan on your wealth manager not your fish monger and the client said well today you're the fish longer and so David happens to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory in Scotland and he he fulfilled the clients wish\nAnd the client later told him I basically made up that story I wasn't sitting across from a Japanese fellow who wanted a thousand side to smoked salmon I just needed to see that you had\nThe connections and the will to do what I wanted one I wanted and not ask any\nQuestions one thing that I got from your book is that there are
