different kinds of causal structures we might be able to put on it um but some of them involve giving it more meaning that it actually has\n... this is hidden brain I'm Shankar Vietnam to increase\n[noise] this is hidden brain I'm Shankar Vietnam and Greek mythology the hunter nauseous says was so enamored by his own\nBeauty then he fell in love with a reflection of himself modern psychology shows that we all have a little bit of noxious is in\nMost of us like people who remind us of our cells whether that's someone with the same name or someone with the same birthday [noise] most of the time such south love is amusing and harmless maybe even beneficial a sign of good self esteem\nBut there are times when falling in love with ourselves all the people who reminds us of our cells can be a real problem [noise] rent them is a professor of psychology at Montgomery College in Maryland He studied something called implicit eco tourism which is the idea\nThat many biopsies are unconscious and one very well studied biased was ... value in the self favorably protecting the self and so forth and so we simply got the idea that there's several different things that at least to some degree reflect the preference for the self and attraction to things that resemble the self\nLike having an affinity for someone with the same but stay or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo off your name\nSo we originally looked at whether people name Denis or Denise gravitate toward dentistry\nThat we learned pretty quickly that it's really hard to get data on those things so you know there aren't great direct rays of medical professionals\nThere is a guy named able who was able to document that was a review on this paper and all that now every time you say this I'm going to just jump in and say a guy named able who was able to do something he was able to do a lot of things he showed that people whose last name is Dr or whose last name is the word lawyer named lawyer gravitated toward those two professions\nThere are lots of other examples brick looked at a massive database of millions of Americans names from the recently released Nineteen forty cents is joined Simon if they were brought patterns like\nCarpenters working in carpentry bakers working is Baker's butchers working as butchers\nMiners working as minor masons workings Mason so we looked at every surname there is a currently the top two thousand names that happens to be a career name and we looked at all of them they're eleven them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forties census with something like a\nI think it was a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names\nSo the obvious thing to say of course is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be carpenters is that the name cartoon do probably originated from families who are in carpentry and so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both names and the choices\nQuite possibly but if you do the math you pretty quickly say it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people so if you assume that even over ten generations\nThere is a fifty percent chance that you did what your dad did and a fifty percent chance that he did what his grandfather did which is probably higher than reality you're talking about a a probability of less than one thousand already over ten generations in other words surname are so old\nAnd they change hands you know when a woman named carpenter marriage is a guy named farmer for example that that's really it\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nThere is a fifty percent chance that you did what your dad did and a fifty percent chance that he did what his grandfather did which is probably higher than reality you're talking about a a probability of less than one thousand already over ten generations in other words surname are so old\nAnd they change hands you know when a woman named carpenter marriage is a guy named farmer for example that that's really it really just can't account for an effect anywhere near this magnitude\n\nRent Palin has looked at large data sets in public records like the Social Security death index or state marriage records databases with information about millions of Americans\nAnd he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds of funny affects like for example one listener called in to say she and her husband we're both born on the twenty fifth day of different months this isn't as uncommon as you might think\nBeyond what you might expect by chance\nThere is about seven percent bias in that direction so if you should have a thousand people doing that you have a thousand Seventy people doing that\nIf that doesn't sound like a lot you're right you should think of them ... as a tiny invisible nudge it won't shave for everyone does all the time but it does shape what some people do some of the time it's when you multiply these smaller effects over hundreds of millions of people that you start to see lots of examples\nRead says that if you really love your butt day the effect gets even larger\nOr operational definition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number so if you got married on the thirteenth of the month\nYou were quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number Thirteen as his birthday them\nAgain Brett calls this an implicit bias for a reason you may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse or your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name or your birthday he thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names in our butts days and have positive associations with them\nAnd so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that uh and the the best bit of evidence I have but I've never bothered to publish this there's one part of people's names I don't like that much\nAnd that's their middle names you know the the joke about that as the sole purpose of a child's middle name it's a no when he was really in trouble and my additional come as no if he might be a serial killer Sunday right in the middle name is not nearly as love this the first or the last name people feel very ambivalent about their middle name\nThey can be other reasons for ambivalence sometimes we dislike it with another person has the same but day if you were born on April twentieth you might hate the fact Hitler was born on that day to\nBrett finds that if a consumer product happens to have your name on it but as poorly belt you are more likely to hate that product people just like seeing something inferior in the world that has that name on it\n\nAs Britain and I were talking I realized something a little uncomfortable that I myself\nHad fallen prey to him ... you know as you're talking right now I'm realizing something about myself for the very first time there is a there was a philosopher in India whose name was Shankar out my name and he actually taught a philosophy that is known as ... and I I've always being drawn to the fact that\nI find the philosophy of event that it'd be very interesting and the fact that Shankar I taught that philosophy\nI thought was just charming but now as I'm listening to you said this I'm realizing that this could just be implicit equal to I've read his\nScreaming on double you say it's imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu slashed I I I\nSee that is known as ... and I I've always been drawn to the fact that I find the philosophy of aid that that would be very interesting and the fact that Shankar I taught that philosophy I thought was just charming but now as I'm listening to you say this I'm realizing that this could just be implicit Eagleton\nI've read his work very well and it truly is wonderful it's brilliant so I think you'd have to actively decision at the same time it does make you think though that absolutely yes has this ever happened to you breath you ever think about yourself and to some is affecting we're getting a little personal here but\nUh I I I Can't resist being a little bit personal I Would say the probably the most dramatic example of that my son Matthew I'm his his last things Poland his mother's last name was pulling my lesson as Pelham\nAnd I entered a relationship with her before I developed this did not after I developed the theory to validate the so Europe ... and you got into a relationship with a woman named Poland\nAnd we are very different in most other ways that's about as much as I said are you saying that the names played some kind of a role I I have to think that I have to think and we were from different backgrounds different um\nDifferent religions I mean where we come from very different worlds and yet I was very attracted to her\nWhere she had she was attracted to me right yeah so I understand why you would sort of called this charming and I think if you do this work for a while\nThere is a certain smile that comes to your face as you sort of look at these connections and you sort of see you are you understand sort of the choices that human beings make but I Do think there's something disturbing about it because I think\nThere is a very strong sense that I think most of us have I have the sense even though I've been covering the world or the unconscious mind for the last ten years I have the sense that my choices I deliberate choices that I've thought about that my ... and making them intentionally and the idea that you're coming in and telling me that they have these\nHidden factors that come in and change how I think about myself and he's a disturbing idea\nIt is a little bit disturbing and of course most people do what you and I did which has said well of course that applies to the rest of all but I in particular but never fall prey to re implicit racial bias or implicit he gets his them so most of us do tend to sort of separate ourselves from even our own findings\nBut I've become in the past decade or so comfortable enough of the study that I have to admit that I really never know for sure exactly why did something I mean sometimes I have a pretty good idea\nBut I don't I certainly don't kid myself anymore to say that I even usually know what why and do what I Do I mean there's just too much research and much of which you documented in reporting on that show that buys these were completely unaware of no just sometimes powerfully drive us in very\nParticular direction so I think I've just kind of let go of it ... it was disturbing to me when I first began to study it the serving as well as delightful and now it's become more delightful unless disturbing\n\nSomehow you're wondering how does any of this matter [noise] who cares if people born on the twenty third of September married those born on the twenty third of July\nWho cares if someone named Betsy carpet gravitated towards carpentry\nWhy does it matter if I prefer a philosopher whose name is similar to my own\nAt least raise is tough questions about the degree to which we have free will so I think some people who have pretty negative reactions to this work are very threatened by it in the sense that it suggests that very important decisions have at least a little note edging influence um\nScreaming on WGN appointed
