Tracy and I'm an award winning journalist former newspaper guy for the post darn glimpse falls he's\nBeen reporting on this story since about two thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the foothills of the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people ages Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the Adirondack pulled off the road a aside wrote off route thirty [noise]\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up two towns and went to sleep\nAnd on Sunday they you know woke up and above\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News takes the sound of a free press\nAnd all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they thought was his middle aged men peering into the tent\nWho looked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on it sunglasses a rifle yet a buck knife binoculars around his neck and\nVery calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he got\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen uh of killed before and I'll kill again I'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees\nAnd he started marching the kids off into the woods\nTook them into the woods near a brook and pears two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of there which he pulled out some real ups basically he had he had the each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun Adam and then the last one he tied so after we had the four people tied\nHe went back to the first\nBoy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids are spread out through the forest they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um\nThey heard vomiting sounds and then they heard bill does voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happened to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing dump whiskey with his life\nHe had been five times in the chest\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running Nick ... ran to his car Carol Ann ... ran through the woods [noise]\nDemand caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch next\nTo kind of monitor the situation I guess\nSo Freeman and um the killer laying on the debt chapter than our men come\nMen that the other two campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert\nLocals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted done a killer and Friedman laying down and the debts and when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun and he's going to shoot\nAnd the manner the gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly and clearly walked into the forest and thus began what was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning and about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road as you can see when the manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by\nIt was the scene like a never been seen before up\nThere today where you've broken down our manpower into a ... patrols men\nArmed with with all kinds of weapons rifle shotgun bloodhound that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods say eventually find\nThe man's car and they're able to run the license plate and it comes back with an ID A thirty seven year old Robert De Niro Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York as a fugitive police are looking forward today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape\nHave seven years now armed with a thirty thirty\nAnd night and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday to feel at night when the people got panic when you're all are well one of the doors are large people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and\nWe've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast I don't care that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left barbecue smoldering they left behind coolers said the man has dragged on what happened was Carol was able to use\nFried was full free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they\nPittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nOn it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follower lead that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest of the summer\nThat day a conservation officer named ... spotted Darrow\nNice breeze or drop your gun something of that fact and Guerra started running\nLow blocked fire four times got 'em in the back\nThe arm and the foot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead because he was just laying there but it you know took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\nSo they put them in an ambulance and they were rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with them they're really in the whole\nTime because they think that he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who's gone missing\nBut he wouldn't talk and it's at this point that the story\nThat I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things that's so fascinating about this case this law professor lethal Armand again is\nThe conflict between what a good lawyers should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording this other guy at the center of the conflict was a man named Frank Armani\nFrank H army\nAnd Brenda the lawyer in Syracuse\nAnd never know whether to pronounce it or money or or Renee that Mary Armani Frank's wife in our area and solve it they use urban but it is or money\nA couple of months ago producers Simon Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York Missouri money now in his eighties he's retired [noise]\nMy name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl\nUm where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well were there just to give a bit of background Mr Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk\nAway it was a fighter I like ... flights go fights like standing up for the little guy and that's partly why he became an attorney when you're fighting a cage for her defended you're fighting the state and tear it\nAnd he was doing really well he has well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert De Niro\nYeah bless your strong to take him out you need a forty five and a a to Z had the feeling that this guy is dangers and love of things are going to happen\nOff to go look for the bodies Guerra told the lawyers that Susan pets was in an era event of a closed up mine shaft\nThe mind ... about an hour south of the hospital a burden fed around me and in that moment were you scared were you excited like oh you rub ... it's a high but you're scared you're concerned yes fear your food if you do\nIn fact at one point looking in the rearview mirror they got a little bit we thought we were being followed by the state police\nSo eventually they pull over get out of the car\nWent into one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm\nLady friends was hanging out\nFor about thirty minutes bells you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then we went off the back door [noise]\nTook of driving the lady friends car to try to lose too\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here which measures as far\nAs we can walk up to this old abandoned mine [noise]\nWent out there last February with reporter Lauren that chemistry and towns supervisor of Mariah\nTom ... father so there's some a road that goes to the minded or what is fair to them on [noise] it was this sort of hilly area south side of the road to visit\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh\nNPR News station the sound of a free press\nThis hair is used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills fairly faith or know leaves and all the trees were\nI'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are mania and this is the only way they came in here\nSo so here we are in our Sunday suits and rebuild tragedy choose for is looking for the\n[noise]\nBut no worse look [noise]\nAnd then [noise]\nWe found this ... well you see the air shot fair they find\nThis air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off you care for that says get any such thing yeah you don't want to fly down in there and\nSo they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft got a flashlight that he takes out\nAnd then those you know my feet and left me down in there\nAnd as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak the blue shoe and blue sneaker\n[noise] and and a leg and I said to myself this the bitch does it end he yells back up to ... get me out of your boom ...\n\nEventually algae found the other body ... she was in a cemetery where Carol headset he left her but our money wasn't there went down the founder\nSo what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls so let's play that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right no you can't\nYou just care we took her to know to keep your confidences over ... under the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella so you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or substantial bodily harm\nThat will be that yeah that can be or will be okay right\nSo so in this situation the two girls are dead then there's no future crime it's over it's done\nAnd even if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up and even if they have hired detectives and even if the local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that\nBut there's no if the if the if the people who are already dead then you ... the the lawyers ...\nThat's right\nIt's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friend\nIsn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to to play this part of the system in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hates them even if everybody hates you even if maybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to do your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fights as hard as they can for the client the lawyer is the agent of his client only only the\nAgent of plant or also a citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a there's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened he

I was a good lawyer ...\nThrough art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and build you did a good body is case taught in law schools across the country everybody teachers the case it's like a touchstone what a people thing what if what if what if you will face so I went to a couple of\nClasses I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham why don't just stand\nUp um I agree um his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've been sitting in on these\nClasses and and talking to a law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught so widely as because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo from from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families\nInvolved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she didn't initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing your mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan mother\nWas the girl from Chicago She was a college student who'd gone missing while she's camping with her boyfriend and she's who are money indulge you found in the mine you know as as I explained before my interest really in the story um\nDreaming on W E s say disappointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on the master's program\nAt young you dot edu slashed I\nConcept of confidentiality and so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that you knew a lot of schools were teaching and and if you have any feelings or thoughts about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct\nUh 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and I think it's being taught is the right way to do things in an ethical classes totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd was the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes it was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal thought in their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and up\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that the unease my daughter's boyfriend was his body was found and that's that's\nAll we knew and we never really had any updates and nobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later and in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact I\nEven went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did\nIt was a total Eli a lawyer maybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of\nOf horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway\nJust to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professor of law students there um when they approached\nThis in with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain they I think the instinct is to side with the families and to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I was hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to\nCommunicate and all of that experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later I'm Still I I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because you don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI guess\nI'm Wondering\nDreaming on W E s say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute
