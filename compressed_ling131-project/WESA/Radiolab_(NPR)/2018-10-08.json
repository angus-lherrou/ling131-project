Barton Robert Krulwich radiolab and today to [noise]\nThey're gonna start\nThis show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before ... Hi [laughter]\nOkay I think it's good All right where we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning yeah start again what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson and\nThere is growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot and killed when I became a national\nThere was a lot of belly again and the press\nHow many people do is they killed in the United states about by the police each year how knowing keeps accurate statistics there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings and it struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will catch fire\nMe a writer and Harris than double John was very little to come sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a\nStreaming on W. E. N. appointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nIt struck me at the time that like what what we react to is all anecdotal once in a while one of these things will catch fire may arrive in Paris than divulge on their animals become sort of a national story\nAnd I personally was having trouble like processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trend in one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply you know the problem is we don't know they have no idea because nobody track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part\nI said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police department itself and the\nPolice department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nI'll buy a broader agency and I could tell you how many purse snatching their word Florida two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers are the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally\nBut everything that's done so far is incomplete\nYou know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian has an online database most of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the ones that sort of hit the public consciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought\nLet's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented Brazil\nBurst study had Florida it's a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records loss and\nLegally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places and ... the government has been sat down and started emailing every single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nAnd three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five\nYears worth of paper any paper generated when an officer fired\nA firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting now this involves a year of work county police departments is getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing that evolved probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThings that have been put together\nThe most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of flu show that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times oh it's just I'm right here to check it out yeah how many how many accidents you think you have sitting on this stuff is probably five thousand pages I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me six feet tall\nWe've got um broken down by county but you can see uh\n[noise] so a or B bay county\n... Boynton Beach uh all\nThe way through the alphabet and he basically just have a all these uh manila photos with tons of papers and by the costs and entire desk\nIs a combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings the represent a eight hundred and thirty one\nShootings I Hope every shooting in the state of Florida and the and in six years time two thousand nine to two dozen fourteen [noise]\nSo he did was go through all of this material scrape each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team didn't involve a an armed suspect was or chase\nAll the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions and left\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E essay Pittsburgh NPR News ... the sound of a free for\nAll of a SWAT Team [noise] didn't involve a an armed suspect was or chase [noise] all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those bullets than we thought let's like learn from these let's see how how we can compile the data and build a database and um [noise]\nYou know hopefully draw some conclusions lessens some solutions\nThis all went into an online database the Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there at last link to it from our website radiolab dot org highly recommend hopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency that keeps track of this stuff in any case\nIn the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it\nYou know kind of surprised us well the\nBiggest some sort of counterintuitive a line and this the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe says if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers they study about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ... makes it\nSeem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and he says you know what you see like on the most\nBasic level a are that about a third of\nThe police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is called mentally unstable\nAnd this is the case we're not taking a gas at whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there's some evidence of the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they called suicide by cop which is where somebody who is usually a mental Leo barely trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch standing behind a screen door and raises a weapon toward the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to shoot that's right and this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know the news briefs\nThat you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to Ben central question what do the numbers say about race\nI think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black and that is a that is out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nYou know what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tell us much right now but the breakdown between fatalities for those same demographics and it's we sat there going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of\nResisting arrest you know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty and numbers themselves don't really get you very foreign percent six kind of ... he says one percent of the\nMore you here it's just like yeah this is only one\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E essay Pittsburgh NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nYears you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixteen numbers themselves don't really get you very foreign percent six kind of person he says one percent of the more you here it's just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know it's back\nTo where we were in why we want to start this nasty nasty stuff still just moved by the single case individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nIt's up to lose somebody that cancer I've lost a friend that cancer recently in fact\nIt was a horrible thing and a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse for his for his wife children than it is for me\nI think it's a different thing when you're a person is killed by another human being and that human being is returned to the streets with a gun in a badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd this is something you do see in bed numbers even though the numbers themselves they they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer\nHas ever been charged and so it's it's just weird sort of like double grief yeah flick past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right then if I'm\nTo get Mr Brown\nThan some of them and then\n\nOr so after the event ended up the community center crystal took a bunch of the mom bailed out in their cars and drove over to this like little gem shop\nLike you guys do this every every event or no no just wanted to know was there and has been telling everyone about\nThis being a joke to her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nSo no we didn't know anything about this but they must be part of the different types of learning part of just ... right right we all just simply trying to find our way is that first of all gathered\nLike probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because you wanted to show these women like here's how I cope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the largest age at certain point was talking to these two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house I come\nBack to like some deep [noise]\nThen I open my windows and I just knew when I go to my house she says if age comes or down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House [noise]\nMid sized one story house in the wind and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin\nThe kitchen cooking chicken never got\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\n... they went from the gym shop over to crystal [noise]\nMidsize one story house in the land and a lot of women hung out in the living room were drinking juice talking abandoned about his story crystal in her cousin were in the kitchen cooking chicken\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them you know their own stories these stories of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n[noise]\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together and\nThere was some earth wind and fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton we start to stay over eight inches of how\nWe sleep in each other bad on the couch you know a air mattress and it becomes like a huge sleep over and the rest of the corn asleep for up talking you know getting to know each other or the vice shows results like therapy for\nFifties let me ask but there was this moment when I spent the day with these women that really\nStuck with me I Believe are at a ... to ... and it was when\nThe lead some of us over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars like\nAbout twelve people out and about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we were basically just in someone's backyard just walking rude ditch patchy grad so we usually the video that\nMom's house probably over like right now and then the police caught attained behind them was probably right here and then the officer they hit their head um came in\nWe came and he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we call execution a vegetable garden 'cause the garden was in\nAnd all that that I Am then 'cause I'm when a when you know when they took him away in released into down in fact we came back here it's all you can smell was\nAnd so now like when you cut and like it's it's not it's it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions you get that smell like it just you get those flat mhm in your\nAnd it brings you right back here mhm yep and the twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\n\nSometimes we're starting to get ... some of the other one that started to cry [noise]\n\n\nAnd then you don't want me to uh take some yeah my find the best a lot of what about falling to me\nA couple of women enemy their phones man\n[noise] oh yeah\nAnd it's probably about these eight women who huddled together and\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E essay Pittsburgh NPR News the sound of a free press\n[noise]\nAnd then you don't want me to uh take some yeah my find the best about what about the phone to me\nA couple of women had to be their phone my\nAnd\nIt was probably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera with this sort of straight face a three to one\nThree two one\nThen we all started walking back to the cars [noise]\nI mean we're we haven't been in\nIt was also the great fight we saw that last week\nAnd I three o'clock in the morning [noise]\nThat's what I remember the and I used to tell you how do you live so far away\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nYeah my son's way it was about Fifteen minutes of that time I visit home I have\nTo go there all the time of horror\nMac yeah that would force how could you not\nYou know what you like you want to go take a chair\nSit there yeah\nAnd it's crazy because like if a if a cemetery like a little bit further out\n... law that is like a certain time every\nDay and it's just a little white man we share everything that I literally I think he does he like go have lunch with every day\nLike Dan is the be all the way I like going on and all of that and it's a little white guy that always sitting out do\nYou think he's chair of the whole\nI Know but I'm [noise]\nSo the trip to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happened to be there at this really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip\n[noise] or\nYou can even be deal with some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one year ago\nAnyone could imagine\nJews on stage with Michael brands mother Eric Garner's mother I watched\nWas loaded into the ...\nAnd it was rather than that a few of these women started called themselves the mother to the [noise]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\nAnd it was weird because in this short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into the thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nDreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute detailed on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu flash I I I\nMean weird because in this short amount of time [noise]\nThis thing that we stumbled into the thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing up and down the cop with a gun a man with a knife\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or death moment between the end if\nYou're going to get\nSo stay with us\nFrom this shirtless black guy and you show up there\nThat's the kind of talking to them cop were in the body can end this black man goes on ways pretty negative than any walking towards the cops once\nYou start learning from crazy [noise]\nLike I gets closer and closer and closer and finally the ... pulls out occasionally the other officers out it was added a free is behind him with his firearm out and the guy\nLike hunted down is approaching approaching approaching a protein\nAnd you get to them like ten feet of the cops and then the guy was\nFighting him fires the case or the guy holding the Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he goes over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then he changed central four cups and then\nThere may not a it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the probably\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot I wanted to try your best shot you want to die if you want to die you can die\nHe tells the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nA fan of counseling on T.\nV. to pick him up walk them over to the squad car put them in and the un\nHuh so this is the thing that you guys will use this video for what it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things\nYou know and and that's the points we at home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up and the guy leans into court judge that woman you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal command first warn them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that\n...\nAnd it's important 'cause their guys partner was holding a gun have you heard that hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to ...\nFree to explore freedom for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nMourn and let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that\n... and it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard that you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest in communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead I mean it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek isn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there\nIs a lot easier to see somebody whose name was and faceless and I got scared and I shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of a report that made the officer think of how we deal with this thing\n\nActually after we finish watching the video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nOn biking through the neighborhood as you mentioned on the front step waves of hatred what are you doing man dared does stupid set up a bit you and how close came to be in that ... me back was medication he wasn't doing drugs that he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now\nNo again are almost kinda like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\n... primary election among the winners they told me it just leads to his house militia county sheriff like shit would was elected sheriff of\nLinn county [noise] I Am really\nWhich is the county that Daytona Beach belongs to him and the other thing to mention is that a ... organization called her which has decreased executive research forum\nBig coalition of police chief and twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is the sanctity of human life [noise]\nAnd just a month after ... put out this principle to the biggest policing organizations in the world the icy pie International Association of chiefs of police and the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive\nConversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women\nWho have a have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing way policing is done in America or at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively it\nDoes I hesitate to use this word but it does make it does feel like reason for hope right and I sort of thought the same way too
