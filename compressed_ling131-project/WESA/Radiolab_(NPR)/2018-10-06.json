E. N. appointed by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute detail on a master's program\nAt the end you dot edu flash I I I\nWas so surprising that a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd\nThat is a that was out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nNear what is the percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for those same demographics and its weeds out they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were\nCarrying a firearm nine percent had a\nBlade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest you know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself is a good thing but for the down\nNinety One of the five Seventy or sixty the numbers themselves don't really get you very foreign percent six kind of ... he says one percent or more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the problem\nYeah I mean [noise] I mean what gets me is like the I don't know it's back to\nWhere we were in why we want to start this methane gas bill just moved by the single cases the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is\nLaw it's up to lose somebody a cancer I've lost a friend that cancer recently and tracked is a horrible thing at a very you know ten ten times a hundred times worse

badge in a you know in a position of authority\nAnd it's something you do see embed numbers even though the numbers themselves they they can't really tell you whether or not a shooting with legally justified what is clear is that over eight hundred plus shootings even the shootings where the person was unarmed only one police officer\nHas never been charged and so it's it's this weird sort of like double grief yeah flick past and present at the same time\nLike you can't put it away because it's every day is another insults kind of right now I'm having\nTo get his cars to brown

[noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over to Christel House [noise]\nMid sized one story house in Thailand and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin where the kitchen cooking chicken\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them or their own stories these stories of grief of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together\nService from earth wind and fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing instead of getting motel rooms again this is Natasha Clinton's we start to stay over it and how\nWe sleep in each other head on the couch

trip\n[noise] or you\nCan even read deals with some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one year ago\nWas on stage with Michael brands mother\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nJust a few months after that trip\n[noise] or you\nCan either be deal with some other Sandra Bland who I met she spoke at the Democratic national convention one year ago\nShe was on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother\nWatched as my daughter\nWas loaded into the ground\nAnd it was around this time at a few of these women started called themselves the mothers the movement [laughter]\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\n\nAnd it was weird because in this short amount of time\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really\nOf felt like at the time a support group and suddenly become\nComing up and down a cop with a gun a man with a knife\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or death moment between\n\nFrom this shirtless black guy and you show up there\nThat's the kind of talking to him and ... in the body can end this black man goes on race pretty big knife in his hand any walking towards the cops don't\nYou know crazy [noise]\nLike I get closer and closer and closer and finally the cop on the body can pull out the taste of the other officer Adam's Adam's frame is behind him with his firearm out and the guy\nDown is approaching approaching approaching approaching\nMe get within like ten feet of the cops and then\nThe guy was fighting him fires the case or the guy holding\nThe Nike falls onto his back on to this like cement driveway still got the knife in his hand\n\nAnd the cop who's got a gun out he goes over a kicks the knife out of the guy's hand grabbed him by the hand turns them over\nAnd then he changed central called four cups and then\nThey may not if it's not a smart idea to have a nice coming out of the police\nThe officer will say why didn't you listen to me and just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you real\nLucky you didn't just shot I wanted to try your best shot you want to die I Want you on a dog you can die\nHe tells the officer was um Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nA fan of our counseling on T.\nV. to pick 'em up walk them over to the squad car with a man\nAnd the UN's\n... said this is the thing\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nWas the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police bullets can't kill\nA fan of our parents really\nDo need to pick him up walk them over to the squad car with a man and the UN's huh\nSo this is the thing that you guys will use this video for what it says one of a multitude of videos that we show officers in the correct way to do things you know and and that's the points we at home or the officers use time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up\nAnd the guy leans into court judge that woman you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first warned them let them know what's going on a trigger control was another thing you know what that\n... and it's important 'cause there are guys partner was holding a gun have you heard this hot you might have just instinctively reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest of communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek isn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there was no connection there\nIs a lot easier to see somebody whose name was in the face listen I got scared and I shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of a report that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\n\nAnd actually after we finish watching a video and I was packing up she told me that just a couple of months after that incident\n... through the neighborhood as you mentioned on the front step ... what are you doing man dared does stupid son of a bitch you and how close came to be that wouldn't be back was medication I wasn't doing drugs and he was as ... as normal as me and you are right now\nNo again uh almost kinda like when I was with these women it felt like I was just in Daytona at this specific moment because it was just a few months after I left\n... primary election among the big winners Daytona they just say here's how militias county sheriff would was elected sheriff of Linn\nCounty\nWhich is the county that Daytona Beach belongs to them and the other thing to mention is that a ... organization called ... which has decreased executive research forum\nIt's a big coalition and police chiefs and it twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for the use of force and the number one principle rather than being something law and order law and order is\nThe sanctity

fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against\nThese guiding principles basically saying that being a cop is a dangerous job and some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the
