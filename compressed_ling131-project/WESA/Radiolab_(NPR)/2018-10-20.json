E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute detailed on a master's program\nAt CMU dot edu slash I I I\n[laughter] Facebook is [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] well the humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies that\nRight there are you the organizer\nIs one of the organizers up the gathering I'm Stephanie newer\nWhat are you calling faceless their same\nNurse in as in like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point so Stephanie\nIn this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook and these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [laughter]\n[noise] now\nWhat Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small\nPeaceful protest would turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook\nOne of the opening shot Facebook triggered hordes now in what would become a loud\nBut do Facebook rockets\nAnd global\nBattle embattled Facebook CEO today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches\nBut but rather something that I think is a is deeper than both of them free speech [noise]\nViolence against Rohingya Muslims what we can say in what we can't\nSay that again by like ... what we can see and what we can see let me learn right judge the front of me on\nThe on the Internet\nThank you Mr Chairman Mr soccer America got to\nDo you use them jak differently prioritize or sensors ...\nCongresswoman we don't ... the global for doing of censoring speech but there are types of what\nWhat what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictates what I can say on Facebook what you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of us can say on Facebook to digital documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off and die\nIn bullet points and if then statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe which made me wonder like\nWhat are these rules how were they written and can you even have one rule book right exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really\nPut it to the test ... so ah let's start back a on that morning and two thousand in the morning that you could argue started it all\n[laughter] [noise]\n'cause in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was a big group of Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nCool so if I so I'm just going to\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\nOne of whom was actually in that room at that moment in now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so at the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of us mostly recent college grads who were sort of called the site integrity team again\nKeep in mind this isn't nearly two thousands seismic change in this week and the Internet hierarchy this was like the deep dark path nice face time is now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had somewhere in the neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than\nMy space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of conference like room with a big long table each of them\nIn front of their own computer and things would come up onto their screen flags to Facebook and a leg meaning like I use or saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards\nThis is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing and and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then\nThat content along with an alert would would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were saying with either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason\nWhy someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and\nEverytime something popped up onto the screen the person sitting at the computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it out and at the time if you didn't know what to do\nYou turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and asked what do I do at this and they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you'd Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach\nWas there any sort of written standard or any common standard\nUh what kind of they had a set of community standards that they at the end of the day they were just kind of that one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one ... and basically all of this page said was nudity is bad so as Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad taken down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\nRise up fight for the rights that Brett\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but according to Stephanie mirrored those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized\nIronically enough through Facebook so to coincide with alive protest they just ... you know typed up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nThe title of our group a Facebook breastfeeding is not a team and it caught on the social networking website is under fire for any policy on loaded with them\nStreaming on W.

kind of thing to do with their kids in the room might want to put it out yeah you'll get back to Simon Adler\nSo as we just heard before the break a Facebook is trying to do two competing things at once they're trying to make rules that are just but at the same time can be reliably executed by thousands\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety twenty five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nI Would argue that this balancing act was put to the test April fifteenth twenty thirty three strikes\nAnd Carlos Rhonda Marilyn thanks very sorry for them to get up thank you I mean how can break we add some breaking news uh otherwise I wouldn't cut you off so abruptly Carla\nMonday to Fifteen twenty Thirteen just before three in the afternoon [noise]\nTo pressure cooker bombs [noise]\nThrough the crowd near the finish line Boston Marathon\nYou ask for it to begin to settle\nFor spring into action or just one man in a cowboy hat sees a spectator who who's been injured picks them up throws them in a wheelchair in as they're pushing him through the the sort of ash cloud says there's a photographer there any snaps is [noise]\nAnd the photo shows the runner in the cowboy hat and these two other people pushing this man who uh his face is Ashton from all the debris\nAnd one of his legs is completely blown off and the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then sort of skin and muscle and tendons it's it's horrific ...\nMeanwhile CBS studio on the other side of the country the next five minutes I remember snippets of the day [noise]\nFacebook employees were clustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news and\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage chilling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published online\nAnd it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the order of events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly [noise]\nSort of going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it this image is spreading like wildfire across their platforms it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone\nAnd so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however ... says\nNo the other people are saying\nThis as newsworthy\nEssentially this photo is being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which the media the receipts\nPush back well I was saying that what we prided ourselves on was not making those calls and there are no exceptions there is either or their mistakes were improvement\nWe made the guidelines for a moment like this ... the other side shoots back\nOh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking a downed like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines much have common sense here like the humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how\nDo you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of the stuff\nFried was slow free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nDoors box and in fact for reasons that are totally clear they decide to take the photo down but before they can pull the lever\nWord starts making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources and executive ... down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what your reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down yes yes that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook has just become a publisher ... but they don't see maybe they have but they've made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization yeah ...\nAnd this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like is Facebook is sort of collective scrapbook for us\nAll or is it a public square where you should\nBe able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now in news organization friends' parents\nDo you get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook is\nAnd this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a\nView us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you're responsible for your content which makes that kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and built products\nBasically ... and others that the company or arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where uh they can't be held liable\nFor much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however were were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what ... what really strikes me about all of this\nIs is here you have a company that really\nUh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective is possible and can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound\nThan what people find interesting or important what what people find newsworthy ... he'll give and I'll give you know give you a great example of this or that having\nJust six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of
