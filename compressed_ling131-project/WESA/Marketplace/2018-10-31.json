version they react extremely negatively\nHe says it could be that English only speakers tend to bristle that adds in Spanish because they want the candidates to appeal to their own culture comics that the main problem campaigns have is that the data on who speak Spanish and the community isn't specific enough\nYou know this might be the sort of thing that works better when you can target at the individual level like\nOnline advertisements\nYou're online behavior which you search for and what you read tells a politician more about what language do you prefer than yours if code does which means the future of Spanish political ads could be more targeted to your Facebook feed than what's on your TV [noise] in Austin, Texas I'm a dealer for market [noise]\nAll the time to start a new job running one of the biggest financial companies in this economy one would imagine that October two thousand eight would be just about the worst but sometimes you got to play the Andrew Dell right so

welcome to the program sir\nThanks a lot ... it's great to have the opportunity to spend time together\nOr as I noted or in the in the introduction you've been at this company ten years which means uh you took over ten years ago in the middle of the worst financial crisis this country's seen in a generation or more what what were those days like for a financial services company guy\nYou know at that point in time there was very little that you could do the the outcome that your company would experience as a result of that crisis was more\nThe result of the decisions you made prior to when you were deep in the middle of that crisis so are you going to work every day just kind of hanging on for the ride [laughter]\nNo it wasn't quite like that I think uh I think in my first Ninety Days as CEO I was a successful in having the stock price they're probably going to see how does that have made it a decade who are able to achieve that\nYeah um what is it or was it I suppose uh about financial services that they got you know what I mean you founded your first Spanish services could your own financial services company when you were like twenty what two or three or something\nTwenty two actually my my formal training was as a pension actuary so I I provided consulting services eventually that business evolved to where we needed a link between our computer systems and where the money we're sided and we linked up with Schwab and\nOver a few years we became Schwab is largest client and then Schwab acquired my farm a few years after that\nKnow your boss Charles Schwab who is still the chairman the board and and uh active in the company as I understand it also by the way like the second or third CEO I did in this series lo these many years ago but but anyway uh yeah

around and see that everybody's catching up to you 'cause fees are going down and and all of those things are happening that have to affect your business\nWell I don't think there's any organization that's generating the net new asset flows that we are the new households lows that we are the new account so so I don't I don't know that I Would go so far as you say people are catching up to us but more people understanding that\nIt is important to not only deliver quality service and quality advice to investors but also do so at a value that leaves more money in their pocket that's a good thing\nYou know we're we're a large institution three and a half trillion dollars we're focused on building an organization and rewarding our stock holders communities employees but but ultimately it all originates with whether we're doing the right thing by our clients and\nI'm a whole lot more proud of the fact that we also generate less revenue per dollar on every a client asset than anyone else of size\nDoes your ... when he was really or no you feel that way to generating less revenue come on\nAbsolute less revenue per dollar because what it ultimately means chi's relieving more money in the pocket of the investor and and and it was her money to begin with I mean our job is about helping them get outcomes that makes sense\nAnd to the extent we do that do reward us with more business I think that's a whole lot better way to grow then to try to extract maximum revenue from every client and an ultimately I Would say that chocolate view that is maybe one of the most important legacies of his pounding this company over four decades ago\nHow often do you talk to him every day I just left his office about five minutes with a headset on burn up show if businesses good uh what do you worry about as a guy who as you said managers reunion something trillion dollars worth of other people's money well\nCertainly the cyber ah environment is significant risk for for all of us um you know you're talking about thousands of the Thames every single day\nTo try to access clients' accounts for access systems and then of course the financial environment our country and
