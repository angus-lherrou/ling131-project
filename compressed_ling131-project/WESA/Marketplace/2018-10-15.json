those\nChen or maybe twenty five percent import taxes on a whole list of goods shipped by each side to the other\nAlso softer were qualitative things like just not buying certain things the other country selves and for our purposes right now one of those certain things as American oil which China has basically stopped buying Rebecca Elliot covers energy for the wall Street Journal welcome to program\nThanks for having the guy this it seems like a substantial drop in Chinese imports American oil what is going on so as the\nTrade tensions between us and China have escalated in recent months\nEven though China has not impose any tariffs on us crude the U.S exports to China actually drop to zero in August after about three hundred and fifty thousand barrels a day of crude in the first half of the year so a very significant drop it\nAnd we're we're reasonably assured that it's all trade related right they just decide or we don't want to buy the stuff anymore we're going to get our oil elsewhere\nRight so it may be that Chinese companies are kind of looking to limit purchases of US soil in case they trade tensions escalate further and you know let's say tariffs were imposed

is that was in barrels a day\nThe U.S has customers around the world oil is going to Europe it's kinda like merica\nToo windy out fair in Asia the market is shifting in response to this decision on the part of Chinese companies rather than evaporating in any way that is like at least for for us exporters\nSo this is one of those things that it's not a a direct retaliation right it's not imposing new tariffs on American products it's the Chinese saying oh okay fine we're just not going to buy American oil 'cause we don't have to\nExactly said there are other exporters they're exerting that choice as of right now it does not appear to be significantly cutting into the demand for us soil but China has a large degree of buying power and of course run\nRight Rebecca Elliot running on um a
