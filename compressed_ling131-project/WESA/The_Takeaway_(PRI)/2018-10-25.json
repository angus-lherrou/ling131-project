acts more threats of political violence of any kind of no place in the United states of America\nThe by the evening at a rally in Wisconsin the president returned to his more familiar talking

to\nWe're already a very very well [noise]\nI Know we can keep it that way right [noise]\nQuite frankly it feels like a lot of Americans are not on their best behavior and that political rancor is having a direct impact on our democracy according to the Pew Research center there's a growing part is in gap between Democrats and Republicans on a range of important issues and partisan animosity has more than doubled since Nineteen Ninety four\nTo better understand this connection between politics tribalism and violence we turn now to Jonathan height a social psychologist at the New York

T. government\nAt first it was a left wing protests as we tended to have here in Brazil and then in the meantime or after the first one the second one that when it got bigger and bigger if\nIt was a simulated as a a right wing movement\nAnd then from then on they started organizing themselves or they went to the streets are against it again in two thousand Fifteen asking for do my roof says basement and then after a while they got that\nAnd well all this structure that was against the tea now is supporting John you both so now do this stream ride politician and things got really ugly in that point\nWhy do you think it ... this extreme to the point where last see not only um could potentially be elected well\nI think it has something of a sudden character because well I don't believe that we have a fifty percent of a population tend to fall or ride thoughts I mean it just to be ten percent thoughts\nEvery last election and less Thirty years but then there was so much rage and so much hatred\nAnd there was also a media campaign against the tea and focusing lost in the corruption scandals that we're serious obviously\nBut they weren't only ... BP's fault and then people this rage in fate should be paying a support for this terrible character this terrible guy\nThat people tend not to see all they see and maybe they don't want to have the exact conscience of while they are actually supporting\n[noise] he's mostly not exploiting um any of the conditions that exist or social divisions that exist in Brazil right now\nWill definitely mainly the middle class in satisfaction\nBecause well er during the the workers but the government's during the Thirteen years they were in power there was significant growth for the poorest but middle class stayed more or less the same\nSo they were after awhile closer to the poorest than to the reaches [noise] and this created some sort of this stuff this faction through a great part of of a population\nAnd now I think both so NATO is exploiting exactly that\nAnd pass the support of this people even though it's his policies won't do anything good for them they tend to do a lot as well\nFor the reach of north for the middle class\nI Want to read an excerpt from an essay you wrote\nFree delicious law free to perceive the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAnd you said quote it Brazil were not drowning under so much rage so much hatred sandwich yelling if there were just a single moment of silence perhaps everybody would be able to hear the alarm bell sounding something is in danger\nIn many ways including on this feels a lot like the moment in the United states that were living right now are you concerned about what you see is what's happening in Brazil and also what's happening across the world\nYes definitely it's a great a reason for concern\nAnd well perhaps we are now in the frontline of something a lot bigger\nI'd like to consider it a backlash of many other advances we've had in this last decade in Brazil that seems to be the case at least because there was this a progressive governments for Thirteen Years and then you have this reaction that very conservative and\nBesides the reactionary\nIn Brazil we don't have a strong democracy as you have been in the United states it's being the only Thirty years of democracy at this point\nSince the less dictatorship and you never know when the military will get in the way again we'll start gaining power and becoming something else so it's a great reason for concern definitely\nIn in terms of those in Brazil and Brazilian society who would be most vulnerable under a boss to NATO presidency\nWell first of all that's not really the poorest because she has a very violent program for fighting crime organized crime and without considering the risks of that\nAnd arming great parts of the population than giving license for policemen to kill without any serious investigation\nSo we know that in in the ... we'll see a lot more blood then we see now which is very serious\nAnd of course there will be also persecution of the aisle it'd be the community because he's been talking about that's his entire career\nWomen will suffer because well he he tends to be against policies of the quality the indigenous community as well he doesn't want to preserve the land\nAnd the original black communities as well so it's mainly the most vulnerable will suffer more\nAnd we don't know if that will be something similar to what we said during the dictatorship that was ... than those activists\nHe has said things that's going to that idea but we are not sure how his planning to do that or if he's planning to do that at this point is just a vague man that's and well many people don't want to see what it's called\n... says the Brazilian writer and author of the novel resistance Lillian thanks for coming on the shelf\nThank you again for the invitation was

yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press [noise]\nIt was ... [noise]\nWe continue now with my conversation with Sasha Jenkins about the restored version of his dad forests Jenkins Nineteen eighty two film Cain river\nCafe everybody on Cain river but that's how I was among\nThose people that didn't make him Maria where everybody equally [noise]\nYou don't need Thomas I never see you again [noise]\nThat's just the off the government [noise]\nAs a matter of fact that's about the dumbest thing I ever heard\nOf [noise] they don't\nWant me to you because of it out for two hundred years ago\nThat the film's protagonist Peter who returned home to fight for his land in Louisiana as he tries to court his love interest Maria when I sat down with Sasha he told me why the films still resonates with viewers in twenty Eighteen\nLand ownership is an important part of the story and there was a statistic that someone in the film said that like every week\nBlack folks are losing a thousand acres of land and\nBy the year X Y Z black people won't have anything and I thought that was a really powerful idea this sense this idea of ownership and land ownership and the relationship that cultures have to the land in as people who have who are of African native dissent\nHaving this relationship and report the land and the ownership of the land in this you know sort of European system of\nWhat it means to own land well we're here so if we're going to participate we might as well be owners as well that was an important sort of subplot in the story that when your mixed in with feminism color is in class there's a lot\nThere did you learn anything about your dad that you didn't now I didn't have a sense of through this film\nWell you know my parents split when I was young and\nHe moved on to another relationship the the woman that he was in a relationship with before he died she's from the region and she worked on the film and had a hand in sort of clue and him into the world and why it's interesting and important but inside of\nThe romance in the film I had a sense of what it might have been like for my parents\nYou know what that courtship might have been like because it was something very\nI don't want to say simple but something so tender about the way the characters interact that it's it's very genuine that you can't really\nYou can't make that up it would be super corny you know I mean someone said recently who saw the film\nThat it it has a very eighties vibe what does that mean well I was a kid in the eighties so what does that mean well you'll if you're a kid from the eighties you will love the uh parents have designer jeans everyone's we're rocking designer jeans everyone's but male and female looks great\nThere's a photo Matt you know I don't know for those who are old enough to ... days we used to have to take film right actually get a developed right at a little hut that was usually stationed in a parking lot there was a photo Matt\nYou know so the pacing you know there's an eighties pacing maybe like if you watch sixty minutes from Nineteen Seventy five it's like it's really hard you know it's it's really slow the pacing everything so quick now but I think the pacing of the film is\nIs in the spirit of the story he wanted to tell he was a documentary filmmaker so there are long scenes music is a very important part of the film and it was funny the editor was telling the story of how my father would make everyone listen to the soundtrack and made me listen to\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nInstances the music plays out in a way that it's almost like a music video which to me like almost like a long long for music video which in a in an interesting way was kind of ahead of its time or\nSort of merging with the emergence of music videos and I learned from someone that he was inspired by super fly for instance that that had like a amazing soundtrack and he wanted the soundtrack to almost be a character in the film and that's definitely the way it is\nDo you think that when you look at black film today in twenty eight teams\nDo you think that there is enough nuance uh black everyday life in those films similar to the way that your dad was able to bring that to light because I think that is one of the most compelling things that you're talking about is just how nuanced and how delicate these portrayals word do you see the filmmakers are getting better at\nThat well I think Hollywood is recognizing that there's money in this audience and people of color have more than one way to be and there's nothing wrong with not having a broad world view but Hollywood television in particular likes to put people in boxes why marketing money\nOkay this very specific group of black people like these hair care products that you can sell stuff to people\nI get it but I think this sort of box that that same litter you no pun intended black box that we've often been put in it's too small it doesn't fit anymore and um\nYou look at you know my man child is can be no you know you look at the sort of new wave of\nOkay here's some other black people to who have stories to tell who are great and so I have hope that things are changing but you know changed never comes as quickly as you'd like\nYou're also a filmmaker are there any projects um that you're working on coming up [noise]\nWorking on a four part film about the Wu Tang clan there twenty fifth anniversary this year and um to really understand Wu Tang clan I mean you can listen to their music and enjoyed it sounds great but like\nTo really peel back the lyrics is to have a real understanding of who they are and where they come from and as I tell people all the time to understand hip hop or blues or jazz\nYou know all these art forms of reflection of inter reaction to the environment and so to tell the story you got to understand the environment all the things that they went through to become who they are and so\nTo me the music is the cherry on top it's all the other stuff the environment the social climate all the things that they had to overcome that really make their story compelling\nIs there anything that you're taking away from your dad filmmaking process and incorporating it into the work that you do\nWell saying something every time I have the opportunity to make a film\nI say something you know I did a film called fresh stressed about the history of hip hop passion and you you learn about a Sunday Best and most people you say Sunday Best and they think it means wear nice suit but they don't realize it means in certain states that was mandated by their slaves and nice\nOutfit so they can go to church worship a guy that's white or supposedly white there aren't a lot of people looked like me you have the opportunity to say things and so I like to entertain people but I think it's also important to say something so every film I Do and my father would definitely feel very strongly about that [noise]\nSasha Jenkins is a writer and filmmaker\n... thank you thanks for having me [noise]\n\nDreaming on W.
