A. dot at Saturn flashed good question [noise]\n[noise]\nThis is the takeaway with tens of a a guy from WNYC NPR I public radio international in collaboration with W GBH radio in Boston [noise]\nThere are a few people who are considered larger than life at Christiana Ronaldo is one of them the Portuguese soccer player is among the greatest athletes in top soccer players in the world and among the highest paid\nIn countries where soccer is like religion and he's a profit like figure but this week and a two thousand nine rape allegation resurfaced in a scathing article in Germany star Spiegel magazine in American Woman named Catherine my your guy is speaking out for the first time\nShe told the magazine that Fernando raped and assaulted her in a hotel in Las Vegas in two thousand nine at the time she said she went to the police and even got examined by medical professionals ultimately she agreed to an out of court settlement for three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars\nBut now she's coming forward with her full story if she has the lawsuit documents to prove it some of which are signed by rebel do himself\nRonaldo denies the allegations and it's called the story quote unquote fake news his lawyers have said that they will sue the magazine joining me now to discuss this issue arena Ahmed freelance sports writer and co host of the burning all down pod cast\nShereen thanks for being with us\nUltimately she agreed to an out of court settlement for three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars but now she's coming forward with her full story and she has the lawsuit documents to prove it some of which are signed by rebel do himself\nRonaldo denies the allegations and it's called the story quote unquote fake news his lawyers have said that they will sue the magazine joining me now to discuss this issue arena amid freelance sports writer and co host of the burning all down podcast Shereen thanks for being with us\nHi thanks for having me something and we need some of your guidance on this story here so let's go over the basics of this who is the woman in question Katherine my your guy and how did she and wrote Ronaldo first meet\nWell Kevin or does actually from Las Vegas Nevada at the time she was twenty five and we're talking about the ... occurred in two thousand nine she was working at a night club\nAnd she was an aspiring models slash actress and she was there this was just before he was going to be traded to Manchester United so she was there to party which has a policy I guess you get to his entourage\nSo he according to the dirt Spiegel article and her account she noticed her pulled her aside and she wasn't really sure who he was she had heard of him I mean who hadn't heard of him but she wasn't shore\nAnd then he got her number texted her and invited her to a party and the details and just to trigger warning for anyone listening he was very aggressive\nHe I'm brutally assaulted her and even in the account that she has the story that he's a documented a sane\nChristiana run all to himself in a conversation with his lawyer has actually said that she said no several times she said stop\nThis is part of what happened and he confirmed that in his own words so I mean afterwards she was in shock as most survivors are\nShe didn't know what to do and she was very intimidated by him and under and then when she confided in somebody finally who advised her to go to the hospital and file police report\nYou know everybody's reaction was saying oh it's but he's so big so powerful and you'll get lost and the so coupled with her own trauma and the mounting fear of who he was because this isn't some too but player in a semi pro league this is arguably one of the best players and aspiring at that time\nSo it was you know it's pretty pretty mortified and she knew what she'd be up against it didn't help that her first lawyer was not as experienced and couldn't guide her the way that needed to be but I mean she was an aspiring actress she didn't have twenty thousand dollars for a retainer so I mean this is part of the problem with a system\nShore and this is a this is not the first time that they're Spiegel has written about this they wrote about this back in twenty Seventeen where has the U.S media been on this story at this is something that happened in Las Vegas Nevada um where have we been on this story\nAnd I will say this very honestly as because I'm part of the problem I'm part of sports media this has been nowhere and I absolutely find media and mainstream media football media particularly to be complicit in this rape culture because\nThis was at first of all not the first time he's ever been implicated in a sexual assault case the first time was in London in two thousand and five barely won anywhere it made no ways I think I just found a blurb on the guardian about it when I started this research\nMyself and one of my co host friend also had been talking about this for a long time we want to do exam and then we pitched this story to about sixteen different outlets and got one yes\nSo nobody was interested in it either they said it's not our beat or we don't know the reason football media is reluctant to do this is because let's not forget that Christian or an all do has an incredibly powerful PR team if she was if those particular outlets get cut off from the club\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nOutlets and got one yes\nSo nobody was interested in it either they said it's not our beat or we don't know\nThe reason football media is reluctant to do this is because let's not forget that Christian or an all do has an incredibly powerful PR team if she was if those particular outlets get cut off from the club or from his representatives you're in trouble I mean he's played for some of the biggest change in the world\nI mean I don't know and that applies to us media where football flash soccer is not um as popular here I Would argue with maybe regular football or American football that that fear you think is is applicable here as well\nAbsolutely because I mean I I pitched us outlets [laughter] and no one wanted to or nobody wanted the story and I'm like how can this not be possible but this is the first time that's happened to me\nThe same thing with David ... the current goalkeeper for Manchester United was also just before the euro's implicated in a very brutal rape case a sexual assault of two workers sex workers\nThat we we should also be clear though that that he that that ... has responded and denying these allegations right\nWell of course is going to deny them I mean he called them fake news but before he denies them let's not forget that he paid Catherine my work out three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars and in NDA like let's not forget that that happened and she has the documentation I mean now she's finally got appropriate legal counsel but the thing is is that\nYour speakers would not and this is something we have to address and we talk about media would not have printed that saved ... and cross the T's and legal has gone over there is a hundred times if Christie honor and all those teams gonna Souter Spiegel that would have done a year and a half ago to have an even issued a cease and desist so it's all posturing\nRight and it and it also is interesting to me that we are in this moment this me to moment\nA particularly when it come I don't feel it any industry a is safe at this point if you will quote unquote safe I'm surprised that there's been such a real lack of attention to this given for example the Larry nuts are stories that have come out in the sports world another issue so I'm I'm really surprised that the lack of attention from the American media here\nI'm not it was the same thing with David to hand look what happened with Kobe Bryant he was given the basic you know a pass by the media which is complicit in this I'm not surprised at all but I'm happy to see that her story is being shared now\nSyrian Ahmed is a freelance sports writer and co host of the burn it all down

version of American democracy join us\n[noise]\nThis afternoon it three or Ninety point five W E s say\n[noise]\nI'm tending to Vegas here with you on the takeaway starting today sixteen year old the New York state will no longer automatically be charged as adults in criminal courts next to the so called raise the age legislation passed last year\nAs a result sixteen and Seventeen year old being detained at New York city's notorious Rikers Island jail have to be moved out by to day New York in North Carolina where the last two states in the nation to make this change here to bring us up to speed on these two huge changes to New York criminal justice system is our dear friend Cindy Rodriguez\nThan he covers urban affairs here at our WNYC newsroom and you've heard her on this show before Cindy thanks for being with us high tens enough good to be here so what exactly are the changes going into effect today one is regarding housing and the other one is how the sixteen year olds are being charged right and right that's correct so\nSaid this law will ultimately affect sixteen and Seventeen year olds and but they're phasing it in so this is the start of the law said this is the first phase of the law so if you're arrested and you're sixteen years old today\nUm and it's a misdemeanor crime your case will automatically go to family court if it's a felony case you're um it will go to adult criminal court now there's been a specially youth part that's been developed in adult criminal court\nUm is the case involves sexual assault if it involves any serious physical injury if it involves a weapon um it will stay in this youth part an adult criminal court\nOtherwise it will go to a family court unless a prosecutor claims there's extraordinary circumstances and the judge agrees with that then the case will stay\nAnd what about this move that at the sixteen and Seventeen year old to have to be moved out of Rikers Island which we know has been the center of so much controversy around or just how people have been treated at the at the facility et cetera so today the day and what's happening yes\nTrue too so another thing to mention is that this law has not retroactive so that means if you're already serving a prison sentence you're staying in state prison it also means that if you are pre trial which means that you are currently detained and records\nFree ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAnd just how people have been treated at the at the facility et cetera so today the day and what's happening\nYes that's true too so another thing to mention is that this law has not retroactive so that means if you're already serving in prison sentence you're staying in state prison\nIt also means that if you are pre trial which means that you are currently detained and Rikers Island and just to give a free or national audience a sense of what Rikers Island is it's the second largest jail system in the country\nUm it's known to be a very violent and chaotic place\nSo if you were there and that means that you're awaiting trial you haven't been convicted of anything um your case will continue through the adult criminal justice system but you will be moved off the island and in fact as of yesterday I was told that all Ninety three sixteen and Seventeen year olds\nThat were on Rikers Island are now out of there now let's talk about where they're going to go so they're going to a facility called horizon said this is a long standing juvenile detention facility in the Bronx and so they've all been moved there\nNow why this pushed for this change I mean was there something about the way sixteen and Seventeen year olds in particular were being treated at Rikers were they not getting sufficient help what prompted this uh this change\nSo there's there's been it said the laws years in the making and the backdrop to it is that um I Believe it was about in twenty fourteen when federal prosecutors started investigating how sixteen and Seventeen year olds were being treated\n'em in Rikers Island and they found that guards were using excessive force on them they were striking them and the had repeatedly they were over using solitary confinement\nUm and so that was part of the effort to get them off of Rikers Island I'm In addition to that we have this young man named ... who was in ... he was arrested for stealing a backpack\nUm that case was ultimately dismissed that he stayed there for three years he was in solitary confinement he was attacked by other inmates and by correction officers and he was very traumatized by that experience um he was out on his family couldn't meet the three thousand dollars bail\nSo when he came out um his story was told by this journalist Jennifer Government from the New Yorker it got a lot of attention\nUm then he started suffering a lot with mental health issues and ultimately he killed himself so all of that as sort of the backdrop of where we are today\nAnd there's been um lots of talk particularly from uh New York city Mayor Bill de Blasio on a larger plan\nTo essentially shutdown Rikers Island um and it's complex by twenty twenty seven twenty twenty seven I'm of course we're all those folks would end up is is probably going to be contested very hotly\nHow does this fit into that larger picture is this may be one of the early steps in shutting down Rikers\nWell it sits in in the sense that in order to close down Rikers um the city needs to drop the population of people that are in jail by about half they need to drop it to about five thousand so um [noise]\nThis is one group of people that are now off Rikers Island and you mention that to move people off the jails is to close down records ... going to be controversial so the plan is that the city wants to close Rikers Island and then open up new jails\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News that the sound of a free press\nAnd so um [noise]\nThis is one group of people that are now off Rikers Island and you mentioned that to move people off the jails is to close down records out it's going to be controversial so the plan is that the city wants to close Rikers Island and then open up\nNew jails in ... I'm so these would be burrow based shows that are more integrated into the community um to do that um they go through sort of a public hearing process and there's been hearings already and the different neighborhoods where these jails are flooded for and there's been tremendous opposition so\nFar what about you mentioned clique brought her and I think that that's a fascinating and really important part of this conversation do we is there any talk about ending cash bail as opposed to just moving people in and out [noise]\nUm right so there is a whole debate about it and an effort to change the way the bail system works in New York um a lot of that change requires action from the state legislator which\nUm seems like it won't happen there is though something pretty interesting that's actually happening today too which is there is\nThis massive bailout that's being planned by the Robert Kennedy human rights foundation and say that\nUm math bailout is targeting sixteen and Seventeen year olds\nAnd women who are incarcerated um there's about five that's about five hundred people\nUm they were trying to raise five million dollars and the bailouts are supposed to happen throughout the month of October um and today was is the first day that we're expected to see some of these people being built out\nAnd I just want to let our listeners know that we did reach out to the mayor's office for comment and they told us and we are quoting the city is very clear on the east coast of raise the age that kids should be treated as kids\nEvery part of the planning process has been guided fight is pretty simple Finney Rodriguez covers urban affairs for WNYC thanks for joining us Cindy thank you can see now [noise]\nComment for this show up on our Facebook page we'd have to add the ... or leave us a voice mail at age seven seven eight might take your ideas and takes are a huge part of who we are let us know what you're thinking about\nThis is the take away [noise]\n\nI'm Peter O'Dowd sky high housing prices are partly to blame for a wave of homeless students overwhelming schools in Washington state\nThere are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them that's next on on here in [noise]\n\nAfternoon at one Ninety point five W E s say\nIf the new twenty Ninety models of caught your eye here's a thought about the ... to offer the dealerships will make donate your old car truck SUV or even vote and support NPR in Pittsburgh and you may even qualified for a tax deduction\nFried ... free to pursue the truth ...
