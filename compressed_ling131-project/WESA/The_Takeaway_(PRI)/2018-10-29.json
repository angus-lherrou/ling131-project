Bruce Hoffman\nTempers we've heard a lot I'm under this administration from the president of the United states that you know we've seen from the Muslim ban 'em to pointing fingers at groups that are violent like MS Thirteen that have a terrible um have committed terrible acts of violence\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News that the sound of a free friends\nAh we've seen three of attacks that were homegrown these were domestic ah acts of terrorism and violence so what our who is really the biggest threat to our domestic security right now Bruce\nWell two things first sully the twenty first century has turned out to be enormously in short time on any number of levels both in terms of political violence and terrorism but also in terms of\nAn order that is rapidly shifting and you know we have a spectrum of threats and it's it's I think it's difficult to sings what's the worst and what's\nThe most threat they're all threatening the roll back because they all kill individuals and they all target individual\nBut Bruce I've never I I have to say I'm not going to say my age but I Will say that I've never um walked into a school or up my place of work and fought him and then was really afraid for my safety in my life\nI think most Americans these days would say they didn't ever think about um being afraid for their lives when they go to the movies or when they go to a dance club I mean this is something I feel that's clearly different\n[noise] yes well it is it is there's no doubt about it but we shouldn't lose sight of what we said earlier throughout the United states history at times of great this of this polarization alienation we've seen an uprise repeatedly in this kind of violence before and after the civil war\nIn the late Nineteen century during the period of industrialization\nAnd modern communications we saw two presidents assassinated within Twenty years of one another\nCertainly in the Nineteen sixties and seventies I think that you know terrorism hate crimes\nRest and sit along the fault lines of our society what we're seeing right now you're quite right is far more acute now that it's being in our modern memories\nBut don't forget one Eighteen month period between Nineteen Seventy one and Nineteen Seventy two there were twenty five hundred terrorist bombings in the United states\nSo this isn't on the news is in terms of the violence unprecedented but in terms of the mood that both of you in ... describes\nAn absolute there's been a change I think that the security we felt recent years has almost completely eroded\nFree let's talk about that a little bit because I'm you've done or perhaps one of the most visible acts of resistance when you took down the Confederate flag talk a little bit about how the activist community is reacting to these uh recent events\n[noise] well I think that most of us view this as a resurgence of violence that has been a constant\nIn this in this nation and I think that it's dangerous and in many ways a historical to try to lump lights the premises violence in with all other forms of terrorism\nFor one white supremacist terrorism is the most common form of terrorism in the United states it always has been you have to remember at one point Birmingham, Alabama was referred to as bombing ham because the number of bombs that were being set off\nAt the homes of black residents who were trying to vote part of the problem of lumping\nWhite supremacist terrorism and with Islamic terrorism and some of these other forms of terrorism that her name is that white supremacist terrorism is unique in America and that it has a mainstream stake in the politics\nA lot of the views that are being espoused by these white supremacists terrorists are not far removed from the news that are being espoused by the G O P and particularly by Trump\nYou don't see as much pushback\nIn terms of labeling Islamic terrorism as as an Amazon terrorism because it doesn't have the same implications for American society America is not a majority Muslim nations\n... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nMachine of America now of course we have ... we had made a lot of progress from\nWhere we were in the past but she discussed what is happening now in a way that discounts the centuries and generations of this type of violence that we have seen in this country again I just I don't see the value and doing that\nBruce I Want to bring in I'm just really quickly here we know that law enforcement focuses on social media profiles our law enforcement focusing on far right extremist\n[noise] what law enforcement to to my knowledge it's certainly follow the federal law enforcement in particular is certainly following this and certainly concerned about it and understand completely that social media has led to\nThe you know preventing not just of course this most extreme most odious conspiracy theories and padded jerks towards tape but also served as a rallying cry for\nPeople who might have been isolated voices in the past and had no traction and their views to inspire and motivate and ultimately\nI debate or provoke others to engage in violence so I think it's something that's taken incredibly seriously the question is what the host of those social media sites what they are also doing\nTo police what's put on their sites and that I think until very recently has been something that was a vacuum at essence very little was done and obviously much more needs to be\nAnd breed just to to round out the conversation here we know that far right wing extremism as you've mentioned in white supremacist violence has lasted for has existed in this country for a very long time I'm Wondering what your thoughts are on how this is a reflected in almost in in white male rage in many ways\nI think that's definitely a component of it I think that our society socialize is some of us to have the expectation of having less rights I'm less access less ability to things I think that we need to create a society\nThat provide opportunities for every one part of this clashing that is going on right now I'm is people feeling like things are collapsing that they are not um having the same kind of economic opportunity that they once had and people are starting to fight and clashed with each other\nAgain what is unique about the United states is that in our history there has long been this ideology that the United states is reserved for white people particularly for white and then I'm In one of the other things that we see coming up and a lot of these incidents is that there's a history of violence against women among many of these perpetrators and that should not be dismissed or overlooked either\nBruce Hoffman is a senior fellow for counterterrorism and homeland security at the council on Foreign Relations and brand new some bath as an

was very frightening [noise] but it also proved to me how strong our community is when everybody turned out for the vigil last night and it's just making us stronger\nWe all need to be together and I think the most important thing is we have to start voting for people to get involved with that will change the gun laws\nFor the takeaway comes from babble on language EPA teachers real life
