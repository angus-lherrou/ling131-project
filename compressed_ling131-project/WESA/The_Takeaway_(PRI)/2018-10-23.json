the take away and WNYC senior editor Andrea Bernstein co host of the Trump big pod cast is back in the studio with me the latest investigation from the Trump team takes this deeper behind the scenes of the Trump Organization in a report that reveals a disturbing pattern of deception and fraud\nAndrea great to have you back on the show and it's always great to be here\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nThe Trump Organization is it a real estate company is it a construction company like what did they do so the Trump Organization starts building buildings which is what Donald Trump's father Fred had done\nThen Donald Trump diversified and he goes into casinos a sort of a number of developments and he runs into an awful lot of trouble with the banks because his project start failing banks don't want to lend to him so that starts this new thing\nAround the beginning of this century where he starts licensing his name and that's the way that the Trump Organization has always presented it we license our name we don't actually do the construction\nBut what we found is that\nDonald Trump and his children even ... junior in particular would go around and they would imply to people that their family had\nEquity stakes ownership stakes in projects and that the sales of these projects were going fantastically Ninety percent sold sold out these are the kinds of terms that were being used when in fact\nThey didn't have an ownership stake they weren't sold out the way that they probably just restructured was it they would get their fees no matter what so they would get paid the project would frequently fail and people who had invested in them bought in would lose their money and the trumps move onto another project\nAnd say the same thing we had begun to see this in various projects but what we didn't realize was how consistent it was the fact that it's a pattern was what was alarming to us because it suggests\nThat it is a business model it's not just a fluke is not just a project or a couple of projects combat\nAnd there's a about a dozen deals that you guys focus on in this episode and in particular there's one on the Trump ocean club in Panama City tells a little bit about why that's\nSo important so the Panama\nDeal caught our attention for a few reasons one is that Panama is a place in the world that has a\nLow rating on scales of corruption meaning that it is very corrupt at the time the Trump Organization got in Transparency International rated it worse for example than Saudi Arabia\nVery low worse than India so this is a country that is also known for being a place where various narco traffickers want to run their money money laundering and want to run their money because there's all of this banking secrecy in Panama this is a project that went bankrupt\nAnd we have we serve on earth through this extraordinary process our colleagues at ProPublica on earth the audio tape up even trumped in an interview she did in two thousand and eight where she was asked about this project\n[noise] [noise] it's ... percent of it for a luxury market entry\nNone of those things were true and although the interview was published the audio has never been heard before and you can hear how this mechanism work and it's okay to say I'm going to build the world's best building I'm going to build\nA such a beautiful building everybody's going to want to buy and there's actually a concept illegal concept notice ... free which is fine you can say that it's when you start to make\nSpecific material representations and you do it repeatedly that it becomes a question of whether there was actually a criminal fraud committed here now having said that a lot of the stuff happened a long time ago very far away so there are all kinds of\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they picked for NPR News station the sound of a free press\nI think what this deep dime has done is really sort of make it clear to us that these are not fluke situations but they're actually a feature of the Trump business model and they sort of\nReally changed the way that we view this licensing model which seemed like a really great idea of no banks want to lend you you just sell your name you don't have to worry about getting the financing\nBut that is in fact what happened in fact what happened is they got people specifically to buy in based on lies and miss representations early on what is\nThe Trump Organization up to now and it's funny that you mentioned the name and just over the weekend there were some New Yorkers who pulled the a lot of money together to get the name off of their building and\nI think that's the way they did they took they took a like a cherry pick her up and took off the letters of this building which is something that's happened since Trump's than president there are still Trump projects around the world that they are actively working on their working in projects in the Dominican Republic they're working on projects and India\nThey're working in projects in Indonesia both Trump sons are now on on the campaign trail campaigning for the causes and candidates of their father but at the same time they're also going around the world\nSelling condos to potential investors that we don't know who they are also the president hasn't fully divested from his businesses he has not there was even one point and twenty Seventeen when Eric's Trump admitted to Forbes magazine they actually we're still talking about it\nOfficially he's given up the day to day control but he can still make money from it\nAnd that is the thing that ethics experts say is so confusing you never know in any given situation whether he is making a decision as\nThe head of the Trump Organization because he could have some personal profit or if he's doing it\nBecause he's the president of the United states\nShouldn't that be I don't know illegal [noise] [noise]\nWell I think to some extent what has happened with Donald Trump and it's it's sort of like broken the ethics systems for example the situation is just come up with regards to Saudi Arabia\nBecause he's done business with the Saudis and he took this initially sort of muted position on what looked like the murder of an American journalist resident in Turkey and people were like well why is he doing that is it because of his business ties\nAnd the fundamental instability of this situation is that it's impossible to know now you also want to send out a little message to your listeners out of the podcast go for it right so we have been hearing from some people who had bought in to Trump developments and we know there's a lot of takeaway listeners and in some of these places in\nHawaii in Florida a lot of people in the San Diego area bought into Baja California\nIn Chicago we're interested in hearing from people who have bought in\nTo some of these

against discrimination based on pregnancy childbirth or other related medical conditions but forty years later how well is the pregnancy discrimination of protecting the modern workforce\nDeborah dinner is an associate law professor at Emory University and she joins me now Debra thanks for being with us hello thanks for having me\nSo tell us what is that how is this law meant to protect pregnant women\n[noise] well what the pregnancy discrimination\nActive Nineteen Seventy eight does and I caught the PTA is it a men's title seven of the civil rights act of Nineteen sixty four\nAnd title seven is a law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex as well as race color religion and national origin and what the PTA does is make sure that\nThe meaning of sex discrimination it's defined sex discrimination to include pregnancy and discrimination on the basis of related medical conditions including childbirth\n[laughter] so what are some of the limitations to this law I understand it's a conditional law can you tell us what that means\nSo what the pregnancy discrimination act does if it says that you can't refuse to hire someone just because she's pregnant or you can't deny a promotion to pregnant women because you have stereotypes about motherhood\nUm and it requires that pregnant persons persons affected by childbirth be treated just the same as other persons who are similar in quote their ability or inability to work\nUm so it's a it's a requirement basically effectively at the same treatment um so the biggest limitation of the PTA is that it's only an anti discrimination mandate\nUm and it leaves many workers bereft of protection and so what it doesn't require doesn't guarantee enough ferment of entitlement ten accommodation in the workplace and I think you see the news\nCan you give us an example of what that means I think if I sort of makes sense but what does that really mean in the workplace if I'm a pregnant woman in the workplace what does that mean for me\nRight so let's imagine I'm a managerial professional and a fortune five hundred company whose fortunate enough I'm lucky enough to work in a workplace that gives a generous paid leave 'em so if she broke her legs she could get say four weeks of paid leave\nSimilarly if she became pregnant and ... needed leave before childbirth or after childbirth she could get four weeks of paid childbirth because she would be treated the same\nBut let's imagine people who work in warehouses like in the recent New York times article they work in low income jobs um where they are much less likely to have generalized protections for disability so their employer gives no for example no light duty accommodations to any worker when they fall L.\nI'm In the workplace and anti discrimination mandate does not get you very far so just the requirement under the PTA that pregnant workers be treated the same as other temporarily that federal workers doesn't get that much protection so they won't be given light duty um which poses a risk\nTo their health and the health of their fetuses\nI Wonder if does this have anything to do with the fact that pregnancy is considered a disability and uh a clause in this law um because it feels like we're we're treating pregnancy the same as we would a quote unquote disability is not at the ...\nDreaming on W E s e is supported by Carnegie Mellon university's integrated innovation Institute details on the master's program at\nCMU dot edu slash I I I\nCan nights does not actually mentioned the word disability what the law says is that sex discrimination under title seven includes pregnancy and then it gives you an example and it says that for example pregnant women should get the same benefits as other\nEmployees who are similar or in their ability or inability to work um so where it might be helpful to explain a little bit where this idea of temporary disability came from\nFeminists lawyers in the seventies were really worried that any law that specially protected pregnant women would lead to hiring discrimination\nAnd so they promoted a kind of an approach that with sex neutral that analogy eyes between pregnancy and temporary disability in order to use anti discrimination as a kind of bootstrap to get pregnant women some of the benefits that were available for temporarily disabled workers generally\nUm and to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of pregnancy but again this um leaves the workers who most need protection um bereft of protection because it doesn't provide a positive entitlement a to the kinds of accommodations that are necessary for the health and safety of pregnant workers\nNow how does this law changed I'm In the past ... years and what do you see is the future of it\nYeah I think that law has evolved to 'em so for example and the two thousand Fifteen decision young the UPS the Supreme Court expanded what would count as disparate treatment on the basis of pregnancy or what would count as kind of a different\nDifferential treatment of pregnancy that was on last fall and so if an employer for example gives accommodations to a large percentage of its workforce um\nFor whatever reason but not to pregnant workers that now can be considered unlawful another advance in the law we've seen is that stereotyping pregnant women\nIs itself in a way that um leads to kind of an adverse employment action firing or a failure to promote or denial of benefits that those kinds of gender stereotypes are themselves\nUnlawful what gender stereotypes are you referring to\nWell for example I think that one of the calls I'm the woman from New Jersey who was told by her supervisor that she needed to take more time off work or or have a kind of less demanding job because she should spend more time with a baby\nThose are the kinds of gender stereotypes that are actually I'm Still very prevalent\nUm the notion that a new mother won't be able to be as committed to the workforce because she's now committed\nTo her child more than she has her job um\nThose are the kinds of gender stereotypes that could be ... of unlawful sex discrimination under the PTA\n...
