dollars a year in today's dollars from his father's wealth and real estate empire by the time he was eight he was a millionaire and total the president receive four hundred and Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire\nThat's according to a scathing investigation by the New York times one of the longest peace is ever published by the paper the investigation was based on more than one hundred thousand pages of documents charted the financial history of the Trump family business and the extent to which Donald Trump profited off the transfer of wealth from his father Fred Trump\nThe report detailed signs of tax evasion and very likely tax fraud involving sham corporations undervalued real estate holdings in schemes to avoid inheritance taxes\nIn total one billion that's billion with a beat dollars in wealth was transferred from the Trump parents to the Trump children instead of paying fifty five percent of tax on those funds the times investigation found that Trump's pay just five percent tax that's basically the equivalent of about five hundred million dollars in taxes that went unpaid\nJenny Johnson whereas a criminal tax attorney and partner at Johnson

taxes that went unpaid\nJenny Johnson whereas a criminal tax attorney and partner at Johnson more in Chicago and she joins me now Jenny thanks for being with the takeaway thank you so much for having me so lots to unpack here but let's start with your brought assessment is what the New York times found fraud there certainly\nParts of this that are fraud there are parts of it that are um tax avoidance our tax minimization that is perfectly well within the confines of the law and then there are parts of that that you know very significantly cross the line\nAnd we of course should mention that the president's lawyer told the New York times that the allegation of tax fraud innovations work quote one hundred percent false and highly defamatory\nUm despite that the times found two hundred and Ninety five distinct streams of revenue created by Fred Trump to help transfer this money to his son Donald Trump\nWhich is quite frankly I'm a pretty incredible and one of the ways that they did that was by creating a company called all county building supply and maintenance and they use that company to supposedly by things like cleaning supplies\nBut into times investigation they found that basically it was a shell company it was a company on paper and they would mark up the costs of products as a way of transferring the money is on tax gifts is that tax fraud\nI Believe that it is based on my review of the allegations in the times article if if those facts are true\nAnd one of the key concepts in tax law is that the economic substance needs to match what you put on paper and what you report to the IRS and this company had no economic substance it was nearly a way of funneling gifts from the president's father or to the president has siblings one\nOf the other things we mentioned at the top is that the uh the trumps also undervalued they're real estate properties\nAnd according to this investigation and the New York times Fred Trump's Nineteen Ninety five gift tax return he claimed that twenty five apartment complexes he owned were valued at forty one point four million\nBut the New York times says the bank value was actually near nine hundred million what about that is it clear that that's tax fraud\nIt's not as clear um because you need to understand the way that valuations occur and the kinds of discounting that is is actually appropriate and in normal when looking at a minority interest in a company\nSo you you start with a value and if if that value is wrong then everything following it is wrong and in this case it looks like that value was probably wrong\nBut it's not as clear cut because we we don't have the competing valuations done by another expert as of the same approximate date\nWe're looking at things that happened years after and things do change over the course of time I would say that that does valuations are highly likely to be wrong\nBut whether it up and and subject to civil penalties whether that amounts to fraud or not is more questionable\nAnd I guess the question that this is sort of all coming from our tax code in the United states which I think you know I Want to warn our listeners don't let your eyes glaze over when I say tax code um who does the tax code favor I mean is it something that wealthier\nFamilies and wealthier Americans are more savvy about and know how to make get their way around these types of loopholes [noise]\nI I think well the\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet the Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\n... code in the United states which I think you know I Want to warn our listeners don't let your eyes glaze over when I say tax code um who does the tax code favor I mean is it something that wealthier families and wealthier Americans are more savvy about and know how to make get their way around these types of loopholes\n[noise] yeah I\nI think wealthy Americans are more savvy but I also think they need to be you know I think an important thing to remember here is that the estate tax only applies to the wealthiest individuals and families you know it only kick thin now this year if when you die you have more than a eleven million dollars\nSo it's not like these people are avoiding attacks that is generally applicable to the rest of the population like when they are avoiding income tax and other people are paying their fair share of income tax\nIn a state tax you know it's a it's a creation of Congress that only applies to the wealthy and then there are other creations of Congress that minimize the amount those same people have to pay a and if you follow the rules\nUm then you're abiding by the law the problem here is that the rules were not really followed\nIt feels like they weren't followed but it also I think for a lot of Americans I think there's a sense of frustration among those of us who pay our taxes and don't you know find these loopholes and and are paying a significant amount of our income in taxes versus the wealthy who kind of seem to be able to get around us\nI think that's more of a valid complaint with income tax with a state tax none of the rest of us pay estate tax do the wealthy pay estate tax yes significant portions of it and you know sometimes they can minimize the amount that they have to pay\n... and what is that what you know is that normal behavior of the ultra wealthy in this country\nMinimizing the amount of state taxes absolutely normal behavior committing fraud to do it is not normal behavior or how do we distinguish the two you have to look at the amounts and whether the violation of allies will fall\nAnd you know the IRS has a whole set of penalties that that they used to apply based on how undervalued the properties we're in the estate tax returns\nJamie

I I think it's the key question in a lot of ways because overwhelmingly\nFocused on recidivism but I think we know that the part of it is a ... a health system for people who are in a pool health of a lot of people coming out or on parole and parolees dice is really is a violent bureaucracy and to a\n... as he goes to our rehabilitative process\nExactly and you know historically parole was conceived to help people returned to society find a place in the community uh after incarceration\nIt's really become very much a law enforcement function it's a ... a parole officers spend a lot of their time monitoring compliance with the conditions of a community release\nAnd are filing a drug test missing appointments or can lend you back in prison\n[noise] you have a different way of looking at ... am these distance [noise] yeah and it shows what that it said\nTalk about recidivism offending again a off the you've committed\nSpend a lot of their time monitoring compliance with the conditions of a community release and to a filing a drug test missing appointments or can lend you back in prison\n[noise] you have a different way of looking at recidivism these distance [noise] yeah and it shows what that is said criminologists talk about\nRecidivism offending again a off the you've committed crime or after you've been released from prison\nThey also talk about the ... and\n... mange permanently refraining from crime and I think the focus on the ... shifts how we think about the response to the problem of crime are and how we should think about people who are returning home after incarceration\nAnd the objective when we focus on deceased didn't\nUsed to socially integrate people back into communities try and fun to help them find a place for them in the families in the labor market in the neighborhoods in which they leave\nThe problem of recidivism takes his perspectives of society what ... might someone returning home from prison caused to the rest of us the perspective on the ... students asks\nHow can we find a place in society a for someone who is being separated from it by ... and\nA lot of the answers to uh the problem it free entry\nAnd not going to be found with criminal justice or thirties they're going to be found outside of the criminal justice system with department of health and housing\nAnd education and ... in the resources of communities I think there's an appetite for that conversation the there's a growing understanding that this massive experiment in mass incarceration there's not been successful\nIt's been very very expensive and it's been very damaging a for most disadvantaged communities\nBruce western is a professor of sociology at Columbia University and co director of the Columbia University justice lab Bruce thank you so much for joining us and thanks to [noise]\nAnd the next fresh air camera Jenkins tax about writing and directing her new movie private life staring Catherine ... as a couple in their forties trying to have a baby do any means necessary adoption IDF egg donor\nLie it bad for the turtle a fly all the eggs [noise] China\nThis afternoon at three Ninety point five W E s say\nEverybody works [noise] not in the same way or with the expectation some people don't even collect a paycheck but work shape who we are and how we see the world my no place like to dance for a living to bake bread through the night or hold the patients hand an emergency room [noise]", "show_name": "The Takeaway (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "03"}
