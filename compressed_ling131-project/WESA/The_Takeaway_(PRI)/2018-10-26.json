states we should not assume that those are my own with the groups not everybody who was registered as a Democrat in Florida or has a history of voting in the Democratic primary as state\nIs going to cast the ballot for Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump prefer given Democratic Senate candidate over given Republican candidate so just looking at you know who's winning in terms of more registered Democrats are registered Republicans cast ballots has all the problems are that that you could infer the author and worth keeping in mind especially with twenty sixteen is\nHow late movement in an election intersects with with early vote so you know the second call me a letter came out right around this time two years ago\nAnd so you know as we look at news events you know I don't know the

remember that a significant number of votes had been cast before those events take place and\nI think that that's something that twenty sixteen should be instructive on and give us a bit of caution\nAnd Michael is there a difference between people who show up to vote early you have states that allow you to come into it at a certain location before election day versus those states where you can vote via the mail you get an absentee ballot sent to you\nRight so when we first respond to that question you just posed which is the election forecasting question and\nA good weekend before the election twenty I'm sixteen I didn't and also some of the early vote in the streets were we're we're getting hired early voting numbers\nAnd um you know by and large we correctly predicted over what was going to happen and the twenty six you know rushing Nevada Colorado where we get very high levels of early voting\nA currently protected those are states that are correct we predict how Trump would have to win the election which was you would have to win a lot of these little ... on early voting states like Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin He ended up running all three of them on but again I I I think some there's some\nValue in the signals that we're getting from the early voting data and that really plays into the the question that you asked me which is that I guess there are actually on differences in the way in which\nPeople participate or Republicans tend to vote by mail that's not a universal truth\nThe Democrats tend to vote in person early and there's this uh this pattern that you see in the early vote on as you get closer to ... that's why I'm saying right now I'm not drawing idioms that says about what's happening in Europe and by the end of next week once we get the in person early vote in a number of states um will be able to tell what's happened\nSocial what about early vote and the impact on some underrepresented groups thinking about\nButter is of color or younger people are people who maybe aren't frequent voters is there any evidence or anything that you're seeing in terms of campaign strategy that is aimed at using the early vote to get those voters engaged in the election\nDefinitely democratic campaigns that that are focusing either mobilization strategies see early voting as far more friendly to the to the sort of lifestyles in calendars and\nYou know are developing refining get out the vote tactics there's been this sort of culture of of plan making which is a tool that that comes out of uh the behavioral sciences get people to visualize how they're going to get to the polls what time they're going to go how they're going to get there\nUm some campaigns calling people back or sending them a reminder of the plant

have multiple jobs are are going to school at odd hours you know and I think that there are a lot of opportunities with very targeted digital advertising to take advantage of of the sort of longer window and the knowledge in some cases about who's voted who hasn't run really tailor campaigns at the voters are still outstanding\nAnd Michael if you can you know kind of think into the future down the road maybe ten years or more is this what we're going to be doing that election day itself is just one day on the calendar and that majority of people voting in this country are going to vote before the election even happened\nYeah and and that's the way we used to build a long time ago back before Eighteen forty five and we said the uniform day after voting elections were held over a couple of days\nAnd that was to help you know the opportunity to travel from rural areas into the county courthouse developed on and so um this is nothing new we've had it for a long time in our history of our country and then we started doing it for a while and we started having a ... starting\nThe Nineteen seventies um states started liberal monitoring their early voting laws to permit first on\nNo excuse absentee voting that we saw permanent absentee voting and so many um owners were voting by mail in states like Oregon and Washington that George Bush was there\nJust sort of threw

historical precedent for that we had never seen before we'll hear about how huge sums of money in this year's elections are affecting early voting and voter turnout but also look at whether Trump supporters will come out in large numbers when the president isn't on the ballot\nYou've seen his numbers bounce around a little bit I think he's you know he's negatives aren't that much different than they were when he won that election but now obviously it's a different context as the talking about him interim election was not on the ballot\nAnd what's happening in states like Georgia with

W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\n[noise] so far posters and ... and started looking at the large early voting numbers as one indication of the energy on the left and on the other side president Donald Trump has been hitting the campaign trail hard to keep his base fired up\nAnd these are also the reasons why it's so important for each each one\nNow if you're going to vote Democrat don't bother\nPresident Trump's not on the ballot for the question is where the enthusiasm at his rallies translate to Republicans up for election this year\nPresident certainly hope so he's already held more than a dozen rallies that's not including one earlier this week in Wisconsin state he won by a single point twenty six team\nHe's a great guy scotch opponent\nIs it extremely liberal\nRepublican Governor Scott Walker is in a tight race against Wisconsin schools they bring tended to Tony Evers\nSo don't waste\nEarly for Scott Walker\nWhatever the outcome of the election this fall deacon that people will look to it as a bellwether for twenty twenty I spoke with Craig Gilbert the Washington bureau chief for the Milwaukee Journal sentinel to see Trump visits will energize the twenty sixteen voters to turn out for Scott Walker\nI've been thinking about you know the cost and benefits of the Trump visit and obviously it makes a certain amount of sense for him not to go to the suburbs of Milwaukee to go to Madison or Milwaukee but you go to a place like last week where he did well\nIn twenty sixteen but even in a place like why are you in a place like central Wisconsin when you look at his polling numbers it's kind of fifty fifty and this is again the more conservative leaning rural part of the state so\nHe's not it's not like he's more popular than Scott Walker in these places but I guess the thinking is that if you can mobilize a certain group of\nRepublican conservative voters and I talked to some people like this on the campaign trail that are pro pro Trump and there may be a little tapping on Walker um then maybe that's worth it\nWhat do you see as the reason that Trump's overall approval rating is not as high in Wisconsin as it was as we were moving into the twenty sixteen election and right after the twenty sixteen election\nWisconsin's one of those states where Trump's numbers we never very good and clearly\nThe difference in Wisconsin was the voters that didn't like either candidate meaning Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump broke pretty decisively for Donald Trump at the end so\nThey were always a lot of Trump voters that were very conflicted and had mixed feelings in some cases they just dislike Hillary Clinton more than Donald Trump so\nYou've seen those numbers bounce around a little bit I think he's you know he's negatives aren't that much different than they were when he won that election but now obviously it's a different context because we're talking about a ... election where he's not on the ballot\nHe's numbers or got a little bit better for example in the last big statewide poll\nThey're still in the forties they've kind of bounced around from the low forties to the mid forties but by any poll or you'd have to say that you know Scott Walker is a little more popular than Donald Trump or a little less popular than Donald Trump I'm so again there's started that mystery of what Trump does for Walker a\nOf what I heard after the twenty sixteen election about Wisconsin was you had two things going on one very energized Republican base especially small town rural ... that we hadn't really paid much attention to because we spend\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nBut the second was that liberal voters voters of color either stayed home or are they cast a third party ballot do you think first of all is that a fair assessment of twenty six teams\nWill I think um Wisconsin is one of those places where you can find examples are of\nGreat democratic turnout and soft democratic turnout in the classic contrast would be kind of mad at Madison area where everybody votes and everybody's going to vote this fall and they are going to vote just gets blue or bigger all the time and it's overwhelmingly democratic and nobody thinks that that's not going to happen Milwaukee has a much bigger question mark because you have\nA bigger let a minority population and Milwaukee has a history of dropping off in mid term elections in terms of turnout and that mattered you know definitely mattered and twenty sixteen I mean the big change statewide was the small towns\nI mean there's sort of two kinds of communities there and that that swing was so decisive so much the stories of twenty six and election but you've got the Republicans small towns and then he got the swing these small towns and there were like\nMore than five hundred communities in Wisconsin they voted for Obama twenty twelve and voted for Trump and twenty sixteen so those places\nThere is an element there are just swinging is\nYou know one of the things that I remember looking at right after the election was suburban Milwaukee Walker shot county which is traditional Republican area\nBut this was a kind of place where we had heard stories I'm sure you'd written many of them about these conflicted suburban voters suburban women who are upset about the Access Hollywood tape and Trump did not do as well and walk a shot as Mitt Romney did but Hillary Clinton didn't do any better than Obama dead [laughter]\nDo you think that's changing that we hear so much now about suburban women especially in these more affluent areas do you expect to see that walk I shall behaves differently this year\nWell this is a fascinating question because there's there's cross currents really interesting cross currents there because\nYou know the suburbs in Milwaukee are a little different than the suburbs and a lot of other cities it's size they're they're pretty Republican they have a real ripple and again we're talking about and some get many cases college educated voters higher income voters they do have this very Republican history that's unusual in a national context\nAnd so here comes Donald Trump and they didn't like him as a primary they kind of under perform for him in the general election but at the same time again that's been the heart of walk her strength in his election so you've got Walker pulling them one way Trump pulling them another way\nAnd I will be very interested to look at those numbers in the mid term elections because again Trump's not on the ballot but again there there are people that clearly Republicans would have qualms about Trump\nAt the same time there's like this partisan poll in a lot of these communities and they're very ... they're very active politically engaged and they have this history of just jumping into these kind of political wars with both feet and if Republicans want to\nTry to offset you know the the pretty big numbers are going to come out of Madison and Dane County they need a pretty robust vote out of these Republican out or Republican suburbs of Milwaukee\nSo great that being said is there a Trump effect in this election\nWill it's there it's but it's not something that the candidates are spending all their time talking about I mean the even the Democrats I think they see it as something that's a given and so they don't need to organize their\nTV ads around trying to tie Scott Walker to Donald Trump and also by the same token you know Scott Walker has always had this kind of awkward relationship with Trump they ran against each other droplet beat up on Walker\nBut Walker is very aware that Trump is popular with Republican voters so whenever he kind
