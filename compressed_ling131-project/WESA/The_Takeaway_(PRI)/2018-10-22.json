threats from the Taliban throughout the country heightened the danger of participating in these elections\nAt least ten candidates as well as dozens of their supporters were killed in the months leading up to Saturday So but the day after the election also saw heightened levels of violence follow the exact number it's unclear targeted attacks lead to more than thirty six people dead\nOn Saturday alone ... was reporting in Afghanistan over the weekend he's a correspondent for the BBC based in Islamabad, Pakistan\nWhere there were dozens upon dozens of violent incidents over the past two days in Afghanistan or including a suicide bombing and the ... of the capital Kabul was Fifteen people were killed in that incident we understand a suicide bomber with trying to get inside a polling station when police stopped him from doing that\nAt that moment he blew himself up killing people who're around him but having said that fool the tragic loss of life that that was\nBy ... gone standards this was an epic cheek Kelly\nBad set of day many people that fit that there would be a lot more major attacks I mean I've been reporting from us going to last a year and a half and and some of the attacks that we've seen in the last few months for example I I I've seen\nFifty people being killed in one single attacked him and we didn't see anything like that so from a security perspective that's me that where people who were killed that wherever attack people why in some cases prevented from voting we already knew going into these elections that\nEpisode will floating stations across the country we're gonna have to remain closed\nBecause of security concerns\nBought these elections was more peaceful than many fit they would the\nAre they considered democratic by the electric because of the attacks and the threats and many of the problems we just outlined\nWell enough to understand a lot of people are quite disillusioned with politics after years of violence and corruption\nI see that being in in Afghanistan over the last a week or so that was a lot of people who will also quite optimistic at times because they felt that in these elections are unlike in previous elections a number of the candidate for young with from professional backgrounds a wet educated ...\nAnd people felt that they were in a position to offer of guns are some real political change and move away from a kind of system of politics that dominated by\nEthnic ... and buy over the warlords\nHaving said that that has been a lot of criticism within Afghanistan or delays that it cut chewing the election protests are a number of polling stations didn't open on on on Saturday or open late or early voting hot to be extended into Sunday or what I was that some of the polling stations people would come and tell me that\nDespite having registered they couldn't find the names on the boat to the rules are problems with a a new biometric vote to verification system that was introduced a little bit of a last minute ready it designed to\nPrevent people both the more than one but because it was introduced so late a load of this stuff it seems one particularly well trained in how to use it and that helped contribute to the today so that has been a lot of\nCriticism of of the organization of these elections you\nMentioned a lot of the younger more educated candidates

parties on really a dominant into parliament most candidates standard independence even if they are affiliated political parties because political parties in in the country often associated with\nScience journalism and struggle for power so a lot of the people who stand as I say our our independence\nAnd that means that they can uh cultivate their own constituencies of support ready to that and he saw a lot of people who a form of journalists that civil society activists standing and these with some of the people who\nBoth his what what quite enthusiastic about alongside them do the rules so a lot of big businessmen\nUm the the children of full my so called warlords who was standing for the first time as well so what a mixed bag of candidate to a standing on a huge number I mean over two thousand five hundred candidates standing across the country in ... when I when I was there were eight hundred candidates for thirty three seats so the ballot paper\nWas about Fifteen pages long it's kind of look like a newspaper but really\nAnd there were about four hundred women who ran among those candidates what can you tell us about them\nExactly so uh that's more like ... different number from the the number of women who ride it in the last parliamentary elections in two thousand and ten to ... all around four hundred women who took part in those\nBut as I say that ... number of of women among these candidates who people are are more enthusiastic about um I was speaking to to to one a female candidate she's twenty six year old very well known\nA TV reporter in Afghanistan and she was saying to me that she was standing but could or she viewed the older politicians is basically being corrupt and acting like a mafia\nOr ... in ... and she wanted a Afghanistan to move away from them as what is the fact that there were there were four hundred women are four hundred women standing or I think around sixty percent of the candidates while under the age of forty\nAnd what about the current President Asif ... Ashraf Ghani he's been a president for over four years now does he still has support\n[noise] yes he said he doesn't and in fact one of the reasons why these elections I've seen is so crucial\nIn because next April will have presidential elections and they'll be much more politically significant because as I say\nThe F. um but it's equal system that is quite centralized said the president ready the key to the country and so these parliamentary elections were were meant to have taken place around three years ago and they've been to late ... ever since then\nI only just happen now so the elections was seen as a kind of dry run if you if you like for those presidential elections\nPeople wanted to see a wood enough off guns feel safe coming out to vote or will the results be accepted that's another crucial question because a previous elections have been marred by allegations of fraud and many say the same could happen again\nSo these are all key concerns that that the people have a about the next year presidential elections and we're hoping to get some kind of indication from these elections about\nHow we got\nSick undercover money inside Pakistan and Afghanistan correspondent for the BBC ... thanks for joining us thank you ...\n...\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free friends\nAre station in Italian Russian Swedish and other languages available and the app store or online at B.
