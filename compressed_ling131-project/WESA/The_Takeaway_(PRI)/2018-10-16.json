P. A. Y. monster dot com\nI'm tansy and Vega welcome back to the takeaway we've been talking about the Proud Boys and the rise of far right hate groups with Tonya Hernandez\nProfessor of law at Fordham University and the author of the forthcoming book multi racial and civil rights also with us is David ... author of all America the rise of the radical right in the age of Trump at a correspondent for the Southern Poverty Law Center\nDavid before the break I Want it to uh go back so you can finish your thought there about whether or not these the Proud Boys represent based off of what a professor Hernandez was talking about this as sort of a new ideology of white supremacist groups\nRight um well it isn't new and a lot of ways and ... ... like I say that they always claim that they're just for white and it's one of the reality of white supremacist groups is that uh you know who to believe they're pro white\nUh advocacy becomes a tax on other races but but that's not how they sell themselves and of course what really is the underlying dynamic here\nIs less white supremacist them than authoritarianism and that's what they're selling and authoritarianism ... crosses all kinds of racial and ethnic and religious boundaries\nI'm you know we've got one of our main\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nBut that's not how they sell themselves and of course what really is the the underlying dynamic here is less white supremacist them than authoritarianism and that's what they're selling and authoritarianism ... crosses all kinds of racial and ethnic and religious boundaries\nI'm you know we've got one of our main a sort of a ... groups out here on the west coast is called patriot prayer\nAnd they're headed by a guy who's Japanese American and his right hand man is big Simone guy so uh yeah ... and I see all kinds of non white guys joining their rights\nBut when I talk to them every one of them has what we call it right wing authoritarian personality\nTania you wanted to weigh in here and I just wanted to throw in the idea that um it's not new but yes it is in some respects and and as much as that now these white supremacist groups are ... are claiming to be welcoming to people of color\nI'm not just that they're pro white and this is just about culture and that they're not actually racist but they were OK with having non white members be part of their bandwagon\nAnd while they may be very much a bath or a tearing his angry with you there they're also spouting lots of pro white rhetoric\nThat I don't think we should be dismissing that you know that that that is to say that that did it in such as his about authoritarianism it doesn't mean it's not about race\nDavid Wright us yeah no that's absolutely right um it it is it's very interesting mix and it's also it's an interesting mix of all the new because\nUh they're marketing it in ways that that I mean to always the radical right was very backward looking and the shape of the ... radical right as very savvy very media savvy and very forward looking which is a problematic\nWell I also want to talk about the initial response to this here at least in New York City um the NYPD the New York police department said on Monday that it did have plans to arrest a nine members of the Proud Boys and three more anti fascist opponents but\nFootage from the fight that night shows the police arriving they disperse the crowd but none of the Proud Boys actually were arrested in there were some accusations that the police the NYPD didn't do enough\nTo stop the attackers there was also an assumption that um that uh there was support here for from the implicit support for the the the Proud Boys from the NYPD David do you think there's a level of support within law enforcement for right far far right groups like the Proud Boys\nYes I Do um I Believe that actually our law enforcement um system throughout the country right now as as being you know very heavily politicized by\nOrganizations like the oath keepers a which specifically you know this is simply a patriot very far right organization that is recruiting law enforcement\nUh and they're succeeding so yeah I've been out covering a lot of these and ah you know I Would say Portland police in particular are very prone\nTo uh acting in defense of the the right wing side and I'm very much uh acting against the they very much see\nAh anti fascist says the bigger problem and I think that's the problem\nTanya your your thoughts on what I find fascinating about this David is that I think another aspect of this is that even for the police officers who don't actually view themselves as being invested in this white supremacists authoritarian authoritarianism I think are very much swayed by the idea that\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free friends\nAs the major problem and I think that's the problem\n[noise] Tanya your your thoughts on what I find fascinating about this David is that I think another aspect of this is that even for the police officers who don't actually view themselves as being invested in this white supremacists authority and authoritarianism\nI think are very much swayed by the idea that what they are serving
