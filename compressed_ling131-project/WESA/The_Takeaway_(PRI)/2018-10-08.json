picture painted about it in terms of media exposure and so for me I Want to be a narrator on the city that's held more humane picture of our city\nIn one of your most recent plays you take on the issue that we are calling the school to prison pipeline where children are essentially criminalized and I'm at very young ages and um something that it's become a huge problem in in the United states how do you take a topic like that\nAnd bring it to the stage and keep audiences involved in such a heavy topic\nWell first of all I was an educator for many years and I was raised by an educator my mother was a teacher for forty years and highland park Michigan which is a a I call it a subsidy inside of Detroit\nUm and so because of that I I just have a vast knowledge about teaching I spent so much time and so many schools across New York city and all of you know the many public high schools in elementary schools\nAnd I have a very close and personal relationships or to teaching because of that as a public school teacher and private with teaching I've been in both\nUm and so it looking at that topic it's pandemic really and you have to look at it from really many angles and so my play pipeline is about\nLooking at it through a mother who's trying to raise her son but also a mother who's a teacher and a public school so we get to see her relationship to the public school system her son who goes to a private school and had relationships that private school system and we're looking at\nBasically within the two forms of education how institutions can fail children an educator\nBoth in the public school maybe infrastructure ally but in private schools culturally and both of those things are harmful to young people and can lead them to not having enough space for the total humanity and very most analyses young especially young black and brown boys and our nation and\nSo that was important for me to try to explore\nOur producer who is putting the segment together found a an interview that you've done with NPR and here's where you say\nI always say that we can't allow ourselves to be cherry picked you know or to be the flavor of the month flavors come and go and I think that it feels like we're being flavored right now\nAs opposed to being institutionalized and grown up from the bottom up and I think you were referring there to the opportunities the women of color specifically have within a the creative fields\nTell us a little bit about that what do you see going forward as now a newly minted MacArthur grant awarded the but also as a woman of color play right\nWell I think that change doesn't just looked like putting people on the cover of things or in the on the brochures of things and looks like infrastructure will change you know you have to change the leadership and we're seeing that evidence than large and small wave and our nation right now right leadership it come from the top down\nAnd so on because that in theater in particular it it means\nProgramming has decided by leaders you know how a theater as Ron How they're marketing department as Ron what kind of audience they're bringing in that's all decided by the institution and so it takes people within that institution and leaders within that institution to\nHave a very diverse um background and for women of color to being more positions of power and where they are making those decisions that so I think we need to see a shift and that sort of the work that I Do as an artist my work\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free friends\nAnd and so it takes people within that institution and leaders within that institution to have a very diverse um background and for women of color to being more positions of power and where they're making those decisions that so I think we need to see a shift in that for the work that I Do as an artist\nMy work is on stage but it's not just on to say just off of off the stage because it it it's a time in the world but I feel that it doesn't make sense for me as a woman of color to have work about people of color and then they're not to be people of color on the audience there has to be a an entire collective shift\nThat invites audiences of diverse backgrounds inside the house to have an experience together that's what makes theater special and that's what my work has to be the catalyst for\nIn Dominique I Do I agree with you a hundred percent and they don't know how we make that change\nIt starts first and foremost with community development I think that there's an assumption about what people of color will not spend their money on and that is\n... but by and large because people are not following the buying patterns of people of color to suggest that we don't have the money or wall spend it on things out of the significant is false\nI think it is off it's about cultivating a relationship that makes people want to spend their money on something\nThat's what the your head and figure it out but I Do also think affordability of tickets is a big deal and that needs to be that needs to be addressed in theater there there's too much of a disparity between ticket prices especially when you're talking about Broadway but the biggest thing I think it's community development which means you cannot expect people to come to you\nLeave their communities to come over to see something at your house if you are not ever willing to go to them\nYou have to be willing to take work out and said their community\nOffered them something for free I always use it in terms of like food I say you know why would I leave my house where I Know that I can cook [laughter] I have my food so it comes to your house and eat junk food and I don't even know that you can cook and you brought me they're all samples\nLike why would I spend money for ... each of food and I don't even know that I like your food that doesn't make sense you have to\nYou have to move me give me some samples to bring me out and show me that I'm not just a flavor but somebody that you're really trying to cultivate a meaningful relationship was that is the kind of thing that I think is missing and that we have to start doing and being way more active\nDominique Marie so as a playwright whose work includes skeleton crew and pipelines thank you so much so many thank
