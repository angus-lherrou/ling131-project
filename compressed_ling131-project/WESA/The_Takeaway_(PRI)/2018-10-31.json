W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nApproach Trump is spending even more time on the campaign trail trying to lift fellow Republicans in tight races in an effort to maintain control of Congress and order to keep his base energize the president is keeping his messaging simple\nTo violate our laws across our borders illegally will be sent back home court [noise]\n\nAnd we tell them that because they've got a long hike but they get they cannot come and\nThe way they want to come and doesn't work that way\nWith less than a week to go will the president's message motivate his core supporters to turn out like they did in twenty sixteen here to discuss this Christopher caught a lot of the White House reporter for political Christopher welcome to the take away\nIt's a pleasure to be here [noise] so let's talk about the president's messaging here as we said we've got one week before the midterm elections what are some of the big themes that the president is really knocking hard we've got obviously immigration what else are you seeing\nThe president is going very hard on illegal immigration as you mentioned he has brought up a very unlikely proposal but one that he thinks it's going to motivate folks which has a ten percent tax cut on the middle class the president has continued his barrage\nOf assaults on the media\nAnd in the last few days he has really dialed up his critique of the Democratic party that has meant something to really unified Republicans pointing to what he sees as kind of the extremes of the Democratic party\nYou know and I'm Wondering if president has made no secret of his thoughts on migrants coming from Central America for Mexico but the very beginning of his campaign so\nIs there a reason why he still really doubling down on immigration hum what does that strategy tell us as opposed to health care or as opposed to other issues that he should be looking at\nThis is a an election that's really based on motivating his base nationalizing the selection around his supporters because the question that Republicans have always had as there were a number of people who turned out for Donald Trump\nMuch of them Republicans but not all of them and the question was would they come out and turn out for\nA member of Congress or a candidate for the house\nAnd that has been a much tougher thing to answer and so if Donald Trump goes out there and says this midterms is really about me my policies are on the ballot you'll remember rock Obama said that and it turned into a scandal will Donald Trump has been saying that exact thing\nAnd it's it's a way for him to ah to make this about himself\nIn a way to really sort of rile up his supporters\nAre what I Would say about illegal immigration that he's focused on is this has been a constant focus as you pointed out I mean\nGoing back to the beginning of his campaign obviously earlier this spring he went really hard on the MS Thirteen gang and started using terms like animals to describe people which are generated a lot of backlash and so what he's doing is we we flash forward to the beginning of October\nAnd the president's political team started to get a whole bunch of polling data come back to them\nAbout this issue of immigration saying that in a lot of these marginal districts these competitive house districts where Donald Trump is not always seen as a help\nIllegal immigration was resonating with folks this whole idea of the Republican Party being sort of the protectors of immigration and customs\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nOh that whole issue was resonating and what happened was the the president sort of had this migrant caravan issues sort of land in his lap after they had already decided that they were going to really close on illegal immigration\nWell and and there's also the the recent news that the president has decided to send troops to the southern border we should also remind our listeners that\nThis migrants caravan if you will the folks who are migrating are still weeks away from even reaching the United states border so the president's doubling down on sending troops and reinforces the idea that these folks are almost the scapegoats in many ways right\nYeah I mean a lot of these attacks a lot of these statements are not grounded in reality as you mentioned these people are hundreds of miles away they would not reach here like you said for weeks and then in in the last day or so there's been this issue of ending birthright citizenship which um is has been\nReally sort of a the third rail um and and it has come up and it has worked in the president's favorite was obviously a question from a reporter was not something the White House proactively\nPut out there well let's listen to that 'cause I Want to hear that clip and then I Want us to sort of break that down\nAll immigration some legal scholars believe he can get rid of a threat to the ship without changing the culture ... water exactly right or have you thought about that is the only law it was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member of one and you don't need a\nNumber one number one you don't need that none of the key nothing to do as much as well as you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nI think the president was very frustrated and the folks around him were very frustrated over the last few days because\nThe the narrative or as folks go head to the polls and a lot of these states that have early voting a was all about domestic terrorism there was this obviously this is terrible a shooting in Pittsburgh and and ... you know\nEverybody sees these these things as the tragedies that they are but we have to say that what Republicans have been saying all along and they knew this was going to be a very tough mid term elections Donald Trump knew that as well\nAnd what they were saying was you know all these issues come up and they they last for a day or two and then they dissipate and so they never really knew where we would end what would we be talking about when voters finally start going to the polls\nAnd they were talking about these these domestic terrorism issues that we're not seen as a help to the party so the president's saw the the migrant Caribbean or despite the fact that it was never going to reach a the border anywhere near election day as a political gift that was the term that the folks around him were using and then\nI Would say the same thing for this question that came up yesterday I mean these are things that are going to come up and what he's doing even if it's not something that they're generating they're able to amplify the stories and to really give them life and I think that\nIf that is something that allows them to turn the page on the type of narratives that they don't find helpful they're going to do that\nChristopher ... is the White House reporter for Politico Christopher thanks again thank you so much [noise]\nOr for the ... comes from babble European made
