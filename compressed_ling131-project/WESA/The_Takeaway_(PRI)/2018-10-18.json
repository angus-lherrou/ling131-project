the sound of a free friends\nThat you're revert rose tuna may have lost the masters fans when he gave up that home run during Tuesday's close game the Astros are currently down three to one against the Boston Red Sox and the American league championship series\nBut as soon as plays on the team has also been questioned for reasons unrelated to his pitching since he joined the Astros last August in June major league baseball suspended as soon as Seventy five games for violating the league's domestic violence policy\nAnd while he was still suspended the Astros picked him up in a trade from the Toronto blue jays than the Astros made another move this week they announced a partnership to address domestic violence in the Houston area\nWhitney Macintoshes a reporter covering baseball for SB Nation thanks for being with us Whitney absolutely thanks so much for having me so there's not a lot of information public right now about the OSU nah a domestic violence charge what do we know about it\nSo what we do know is that he was arrested back in may early may uh in Canada for an assault on an unnamed female victim uh in that case then a a police report was filed but because it was in Canada\nOr things are just a little different things are a little bit more under lock and key whereas in the U.S we would probably know some details what we know trial dates were pushed back throughout the summer while he was suspended\nA and eventually just about a over a month ago the criminal case was wrapped up\nWith a piece bond which is about approximately the equivalent of a a probationary a you know restraining orders situation in the U.S he has a year of\nProbation he's not allowed to speak to the victim and essentially that was because the victim who lives in Mexico did not want to travel back to Canada to testify so they had no a reasonable expectation of connection um so that's where we stand the suspension has ended and uh yeah the the details are just a little\nFuzzier because we don't have that police report to refer to or an actual criminal trial that you know went under way\nSo let's talk a little bit about ... a current domestic violence policy like what is it it's only been around for a couple of years um but it's led to some long term suspensions like in the case of tuna yes\nI'm all these current domestic violence sexual assault and child abuse policy was implemented in twenty Fifteen I'm there have been a handful of investigations suspensions to this point no sooner was the third highest suspension so it was a pretty significant a sanctioned it was the third or fourth one this year actually\nI'm most recently Addison Russell of the cubs was suspended forty games\nFor a domestic abuse so are there have been players offended before and after you know he is not the first but again his situation is very specific because\nThere was a trade that was involved um\nBut MLD doesn't necessarily um similar to other sports and that they do not necessarily wait until a criminal case has been completed they do their own investigation they speak to the victims on their own time they may not speak to a victim uh at all when they take their a final decision into account um and overall the processed it a little bit\nA kind of like have seen this case it's a little bit um [noise] non transparent we don't have a ton of information about\nWhy a funeral was Seventy five games as Russell was forty a handful of players have been in the Fifteen to thirty range in the past few years we don't really know what ... investigation\nConsists of them um so it's a little tough and it does make it uh it does open them up to speculation quite a bit especially in the Senate case you were saying he's the third highest number of games he must have done something awful but we don't know um and we have no way of telling so it's a little tricky\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free friends\nWill shovel to play in the postseason compared to players suspended for steroids or performance enhancing drugs which are not eligible to play in the postseason so that's a little bit of a\nTricky line as well so there's definitely some criticisms are some issues of transparency as far as how their investigations go about but uh it's been a few years and you know uh I think a case by case basis it's worked on varying levels for them as they like it to\nThe Astros decided to trade to ghetto sooner while he was still suspended and I guess the ... and when he was speaking to the New York times earlier this week the general manager said this quote did we take a risk no question\nAre there are people that are still upset about it no question will do whatever we can at this point supporting the relevant causes and he went on to say that it was soon actually makes the team stronger what\nDo you make of that [noise] yeah I think it's a ... the way I've seen at the Astros have been a little a little bit calloused in this case um you know this is not the first time that a team has treated for\nA an a legit or confirmed domestic abuse or in order to win the world series the cubs did this with our oldest Chapman a stark closer currently on the Yankees a few years ago and it did win the world series and it worked and sounds kind of had to\nCome to terms with whether that was worth it with those tuna um the ... been a little bit more blatant about that what we're doing um you know he ... he throat good pitches he's gonna win he could win a World Series\nWhen ... what's interesting about this story is that the Astros now have a domestic violence campaign tell us about that what is that\nPurely for the optics of ... having gotten no sooner is that a real serious a campaign that they really have put a lot of energy behind what is this campaign\nI think it can be both but it does come across as significant PR then Jim ... owner of the Astros did openly admit kind of\nWe now that we've created for a suit and we want to make sure that domestic violence awareness is a ... in an important thing for the Astros foundation which has a thirty million dollar and down there and um so he and he kind of fed the quiet part out loud we traded for domestic abuser now we'd like to do the work in the community that hope hopefully makes us feel better about that it feels like they're trying to have it both ways\nIt it does um the players have been saying oh he's a great clubhouse presence you know ... flew an H J Hinch Jim and manager of the team have kind of been like\n... he's a he's a great player he can put that path behind him it's great and now they're donating I'm Around three hundred thousand dollars to\nLocal women's
