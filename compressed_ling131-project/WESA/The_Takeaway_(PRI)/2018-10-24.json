Honduras the migrants have now reached southern Mexico where many are requesting asylum others will continue the arduous weeks long journey by flip to the United states the president has made no secret of his feelings about certain groups of immigrants\nYou wouldn't believe they scrape all\nAre animals they're bringing drugs\nThey're bringing crime [noise] their rape is they are not a friend believe me I don't Jay Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown\nOf Muslims entering the United states\nSo we want to take some time today to do some fact checking on this caravan of migrants coming from Central America there are\nYour cameras and search by MS or you're going to buy Middle Eastern\nYou're going to find everything I guess what we're not allowed because I said I've got to\nHere to help us unpack all of this is Ron next and the New York times correspondent covering the department of homeland security Ron thanks for being with us hey thanks for having me\nSo lots of stuff to take a into consideration here we just heard the president's comments about uh they're being middle Easterners and the caravan he later said he had no proof of that but\nClearly this was a dog whistle I'm thinking who was in the caravan Ron what do we know\nThese are people that are primarily um migrating and and speaking to a an asylum\nI'm primarily coming from Honduras and I understand that there are some people from my colleagues on the ground and understand that there are some people from Guatemala and maybe a couple of other places in the northern trying all countries [noise]\nBut uh it looks largely like it's it's a a crowd of people were group of people coming from Honduras\nNow we also heard I'm Mike Pence vice president Mike Pence and Sarah Huckabee Sanders who were saying that there are about ten terrorists or suspected terrorists come into the United states every day that was something that they are set around this caravan let's take a listen to a vice president Pence\nWell it's inconceivable that there are not I'm\nA people of Middle Eastern descent in a crowd of more than seven thousand people advancing toward our border ... well let me let me is to districts on this I mean in in the last fiscal year oh well we are for him to more than a more than a\nA more than ten terrorists or suspected terrorists per day at our southern border from countries that are referred to in the lecture punish other than Mexico that means from the middle east region\nRon does other than Mexico mean from the middle east what is he referred\nTo their to other than Mexico ... includes everybody you know from Mexico\nThat was not a direct one miner okay\nNo no including people from the new other triangle and and that's primarily who's been referred to as other than to Mexico but it it really does include anyone who is not from Mexico and nuts because\nTraditionally up until a few years ago most of the people uh you know seeking to come across the border um either get asylum or crossing the border illegally were uh people from Mexico\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nMy concern about him is Thirteen um but I Do want to check with you to see is there any evidence of MS Thirteen still far being a part of this group or having any influence over this group\nI haven't seen anything that that suggests that MS Thirteen or ... is a part of the group um [noise]\nYou know the president's comments about ticket camera and go in the middle of a caravan and you'll see MS Thirteen I I don't know what your mess Thirteen would look like I mean they're certainly you know a members that have facial tattoos and things like that but not everybody who's ever MS Thirteen looks like that so [noise]\nYou know as far as as I Know um and from my colleagues on the ground there and and my coverage of this we have not seen any any evidence of that today\nThere's another concern um and I I I think this is a really a question of language and dog whistles out when it comes to race and politics and I'm Wondering are the Republicans nervous here on do you think that's why they're doubling down on this rhetoric just two weeks before the midterm elections\nI think immigration I'm you know obviously it it helped to president good good elected and this has been hit one of one of if not these signature issue I'm for this or administration\nAnd I think that for a lot of Republicans ... place while a particularly now you see cameras with this crowd of people coming to the country and you can point to see they're they're they are there are these people who are trying to to get into our country\nUm so I think for them you know it's it's an issue or that they feel they can gain some traction with as um you know political or scientific and pollsters are predicting a blue wave particularly uh in in terms of taking the house representative\nYou we've also heard my pen said that it is a the caravan of the Venezuelan plot um the president has suggested that the caravan as being supported by Democrats and George Soros his name has been tossed about run to you know can we confirm any of those claims\nUm [laughter] [noise] so there is no evidence um that the Democrats are George sorrows or Venezuela\nUm have sponsors of this particular caravan and and remember this is something that happened earlier this year too there was a caravan of people coming coming to the U.S and most of them\nActually didn't uh ... make the trip to the U.S it it sort of petered out before it actually got to the U.S border so ultimately we don't know what's gonna happen\nWith this group of people because they're about a thousand miles away\nRight which is more than

measure as well as the origins of the practice and the case against it today\nDanielle thanks for being with us on the takeaway thank you for having me so what is where did this ballot measure come from who wanted to eliminate daylight saving time in California\n[noise] this is from the state assembly member sponsored by a state assembly member in San jose and he heard about the issue from his constituents um it was his dentist actually who showed him medical studies that link that loss of an hour of sleep and the spring to increased stroke\nTraffic accidents and heart attack\nWow so there's actual um consequences to ... changes [noise] there's pretty good data that that loss of sleep it throws off people's circadian rhythms disoriented them and I'm puts them at higher risk of all of those things\nSo it's not just that we're grumpier there's actual real change interesting what what's the case for ... like what is the case that there that are in addition to any of the health concerns are there other reasons why a prop seven wants to be a at the white white folks are pushing props up [noise]\nYeah I mean it's a pretty unpopular practice to switch clocks so there's some popular support for keeping the clock steady or around also when we are using daylight savings time we have that more light in the evening\nAnd there is some economic benefit because as public health benefit because people are exercising their out eating at restaurants they're playing sports they're walking their dog\nNow why do we have daylight saving time in the first place can\nUs yeah the idea dates back centuries it was Benjamin Franklin who wrote the first proposal he was probably joking but at the time out if it was in the late Seventeen hundreds\nHe was living in France he was the American ambassador to Paris and it was his habit just leap a to work late late into the evening riding by candlelight until three or four in the morning and then he would sleep until about noon and one morning he got woken up by the loud sound at six AM\nAnd realize oh the sun's up I could be I could be using the sunlight to write by I don't need to spend all this money on candles um but it wasn't until World War one\nThat it was really adopted by countries it was a Germany the was the first country to Institute it and then\nI'm all of the countries that were involved\n... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nIt did use to save some energy it doesn't say much now it seems um it was then made optional between the wars brought back again in the United states for World War two\nAnd in California voters um voted to Institute that the daylight saving time schedule that we have now are in Nineteen forty nine\nNow some of our listeners may remember the last time the United states didn't switch to standard time which was back in Nineteen Seventy four during the oil crisis can you tell us what happened that [noise]\n[noise] yeah I'm President Nixon ordered year round daylight savings time for two years to save to save energy during the OPEC oil embargo\nBut it was incredibly in popular because it meant very cold there dark mornings especially in the northern latitudes and it was so unpopular that Congress ended the experiment I'm a year early\nNow I'm Wondering about you mentioned northern latitudes now is daylight saving time something that really helps um those of us in the north and maybe hurts those of us in the south or who are closer to the equator\n[noise] well I wouldn't say that it hurts people who are closer to the equator but the shift of light versus dark is of course much more drastic in the northern latitudes [noise] you know on the equator we have\nTwelve hours of darkness and twelve hours of light so here for instance I in California if this proposition passed\nAnd California did indeed go to a year round\nSaving time the son wouldn't rise in the in the shortest days of the year in LA until about eight but in the northern parts of the state that would it wouldn't rise until about eight forty five\nWow that's pretty intense you know we did ask our listeners um for what they thought about this idea and there were lots of folks who supported as we mentioned earlier you know there's a lot of support in California for this right now but I Do want to play you a comment from one California voter\nHello I'm Alexis from Los Angeles as a Californian and it's pointless measures that what is resources that could be used for other issues like health care homelessness education pathway for immigration prisoner farm\nSolicit him even if the measure passes it still needs to be approved by Congress and who knows how long that would take Ivo no\nDidn't we just got a coming up on the end of the segment here but it's not an accurate representation would it take resources away from needed services to make this change\nYou know the fiscal impact is really unclear it would require some extra money to coordinate airline flights and you know with other states but it also could save money with decreased accidents and increased
