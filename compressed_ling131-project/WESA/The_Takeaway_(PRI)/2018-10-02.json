Kate thanks for joining us\nThank you tend to you know so we are talking about a turning point in Mexican history tell us what happened fifty years ago today\nFifty years ago there was a real bust student movement that began in the spring of Nineteen sixty eight with students from universities all over the city and eventually all over the country\nPouring out into the streets and asking really for the first time for change for freedom for an end to police and military brutality\nFor the president of Mexico to step down for authoritarianism to end with it exciting and powerful kind of civic

down into the crowd in order to create a kind of chaos which would then permit the military to move in and harassed hundreds of people which is in fact what happened\nEarly in September of this year we saw major student demonstrations in Mexico city and\nI'm Wondering when you see you know students and young people getting very much political these days do you think back to what happened fifty years ago are you seeing similarities there and between what happens in Mexico today versus fifty years ago [noise]\nSure but I don't think students are pouring into the streets because of what happened five decades ago I think they are pouring into the streets because of violence and impunity uh from the government today I think they are pouring into the streets because\nFour years ago almost to the day forty three students were grabbed by police and drug traffickers in a tiny town and get it at the state of NATO\nAnd disappeared and they've never shown up and the government has done nothing or so the the students today yes there is a movement today there is a pushback against the government\nAnd in fact the Mexicans just voted in a person to be president um Lopez Obrador who

and important commission that is\nWe set up by the current government opinion yet though to provide support and attention to victims of violence\nThat it's not a government recognition of state

of you with young one's listening or those who might be upset by conversations around sexual assault this material it's explicit and be triggering\nI remember when I was about Eighteen and you know

was her own experience years ago that motivated her to make a new documentary film called consent\nI remember saying to him I'm reading one topic I\nRemember him kind of taking that as a cue to convince the\nBut the film explores more than just the conversations required before a sexual interaction in this current moment of me too and the emergence of decades old sexual assault allegations in the public arena\nYoung says we need to also be thinking about how to better deal with the trauma of the past and what does that reckoning look like in some cases she says it looks like dialogue I think\nThat more awareness I ... I think that people are starting to talk about it I mean especially given what's happened over the last year it's been almost a year since um the Harvey Weinstein allegations came out\nAnd there was a real trickle effect when that happens in Hollywood and in other parts of our society and we stopped talking about what consent looks like from cells in our daily lives and our ... and then they thing\nWhat is consent how is it being defined today and has that definition evolved\nA word you can also that question I feel about it is essentially an agreement between ... to people as to whether we move forward with sex or not\nBut it is incredibly difficult to define it just one of the things we found out in the peace and how you get to the point of consent is constantly up for debate one of the things that we're doing in the piece was offensive consent you know needing to\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nStill it is essentially an agreement between normally to people as to whether we move forward with sex or not\nBut it is incredibly difficult to define it just one of the things we found out in the peace and how you get to the point of consent is constantly outfits by one of the things that we throw it in the piece was ... you know needing to have a solid yes\nBefore you move forward with any kind of sexual interaction\nAnd that on the face of it it's great because I Would just dispel any kind of confusion around this topic but when we actually think about it you know needing to you have a yes when you strip someone's\nHand when you kiss someone not always seen as very sexy thought maybe that's a problem with our society and a ... for sexy and for a month and maybe we need to start redefining them\nAnd then the question becomes well part of the question in this film is what can be gained by talking to the people who have hurt you and I think that's a really delicate\nPlace to go I'm particularly given what we're learning recently about how long it takes how these memories can be stored I mean does it help to confront the person or talk to them\nI think that it depends on your own situation how trauma has manifested itself and how you feel about that particular scenario paying out\nWhat we tracked in this documentary is a case of two adults who ten years ago had sex one person who thought consensual sex a drunken incident won't puffing cool about rape\nAnd they sat down and had a face to face conversation\nI told myself I was in training and that the things I thought I ... just take a real like oil and not not wanting to face the next level if I had a question\nTheir soccer I don't remember how I got into a room wired and into a room when that happens any

and causing a trauma or an years of opportunities to Rosa and are are just started you in this process\nIt's interesting because at the time when we're talking about ... accountability looks like I mean we really don't have a lot of options for how to handle situations so often happens years ago or even decades ago um and said this is one option to face it with conversation and dialogue\nIsn't there I mean I Would also say it's a pretty dangerous way to approach it depending on your situation I mean do you recommend trying to do that with a licensed professional or is it something that you should just do on your own call the person or I just\nSet something up a lot of feeling yeah definitely um\nAnd he is a guy or even decades ago um and said this is one option to face it with conversation and dialogue\nIsn't there I mean I Would also say it's a pretty dangerous way to approach it depending on your situation I mean do you recommend trying to do that with a licensed professional or is it something that you should just do on your own call the person or I just\nI Know that something that I was up a lot of feeling yeah definitely and and I thought that it's definitely not for everyone and I wouldn't recommend doing without seeking professional advice to um [noise] yeah I mean that's a ... it's a very controversial technique it can cause ... and\nUm it can be seen as a too soft and approach but some people I mean some people do deserve to go through the criminal justice system this is just an alternative option that I wasn't aware of before making this documentary and that we wanted to bring to the table as a possibility for some people\nIs there any other way that people should be thinking about getting to that level of reconciliation without a face to face meeting and I think we often talk about forgiveness and a way that that's the end goal but is it\n[noise] no I mean and and that's where it starts to of justice sessions I should say that the end goal is not necessarily forgiveness um the majority of justice sessions allow the survivors to be in the driver's seat\nAnd so it's up to them whether they forgave or not or whether they want more sessions or whether they want to continue the conversation or whether they want to just\nLet it go there are obviously many different ways in which individuals find healing and find closure and this is definitely not a buell and ... everyone I Would say that there are limited options because you know as we all know the criminal justice system is\nOften fails us and when we want to handle these situations and six out of a thousand cases of sexual assault go without convictions and so\nWe have very limited option but this is just one of the ones that we tried to showcase hair\nAnd at the beginning of the film you mentioned your own experience um that you said falls into the sort of gray area of consent did that experience make you change the way you think about trauma\nI think that it's an interesting time to talk about trauma if the last few days have ... anything it's that trauma is real and lost in and can run extremely deep I've been surprised over the last year will say that that experience\nHave had a lasting impact and that I Do find myself thinking back to not\nVery uncomfortable moments and I thought I'd left behind longtime\nIs valuing is a correspondent for
