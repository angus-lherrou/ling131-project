raising the alarm about the tiny deeds of plastics and face wash and now these tiny invisible polymer particles\nSeemed to have worm their way into everything else on earth our water or shellfish\nEven our beer perhaps it was only a matter of time before we found them in ourselves that's right we are full of micro plastics and you know explain more and try to but others like the subjects in science\nIt's popular science senior editor Sophie Bush with [noise] with have you back nice to be here so ...\nWhen we go let's talk about how this word back to the researchers find these micro plastic\nSo researchers um they had a group of eight subjects I'm from countries all over Europe and Asia and essentially had these subjects keep a food diary for a week and then at the end of the week they were they took a stool sample from themselves and sent it to the researchers and then the researchers had the fun job of picking through that\nThey were looking for ten different types of plastic and they found these these plastic types that on nine of them and they were in all of the samples still samples so they'll run for our body yep we eat them and then we send about the other end\nOnly a matter of time right with all the micro plastics that are around us\nRight researchers that's on micro plastics in tap water in the er it's in seafood um because a lot of these plastic fragments get into the waterways and then\n... them and we eat the fish\nOr the other thing is that all you know a lot of history of water from plastic bottles or food out of plastic takeout containers are that's been wrapped in plastic and there's all sorts of chances for fragments to come off so the definition of a micro plastic is that it's smaller than\nFive millimeters but it can be much much smaller than that you know some of these fragments or on the nanometer scale\nAnd we suspect that there's no harm coming from the\n... very difficult to tell you because it it's hard to sort of parse out um you can't really see people some people plastic samples and not be the other people plastic samples at this point it's just man not ethically\nFeasible but um it it's hard shell maybe they're just passengers harmlessly it's also possible that they could be accumulating and that um a lot of these plastics carry chemicals that they made in each into the human body so it's it's I wouldn't tell people I Would say don't\nDon't panic because it could be yes it could be that are harmless but it's very difficult to know that was one of us of a certain age\nFried ... free to pursue

I'm Sorry to interrupt you ... do you want to bring you into this conversation do you think the president can do that can unify the country right now\nI really want him to really want him to try um I have been supplied it so far uh that every time he has spoken out on the street give words that are about Seventy or something like ... and then ... minutes or hours later he does or says or tweak something\nThat was to blame on the victims let the media or you know tries to lessen the some some way to make light of it in some way and I think\nThe president is job right now it's not at all to exist job is to bring people together I Would love to see the president\nUm do something well maybe he called President Obama may be called president hunter and offered his is help and and and made sure that the FBI all the other\nSources of your disposal they were protected it you know him and made sure the attorney general Jeff Sessions called aging older to make sure he was going to be okay this is a moment we're supposed to reach out and not just with words but also with actions with\nThe president has has not apparently reached out to any of those who do home the the the male bombings there were bombs were addressed um but I Wonder if you could tell us about the suspect we don't know a lot\nDreaming on W. E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program at\nThe end you dot edu slash I I I\nHow would you as a Republican strategist Allen's advise leaders of the party to address is\n... ... more than anything it's important that we not jump to conclusions and not speculate prematurely what his motives were but as you say looking at that van with a lot of the the photographs you saw\nAnd there was also that sticker on there with mention of CNN and it was not in a favorable term\nAnd I am a contributor CNN I met that building where this about what happened the other day or at least once a week and it it is frightening but I think from a Republican standpoint we need to send the message\nThat a while we can disagree politically we need to do so in a non violent way and we need to do so in a calm way and\nUh the best way to show if you're disappointed with the way things are in this country is to go vote and let your emotions be heard at the ballot box and I think it needs to be consistent and I will say\nThat in my view the call to end the race to the bottom starts at the top and it needs to be a firm and consistent message and as your most said it needs to not be Justin word but also in action\nWe were in your saying starting at the top meeting with the president a drawl absolutely how do you think Democrats you deal with it\nLuke William hunt former FBI special agents I Want to ask you one more question before I ask you a to hang tight or what your thoughts on the fact that these devices\nNever exploded not one of them does it is it assigned to you that the suspect was a bad bomb maker or that but you know he he didn't want them to explode\nWell you you know this is this is ... I'm completely uncommon ... and one thing that you see what this kind of thing it's just sort of jumped to sort of terrorize people [noise] um even if you have someone who's not capable\nOf actually created enough of an active device it's going to explode a this is obviously a way to terrorize people I'm just sort of get back at the other side if there is some sort of political motive which of course we don't know exactly the details yet so I I think that's that's um probably the the\nBig I'm a motivation there\nOkay hang was hang with us if you can NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson let's bring you back in uh we are awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department is remind us who is uh that we expect to hear from it and what are some of the unanswered questions that we're still waiting for\nYeah this is quite a line up we're waiting to hear from including the attorney general of the United states Jeff Sessions the FBI Director Chris Wray the U.S attorney in Manhattan Geoffrey Berman and that's important because that's where we think\nThis individual ultimately will be prosecuted where he will face justice several of those devices were recovered in New York and we know the FBI is New York field office has been particularly active we have\nWe have an official from the FBI is New York field office William Sweeney we also have the NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill\nA we have the postal inspectors we have the secret service and somebody from the Capitol police as well so this is a murderers row of law enforcement it's very rare you see that many of these top officials on the stage in fact I have a question whether all these men are actually going to fit on that time on stage at the Justice Department\nHas her unanswered questions\nDid he have any help did he have any help and are there other devices out there as we speak I've gotten an email confirming that Tom's dire a prolific democratic donor has confirmed that he was addressed to package and there may be other such devices out there\nWe've got to find that out a law enforcement desperately is going to be hunting for those things because they fear they're dangerous even if they don't go offer detonate um they do contain material that could be problematic and law enforcement wants to wrap their arms around all those devices out there they also want to find out whether this man had any help\nAnd what he was planning next if anything as for motive if not clear right now there is a social media account that's been linked to the suspect fifty six year old Cesar ... Crump South Florida\nIn that Twitter account he has gone off after a prominent Democrats including some of whom have who have been an address he is a V. suspicious packages and that's one hint as to his motive but of course law enforcement is going to be digging ever deeper for more evidence and more information\nNPR's Carrie Johnson I'm ... and just to to reset for the audience where we stand now authorities arrested in South Florida Man this morning\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nTrump law enforcement has confirmed that that man is Cesar ... fifty six years old as an address in Davey Florida and has a criminal record also has some ties to New York\nUh the arrest followed the discovery of three more suspicious packages and Carrie Johnson you just mentioned the Democratic fundraiser Tom Steyer has said that he was the recipient of or at least the intended recipient of one of those packages did he or she was statement as well did he say anything about the package or how he found out that he was targeted\nYeah through a spokesman he said um if confirmed that a suspicious package mail to Tom Sawyer was intercepted had a male facility in California he says\nWe're thankful every one we work with is safe and sound that's our first priority but he says were seen as systematic attack on our democracy and the rule of law that extends much further than one isolated incident in Florida\nAnd he's talking about the need for people to come together and rebuild\nA democracy for each and every American I'm trying to find some unity er during this very dark period where many prominent Democrats have been at that uh recipients are intended recipient of these suspicious devices over the last few days\nRight I'm just thinking that if you are a prominent critic of the president and you have not yet been targeted but perhaps you could be because of positions that you've taken and again we don't know fully know the motivation but this so far though the people who've gotten these packages up and critics of the president\nI'm Kerry have you have you been hearing from people who who are concerned that they could be next to it that they're taking precautions in case they are [noise]\nI have been hearing from people a former officials in the federal government and the Obama administration\nWho are trying to be more mindful of how they handle mail where they open mail and I'm being basically on the lookout for one of these suspicious looking on yellow mental envelopes with patenting that we've seen on the news for the last two days\nOf course some of the targets a or intended recipient of of these devices are really well known the attorney former attorney general Eric Holder the former CIA director John Brennan this morning in New York another package was intercepted intended for the former director of national intelligence Jim Clapper\nAnd another one this morning in Florida intended\nFor New Jersey democratic senator Cory Booker the list just kept growing and growing and it's not clear to me that were done yet without\nHave all those packages for all those people that you just mentioned where they all exactly the same so that you would continue to know what to look for a ... in in the mail string ah for the\nVast majority of the packages the FBI or local police are both have confirmed that these were similar looking packages and images that you've seen\nNPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson I Wonder if we can bring back in the loop William Hunter former FBI special agent to teachers in the criminal Justice Department at Rutgers University in Virginia a new country there\nYeah I'm here yes so you've\nSeen on TV a lot of ... have described as as Kerry just did what the packages of looked like\nIt at what point if there are packages that are are more and more packages to come at what point um can you identify those is coming from either did suspect or somebody connected with the suspect or maybe some buddy who's a a copycat as often happens in cases like these\nYeah yeah it's it's extremely difficult I mean you know it's obviously a easy to get some of these materials but it's a lot of materials are tall\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nUnfortunately to confirm whether or not it is I'm the same suspect or copycat 'em so you know we're talking about um review of by the ... the FBI a\nLab all back in the field office looking at the actual forensics a so it's not going to be an easy call a quick call until it's actually had a look at these things at what point will you feel that the threat is over\nThere the threat is over yeah\nOh that's that's a great question I mean I think of as a as a couple of games so first that he's got a a interrogate destruction show 'em if he's willing to talk and that's a that's a big gift um you know you can have\nA sense of of how forthcoming is how you know what his age what else is out there the other thing is just physical evidence and the electronic average is you get in and with a search warrant and you're able to take a look at is I'm a computer his phone records\nThat lake give you a really good sense of what all he's done I mean there may be just a ton of evidence at his house or in his car business and that's going to give you an idea of how extensive these threats are so I Would say within the next\nYou know twenty four hours you're going to have search orange executed you're going to have a job that initial interrogation or they should have a good idea of how far this has gone with this particular suspect but then there's all the question of\nAgain is working with someone else a tracking down any potential each other a associates that made and healthy\nAnd it's ... William hunt NPR's Carrie Johnson it looks like it'd be like very soon\nTo the Justice Department for this press conference about the rent that happened today just very quickly we know that there was a white van with all sorts of political details apparently pro Trump ... spent details on the side of it do we know is for sure if this vehicle is directly tied to the stuff that he was arrested\nHere's what we do know law enforcement is proceeding on the idea that it is somehow connected to this aspect that they have not said it is his definitively on the record I\nExpect we're going to hear a lot more about that in the next two minutes or so when it's a news conference start as law enforcement decides to tell us what if anything this individual is charged with and how they know that\nAnd does he says I actually individual you're talking about a fifty six years old of daily Florida\nWhere he is he right now he is in federal custody or he was taken into custody in South Florida and the likelihood is that he as um everybody's are trying to find out more from him about whether he had any help whether they're additional packages out there and and any number of other questions they want to know to protect public safety\nWe have gotten a warning that this press conference with attorney general Jeff Sessions is going to be getting started within the next few seconds to say thank you dilute William ... former FBI special agent thanks very much for your incite\nWhen it comes to Jim O'Neill NYPD police command YPG doesn't do anything without the FBI and the FBI

individual expertise the members of the NYPD bomb squad are highly trained emergency service unit or intel bureau a counterterrorism bureau\nOr patrol cops were the first to respond to CNN all help lead to today's arrest I couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day we said from the outset we would identifying the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts\nWe can make that promise because of the confidence we have our ability to investigate the deliberate precise manner\nToday's arrest means that New Yorkers in the day people across our nation are safe but his director ... said that might be more packages out there and so I went still needs to take caution and if you see something out there called nine one one and in New

what space exploration well\nUncovered but I don't think it'll be flourish in just for the sake of exploration\nI think it will be more of the fact that it\nAllows us to see things\nMaybe we should have seen a long time ago\nJust haven't been able to until now\nMm that Dr Ryan Gosling playing astronaut Neil Armstrong\nAnd the new movie first man he's talking about why he wants to be part of the Gemini missions astronaut crew which will later on down the ... the first human to set food and set foot on the surface of the moon and\nWe've gathered a solar panel of space nerds to talk about the film what they liked and maybe could have been done a little bit differently abled and there were some areas in the film we want to hear from you if you if you could make a movie about space exploration\nWhat story would you want to town and there's a common stories we hear the famous ones\nWhat about some on famous people and famous stories that that could be from the space race so right now at any decade your life give us a call our number is eight for for seven to for eight to five five eight four four tie talk you can also tweet us\n... fry let me introduce my guests Miriam Kramer

New York\nThank you good afternoon nap and I see a ... a ... professor studying space exploration at Fordham University his most recent book is beyond earth chronicled of deep space exploration nice to have you nice to be here a\nSpoiler alert [laughter]\nThat's it we're deep diving into the movie and that means we'll be talking about the key plot points including yes does Neil Armstrong make it safely back to the moon and back\nIf you don't know that we'll get we're going to be giving that away so if you want to take part a number eight full force having to for eight to five five or you can also reach us at science friday I'm Rand mustard let's start with the review thumbs up or thumbs down\nOh I Love that you know I'm In the tape for this man I really liked the first man at actually I thought that's a kind of surpassed my previous favorite space movie a and is now in the top spot about Apollo Thirteen\nRally yeah pretty I pray yeah I really I really enjoyed it I thought that it was sort of the space movie that uh\nScreaming on W. E. N. imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation details on a master's program\nAt ... dot edu flash I I I\nMore I I really enjoyed the tone of it like I just wanted for a long time ah for there to be some kind of darker look at space history and I think that this kind of\nGave it to us in a lot of different ways from like the ... metal of the ship unless they're launching I thought I was you know I can I\nCan as it was ... you know get an idea how the rattling much vibration it really was in\nIt like ... I felt that um and just also like looking at the portrayal of masculinity and kind of the way that the whole movie came together around that I thought was a really astute highway\n... when did you think\nOn a personal level I really enjoyed it for me it's the first person aspect versus just sort of watching it from the outside you can really put yourself in the movie and you know most of us will never get to fly into space so getting to actually experience it in a way I was really a fun way to have it movie made\nFor throughout the film we see Neal Armstrong as a dispassionate mhm reserved contained and that was all part of his engineering mindset here's an here's a clip\nPlanning on taking summer job or is it a new buzz sure what fellow wouldn't want to give his wife bragging rights [noise]\nNeal when you take anything a fan of choices they were\nI think that's a real quote you meant you know right I did I did I met him once\nI'm at a conference so I think you know the movie it really does justices character in a way up by ... I like the movie quite a bit it's a it's a flood movie but it's really great movie I really think this is a a movie that captures the other side of the right stuff so to speak the engineering technical backgrounds and the kind of commitment these guys needed to have beyond just be fighter drunks and\nAnd that kind of internal narrative internal uh I'm kind of story in this movie about what it took to be an astronaut\nI think we do is communicated really effective which he has reserved as you went as you knew him well I didn't really I don't think any of that well but from what I understand he was very reserved but he was not I think as perhaps a dour as portrayed in the movie\nOr you had a sense of humor he was a funny guy but I Do think he had a lot of struggles in his life and as his biographer Jim Hansen has talked about a\nUm you know there were some serious problems struggles in his family life and also with his colleagues and ask for an office so you know I think it's a bit of both you was I think he was he was a bit um perhaps reticent but um but I think he was also a capable of just being kind of chilling out\n[laughter] you know you didn't get that impression too much in the movie not so much in the movie but I think the movie was focused on those aspects of his career in life the record concentration and diligence\nAnd there's your urine and you're an engineer did you feel like there was a fair portrayal of any engineer\nI think engineers have a whole variety of personality so I think he saw a few different personalities that movie and if you look across a lot of movies do you see that there's an engineer there is a very serious one they're the ones that are super outgoing so it's certainly a fair perfect portrayal because pretty much every personality type exists in engineering\nAnd one thing that struck me about this film was how jarring and difficult Paul the scenes of space flight where they had the Neal is cramped the launches were teeth rattling and it was just disorienting any time we saw people flying a\nTo me is that realistic to you\nI think there was a lot of realistic aspects that you know people if you have this on floating in feeling that especially in the Gemini capsule the mercury there wasn't a lot of room\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nPanel so I think that with a very accurate portrayal and all the switch gauges are just right there so that and then of course the rocket ride that pill can be a very bumpy so that was certainly true\nThat is going to the phones Andrew in Sarasota, Florida welcome to science friday\nAndrew are you there\nOh hi Hi sorry I think I got disconnected there for a moment [noise] um yeah I was saying it just since the added dimension muggy on our program we hear a lot about mercury and we hear a lot about a but Apollo but I feel like the Gemini program is under served the first time\nMan stepped out into the void and Americans that space walks I think that's a story worth telling\nHey thanks for calling you know I have a lot of people don't realize you know in that scene in the movie where he can control the orbiting the rotation and he had the right stuff to pull out of that that's why he got the first seed you know to go landing on the ...\nYeah I think that's definitely one of the factors that kind of um [noise] made it much more visible and ask for an office there were I mean there were other candidates for the job\nBut for sure the gym and I ate experience was a really key point I was a really dangerous missions\nAnd I was just looking at all life magazines from that month and it was widely reported that the time as a kind of really a kind of a an amazing exciting moment in the space race a kind of success or failure in that sense but a fantastic a moment captured really nicely in the movie\nAs the one person in the room who remembers that real in real time I can say that it was very very concerning um uh the the big emotional punch of the story was Neal's grief over the death of his daughter when she was just two years old\nAnd then the loss of the fellow astronauts on the lead up to Apollo you know living in Palo one whatever and he thinks he's humans just lost his shaped history has has played out a well\nI you know what I mean these things or if I I think is also communicate in the movie the fighter pilots test pilots were very familiar with losses 'cause they had been\nUm air force bases and they're many of their colleagues were um you know not making it back home from test flight so in in many ways they were used to it but nobody's really used to losses like that and especially losing a child is something that nobody can really knowing this happened to them\nToday's programming is supported by ...

Carroll Jenna than um you know there are very few African Americans and space exploration there if you went and asked me was the first African American woman to go into space\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nAnd then she's done dancing and acting with on Star Trek and she graduated high school at sixteen and um you know insurance that very inspired by the civil rights and the thing I just feel like she's just all around up really multifaceted fascinating person to do a movie about and I'd love to see addressed you see something about her you're not in very\nMuch in agreement oh yeah I may Jonathan ... is very cool I've I've met her a few times and it's just always a treat to talk to her about a night can you tell us a little bit about her history and um I I think pretty much what what the college that is what I Know of her as a she just thought like a really\nInteresting life filled with a lot of different things from science to the arts and leisure [noise]\nI'll name Jonathan yeah there are certainly a lot of a background um she flew wanting to shuttle flights early ones for women and and I think there'd be a really interesting story to tell her\nI said yep so movie I think there would be amazing stories or um you know for life is amazing\n[laughter] then it as a treat from a tweet from appetizers how about the early women astronaut to didn't fly for perhaps what would happen would have happened if they did for\nSomething like an interesting topic and there are all these behind the scenes stories right\nYeah there are I mean I think um [noise] it that's the mercury that Thirteen rate I so I I they're I Believe with the ... some kind of Netflix theories about about that and also some kind of documentary series that was regarded as\nYeah um [noise] and all the people who were in that control room and all the other places and you know\nAll kinds of all kinds of stories um interesting of this this is a movie um about the heroes of astronaut certainly fifty years ago\nAnd still be fifty years since the moon landing next summer which I'm having trouble getting my head around [laughter] and\nWe also have Apollo Thirteen we have the right stuff why is Hollywood still talking about things that happened fifty years ago when so much has happened since what do you think\nYeah I mean that's a good question I I think part of it as that\nYou know Apollo landing on the moon that was that was the big stuff like that was the big stuff that human exploration has has done\nIn the last fifty years I mean that the shuttle is exciting and incredible but it wasn't as exciting and incredible as like actually going to the moon [laughter] um so I I think that it's it's a deep wells that people keep coming back to you because of that\nUh and that's it like I think that there are plenty of stories to be told more in the here and now I mean I I think the robots should should get there's you\nKnow that's what I mean we were talking about this I said they're all those robots we don't hear any stories about the trials and tribulations getting those robots yeah and they're mad at other places\nYeah and you know what we also hear about any stories of any other countries in the space for ... there are so many other asks if there are so many countries up there right now\nI mean there is a story to be told that the tweet about the Russians think there'll be a an epic story to tell about their chief designer and uh they're they're older travails and difficulties and\nThe space dog like a ... there's many ways to make sense for into that story um but I Would say that it's not all looking back in the past if you look at movies like um gravity and the marsh and those\nAre sort of maybe imagining that kind of alternate alternative to these sort of looking backward movies I think maybe there is something to be said about the interest in space in general but I like to believe we're not just looking back worlds with imagining the future is your what do they talk\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nAre big project is actually trying to get back to the moon so that's a bigger Ryan as the last programs and all of exploration systems ballot meant so\nYou know really I think once we can start flying those flights a there will be a whole nother a crop of a story to be told and one of the things I'd like to see I don't think the general public really understands engineering at how all of these things take to develop so on a personal level I think it'd be great if if someone could figure out how to tell\nWhat it takes to actually get to the flight ... to fly on it mhm bend in Mesa, Arizona welcome to science friday\n... thank thank you my name's Ben and uh yeah I I Would think it'd be interesting to make a film about what the challenger accident from an engineering standpoint um they the engineers actually tried to stop the launch in a ... and unfortunately that did not happen\nUm and it and then in the end it effected them in ways that many people did though of course it affects it killed the crew but oh\nI think that many of the of the engineers have a story to tell us well\nThat's a good point yeah absolutely I mean that's a ... that that will be an amazing story but um I I think there is a ... plan to make a movie about the challenger mission a bit focused on the school teacher Christa McAuliffe but I imagine these\nThe decisions made on the day and the ... the day before the launch which were critical will be depicted in some fashion in the movie which were all engineering decisions and uh I'm I'm and I'm sure it will be you know a crucial to understanding the accident\nYou knew who is you mentioned the Orion mission that wants to get back to the moon is usually going to be easier because of the lessons we learned from\nPaul in order to know uh getting to the moon is just as hard today that was in the Nineteen sixties I mean we know a little bit more we have an experience space of one to draw from a but actually going to the moon and the the mission is going to be justice risky it's just\nIt's hard to do um that amount of a prop we need when Neal said he wished for more ... I Wish for more prop every day as well um so it's not any easier getting to the moon and it is risky I'm the second time around\nI remember after the uh the Apollo missions were cancelled the three rockets leftover we only went to Seventeen years was to be twenty I remember going to Houston and seeing them lying on their side one line inside as a home for nesting birds\nAnd everyone thought there was anything as sad as sing at Saturn five being home for you know it's nice to birds and play and this was the most I've worked in that way if in a building now and it's been restored I Know that has been couldn't we just turn that's put back in the building and loan I mean\nAre they the avionics are quite out of date at this point I don't think we can control it anymore [laughter]\nWhen what's the schedule for that and do we have enough money and is it going to be going\nOut so we're working to uh twenty twenty flight for the first launch of the last ah and really the second launch of a Ryan we launched in twenty fourteen for the first flight of her eye on 'em and that'll be an unproven flight we are going around the moon or to a distant retrograde orbits it'll even go way past and then what about Seventy thousand kilometers on the far side\nAnd that will be a long mission that's really the shakedown all of the vehicle systems on SOS Andrew Ryan before we put crew on the next flight we were in progress we have enough money um\nAnd it's just a challenge getting their back to the future yes\nDo that or I Want to thank all of you are for ... for taking time to be with us and it's it's gonna be the fiftieth anniversary next year\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "26"}
