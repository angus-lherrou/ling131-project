to our guests Rebecca golden Eugene Chang Emily real or professional professional mathematicians get paid for that has been just doing the crossword puzzle [laughter]\nUm let's go to the phones let's go to the first call from Bruce in Huntsville, Alabama Hi Bruce\n[noise] hello hello Hi there my question is uh do mathematics exist without human beings are consciousness to uh to think of them\nAre are talking about philosophy there's mathematics exist without people\nSo his his what I think I think I like what Rebecca said some mathematicians think they invent math and some people think they discovered\nWhat I think is the I discover mathematical concept and I invent language for thinking about it so the philosophical question becomes do thoughts exist do concepts do I does exist without humans existing I think that the language that we invent\nFor communicating mathematics to other people definitely does not exist without the U.S but those ideas do they exist without this I don't know\nI don't know what we're and let me see for Rebecca or only wants to chime in on our you know\nI think one thing that I'm appreciating as I get further on in my career as a how important a community is a human communities are to the mathematics that's being developed so it's a sort of very charismatic a lecture or a good ... can have a huge influence over field by\nMaking other young mathematicians excited and dry and people and and so then a lot of energy happens focusing on particular problems and questions and you could very easily imagine the development having been different\nLet's go to a home or in woodland California Hi Homer welcome to science friday\nAt all thank you for taking my call 'em as getting bligh so diverse and I wonder if your guest was talking about if you have a big imagination you can pretty much do anything and all that data for everybody to call in because you know and I'm I'm attempting to write a book you know I'm I'm five\nBy enthusiasts [noise] mhm so um when you mentioned higher mentioned it's about a kid who travels so hard to measure that basically I'm just using my own imagination\nSo I'm wonderful I don't know what to base it on as far as I Know of their life with and have a fourth dimension I heard his time I'm sure a lot\nBut then where do you go from there I mean what about\nHigher demand or what what we can do so\nAll right let's see if we get some hints for you good luck Homer says\nThose are great questions and I should add that there are in fact blind mathematicians so it's a it's certainly not impossible to do very high level mathematics or if you're blind there's on there they as far as looking at higher dimensions one always think about it I mean a lot of people like to think of space and time as having\nThose being that four dimensions that we can think about but anytime you keep track of a bunch of things here really dealing in high dimensions if I wanted to keep track of\nA People's hair color\nFree to pursue the re to explore we're Ninety point five W E essay Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nShare blind there's um there there as far as looking at higher dimensions one always think about it I mean a lot of people like to think of space and time as having those being that four dimensions that we can think about but anytime you keep track of a bunch of things you're really dealing in high dimensions if I wanted to keep track of A People's hair\nColor and their eye color and their\nAddress and some other information or that I'm really maybe their income and also their phone number at that would be the kind of thing that may be a real ... real the people are interested in keep track of that kind of information and that's already a bunch of dimensions one dimension for each piece of information that you carry about\nSomebody [noise] um so there's a kind of way in which ah what mathematics does the dimension is really just keep track of things and if you keep track of a lot of things you're actually keeping track of a lot of dimensions\nOr you know ... the John Hi dimensions have been in the news in physics which takes mathematicians to figure it out for them um and especially string theory talking about how the big dimensions are many we're talking about twelve a dozen or more I ... do you understand what's going on there\nBecause we're all dimensional mathematicians\nThat's sort of a joke and an infinite dimensional kept the theory that once you'll be on three basic he might as well be insanity [laughter] so difficult to be on that one and three in fantasy [laughter]\nIt's hard to understand but it's a great question when you say do we really understand it and I think one reason that many people have put off math\nIs it that they think they don't understand it but none of us really understands it honestly we were just trying to understand it more all the time and being confused doesn't mean that we're not good at it and I think a lot of people put off because it back that they feel confused and they go oh I'm no good at math\nWe just we have five contributions to go this hour has twenty minutes to

like a heartbeat but it is not it is the seismic sound of an elephant walking the vibrations in the earth let me play it again\nBoth\nThat African elephant is the largest land animals still alive today and more importantly for this story they are the heaviest they way up to two times\nSo it might not surprise you to learn that we can listen to them and the shaking of the ground earthquake monitoring tools are capable not just of detecting elephants\nFrom distances up to six kilometers away but also distinguishing what kind of behavior is being hurt whether the elephant is walking quickly or even just roaring and the researchers speculate perhaps this information\nCould help us monitor elephants at risk of poaching among other conservation efforts you to talk with me about that

sense that spider Web is basically the savannah terrain say is interested in what the role that that physical environment plays on how they can use these vibrations that in the nation\nTo change how are you have you ever tried to measure the size of the logical signal of an animal before\n[noise] no certainly not consciously so certainly something that we did [laughter]\nThrough that delivers you know I'm seismic instruments essentially measure anything you could imagine but um\nBut in this study what we really tried to do is is a focus on the uh the mental behavior describe the equipment to use and how you set it up and Raul works the recording of of vibrations works very much like what we're doing right now it's a talking to a microphone so we just sort of put the year to the ground and listen through the waves propagate through the substrates\nSo whatever the source comes from cooking earthquake would be okay no impact to a nuclear bomb or in this case an animal\nIs the the art and

either like a heartbeat or a motor boat underwater\nYeah so what what we did to generate this or do you check was using this jihad saying which measures the vibrations through the ground\nAnd basically generates is that the same as a kind of audio track the well I ... you said this five patients that we could hear it is to increase the frequency city the actual pitch is actually a lot less I think like really low base that you can feel rather than here\nAh and then I also had she amplify this recording is I'll say a it's a modified from its original form\nThat you can imagine it's the same techniques that you would use to record say out of voices right now and that was one single elephant we were listening to\nThat was one elephant a walking past a which was recorded in the field in Kenya\nNow you find that these signals can travel three or even six kilometers was set up to five miles away from the elephant itself is this is this something a human could feel just standing there\nHumans do you have a sense of vibration I Would not very good at using it they say and it's a lot that itchy sees type sets a genius phones\nAnd then she I use a census itself but it it doesn't
