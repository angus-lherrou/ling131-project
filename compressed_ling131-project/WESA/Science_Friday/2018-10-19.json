E. N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on the master's program\nAt the end you dot edu slash I I I\nYou know the number of C sections happening all over the world listen to this worldwide rate\nHas nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se is by C section now a series of studies in the journal the Lancet looked at this trend to see what is behind is uptick\nWhat are the effects on mothers in babies and what into vengeance can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rates globally\nAlso what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is the you or your partner to get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet us our phone number a four four seven to for eight to five five\nYou can tweet us ... fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy is an author author on that lasted series he's also professor of midwife midwifery at the Yale School of nursing\nThank you for joining us today alec enemy\nThank you tell us alliances series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rate can you give us some of the numbers of different regions of must have buried around the world\n[noise] well it does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries overused C sections and twenty five percent under use the the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery is enormous his um thing to do\nPart of it has to do with um insurance and um access\nAnd a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get ... birth after they've had their first this area and so it's it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure\nAnd in countries such as in Africa that um don't have enough to access probably are under using at the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about ... and F outright\nSo when you you think about one in three women in the United states having um has this area and we're way over\nLast talking about over ... there's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to ... you know the the interaction but but you write women who are wealthier who had insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's and accepted norm is part of the culture in in Brazil\nAre there are big differences within countries in China the rate ranges from what four percent sixty two percent depending on the province [noise]\nAnd again that has to do with access and a wealth education um interest\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\n... are more likely to have this has area and and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because\nI'm ... is his area and is not a low risk a surgery it is it's a major surgery ends and things are\nThere are small but serious risk of both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and still birth and preterm birth later and with um subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states were increasing maternal mortality rate\nYou mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and why\nThe not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when a woman really needs it and I think it's important to stay at at the outside there are women\nWho and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nWant to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and why she sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be\nVice chair of quality and the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr ... thank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um [noise]\nBut there's also this idea of of planned C sections right the due to do you have to approach this do you have ... have you seen there's been your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... and the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have the delivery of biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver on in our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is\nA tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to patient opinions are patient desires or their perceptions of what safer\nUm the truth is is that I think that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise in there and deliver right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing and [noise]\nYeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make a recommendation for us as area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible\nUm it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics so there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\nOn the progress during labor in terms of the cervical ... is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on only brand delivery unit that might put some pressure on him make quicker decisions to move toward delivery but at but at the end it's really our decision on as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E essay Pittsburgh NPR News the ... the sound of a free press\nQuestions but they generally do say yes Holly what's your reaction to the\nOh I Would completely agree with her the the culture the unit\nWhere a woman who's giving birth is very instrumental um there's a number of strategies we can do to promote

do we um and I went deeper thankful for that for that\nBut when I got pregnant for a second time I really wasn't given the option of that over after that um I kind of had to do all of that\nUm it said on my own so I I look at me like I had to look at rates are they're written very MADD you took pregnancy\nAnd um it really was up to me it was\nLike my provider\nThat you want to have the time I was

this hour about the increasing the number of she's sections and what that means for women's health\nMy guests are Dr Holly Kennedy professor of mid were free of the Yale School of nursing or Tony going vice chair of quality in a department of of a stretch tricks and gynecology at the famous ... Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and lots lots of folks on on the line and let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get there but let me ask you how you you worked on research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach here compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nIt it it differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out that W World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help help us look at decreasing says area and and\nAnd one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have a midwife and some women have an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on that we are very extensive review of the evidence and they found that midwifery was a a associated with improved outcomes increase the including decreasing C sections and so one what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped\nThe integration of midwifery across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in a regulation um and reimbursement independent practice to midwifery practice and so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest sea section rate of of just about Eighteen percent\nTwenty six percent of birds are attended by midwives in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent of birds are attended by midwives\nAnd then they met that with outcomes and uh if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and infant outcomes in the country and only one percent of berserk attended by mid west so that's not a causation\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News the sound of a free press\nAnd that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um we have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery ... than they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nOh Tony go and you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a decade what did you do there\nWell first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primaries is Erin I'm first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heart rate monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite inaccurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make\nSurgical decisions based on such a such a faulty test nonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use feel heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using\nScience and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focus on our documentation our communication\nWe also really tried to make sure that people were using scientific\nModern definition for progress in labor a\nDefinitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than nowhere more modern data really proved to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor\nAt I mentioned earlier we focused on improving access on and uh and I'm enthusiasm for be back and then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFrom his book you were at the Beth Israel and I said you if you were always from so phone down here in Boston so there's this all mean to the to the hospital you go to determines more or less what you'll have a C section Ina\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on Syrian delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there an delivery rates may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work and the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr wherever tweeter that's relevant to this from services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a typical delivery did did you study that in your your your report how it\nWill be a ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money who are wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that um they can get reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not\nDreaming on W E s say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university's integrated innovation Institute details on the master's program\nAt CMU dot edu flash I I I\nForm um many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one in in time or perceived to be in time [noise]\nMhm [noise]\nYour your ... your shoe of reimbursement as is interesting here in the U.S a where by and large citizens are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery then at the very end delivery\nHowever the hospital does and that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patience um and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here and the U.S a reimbursement is greater but it really goes more toward the hospital side because of the length of stay\nLet's go to Sharon in Somerville Mass Hi Sarah\nHigh um I've had two C sections and um they were mandated by the doctor due to complications sort of chronic disease and so I I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section due\nTo my chronic illness complications I had male friends saying things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just ask if you could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that as questioning you know\nCan I be a woman if I don't you know pushed the baby out ... and and that was really upsetting to me because\nMy two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me and I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those up the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions\nAnd I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um and different direction slides I'd love to hear the response\nOr I got about a minute to Tony are only\nWould I Would I Would completely agree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her\nAnd and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is I Would completely agree that it's important that you have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of

predators and they have another thing in common complex social behavior think about the term hive mind right\nThis idea that all the individuals in a group are working together to keep each other alive in this crazy world\nBut how well does that actually work out what factors make a colony more or less successful\nAnd kind of individual behavior still pills the hand of fate for the whole group or the hives indeed the legion\nMy next guest looked at these questions Alice Waters is an associate professor at UC Riverside studying the lives of bumble bee and no pitcher woman is an associate professor at UCLA looking at these social behavior of bees ants and even spider [noise]\n\nDark and ordered you know I if you ask everybody you built tell you that honeybees good all the attention right now but but you gravitated to bumble bee why was\nThat I actually did my PHD in a honeybee labs are but I went rogue and worked on ... I started my PHD in two thousand sex which is the year that the honeybee genome sequenced and when it we sequence we suddenly had this tool kit that we can use to answer all kinds of\nReally cool molecular questions and honeybees and so I started fell in love with bumblebees and wanted to develop something similar for them\nAnd compared to only bees bumblebees have a very different life cycle right out of the colonies gets started\nA first honeybees there what we call perennially social so they're always social or there's never a point in their lives in a life as a hobby queen\nWhere she's living on around the bumblebees are different um they have an annually social life cycle where queens in the late summer season new queens will emerge in the colony and nice queens will leave the nest on their own and they'll go off and mate and they over winter all completely on their own\nAnd then in the spring IDs queens half to crawl out of there over wintering spot\nAnd start their own ness so they spending most of their life living on their own and so even though there are social insects and they have queens and workers and that sort of complex social behavior they're also in a sense living like solitary insects are part of their life cycle to\nBroadway show us with what they look\nI did yeah you'll notice from the get go than it looks a lot different than a honeybee nests it's really interesting because I'm to the best of our knowledge honeybees and bumblebees actually share a common origin of sociology so we think that the ancestor to both of these be groups they shared an ass\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nAnd you know a lot can happen in a hundred million years and so they've all these differences and today they look really different the way they nest away that they live\n... in the meanwhile honeybees are extremely social all the time right yes they are and we tend to confuse the two kinds of bees is having equals lifestyles all the time we really well to be to be\nRight well I consider honeybees is aim and swings my lab actually studies ants um we do a little bit of work on honeybees but mostly focused and the ants and so some of our work on honeybees is looking at how they forge and how different individuals and economy contribute to forging ... at home\nYou brought some assets were through in ... Jarvis harvest giants from I'm here in California oh it's like so far she on the sidewalk since ... slightly larger than what you'd say are a little bit longer\nThere but yeah and of course she than the ones you see on the sidewalk\nAnd what why are you interested in the\nCities and the blacks are the true ... and and the nice thing about this this particular species is that they tend to move between ... sites\nSo a colony of five to ten thousand individuals will just when they decide to pick up and move from one site to another\nUm and it turns out that the structure of the nest it determines how quickly they for it and how quickly they call their friends to the food so another thing I brought here as in the cast and asked to flip it over I was on its head also\nWould hang just like that that's a cast of a an an Smith yes use their like pouring plaster Paris\nIt's exactly faster flowers from Home Depot\nHow far does that go down as just the whole life and now that's just the top part about six eight inches long it looks from just describing for audience but it could go much deeper than that\nYeah so you can pour down other materials we did when ... um which is a type of metal that when you heat it up like water and so it slows down much deeper and then when it's hard to it's easier to dig around and it's on break the plaster\nAnd so we can see that it goes much much deeper probably a few feet down and it depends on the environment to so and then running for I said he was the these there's a lot of ... that determines how they can go\nThrough so much focus on queen bumble bee wonder about the drones and the workers can they make a difference in whether a colony succeed\nNot the drones said that the Germans don't do too much for the colony itself they don't do much work um but the workers are definitely important to you we're focusing mostly on queens in my lab because they have this part of their life or they're living on their own and\nWe've done a few studies now that show that cleans are actually very sensitive during that stage uh so it's an important point to to study\nSomething that ... that when I was reading about this or whether it was really amazing is that when we talk about honeybees we know that to make a queen or what something called royal jelly but that's not what the bumblebees do we how do you make a queen\nFor the most part we don't know I guess what we do know is that it looks we know what happens during larval development so just like in honeybees and there's a some point\nDuring really early larval development where a female larva she can start becoming a cleaner worker and if you think about the implications for that and what will happen to her and what she might do in her life is completely different depending on this one or the other search trajectory\nI'm and we know it has something to do with food and buy movies we know that it's something that they're they're either getting more food or they're getting more food at a very specific point a but we've\nDreaming on W E s say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute details on the master's program\nAt CMU dot edu flash I I I\nI'm obese and people just have to look for them yet\nWell interesting lots of questions from your hand foot start right over there on the right side yes go ahead please\nUm Hi my um my mom\nIs allergic to me I was wondering if there was any way that you could dish extracted DNA from the bees and use it to 'em like helped her heal her when she gets style\nThat is a great question I'm allergic to bees to Iraq that offers you work with Dave and you're allergic so I'm allergic to honeybee okay but not by movies\nUm that's really great question so the the things that are in the venom that caused the terrible reaction on that your mom would get if she were somebody being me too\nI'm does a lot of those components are encoded by the genome of the bees and so if we sequence it and we learn more about what those factors are and they how they trigger an immune response I that there are researchers working on that to try to figure out how we can understand how the two things the immune system and the human and the venom and there'd be interact\nInteresting ... requests yeah great question uh no longer answer also live in big groups with the queen how were they are large different from something like a honeybee\nWell there's a lot of ... and so there's different types of ... and um there's some similarities in some differences in first of all many of them live underground ... will and\nPut their hives inside of fame three cavities\nAnd so that's one difference for example um they're interesting similarities for example the honeybees in some species offense will relocate from one site to another is so honeybees will\nGo and look for a new nest site and can the way the shape of the entrance of the cavity did they find in the side of the cavity will determine whether or not they're going to go there and certain other ends well off as a species of ... that will look for certain privacy is it again have small entrances and dark places so there's some somebody's in some differences\nI think the sizes and one thing there is some species that have am colonies that are only up to you know fifty or a hundred and then there's some that are thousands tens of thousands and even up to ... million so at least cutter\n... million individuals\nAnd just in time for Halloween I Know that you also started his social spider borders social

neither something about being in the wrong time zone always catches me off guard\nBut I Am not the only one I can see from the audience to strict about sleep in the United states among other countries aren't great fewer than two thirds of us are getting the recommended seven hours per night and you've probably heard by now that it's a bad idea to consistently lose disease\nChronic health problems acute cognitive problems the whole ... what is our ability to sleep more than just a product of our habits were schedules could there be jeans at work\nMy next guest says the answer is yes he's on the hunt for genes that regulate how will we sleep and how well we recover from last week and he's found one of these genes in a surprising place\nNowhere near the brain welcome back there came a Paul associate professor of integrative biology and physiology at the University of California Los Angeles [noise]\nIf\nYou need to get seven hours of sleep at night that's what the usual requirement is yes for um the majority of\nRead it for free to explore we're Nineteen twenty five ... Pittsburgh NPR News they found a free press\nLast significantly more than seven to eight point five hours a night than that doesn't work out well for you in time in a lot of trouble yeah\nBecause I get like sick if I'm lucky I get seven I Know someone who gets two hours a night and seems to be doing fine with that but you're saying that that\nWell that is not going to ... in all honesty I'm going to fix our crowd myself why do we need to sleep in the first place that's one of the biggest questions actually is why as one of the reasons I have a job actually what we do know is that if you don't sleep adequately\nVetted impairs your health so they're kind of two categories of consequences if you're not getting sufficient sleep every day the first are where we can set a short term\nSo many of you may stay up tonight after you leave here you may go hang out to a party or you just maybe for the kids not getting enough sleep tomorrow your memory may not work as well you may have a harder time focusing on things you may make more errors when you try to do things that you normally do\nThose tend to be um cognitive affects there are more longer term effects if you continue daily on a regular basis\nNot getting enough sleep than their health consequences I'm it impairs your immune system which makes you at higher risk for infectious diseases and it also increases your risk for chronic diseases like heart disease stroke and diabetes\nI mentioned about genetics and sleep what what is there about genes are they involved in sleeping\nInterestingly enough I think God genes are pretty much involved in everything we do ... what does it what\nAbout sleep what our genes control would it be the hour the than the number of hours that quality what what one of the genes Julie\nThat's what we're trying to figure out um the interesting thing when you're talking about genes is you're not just talking about\nHow genes are expressed but you're talking about how they interact with the environment\nSo I was like to point out the study of genetics is the study of genes and their expression but also the study of the environment if you want to understand how genes work then it's a pretty smart idea to try to understand how the environment works I'm from a kind of line of research that has shown that genes play an important role and timing sleep\nI'm there a time of day you prefer to sleep at the time of day you prefer to wake up but they also play an important role in consolidating sleep um we're awake most of the day or sleep most of the night of what we're trying to understand our what genes are responsible for the restored if properties of sleep\nThe things about sleep that preserves your memory and your ability to focus\nAnd the things about sleep that improve your health\nThe genes that regulate these aspects of sleep are still largely unknown and that's what my research is focused on\nNow what fascinated me about reading about your research also was that these genes that help with our control sleep or not in our brains they're not in our heads\nThey're well they're everywhere yeah um what they're expressing the brand they're expressed in the body\nThe gene that I focused on and my most recent study beam all one has expressed and the majority of tissues in which we have had a lot so remote one is what's known as a clot seen your clocks in every selling your body very real clocks in order for something to be characterized as a clock there has to be an input mechanism to set it\nHas to be an ... and the timing mechanism like gears I talked to my students about deals on the clock most of them don't know what ... is our [laughter]\nSo I talk about their electronic mechanism in their phones that Keith\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... say Pittsburgh's NPR News they found a free prime\nTime the majority of cells in your body have these clocks and we know that these clocks regulates sleep on for a long time we've been very interested in how these clocks of regulated sleep till we've looked primarily in the brain because the clock that regulates most of your ... and the brain\nAnd most of the things that drivers sleep around the brain but what we found quite surprisingly was that the clocks in the skeletal muscle\nCan speak to sleep regulatory areas in the brain and tell your brain\nHow sleep more importantly how to recover from sleep loss\nAnd when do you mean how to recover so the mechanism we study asleep homeostasis it's kind of works like a thermostat if you set a thermostat to a certain temperature if it goes too low to turn the heat on your terms that's out of the hit on the ... goes too high a thermostat turns the air on\nYour sleep process these works similar there's a certain amount of sleep that you need to function correctly every day if you don't get enough sleep your body will try to compensate by having usually more if you get too much sleep it will go and the other direction\nThe clock is the same as the clock on your thermostat in the morning it's set to go to one temperature in the evening it's set to go to another and works the same way in our bodies in the morning your clock tells you to wake up in the evening your clock tells you to go to sleep\nOn for a long time we suspected that the clock mechanisms are more involved in the ... mechanisms that allow you to recover from sleep loss and what we're finding in my research and the research of many that have come before me is that the genes\nThat are as like the gears on the clock the genes that are responsible for timing\nAlso play a role in your ability to recover from those so when you say the clock is that the the circadian rhythm we've been talking about the circadian clock that regulates your daily\nRhythms of behavior and physiology so we have a twenty four hour light dark cycle sun comes up in the morning goes down it might um synchronize are clock but if you were in a consistent lighting environment constant darkness\nI'm a constant light than clock will still continue to isolate it hasn't been dodging Tommy mechanism and it would isolate at a period or frequency close to twenty four hours question overhear yes I have a question about napping\nAs I'm getting older I'm discovering that are really cool thing to have an [noise]\nHow might that play with the a clock that you're speaking of in the south\nSo napping as it is a very interesting phenomenon big fan of it by the way they win by yourself than an hour and I do have one of the great things about being a sleep researcher as if I take a nap and miles in the afternoon\nAnd no one can complain they can write at all I Know what I'm doing research [laughter] but you're saying napping is important is the lapping is very important if you're not getting daily sufficient sleep and most of us to have children or have jobs or live in a busy environment may not beginning um sufficient sleep so if you're not then getting an afternoon nap\nAn hour's usually was about recommended but I think from a half hour to an hour is healthy however you if you are getting sufficient sleep and you're still napping\nThat goes into hypersomnia which is like I said getting sleep too much for much of that suggests that there may be an issue however in relation to the clock my lab is currently conducting studies to determine\nIf the ideal time for napping is driven by clock mechanisms um especially those of us that get sleepy or the afternoons sometimes between one to three which is currently the same time of course I'm teaching right now oh gosh I have to be pretty animated when I'm teaching but you can't blame them\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News they found a free press\nAre way let me go to the questions on this side yes\nHi my question is about the adolescent brain and sleep ah ever since I was in high school we were talking about shifting the start time for high schoolers to be later in the day because yes [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Pittsburgh", "day": "19"}
