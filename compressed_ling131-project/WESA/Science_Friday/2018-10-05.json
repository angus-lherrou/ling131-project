E. N. say it's imported by Carnegie Mellon university integrated innovation Institute\nDetails on a master's program\nAt CMU dot edu slash I I I\nWould venture to turn out to the artist topic and current events and that is voters and Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault against a judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether that should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write than in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process is at play tell me what you mean by that\nWell that's a whole other our whole lot of different\nParts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because a lot of people claim to the principle of the presumption of innocence\nAnd the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for saying certain things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence there is a paradox because some people say well we have to put you pick someone innocence until that until that proved guilty and the thing is that if you have an accuser\nAnd an accused Boston or let's just say the accuser is a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a ... because we can't actually hold the mom and the woman both innocence at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nOn mathematics and civil Sufi have studied paradoxes for a long time I studied ways to resolve paradoxes by shifting levels are finding that things are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of\nPresuming the accused person to be innocent and then we can look up ... will that creates for us and what mathematics does all the time and it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical will run out and then we look at that world and do what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accused people to the innocence until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is almost never actual evidence that can prove that it happened\nAnd if they know that they can get away with it that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we kept that so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so\nHaving a false accusation um would be when somebody is innocent but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but ... isn't proved to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether you were prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we have some help prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWith prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault over time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that so and then ... them is a a question of black and white thing\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five ...

when the dung beetle is ready to reproduce they a tunnel underneath a done Patty and they create these developmental chambers out of dying that we call it breed ball and in each of those balls they place a single egg\nAnd from being an egg to an adult beetle that that developing beat all depends on his developmental chamber for its nutrients that for a shelter and protection and uh none of toads right along on these beetles there there are small worms\nAnd um they end up in these developmental chambers along with the developing beetles and um we didn't know before whether that was a good thing or a bad thing um but we did know that um\nThat this association existed and so this was something that we wanted to investigate more to understand the consequences of that interaction

Ira Flatow and the past few years the field of exoplanet discovery has really taken off instruments like Kepler and the Newark test had been racking up the planet count\nBut this week astronomers writing in the journal science advances brought the whole thing to a new level describing the possible discovery not have an exoplanet\nBut at the moon orbiting an exoplanet to be specific\nKepler sixteen dash twenty five ... be\nAnd his some four thousand light years away has to do that well joining me now to talk about the research is Alex ... cheese and and it's half graduate research fellow in the department of astronomy right here in New York at Columbia University welcome to science friday thank you very much for having me first what what moon is this where it give us a little\nThumbnail description sure yeah so it's a a moon as far as we can tell if we're not quite claiming it as a discovery yet there's still some lingering uncertainty but as far as we can tell it's there\nAre a large moon about the size of Neptune actually which is sort of strange um orbiting this plant called Kepler sixteen twenty five be and it's about eight thousand light years away as far as we can to [noise]\nSo but so what is the relationship with the size of the moon to the size of the plant so the size of the planet is to buy the same size as Jupiter it's a little more massive as far as we can tell\nA and then the moon is uh like I say about the size and the mass of net but even at a pretty unusual moon that big a well it's certainly unexpected right where if you look at the moon's in our solar system ah we've got a lot of them\nAre they're all ... significantly smaller than New York so uh when we spotted this we said uh you know this is what it looks like about the size of Neptune\nThat is sort of a raises new questions for people how how do you get something that big it's a little premature to say how common are how rare something like this might be because ah this is potentially the first so we don't have any sort of population statistics on these things\nAh but ah you know you could argue that because it is the largest you know because it is so large a it's sort of the lowest hanging fruit so maybe it's not entirely surprising that the first one we see is so large\nYou know because we think of our moon we think of another body hitting earth and knocking out a piece of it right it doesn't look like that and this case\nUh yeah it's like there's so there's basically three mechanisms that we think we get the moon's from an impact or scenario like how we got earth's moon ah moons coalescing out of a disk of material swirling around the planted in the early days of the planetary system like the way we get the moons of Jupiter and Saturn Uranus\nAnd then finally a capture scenario like Neptune largest moon Tritan as far as we can tell that was captured from the ...\nSo uh that this is sort of the first question that everybody thought of when when we announced this large moon how do you get something like that it's not necessarily a ruled out by known mechanisms but it certainly has the the theory scratching their heads or\nBut yeah and we like it when they scratch [laughter] how do you do how do you detect a moon I Know the theory but that detecting the exoplanet is that what you tell us how\nYes I Will ah there's a variety of ways to go about looking for planets but the the most popular the most successful way so far\nIs using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the store over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the store like if there's a moon around that planet than we would expect to big\nRead it for free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... say Pittsburgh's NPR News they found a free press\nIt's but the the most popular the most successful way so far is using this thing called the transit method when the planet passes in front of the star from our point of view it blocks out just a little bit of the starlight that we're observing so if you're monitoring the brightness of the star over time you see a little bit in the intensity of the star like\nIf there's a moon around that planet than we would expect a big dip from the planet and then a smaller dip as the moon blocks on some of the light as well in addition to that uh we try to see the gravitational influence of the moon on the planet the planning of course is pulling on the moon but the moon is pulling on the planet\nAnd so that makes the planet wobble around a bit as it is it orbits the star and so\nSometimes I planetary transit comes in early other time it comes in late and so those are really the two lines of evidence that we see for this X. them not just this depth this transit of the moon but also a something ... folks are pulling on this planet that uh that uh we're attributing to the moon\n[laughter] hey says no and that's the point I Want to pick up on because when you came in and talked about you say well this is the evidence but we're not totally sure right well what did they doubt well\nSo it's an extraordinary claim and as the famous saying goes extra now playing and one of my favorites are extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence\nSo ah we've done what we think is a pretty thorough and rigorous job or trying to\nRule out other possible explanations for this signal a question naturally comes out is there something weird going on with the telescope is this maybe something happening on the surface of the star could there be another planet in the system that's that's pulling on this planet and making in wobble around\nA those are all plausible explanations a but we've done our best to rule out those alternative explanations and uh as far as we can tell you know the numbers are saying the moon's there but because it is such a an incredible claim\nOr it may be incredible it's not quite the right word it's an extraordinary claim and so we really think ah additional observations of the system are needed to really confirm it\nReally it was so unusual I Am I reading from my notes you that you were able to get viewing time on the Hubble for this that you're right very hard to get so you must have been other people might want to know about this very\nSure yeah yeah you know so we had a a observed three transits of the planet and the Kepler data a this was a phenomenal mission that lasted about four and a half years we saw three transits in with a Kepler they looked tantalizing but it wasn't enough to make a claim\nA so we really thought at that time we needed to follow up and observe this thing again Hubble was really the only game in town it's a very long duration of event ah we observe this system for about forty hours altogether\nSo if you think about it uh you know the earth is turning and so you can't observe this system with any single telescope uh from the surface of the earth so you'd have to stitched together multiple datasets from multiple telescopes or to make this observation and that would be\nA very challenging so you know you really have to go to space and uh obviously we made a a convincing enough case that uh that they gave us the time\nThey're they're talking about the wants to ... is gone and I'm I'm I don't know why it should be but that's not for me [laughter] um it can be used up uh the Webb telescope ... a better for you guys were looking an extra point\nGoing to be like why yeah in front of aspect tiger instrument at the very very large mirror a and a sitting aware as Hubble orbit the earth or when we perform this observation you know you can imagine how people staring at this target but then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single urban Hubble takes Ninety six minutes\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five definitely yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station at a free press\nSo plant it's going to be a hell why yeah it's pretty bad spectacular instrument it's a very very large mirror a and a\nSitting aware as Hubble orbits the earth\nOr when we performed this observation you know you can imagine how people staring at this target\nBut then the earth gets in the way for about forty five minutes every single orbit Hubble takes Ninety six minutes or so to go around so half of that orbit is just totally blocked out\nA James jaded just he won't have that problem and like I say the mirror is going to be really spectacular so uh that data is going to be phenomenal the bigger problem is that these observations as I mentioned before are so long yeah\nUh that you need a lot of time to perform them and uh this a telescope is going to be highly over subscribed to many more people want to use it then they can possibly afford the time so we're going to have to\nA very good case you know there are dams officer other Asian\nAmerican obsolete is the wrong word but they're all everything is always an obsolete by the time he gets built a highway or something else to take some law well we shouldn't made it twice as big we've spent whatever Asher yeah\nYou know so there's other telescopes coming down the pike that there are people bidding right now to ... that we've talked about a W first and then there's a\nA telescope called ... more than ... ... yeah that's a that's\nA I I don't know who's working on it but it's it's a ultraviolet and read and optical that's L. O. U. V. I. O. R. and I think so uh that they come up with great names for these things are so there's going to be some fantastic instruments Chevy of Estee will definitely be an improvement on Hubble\nBut you know how boys over twenty five years old now and it's still a top of the top of the line instrument to use that generally amazing\nIt is I'm All right so if this is a strange jar planted situation does it can it tell us anything about our common ordinary solar system planet situation\nThat's a great question and one of the things that I I'm always saying to people is you know they always come into question why do we care about these moons what why what's interesting about these things\nAnd uh you know I think a big part of it is that every time we look out at these extra planetary systems we are learning or by extension more about our own solar system and the question is very much still open how common are we would is is the things going on here\nJustices are supposed to be above the political break so how will this fight in the ... the Supreme Court stories afternoon on all things considered from NPR\nNews from NPR and Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania headlines just about twenty minutes away once we join all things considered at four o'clock Iran Pittsburgh is NPR News station Ninety point five W E s say\nW E essay is supported by Pennsylvania winds October is PA one month celebrating Pennsylvania's locally grown and cracked it winds with special things to do taste and discover across the state profiles tasting tips and defense or ...

Harvey Washington where I live a more the the focus of your book in the poison squad um he actually started where people were volunteering to eat stuff for him to test out his food safety ever tell us about that the what the wives did you have to lose amazing\nIt's just crazy you I mean when you read this experiment first thing you think is you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control but what happened was he had been working really soon\nFree ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nTo eat stuff for him to test out food safety ever tell us about that the what the wives did you have to what was amazing [noise] it's just crazy\nYou I mean when you read this experiment first thing is I guess you could never do this today right you would never get it passed all of our control\nBut what happened was he had been working really sense for about Twenty years trying to get food safety trying to get labels you know at\nCompletely not able to move this forward politically and he finally said okay well let's just have some better evidence and I'm going to skip those you know a less important other species I'm not going to do any animals safety testing and all I'm just going to dump these things in the human beings and so\nThat's the amazing part of it and so he came up with this experiment in which he persuaded young government employees a mostly young men in their twenties to basically dying very dangerously and the deal was\nThey would eat three free meals a day seven days a week and it would be beautifully cooked by a professional chef and all kinds of wonderful ingredients but half of this group at any given time\nHad to be adding capsules of the compound that he was testing at various doses from very low to very hot\nAnd so during the ... Scott experiments he looked at formaldehyde and food he looked at bore acts which is a cleaning product he looked at salary silica said which is a fever reduce or a you know a medicine\nAnd he kept ... rotating these through these tests and what he said was he hadn't expected the young men to get as sick as they did but they almost immediately started having all kinds of gastrointestinal problems and other problems\nAnd because this ... this study had caught the attention of American newspapers [noise]\nIt was the Washington Post that nickname at the poison squad this is front page news all across the country you were food is poisonous and now you start seeing this kind of rise of public outrage which then was amplified by the Sinclair but\nWow that's so ... did he have some experience in his own life that motivated him says wanted you know create this poison the water gets to the bottom of the food safety [noise]\nYou know that's a great question I think he was kind of a holy roller cameras spray he and his dad had been a preacher a farmer but also like to enter a preacher\nOn a conductor on the underground railroad during the civil war\nAnd he had interviewed his kids are with this kind of said some higher calling\nAnd and widely really I mean what was interesting about a month that he took on this issue of food safety which the USDA had never really been interested in from the very beginning and then he just starts feeling at a party stealing the layers of it apart\nAnd the more he realizes how at risk people are the more he becomes really increasingly I write and you'll hear him saying\nWe'll say OK I'm testing these on young healthy people but what about children what about the elderly what about the sick and so he has the sense that uh the role of the government [noise] hang on\n...
