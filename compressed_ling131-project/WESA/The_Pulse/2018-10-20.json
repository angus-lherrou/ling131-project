no question that the energy sector is you know a major contributor to to climate change 'em well if you start getting into the blame game though there I think you have to start\nLooking at a number of directions so you know they might be burning fossil fuels to produce electricity but guesses on the other end of the wire turning the lights on in their house turning air conditioner on in their house that's that's consuming that electricity\nIllogical utilities and most of them are businesses um and therefore [noise] you know they're responding to markets and and we're the ones you know who were

personally I I I Do not think that as realistic I mean I think achieving these kinds of changes are very short timescale is\nInvariably disruptive and with disruption comes opposition and we can say well there's political opposition from conservatives who are interested in climate change\nBut I think once you start talking about you know the cost of some of these changes again hitting people at home in their wallets the central disruption to companies you know that level of disruptions going to create a large amount of opposition which is going to make it very difficult to do anything\nPolitically and socially even if it were technically feasible\nSo what's our [laughter] what are our options that and if you think we can't really make that deadline than what's next for us here on this planet\nYeah great question well I mean the point though is we have to recognize we're probably not going to the climate change below one and a half degrees and there are consequences are going to be experienced as a result for consequences are already being experienced in recognizing that means we have to actually have started the best thing in the adaptation side of climate change\nAnd really investing in managing the risks\nSo that the consequences to human beings in society and the natural environment rupture making progress on that front as well\n\nBenjamin Preston is

and release more off it leading to a longer pollen season and more pollen is of course the bad news for people with asthma or allergies and\nWhen I think about asthma as a condition Allen they are already a bunch of factors that are really out of the control of individual people write it gets worse in terms of where you live or what you're exposed to\nRight so let's zoom in on that and look at
