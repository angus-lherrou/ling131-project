insurance prices\nAnd that's news because it's hard for any one person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your insurer\nWhich passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs and he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who is this woman we're talking about uh sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan in twenty four teen\nAnd when she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families that plan was in deep trouble it's self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go\nBroke so the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from you\nExactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us who get our health care benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care\nAnd so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Maryland Bartlett do differently\nShe had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a massive nerd who knew how to follow the money\nAnd so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid\nEach hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare publishes its prices and so she could see that her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets paid\nWell and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the

Medicare and Medicare publishes its prices and so she could see that her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets paid\nWell and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge was to get things under control and so she had to do some really hardball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea in the health care world as she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case you had some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because the health care industry really does need our money\nSo she said look you hospitals that are at five times the Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape\nI Wonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking that in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital they would just say listen our prices are price\nIt took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high price hospitals she called in the union to
