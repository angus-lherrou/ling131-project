W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free friends\nExactly not hitting is drawing on fairly traditional stereotypes about liberals and conservatives\nConservatives prefer order and rules liberals prefer experiential schools and community theaters now those are stereotypes which means that they're going to be liberals who hate community theaters and conservatives who despised churches but the question that hitting and others are asking is\nHow companies stereotypes are so often accurate\nIf being liberal and conservative is all about our political views how come these labels describe all kinds of other things about us from the kinds of food we prefer to eat to the kinds of poetry we left\nTo where we want to hang out so he's arguing that our political views spring from something deeper than just our beliefs about big government or small government\nPrecisely he's arguing that political preferences at least in part\nCome from a psychological and biological predisposition\nThe most compelling evidence for this comes from studies involving large numbers of twins some of whom are identical and some of whom are fraternal\nIdentical twins share the same genes fraternal twins share fewer genes identical twins to not to have more political preferences in common than fraternal twins do even though each ... presumably shared the same family and upbringing\nHeight for example turns out to be about eighty percent a heritable when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent\nThirty to forty percent so he's saying some part of our political beliefs come from biology\nYes and of course that conclusion upset a lot of people\nAnd they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component of not zero but apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that\nWhat he and his colleagues are saying is that biology and psychology play a role in our political preferences Noel liberals and conservatives in the United states often accused one another or stupidity or malice but if he and his colleagues I'll write one reason we might not see the world the same way is because we simply not lie at the same way\nGet on this list represent your city your county or give us a call for one to six nine seven to nine five five or go to W.
