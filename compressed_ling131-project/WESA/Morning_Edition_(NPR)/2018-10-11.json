correction that yesterday's drop in the Dow caught a whole lot of people off guard it fell by more than eight hundred points the largest shopping six months\nAnd one reason people were surprises because economic growth has been strong unemployment is at a record low so the question is what spooked investors here President Trump is blaming the Federal Reserve which set interest rates for the sell off I think [noise]\nWhatever or whomever you blame the Dow drop has markets in Asia and Europe ... this morning as well\nAll right we've got NPR senior business editor Uri Berliner with us this morning ... what's going on why the drop\nGood morning well there there are a lot of things that are going on right now um\nOne is that you know we've had a decidedly sour mood take over the market in the last few days yes and the five hundred is following five straight days it got a lot worse yet they've got a lot worse yesterday and on the NASDAQ where a lot of the tech stocks are traded it was even more so I was down more than four percent\nAnd a lot to say that really that surprising because\nThe big technology companies they've led this long rally they really power to you know the the names you know Facebook Amazon apple Netflix saying I'm Google a alphabet which is good will come they've led this rally um but since the beginning of the months they've started to fall off some of those cuts doctor really struggling now\nPresident Trump is blaming the fad of presumably because they raise interest rates can you explain the connection here\nRight well so the fed has raised interest rates eight times in the last three years it started from a very low base rates were basically zero for a long time so it's steadily started to to raise rates as the economy improved\nAs a recovered with the intention of keeping inflation in check ins recovery and keeping the economy on an even keel\nUm but that rising interest rates makes borrowing costs more expensive for companies for people and it can have the effect of ... of somewhat slowing the recovery\nUm and the president as we heard in there say that he thinks the fed has gone crazy see Clinton clearly disagrees he wants the fed to prop up the economy by keeping interest rates low explain why that's not necessarily a great idea\n[noise] well I mean it's not\nUncommon for for presidents to complain about the fed or to be unhappy with the fed when they raise rates especially if it's any time in close to an election what is unusual for a president to say the fed is gone crazy um that's really unusual\nOr you know if the fed has a policy where is trying to keep this recovery going into trying to keep inflation so get wants a steady economy um if you keep\nRates very low there's the potential the economy could overheat and fall back into recession\nRight and of course we know President Trump talks a lot about the stock market as an indicator of whether or not the overall economy is healthy and it is it isn't necessarily the best indicator but as you mentioned the elections coming up so it matters to him a lot of\nIt sure does I mean he's talked throughout his administration how about how great the economy has been in how great the stock market has been he's taken a lot of credit for that now if the stock market does go into a downturn it will be interesting to see how it explains that and what what he thinks cost isn't isn't it\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety forty five ... W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News that the sound of a free press\nCertainly the best indicator but as you mentioned the elections coming up so it matters to him a lot [noise]\nUm it sure does I mean he's talked Rosenman stretching how about how great the economy has been or how great the stock market has been he's taken a lot of credit for that now as the stock market does go into a downturn or it will be interesting to see how it explains that and what what even cost is as NPR senior business editor Uri Berliner for thanks very\nTruce programming is supported by Allegheny health network or your Jones executive health and wellness program offers ... health services for corporate executives were streamlined example Trump's designed to meet their health care goals doctors are available and ... knowing dumped on Pittsburgh\nDetails at age um dot org slash executive health\n...\n[noise] and you're listening to MORNING EDITION on Ninety point five W E s say thank you so much for joining us it's the second day of the fall membership driver having a great drive so far but we are inviting you to join us this morning as a contributing member my name's Nancy what on with me in the studio is lives read\nAnd there is a dollar for dollar matching effect thanks to Bob in Barbara from Fox Bert they will double your contribution right now but only until eight o'clock\nSo make sure you pick up that phone and call for one to six nine seven to nine five five you can get ten dollars a month and they'll match the annual value of a hundred and twenty so you're a hundred and twenty\nBecomes to forty give twenty dollars a month to forty becomes four eighty you get the picture up to five thousand dollars can be matched between now and eight o'clock doubled the buying power of your guests now when you called for one to six nine seven to nine five ...
