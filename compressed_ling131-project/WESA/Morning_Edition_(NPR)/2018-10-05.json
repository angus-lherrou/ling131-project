emotional needs and the primary role of schools is to fill the academic needs and the reason you have all these community support says that's going to help you that's going to help the kids meet those goals kids will be resilient\nIf you provide them support what they need is at least one grown up to really care about them there's a big\nBody of research on resilience and how kids can be resilient even in the face of tremendous trauma and it's I'm not I I in no way to minimize the trauma\nBut the kids need the resilience in order to be able to live lives that are not traumatic\nSomething I hear

everybody so we have to have another solution\nIt's this continual cycle of\nUm identifying a problem hypothesized sing a possible solution then a\nAssessing whether that worked if it worked keep doing it intensified if it didn't work why not and adjust to this is basically the scientific method over and over\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburg NPR News takes the sound of a free press\nContinuous cycle of um identifying a problem hypothesize thing of possible solutions than a\nAssessing whether that worked if it worked keep doing it intensified
