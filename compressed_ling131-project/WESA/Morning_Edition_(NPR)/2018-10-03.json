devised next\nWhy stop there why not go all the way to retake all of Korea unite the peninsula under one democratic government\nMake Arthur's troops crossed the famous thirty eighth parallel dividing north and south\nBut what U.S forces did not quite know as they moved into North Korea was the neighboring communist China considered the Americans a threat and a huge Chinese army will soon crossing the border to oppose them you're a landmark called the chosen reservoir\nIt was initially and intelligence failure we simply didn't know at first because the Chinese were expert at camouflage they moved only at night um they never used roads they were a foot army but didn't intelligence did begin to trickle in crystal clear and MacArthur didn't want to believe this because\nHe wanted to finish the job by Thanksgiving get the war over with and so he sweat this information under the rug\nWhat was the landscape and the situation in which a U.S Marine Division found themselves around a reservoir in North Korea in the winter of Nineteen fifty fifty one\nMacArthur ordered the first Marine Division to advance to this reservoir up in the mountains of North Korea to take it and to keep on going to the Yalu but the commander of the first Marine Division whose name as general Oliver Smith\nRealized that this was a perfect scenario foreign circle meant he was very precious and he seemed to know that a big battle was going to happen\nOn the shores of this frozen lake in the mountains of North Korea sounds like it was pretty cold eighty five percent of these men suffered from frostbite many died of exposure\nAnd none of these troops were prepared for fighting in these\nKinds of conditions you give an incredible detail of an American marine who is attacked with the rest of his unit by the Chinese it's the middle of the night it's incredibly cold he leaps out of his sleeping bag and only realizes after fighting for hours that he had never managed to put his boots\nOn you know this is Hector ...\nTo receive the Congressional Medal of honor for his exploits that night he may have killed over a hundred Chinese soldiers who came wave after wave after wave at him and his

moved to soul as a a teenager\nOnly to have the war reached soul in Nineteen fifty when North Korean forces invaded\nHis uncle and his aunt were both murdered many of his friends were murdered he had to hide out in a house in Seoul\nHe hid until American forces entered the city blasting to ruin says they took it back\nThe capital city of immediately\nVolunteered with the Marines and they gave him an assignment which was to go be an interpreter and a guard in the very city that he had grown up in North Korea ham Han ... experiences\nAs an American interpreter in the north\n[noise] he was assigned to guard a bridge in his hometown a bridge they called the bridge of long life\nAnd he was there to prevent refugees from crossing it he hated this assignment but then he found out that his sister was on the other side of the bridge of long life\nAnd that she was not allowed to cross and that his whole family was about to board one of these ships for this great evacuation to the south and that they're gonna have to leave his sister there forever\nAnd so he prevail do over the American guards they got into a jeep they hunted for his sister all over that part of the city and they found her and she rejoined her family and and made it to the south\nLead by ... survived the war and emigrated to the United states he is now Dr Lee by ... of Cincinnati, Ohio and American citizen and

has been given no more than a week to look into the allegation about the Nineteen eighties how is it possible to do NPR's Martin Kaste reports on what this FBI background check is and is not\nIf you're following the breathless coverage on cable news you get the impression this investigation is pretty serious happening\nBreaking news comprehensive pro but listen carefully to how it's being described president\nBut with sexual assault allegation Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh catch\nThat this is an investigation into sexual assault allegations but it's not as a criminal sexual assault investigation and that's pretty apparent to the people who usually do those the local police\nWere falling at a little bit uh some more than others\nThat Steven Cooper commander of the criminal investigation division for the police department in ... Texas outside Dallas he's done a lot of sex crime investigations but he's glad that he's not doing the Kavanaugh case\nWe wouldn't want to have any part of that given the nature of how public that investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched it on TV has turned a song so any potential witness for victim is um let's say tainted\nIf Cooper did have this case he'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing that because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca\nCampbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nA trauma informed interviewing a saying just because they might have difficulty answering a question or they might have some inconsistencies it doesn't necessarily mean that they're lying it doesn't necessarily mean that there's a problem in the case it means keep an open mind and continue the investigation\nThat kind of slow non confrontational style is not what FBI background checks are usually like background checks focus on the inconsistencies as agents ferret out signs that someone is lying or compromised or hiding something\nThe FBI is just gathering information for prospective employer and the standard of proof is lower still Tom ... says you could do an actual criminal investigation into case such as Kavanaugh's assuming the state statute of limitations allowed it\nThere are clearly hurdles to delayed recording but that doesn't mean we shouldn't investigate thoroughly\nTrembling as a retired police chief of Burlington, Vermont where he both worked in oversaw sex crimes cases and now he helps to train sex crime investigators well it's hard to build a criminal case when the alleged attack happened decades ago when there is no DNA evidence he says you should still try looking at\nThe circumstances hearing from any outcry witnesses that the victim ... through the years looking for other victims of this offender becomes a big piece of this investigation\nBut that kind of approach especially when you start looking for similar attacks by the same person takes time weeks sometimes months when the police do it and that kind of time is not a luxury that the Senate has allowed the FBI Martin ...

investigation is because anybody with any social me or who's watched the MTV has turned his arm so any potential witness for victim is um let's say tainted\nIf Cooper did have this case she'd probably approach it differently from what the FBI is doing that because in recent years police have been moving toward a model called trauma informed interviewing Rebecca\nCampbell is a research psychologist at Michigan State who's helped to promote the new standard which takes into account that it's normal for victims to sometimes get their facts wrong\nA trauma informed interviewing a saying just

postponed like two three times but I\nHeard was ultimately acquitted of firearms related charges in that case but his experience echoes of clients who sued the Allegheny county public defender's office in Nineteen Ninety six\nThe suit describes an environment of severe dysfunction clients often didn't meet their lawyer until just minutes before appearing in court the lawsuits that attorneys were saddled with such overwhelming caseloads and denied so many resources that they often cut an advocate effectively\n... the ACLU was one of the attorneys who brought this suit\nWhat that lawsuit did was to pretty much double the resources of that agency so both financially in terms of budget in terms of staffing should they got a bump in ways that\nMost of the other counties Pennsylvania have not\nBut just how much progress the office has actually made in the last two decades is being debated by the chief public defender and a former attorney in his office named Joe Ozzie\nOzzie says before he resigned in June defenders had too many cases office data show trial attorneys audio were assigned to an average of about sixty cases at any given time over the last year and a half\nBut as Audi notes and the office confirmed the number has risen above eighty at times\nAnd if you have eighty you're juggling and some people are getting the attention and some people are getting great representation but\nI can say at least for me personally I felt that there are deficiencies and my representation and it started to weigh on me\nThe Allegheny county public defender's office typically ran surpluses of more than four hundred thousand dollars each year from twenty Thirteen to twenty sixteen that bothered Audi far more than his caseload\nThe solution was to hire more attorney solution was to hire more investigators we had the ability to do that\nChief public defender Elliot how the doesn't see a problem he says his office has simply become better managed\nIn terms of resources in terms of our ability to effectively represent our clients wherever we need\nHere just across the street from the Allegheny county courthouse\nIs devoting more resources than ever before to its clients

information you know what should I expect next you know can you are expert like my my court hearing you know can you please contact the family moved to things like that\nIdea agrees the office has made strides but he says those improvements aren't sustainable without more attorneys and that current public defenders are being asked to do more for low salaries that aren't keeping pace with inflation\nAnd it creates a situation in which there is high turnover there's often just satisfaction with the work environment and to claim but that's not going to have any bad effect on

expect to get a presidential alert on your cell phone it's not exactly from President Trump rather it's a test avenue nationwide warning system that a president could use in case of an attack by another country or a cyber attack or a widespread natural disaster\nStill some worry President Trump could abuse the system NPR's Brian Naylor reports\nBack in the days of the Cold War was pretty common to hear this announcement on TV or radio you know the one this station is conducting a test of the emergency broadcasting system\nThings have gotten a little more sophisticated now but basically the same minute long emergency alert system test is conducted every month or so on broadcast cable and satellite TV and radio there'll be one of those this afternoon to\nBut today you'll also be getting an alert on your cell phone have some of us receive alerts already amber alerts for missing children or flash flood or tornado warnings but this is the first time that you'll be getting a national presidential alert from FEMA\nRuin red letter is director of the national Center for disaster preparedness at Columbia University he says testing the system makes sense\nI think having the testing of this new wireless emergency alert system is a good idea that you can think about a variety of scenarios where it'll be good for the president can be able to speak directly to the war\nBut this is where a doctor redlin or has some qualms especially he says when it comes to this president\nWe showed her to think that the president might be using such a shift them for political purposes or it create a diversion of the presidency without a threat\nFor whatever reason so I think there are real sure you're right it would be so what about it but he's an hour is that many Americans would want to give to Donald Trump\nRed letter is not alone last week three people filed suit in New York to block the testing of the system known as wireless emergency alerts George W E s the suit states the plaintiffs are Americans who do not wish to receive text messages of any kind on any topic or subject from President Trump\nThey say the government is violating their privacy and the sanctity of their homes and that wants to turn people cell phones into government loudspeakers that compel listening\nFEMA says that accusation is baseless\nIn a background briefing for reporters a senior FEMA official conceded well there is no opting out of the alert system is very well governed and you would not have a situation where the president would just wake up one morning as the official put it and attempt to send a personal message and besides has Twitter for that\nBrian Naylor NPR News Washington [noise]\nComing up later today on all things considered we'll hear from one of
