market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited duration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option these are\nNiche product always have been\nThat's Doug badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nSimply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years a stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies\nFried ... free to pursue the truth Ninety five double you yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nHealth insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies can find coverage [noise] more than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the ADA exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which ... says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to backstop they may want something and they may buy these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the duck double as met\nSo people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people Alison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your health comes from exact science is offering cola guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon cancer screening tests that can be used at home\nBut you didn't work out what you're talking about the situation that prime minister where you don't want them as citizens of\nIsrael but you want Israel to still have affected security control of that area that leads to question are you willing to support that proposal that would give Palestinians equal rights civil rights civil rights that are equal to those of any Jewish Israeli citizen and what form of that tank\nWell they would have those rights and their own territory in other words they have their own parliament they have their own government going flag they have their own\nWell they have any of them back now but they have very very little writes compared to the average Israeli I Would think\nWell if you go we don't govern the Palestinians don't administer Ramallah origin then or now blues are governed by the Palestinians but you can extend that governance but not to the point where you would ah endanger Israel\nNow this is a very odd to think where the Palestinians are demanding something that would collapse their own authority and their own government but it's not the first time that they do so so I think we have to be realistic\nAs long as the you know we have the middle east on reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism\nFree delicious law free to proceed Ninety five W yeah day Pittsburgh NPR News station I have a free press\nAnd dangerous you know this is a very odd or a big with the Palestinians are demanding something that would collapse their own authority in their own government but it's not the first time but they do so so I think we have to be realistic as long as the you know we have the\nMiddle East on reformed and pockmarked with so much violence so much radicalism so much terrorism\nThis is the best way we could we could have bought and\nYou you believe in any circumstance that Israel should be able not only that security control but to arrest people to bring them into Israeli courts you want that to stay with Israel [noise]\nUh yes I Want to have an overriding bar but I'll tell you why you don't see this is an interesting question how come you don't see that much terrorism in the west back\nWell first of all we have security cooperation with the Palestinian authority that's good um we don't have it with Hamas in Gaza but the bulk of the security operation was a it was done by off\nBut here's how it's done we have say intelligence about uh uh terrorists in a one of the Palestinian towns\nWe would call up typically the Palestinian security authorities and say why did you take care of it because I don't want to send our soldiers there we don't have to why should we you know and often we have to do because because we're willing to take the within attack as we were at\nThe un by President Abbas so they want us to take care of their security but also you know attack us\nFind it it actually final thing prime minister because I Know your time is very ... I Hope you got the irony of what I said I understand I Do\nFinal thing you have been very closely aligned with President Trump that has carried certain great benefits for you is there also a risk in being so closely allied with such a polarizing president because you would rather as Israel historically has have\nBipartisan support in the United states\nIsrael values is bipartisan support Israel they've had a bipartisan support and I believe will have a ... in in the future it's a very powerful\nBond there there's no risk with being so close to Trump\nWell I think that uh you know you feel that we could have agreements and disagreements with ministers was for example we had a you know it's no secret\nOf how to disagree with President Obama on Iran but at the same time\nWe signed a demo you are in the animal you are the memorandum of understanding going through those are all a very important American security assistance for the coming decade and I appreciate that uh so we can have disagreements with yet have a basic agreement about the importance of our lives\nBy Minister Netanyahu was always a pleasure talking with you thank you very much factors do good to talk to\nIsrael Benjamin Netanyahu we also invited Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas to join us and that invitation\nRemains open It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News\nThe Capitol you enough to say Hi Maria scandal I doubt\nIf you're in charge of crime and enabled a hiring attorney you have the right to an adequate defense and the men in the U.S Supreme Court to states to make sure that happens forty nine state funding for public defenders and usually the money's tied to oversight and standards the odd one out and building\nPublic defense in Pennsylvania remains a patchwork system that can have dire consequences for the most vulnerable people in their state Keystone crossroads reporters and only ... the taken Stefan county to investigate ... starts a crystalline invested in two thousand four for it\nDreaming on W.
