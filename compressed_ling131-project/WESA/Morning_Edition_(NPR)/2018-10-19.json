two hundred and forty nine seats in parliament for candidates of all all flavors or an philosophy is a there was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of scarring and worry\nPartly because of threats by the Taliban which has now come true well and partly\nWidespread of widespread charges on that there was going to be massive fraud though you said a lot of positive uh campaigning

C. A. premiums went up one hundred and fourteen percent since twenty fourteen according to the Pennsylvania department of insurance\nBut Bartlett his point stands as he speaks to one of the two aspects of the CIA that have made it a complex issue for Republicans and Democrats alike\nOn one hand even some Democrats have shown unease with the cost of the plans especially since the individual mandate required people to get insurance or pay a tax on the other hand even some Republicans have been uneasy about losing the protection for pre existing conditions under the CIA\nTwin daughters were for when they sat there are no words to describe the terror we saw when doctors and they both had cancer\nIt's that second point that as Senator Casey on the offensive\nFlu Barletta has its way kids like mine can be denied the care they need in Congress for landowners let insurance companies stripped coverage for pre existing condition too\nFried ... read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station\nThe sound of a free press\nAnd he learned his Eighteen month old grandson has cancer cases campaign noted they profiled that same family for years but ... case these point Barletta like most Republicans did vote to repeal the AIDS da\nDa da da da and theory Republicans might have reintroduce those protections as part of the replace Obamacare effort\nCasey didn't have any campaign stops planned but he was available for a phone interview he says the vote to repeal the A. C. A. was just the beginning of Republican efforts to return health insurance to the days when an illness could keep people from getting covered\nAnd then the second thing it did was rammed through this tax bill which not only gave the top one percent eighty three percent of the benefits and gave big corporations\nTwo trillion dollars in a permanent tax relief but guess what in the textbook and guess what it had you you you but you gifted probably that had a a cut to health care\nGetting rid of the so called individual mandate there ... there by ripping away health care for millions of people\n... says that move paved the way for Republicans to file a lawsuit in September in federal court\nFive point three million people almost half our population I have a pre existing condition if you're worried about those protections you should be really worried about voting for my opponent or other Republicans\nIs now the official position of the Republican Party that pre existing condition protections do not matter a net and they're ready to take those away because they're all supporting this lawsuit in Texas\nThat lawsuit Texas versus the United states asserts the Affordable CARE Act is unconstitutional and therefore should be thrown out\nAnd if you get rid of the whole thing then you get rid of things like the banning of denying care for pre existing conditions right\nThat's Dan ... an assistant professor of public policy and the administration at Penn State Harrisburg\nIt's been a difficult environment to actually reform the Affordable CARE Act when the position of that we need to get rid of it so I don't know that the Democrats have made a lot of good a strong argument to reform they're just sort of fighting the the repeal battle\nMelons and says while Republicans don't want to be on the hook for rolling back protection for pre existing conditions Democrats are still dealing with the issue of high premiums and deductibles a problem they haven't quite been able to sex\nYou know as as they went through the process of trying to repeal and replace it couldn't really get replaced on and then there was try some effort to try to just repeal but if you just repeal you you not only get rid of the things that people don't like like the individual mandate you get rid of other things that\nPeople do like like um the preexisting conditions clause and if you can't replace that\nWith a with anything then you know you you may be able to repeal the Affordable CARE Act but you lose those things that are that are potentially um popular even among even among Republicans\nBarletta is fighting his own battle and despite the energy of supporters in places like Scranton it's an uphill one Casey has raised to point two million dollars in the third quarter of the campaign and had six point seven million available Barletta also raised to point two million but it has just one point three million to spend\nMany face to the more than Nineteen hundred people who contributed two hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars to the W E S a fall membership campaign [noise] it was a huge success special thanks to our sustaining members and our leadership circle members for their challenges it matches\nYou make everything we do possible\nOh you'll have to dress warmly this morning as you get ready to head out the door Don will be breaking on this Friday under clear skies it's thirty four degrees going up to a partly cloudy high today I'm sixty wind and rain will be moving in with colder temperatures this weekend\nBroadcasting from Pittsburgh historic south side this is Ninety point five FM W E essay and W.
