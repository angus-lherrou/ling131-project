u._k. would withdraw from the European Union for the British economy was so big so vital the Europeans would easily negotiate great terms of trade with the British that's what breakfast advocates said that\nNow as prime minister Theresa May prepares to European leaders this week was time running out there is a risk of no trade deal at all NPR's Frank Langfitt is covering the story of London either Frank good morning Steve how has the story of all there was going\nVery well you know uh basically there were talks over the weekend of Dominic Rob these the breakfast secretary you flew to Brussels\nAnd couldn't come up with a deal and they're supposed to primarily as opposed to fly to Brussels on Wednesday with the hope of kind of working this out but it's not going very well and as you are not discussed many times before the big sticking point which was never discuss during that referendum you mentioned\nIs the future of a a border across an eye on the island of Ireland\nAnd neither side wants to see a new border um but there's a great concern that that could happen and they can agree on how to work it out\nBasically with prime minister may would like to do is stay in a customs union with the United kingdom I mean with you for a limited time the you doesn't want that they were afraid they want to guarantee there'll be no border and basically the talks or they'll make us so what they've got\nFree ... read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nUm but there's a great concern that that could happen and they can agree on how to work it out\nBasically with prime minister may would like to do is stay in a customs union with the United kingdom I mean with you for a limited time the ... doesn't want that they were afraid they want to guarantee there'll be no border and basically the talks arrests they'll make\nUs so what they've gotten to is some way to somewhat extend free trade between Britain and the European\nUnion's actually what they're really doing Steve is frankly honestly kicking the can down the road because this is such a difficult\nProblem to solve all though you also noted that even that proposal is not something the Europeans are legal too eager to grab onto\nNo they're not and actually here's the big problem for prime minister may even many members of our party don't like the idea either if you go back to what you're talking about earlier breakfast ears they sold this to people in the United kingdom\nAs it was going to be a brave new trading future for the United kingdom they were going to cut all these new deals with new with other countries like the United states\nIn fact if they stay inside a customs arrangement for a long time that actually would tied their hands they say are they would be still tethered to the European Union and they wouldn't be able to cut these new deals that they say and they insist would be really good for the u._k. economy\nWell are there Brexit fears then saying okay fine great let's just walk away from the European Union with no agreement at all which means we end up with a hard border in Ireland and no real relationship with the Europeans everything has to be started over from scratch\nTheir our breakfast ears who say that to an end even prime minister may has said in the past\nUh no ... no deal is better than a bad deal and what's happening is we're running out of time here it is possible that there could be other negotiations in November and December but I think the European Union's patience is running\nA and the difficulty for prime minister may is even if she can get a deal with the European Union could you get it through her own parliament there's going to be a cabinet meeting tomorrow where it's going to be probably pretty fractious and there's a there's a rising risk if there would be no ... no deal between the two\nUm and what that would mean certainly to the u._k. economy many economists say would be very bad walking away from this enormous market across the English Channel\nOkay so prime minister may meet tomorrow with her cabinet and then what happens the next day\nWhen they only have to see if she'll even fly to Brussels she's supposed to fly to Brussels but if they haven't if there haven't been any further talks\nNo further negotiations no progress what's the point of her going she actually flew to Salzburg this was about a month ago and and actually she felt was humiliated by the European Union they didn't like the deal she was offering and kind of center on her way you're not going to risk that again\nSort of stalemate and time is running out remember at the end of march the United kingdom is set to leave the European Union of and there's not a lot of time left to work this out\nFrank always a pleasure talking with your facts happy to do it Steve That's NPR's Frank Langfitt in London\nYou're listening to NPR News this\nMORNING EDITION on W E s say one of the many
