N. say it's supported by Carnegie Mellon university's integrated innovation Institute details on a master's program at\nCMU dot edu flash I I I\nDo too I'm actually were killed by this in this attack yeah\nLet's just make a few things clear this was the worst anti Semitic attacking us history it occurred just days after the largest\nAssassination attempt on political leaders in this case all Democrats and targets of the presidents in us history and we're not going to have the big debate about whether extreme rhetoric including some of the president's rhetoric\nHelped insight this but the president has made a lot of unifying statements he said these acts were evil he has also\nGone on to campaign and hold rallies kind of partisan politics as usual although he said that he's going to try to tone it down a little bit and he did but just before a rally in Illinois over the weekend he had this to say about his tone\nI Would like to be able to have its own that I have because I feel very strongly about it\nAnd I'd have a much different John frankly the press was\nEven have to rush was fair I'd have a much different out all the time\nSo in other words the press is still at fault\nBut as I said we're going to have a big debate about whether some of the president's words helped create the climate for these kinds of attacks he's not responsible for the acts of crazy people\nBut there's what the president says and then there's what people here you know the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA posted on social media that Jews were funding the caravan Donald Trump has tweeted without evidence that George Soros was funding the caravan he talks about global is a lot and in the right wing media like Breitbart the Daily Caller global list is a synonym for Jew\nIf this is a president who has not really embrace the role of United and chief\nNo he doesn't believe in that other presidents have seen their role as sort of the moral leader of the nation but he doesn't believe in that I don't think he'll change she's over Seventy years old and this kind of extreme rhetoric has worked for him he believes it energize his base\nHis closing argument in this election is based on race and fear of crime fear of immigration and it's kind of a social media business model you know the algorithms at YouTube and and other social media organizations know that more extreme content keeps viewers\nOn longer and this is what the president feels works for his base and that he might tone it down a little bit but I don't think he's going to give it up\nAs you know mid term elections are just over a week away well the events of this past week affects the elections and if so how\nI think for the most part the fundamentals of this election are set they've been very stable with the landscape for Senate races leaning towards Republicans in the house the trend seems to be leading towards Democrats I think the biggest way this might affect\nThe elections is that it crowds out talk about politics the president has complained about this he said Republicans were on a roll we had momentum now all the media wants to talk about are these in quotes bombs\nSo that might be the biggest effect\nAnd pair national political correspondent Mara Liasson ... thank you so much thank you this morning we've been talking about the shooting at the tree of life cynical but this past week also saw fourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case she's there say Iraq is\nFree to explore read it for the the Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station\nThe sound of a free press\nThis story we turn to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could morning It's MORNING with the [noise] All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWell we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will uh it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation\nWell are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested\nA so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make all these explosives and that puts a nation on edge on CNN has reported citing a source\nThat a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are getting a picture of how he became this extreme [noise]\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty sixteen he had a very troubled life lots of arrest\nBut he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and body building in nightlife\nAnd then two years ago all this anger a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he lived in a van hung out sort of on the southern edge of of Fort Lauderdale in Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting this year\nIt's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I began making all these attacks\nAgainst David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud you didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the financier who's been in the news so much lately and in Soros in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you suddenly co workers including one who was in that town\nYet Deborah gradient was a manager at the new river pizza\nI Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nThat talking to my left ear last

Hannah Jones she covers race for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black voters are Latino voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all unless it's a story about race we\nTalk about them in terms of their varied interests and there are varied identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class voters or we talk about educated voters or evangelicals are we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for white voters\nWhat happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern of white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color are somehow the only ones who engaged in identity pilots\n... free to pursue the truth ... W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nHow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is the default so I have treated frequently that when we see something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voter they need to go after suburban voter that there's a silent white in front of\nThat statement and that side of the white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does that accurately reporting this story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about why people\n[noise] well I think one we really downplay I mean we we saw this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election what we saw was that we did not see why people as voting a in a racialized away because\nBy ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue and in fact what the research show was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that they're they're white and it was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnother way politicians may not explicitly say why put our invoking it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world to something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to the very unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you were a person of color we got legal apartheid in his country until forty years ago\nBut why voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not actually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows\nWhen we were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously the most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also this sense that news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how did those two things then sent when you're trying to\nDiscuss some of these racial divisions in this country\n[noise] when I was clearly argue we're all biased I think the way that we covered the election showed that biased to be very Larry clear because we were ignoring literally where voters on the ground were saying ... ... voters on the ground where say\nNo I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also a job to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt and we were like no no they don't know what they're talking about it it's it's economic anxiety so that's biased\nBut also when we talk about fairness is it fair is it accurate to say you're talking about suburban voters if in fact you were only talking about a segment\nFree to pursue the free to explore we're Ninety point five W E s say Pittsburgh's NPR News ... the sound of a free press\nOr all of the people in our country that at this point is about forty percent non white who we are rendering invisible and our

writes Claire Underwood still feels a little out of step with our current political moment\nAs the show opens Claire Underwood is the nation's first female president surrounded by people who suspect she's not quite up to the job she's not particularly popular either judging by the litany of threats her head of security reasons\nTo her [noise] I'd like to fry her eyeballs if no one else steps up

to be centered on Claire even up producers have brutally excise bases character spoiler alert the public is told that Frank died in a sleep next declare but its house of cards and clear is already killed off another romantic partner so who knows\nThe fact is Claire often seem so emotionally detached she's a less compelling anti hero even when she does that talking to the audience thing that's bases Frank Underwood once did so well he wants to talk about the difference between useful and useless pay but when she talks about our own pain she seems curiously disconnected from it\nIt's not true when he tells you all those years ago\nThat there are two kinds useful and useless [noise]\nOf pain is pain [noise]\nLayers pain mostly involve trying to liberate herself from the wealthy mostly
