out of this room today\nAnd uh and just have a little humility on that front so like\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake unless you know what happens here\nThan eight after the Ford Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do some close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talk to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and convincing but he came back over and

Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or a criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as late voted friday he fled the capital\nI talked to him in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes he said why did you vote yes I Am
