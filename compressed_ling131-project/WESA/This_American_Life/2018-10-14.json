procedures they should follow in that exact situation\nJust came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nAnd I don't think they could have been more prepared than anywhere than in a new way to get\nEven sell sell\nBut I can\nDid the training they received

they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school was an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threats hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDouglas is a school with eleven buildings in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments multiple ... teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher and that new clip you just heard\nAnd the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up she's an enthusiastic teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and other teachers have been trained they ran their students are all the new drills those school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when you're the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class because they're going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and go through all the emergency procedures\nCame out of that training expecting an unannounced drug blanks that age of fourteen teachers I spoke to said they were anticipating what Melissa and Ashley were a surprise active shooter trail using blanks\n[noise]\nAfter the two boys tour around the corner yelling at the shooter at the shooter actually stood for another second and our doorway still confused then she plans to her left all the way down the hall just set of open doors to face the freshman building\nI see like hundreds of kids running out of the freshmen building flicking terrified you know when you see terrified kids running like that and it's\nThey they're not there there is no rhyme or reason it was chaos and then you hear that you can hear the gunshots and it's just it's that is not what the drill was\nShe knew it was real [noise]\nFor like the next Ninety seconds as kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running to stop\nShe shouted back to her kids stay put and get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the sound how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds were ... off the media center area the quad it sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction\nWow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were present that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe

terrified people running and I just I could not in our consciousness leave\nThem live and be like that [noise]\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol or follow your instinct\nFor some teachers that wasn't a choice at all\n... in her classroom must have got our attendance sheet out of her emergency\nFolder she kinda Seventeen over twenty five students and to from a different class she pulled in\nFrom the hallway the group is small enough to fitness applied closet someone told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and moved there in the closet it was hot and dark except didn't faces live by their cell phones and Melissa had her phone out too\nThere's a group taxed between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she ... she's on the tax to us that says there is a shooter there's a shooter and my floor\nUm and so my ... my friend Sara says\nDrill or actual and she says actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been raised by a bullet she was raised in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our one by\nWe heard noises in the hallway and we got really quiet um had has a flashlight part of my phone on so that we can kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like he was opens with a key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in around and then somebody that's comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police and then the police evidence that this is a police anyone in here and then there was I\nKind of like a pause and and they're like this is the police as anyone in here and I was like guys I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police as anyone in here and your first thought is it really is a police are still you're not sure I'm Still not your first time they set it on like afterward I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really gets even if it is the police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they had their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to guess about whether to trust this was a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops and so I just very slowly\n... than you pulled on the handle push it open and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving us instructions come out with your hands up\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] what they're told me that actually it was one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEven did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy how her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yells to you know Scott below the closest

one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway do\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting drills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shooting for how much we think and talk about them are still that historically rare but now Melissa and actually have been in a rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having\nA playbook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I moved out to a closet [noise]\nBut they also both had ideas coming out of this about ways they could have been better prepared and\nMelissa for instance one a trauma kits with God's in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it does actually has saved lives and mass shootings\nI really wanted to find some expert to weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help\nDid more kids arrive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson research is what's
