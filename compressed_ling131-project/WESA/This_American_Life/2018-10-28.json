United Methodist church across town open their Sunday services to an interfaith group of worshipers\nAnd the church sanctuary there were eleven white roses displayed at the front one for each of the people killed in yesterday's attack and during the service each name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor wrestled ... that he that he held a special ... to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nOur intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters to remember those who were killed on to offer prayers\nUm but as I mentioned in my my Sherman to also find our voice\nYou know we often say that we offer our prayers and thoughts and that is funny but we must do more we must put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with our boys and with our actions we can ensure that\nThis hatred is not the new American way cannot be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might have been afraid to come out today I did yeah\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put to target on her back and\nI open and affirming you mean as an everyone's ... everyone is welcome to sexual or ride every one is welcome and and normally welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today was it more than you expect that we had a couple of ah\nFolks from the Jewish community come at the beginning and to offer their words of Thanksgiving they did not stay to worship\nBut they did come and to say thank you for doing this so it makes a difference if\nI ask you don't seem rattled by this maybe you are on the inside but you know this community is not that far from here and I ended up to wonder you I mean you hear you\nMy daughter my youngest daughter turned into four roses in honor of\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events because he was a police officer in white hall notch where the ... a perpetrator lives\nSo it was very frightening for us personally um I I Try to allow God ... the urge\nTo give me the ... that I Need\nI I Do not fear for myself I guess if I'm honest I fear for my my children my grandchildren\nBut yet I can allow hatred to intimidate me ...\nWe also met lore has she is the nursery attendant at the church responsible for caring for the congregations littlest members during worship and for her yesterday of attacks on the synagogue where a baby naming ceremony was beef with being held in the presence of children hit very close to home\nWell this church has recently kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of a situation like that of course is the nursery attended that has always been something that's been on my mind if they start here because I'm responsible for eight or nine children at a time\nAnd how I Would evacuating from the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it\nSaid I was running through my head tenants plants that I come up for years\nReally is that what occurred to you yesterday when you heard about what happened where you thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nYeah I grew up post Columbine so\nFree to explore free to pursue the truth Ninety five W yet they Pittsburgh NPR News station the sound of a free press\nBut to do if there was an active shooter in the school and my whole life I grew up in public school constantly hearing about stuff like that tiny hut happened when I was in high school or things like that just always kind of was in the back of my mind and it's kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad you know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plan anyone wants to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that's what you have to be thinking of how\nWe also met a father and son oldest and Matthew ... who were in attendance at the special services today and I would've said his own life experiences allowed him to feel empathy for Pittsburgh Jewish community\nIn African American beer and block an earlier we know about these things are very few walk through reserve neighborhoods or people to look at your front of\nA sermon field are you
