emotion\n[noise] and he walked into the hearing\nTo listen to Dr Ford and judge Kavanaugh not sure what to do [noise]\nBefore you explain what happened next I wanted to say going into a day like this undecided is both very rare for senator and very rare for everyone in America right now\nI don't think being undecided could have been more scarce that day\nDo you know anybody who didn't already know who they would believe in who they would not\nThe one time he spoke in the hearing you sounded just as I'm sure if he had going in and it was at the end of the day\nIs not a good process but it's all we've got and I would just urge my colleagues to recognize that we are Twenty one very imperfect senators trying to do our best to provide advice and consent and India and there is likely to be as much doubt asserting to\nGoing out of this room today and and just have the little humility on that front picture\nIf you watch the news you know at least the outlines of what followed but just to explain because I think you can't understand what happens at the end with Jeff Flake\nUnless you know what happens here the night after the Ford Kavanaugh testimony Thursday night sleep stays up all night freaking out over what to do\nSome close friends told them about their own sexual assaults he talked to advisors you talked to lawyers going over what was said\nHe found Ford credible and

on cap and I reached Chris Coons that afternoon\nIt you know look Jeff and I both went to the same place had read the same report 'em and you know I appreciate his friendship [noise] we are we are viewing this through a different lens Jeff as a conservative senator has always wanted a conservative on the Supreme Court I Am not and I don't\nWho started the FBI report was a disgrace basically didn't follow up on any leads he said was not the investigation he'd asked for last week he was mad frustrated kept going off the record and raging you would not tell me about his conversations with Jeff Flake after they both read the FBI report\nI'm really trying not to either put words in his mouth or um criticize him because you know I like I Am I Am restraining myself from saying something that is not appropriate here\nAs soon as late voted friday he fled the capital I talked to him in the car [noise] people are mad at you again I said well that's how it goes you said why did you vote

of us and um\nAnd discuss the case uh we begin with an order of seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nLeast senior and if the case is the one in which there is a great issue is a public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision\nOr the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four case that it's not just\nReverse of our from it's a question of the rationale\nThe principle of\nThe reasons that you'll get\nAnd let's say it's five to four\nThe five in the majority don't have a lot of back slaps on high fives in thumbs up\nThere there's there's a moment of off\nWe realize one of us will have\nTo write an opinion that commands the allegiance\nOf the American people\nAre an opinion that explains\nTeach the principles of war or the principles of the constitution of the controls of results\nAnd when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case uh we draw down on that capital of trust we make a withdrawal on the trust that in the public has it in our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish that trust\nBy hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles of neutrality\nAnd courtesy scholarship

witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent as deeds\nBased on this testimony was only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed when news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Maryland's email but he did it\nIt's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\nI I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nNot really want to should have done to begin with for not following my gun\nFor not drawing [noise]\nShame leads to a nurse or even the most casual reader or the fundamentals of physics will tell you entered object will remain a nerd until it has acted upon by an external force in other words\nIt takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Maryland a letter\nI Know this is a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would read and I hope I'm not being too forward\nI ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger\nAbout a week later I received no back via email thank you so much for your letter Marilyn writes\nI have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply she also forward originally email just fan once you send two years ago the one he can't stop thinking about\nWhen I read it I'm expecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word\nInstead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks fan for the article and says she shared it with her son or tones breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that span\nConsumed by guilt would read so much into so little\nBut what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place [noise]\n... I'm joking I\nLike I have a couple of little things if you're if you get ... some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK\nMarilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meeting the hotel suite downtown where I Can't stop offering the food that she can stop ... you want to have a coffee or tea Maryland is colon stately with smiling eyes she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black\nShe sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI was always slice of the party I mean I was a jokester all makes she have melons because she's going to keep the policy going I was always kind of the ones that everybody went to people know you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get upset\nFree to pursue the truth free to explore we're Ninety forty five ...
