were presidents ... why do they feel it had to do this now with Trump not just play the face to face with the Trump team but also triangulate around him to get this new NAFTA source\nWell the reason for this was quite simple that's our core economic interests were at stake that even just the auto sector alone there are a hundred thousand jobs and in many many many more jobs that are dependent on that and the idea of twenty five percent tariff on a Canadian article\nIn the United states that sharp in mind but I Do want to emphasize one thing which is we're talking this this thing is over from the Canadian perspective this is an ongoing challenge we're dealing with the U.S president ... material and unpredictable there are\nRemaining issues to be resolved including these steel and aluminum tariffs that are still in place\nIs an safeguard if if Trump tries to withdraw from the deal now the the L seems\nTo be the deal at this point and it's a matter of passing through our respective

would hope that this will that a ha or a more positive relationship between Canada the United states and Mexico\nWe can't afford not to take precautions and anything can happen as we've seen record as part of taking precautions and saying this campaign is going to continue indefinitely\nRoland Paris a former foreign policy advisor to Canadian Prime minister Justin Trudeau thanks very much for your time\nThanks Marco the new trade agreement with Mexico and Canada brings more certainty to the U.S economy that's a good thing but here's something else to worry about new estimates from the congressional budget office show that our government's borrowing\nIs off the charts by historical he's done standards according to the CBS show and just a few years we'll be spending more money to pay the interest on\nOur national debt than we will spend on our defense or Medicare to put it another way the U.S has become one of the most indebted nations on earth we as the world's Jason Margolis to help tell us what that actually means\nA few years ago when the Republican Party didn't control all the reins of government deficit hawks like Congressman Paul Ryan work constantly banging the drum about the perils of a rising us debt here's Ryan speaking to CNN in two thousand and twelve\nWhen a crisis right in front of us and what brings down great empires past and future in debt and there's really nothing to prevent it\nAnd here's Donald Trump speaking to CBS one he was running for president\nI Will tell you we are sitting on a time bomb and Hillary Clinton doesn't have a clue and President Obama has pretty much devil's a dead since he's been in office and somebody's got to pay the price we have to start chopping that debt down\nBy one to Obama was out and Trump was in the Republicans were singing a different tune under Trump and Speaker Ryan spending has gone up and the Republican tax cuts have blown a bigger hole in the budget today the U.S debt it's at Twenty one\nTrillion dollars a huge scary figure\nBut also kind of meaningless by itself\nWherever the threshold is too high we don't know but rising forever is definitely an unsustainable on big problem and we're the only a vast economy on an unsustainable course\nEconomists like Jason from an at Harvard's Kennedy School of government study what's called the debt to GDP ratio how much a country owes versus how much it generates all the other advanced economies it's falling\nGermany France Mexico Argentina Mongolia they're all carrying a smaller debt to GDP ratio than the U.S if you look at a list of how we rank internationally and the U.S is sandwiched between boot taunted and Jamaica were carrying are heavy debt load since World War two\nEconomists say when you're in a time of recession it's time to spend to get the economy going again when the economy is roaring along as it is now it's a good time to save says Chris Edwards he's the director of tax policy studies at the Kato Institute libertarian think tank in Washington\nThe Republican Party I used to be a ... outside of the national defense areas or the party of spending restraint but they no longer are you don't hear anything about ... spending restraint for major Republican leaders and the fact that we're in an attempt to Europe and economic expansion\nNow and that keeps rising is really extraordinary and very irresponsible unless Congress fundamentally changes of\nIts path we are headed for a Greek type crisis\nBut what exactly could that mean\nThe rising a debt ah you know could could create a crisis situation where interest rates are spike the government has to take drastic actions perhaps you know cutting benefits a Social Security and other benefits are radically or hiking taxes are dramatically which will damage the economy\nSocial unrest people taking to the streets as their savings rate could that happen in the United states of America mark gold wind doesn't see us as the next Greece but he does think we should be paying more attention to the dead\nOne of the scary things about that is we probably won't know where to deep in debt until it's too late gold wine is a senior policy director with the nonpartisan think tank the committee for a responsible federal budget I don't think we're headed for Greek like crisis because unlike Greece with our on our own currency\nAnd we can actually make her own party but I Do believe that our current path is unsustainable\nAnd I do believe that if there isn't a course correction at some point um we will face a financial crisis who actually potentially create a global financial crisis that's\nNot as bleak as a full scale Greek crisis bordering on anarchy Jason firmin at Harvard doesn't think either of those scenarios is likely he served as chair of President Obama's council of economic advisors and says the debt should have never been our number one issue in the first place\nBut I don't think it should drop off the list of concerns entirely either\nWhen it comes to the United states' debt right now he says he subscribes to the termites in the woodwork theory\nThat every year they shut the weight your prosperity a little bit and we do a little bit worse off but without ever thing ever being really dramatic\nStill after a while your house will need to be fixed and continually delaying repairs we all know
