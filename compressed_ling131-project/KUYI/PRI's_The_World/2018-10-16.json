S. for asylum one of those is obviously family separation what are the others\nWell the reason that the Trump Administration would separating families but it's not just be cruel it wanted to detain all asylum seeker indefinitely if you're detaining refugees only based on their migration status and they don't present any kind of risk society or risk of sleep that constitutes arbitrary detention under international law\nEnds in right now along the entire length of the U.S Mexico border the Trump Administration is pushing thousands of asylum seekers back into Mexico and tons of that it's safe for them to wait there we also found that\nThe U.S authorities had been encouraging Mexican immigration officials to deport does decide on the cruise back to the very countries where they slip persecution or threats of death and that's flat illegal under both US law\nAnd international law so there's these three interlocking\nPolicies and since we released a report both Republican and democratic members of Congress to come just asking for more information we're hopeful that as we get closer to the appropriations process that Congress can use the power of the purse to compel the department of homeland security to be more forthcoming\nBack now to Maria the Brazilian grandmother seeking asylum in the U.S with her grandson brain griffey says Amnesty International with President that Marie is final immigration herring and it wasn't looking good for\nWe actually witness as judge such compel her\nIn the courtroom to give up her asylum claim in order to be reunited with her grandson special needs before being deported back to Brazil implication was all of a sudden fame some air strikes is saying we want to close the loop holes but we can reunite you with your grandson so you don't get deported without um so what you see here's a clear threat of\nPermanently separating the grandmother from her grandson\nAt the threat of being deported without him and we saw in terms of post a grandmother and a grandson in the long term consequences or grade she actually had a medical emergency where she had to be rushed to the hospital\nBecause of health that you're so much for the mental anguish of being separated from her grandson with special needs and she presented in court and still it for a longer attention finally actually it was only when Congress person\nPeso O'Rourke got involved that she was released it'll turn to reunite with her grandson where our Maria and her grandson today\nThere in Connecticut he's still under the custody she was seeking to move from we can visit to having guardianship of him again but she has to go through the bureaucratic hoops while she also appeals from Saddam claim I spoke with her a few weeks ago\nAnd she said you know I Need to go to a psychologist I'm scars a deep I forget what I was saying I Can't sleep at night it was all the symptoms that I've identified myself worked in war zones I bet she told me you know that when she first saw him he wasn't being taken care of properly\nHe was in this heavily air conditioned room just shivering saying you know a mommy mommy why did you hear and Everytime they leave each other after a visit all day and they both go through the suffering because they're reliving the moment to the separation\nWas EMS international prime griffey another story now about family separations is one with a twist assorted about Seventy years ago when the border between Alaska and Russia was officially closed\nIt was the start of the Cold War and the Soviet Union impose what was called the ice curtains the border finally reopened about three decades ago but even though travel is possible\nA lot of families live on both sides of the ... sea remain split Emily ... recently spent a week with one family waiting to make the trip from Nome too caught up in Russia\n[noise] in a tiny kitchen in an apartment and known Valentino can you get cut off aid to pop\nUp for it I go and washed for [noise] how you do [noise] that are really fun\nFor her two daughters find and all of that try to keep our mind off the rather that kept us grounded here on the west side of the parents strange how I have two parents [noise] many years [noise] I'll come up either\nWay primary fire parents crane not identify say hello can you can actually rents and gamble a lot of LA\nJohn St line finally gonna bearing the it's only about eighty miles as the crow flies from their ... that's the tiny coastal village where can you can correct\nIn Russia and pass away three of her sister or brother napkins and and many of her friends start west communique isn't really that far from home but getting there and it's tough\nFor starters the runway on the Russian side often gets ...
