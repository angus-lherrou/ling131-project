conversation\nAbout sexual assault and harassment that may have helped some women in the hotel industry achieve the goal they've been fighting for for a long time getting their employers to do more to protect them from sexual assault was made headlines a few years back when a hotel housekeeper accused Dominique Strauss Kahn the former head of the IMF\nOf sexual assault\nThat case was settled out of court but the problem never went away here's the world's Alison at at a\nImagined is you're a woman working in an office and you're in the middle of a meeting all of a sudden your meal co workers starts to undress it's hard to imagine that happening right well if your hotel housekeeper chances are it has happened to you\nYou know I'm not doing time and I'm assuming oh no one's in the room so I'm gonna put my kid and I'm going into the room so this particular time you know I'm not answer this I mean there's gas is standing there completely ...\nThat's ... she's a housekeeper at a large hotel in Chicago she asked me not to use her last name or the name of the hotel where she works she's worried about how speaking out my impact on job she says that when this happened she was more than just scared\nLike it just it made me feel disgusted angry so I just kind of like bad just left\nShe recorded a tour manager but she says nothing was done\nSo it's one of those things happen so much in housekeeping where your managers kind of feel like it was just an hour and they just say okay you don't go back to the rooms today\nBut she did have to go back she brought another woman so she wouldn't have to be alone and fortunately that just wasn't there\nBut he wasn't asked to leave to twenty sixteen when members of her union UNITE HERE wanted to ask her and her co workers from questions about sexual assaults on the job she knew this was her chance to make change happen\nI'm like oh okay and one of my coworkers were sitting next to me like you know just kind of knows me like you know they come and talking about sexual harassment and I'm I'm like this is our opportunity to kind of share things that we deal with every day\nWith Tony and other housekeepers in the union set up to survey more than five hundred women about their experiences on the job nearly sixty percent of women they talked with dealt with some form of assault by hotel guest\nThat lead to action last year housekeepers and Chicago successfully lobbied for device to keep them safe\nIt's called the panic button and it was part of a city wide campaign known as hands off pants on to\nThis is one solution [noise] it's they send a message that science was in danger he knew that there'll be ... she's the head of housekeeping at the ... hotel she shows me how the safety device works\nPress the button and hotel security is on the way housekeeping\nProject emigrated here in the nineties from what was then Yugoslavia\nShe's always worked as a housekeeper her story is not uncommon according to a study done by the American immigration council the top occupation for foreign born women here in the U.S is housekeeping with nearly nine hundred thousand women working in this sector for having the panic button has made her\nAnd her staff safer I honestly think things are great I think it is great Chicago hotels are required to give this device to housekeepers but sexual assault in the hotel industry is a global issue\nSo what are some of these larger chains like Mary on June to keep their workers safe to say in Paris or get by\nSuch heightened awareness around safety and security so we're dialing up in the space but I think it's important to remember there is no one magic answer\nThat's Erica Alexander she's the chief lodging services officer from Mary in international she's talking about the new devices to rolling out in the U.S and Canada but the company has no current plans to put panic buttons into the hands of their workers in other countries\nThat are a huge problem because we understand that you know the Mariette brand doing the right thing when you're in the United states around the world\nThat's Cathy find gold she's the international director of the AFL CIO she says that back in June housekeepers from Chicago presented at an international labor conference in Geneva they inspired other housekeepers working in South Africa and around the globe to push for hands off pants on campaign\nThat is happening here in the United states and Mary I can't do it in the United states they can do it in China where they have masses and they do it throughout Asia Latin America\nBefore the me too movement last year housekeepers like Tony I didn't have much of a voice when it came to safety on the job [noise] they've been trying for years to get their employers to protect them\nAnd then all of a sudden all of this stuff started showing up in the new and I'm just like this is incredible on my book could do like we we all have to say like we've started something\nAnd they have five of the major hotel chains have promised to install panic buttons in older hotels nationwide by twenty twenty but for so many people around the globe workings housekeepers there's no button that can press\nTo stop them from being assaulted on the job for the world Alison ...

far end of the earth remote villages in Russia for example but getting into can also be as easy as going online and doing searches the investigative news websites doubling cat and the insider did both\nAnd in the process managed to reveal the likely identity or one person allegedly involved in the poisoning of a former Russian military intelligence officer and his daughter in the u._k. the suspects name is Dr Alexander Michigan according to the investigation\nHe's a trained military doctor who worked for the G argue Russian Army intelligence\n... one of the building cat reporters who worked on this case you went through a pretty a lengthy process to identify Alexander Michigan what clues did you actually have to work with\nWhat we had a little bit to start with just from the information that Russia had released and also the British authorities\nIt is to identify Alexander Michigan what clues did you actually have to work with\nWhat we had a little bit to start with just from the information that Russia had released and also the British authorities had really about the cover dennie guy so\nWe now know his real name is Alex intermission before he was ... and he's in his outcome Petra which was his covered that it was totally fake identity they made up out of nowhere for him to travel under\n[noise] um and so we had some information about that cover identity quitting his birthday um where he had to pass passport issue too which is a very small town in the middle of nowhere [noise] I'm In northern Russia\nSo that was a good starting point\nSo to talk a bit more about that process how you you've got that starting point where do you go from there so we have a starting point if we can assume that he probably use some of the same information cover identity from Israel I looked into a bunch of database of some of them are openly available some of them are late um Russia is a very corrupt\nAnd leaky society and because of that they're linked databases from driver's licenses and insurance stuff and voter registration and addresses and stuff all over the Internet you can find that you know where to cross referenced everything we can find and we found him ... about a guy named Alex in Michigan by the same birth dates and disarm roughly the same village in the middle of nowhere and northern Russia\nAnd after a bunch of digging including actually\nFinding someone to go to his tiny little village where he's from and finding locals who I Am currently he was a local DJ before he went on medical school\nYeah he was he a DJ at the local club the one club I'm sure they had in the tiny village so we once these countries in these databases of cross referencing the tiny bit of information we think we're probably matched the true identity Michigan\nI gotta say some of the ... in in your process to you and your investigators really seem to have to put your cells in the mindset of a spy\nAnna way I mean a lot of this was just a lot of very creative thinking thinking of\nUm any vulnerability of what would leave a paper trail on the spy and Russia so you know maybe not you can't find his birth certificate right because maybe that's all the information has a new way forever but again these spies have real lives to they have a family they have kids or you can find information that we tracked back to them\nSo I mean yes maybe some of this kind of spy work but it was very very basic routine research I actually learned and you know high school or college or you know searching\nLooking for an interesting details cross referencing them and what's actually\nNow that you've got a name what else were you able to find out about Dr Alexander mission like do have evidence that he was working on behalf of the Kremlin\n[noise] yeah I mean this guy is listed his registered addresses at headquarters and the cherry which when I was glancing absolutely insane like why would a secret spy list his public address like on his driver's license that address to the you know see I ... the ... one of the CIA [noise] well he did it because of you know if you get pulled over and his car\nTo cop pulled up the address and he sees the address of the you know the Russians CIA more or less and he's like oh actually you know everything you can just go you know you're fine so\nUm we ran the address I'm at a traffic that we found a three hundred and five men all between the ages of twenty five and fifty\nAll had the same register to address the difference when I had written a mosque out all these men almost certainly are often you that you are you\nAnd they all listed their vehicle registration address 'cause they get to want to pay traffic fines and they get pulled over or they get older for drunk driving or speeding the cop just let them go right because they don't want to mess with somebody in the intelligence services are really everything just goes down to laziness and I guess corruption in a way to 'em and that's how the owner abilities however the research that's um played out\nSo the headline in the guardian on this news and treat me it said a string of own goals by Russian Spies exposes a strange sloppy knows so what is your take on the possibility that this was not sloppy and his butt intentional that Russia want it to leak who these men were\nI mean I suppose it's always possible right because we know every time any investigation to make Russia or China and saying well they want you to find right well if they want us to find a wide no one published or because you know these insurance\nRegistration is for these eagles the J your headquarters [noise] you know they've been doing this for years and years and years and years and registering new age is the address and like
