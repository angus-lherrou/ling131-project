GBH has spent a year looking deeply at how all this has impacted people all around the world they're documentary the Facebook dilemma is airing\nOn PBS this week we want to focus on one country discussed in the documentary the Philippines where president Rodrigo Duterte day is accused of using a coordinated army of trolls to silence critics\nGave it any patriotic for me I'm In line skates sponsoring highland name chemical [noise] so this is just trying to democracy on [noise] and where our lives are probably [noise] playing like a coup\nFrontlines James Jacoby worked on this investigation and joins us in the world studio thinker coming budget thank you [noise] uh what is the place of Facebook in the lives of most Filipinos like how much of the population has access to it and\nHow much do they interact with each other by the up while it's remarkable the story Facebook in Southeast Asia it's amazing that\nThey've pushed aggressively into south east Asia to Philippines and to me in all other countries and they are essentially the de facto Internet and a lot of those countries because they offer Facebook as part of a data plan where people don't actually have to use the data in order to use it and the Philippines it's between Ninety\nAnd a hundred percent of the Internet users in the Philippines use Facebook as the Internet basically and\nMaria wrestler who who's a\nThe women were interviewing in the film from the Philippines runs a big news organization there she talks about the fact that it's their public space it truly is\nTheir public space in the Philippines um in terms of their allies so Maria restaurant we just heard from we'll hear more from her in a moment um we've reported on this or that a\nOccurred in Myanmar where fake news actually lead to violence headed Rodrigo Duterte day the Filipino president weaponize Facebook during the election campaign and twenty sixteen so what happened is Facebook actually offered a lot of help to to tear today during his campaign for president\nAnd help them to really harness the power the platforms helped his campaign really understand how to use it effectively and as Maria wrestle reports after he was elected he essentially weaponized if by turning all this campaign machinery all these accounts that he was controlling\nHe had a network of fake accounts and paid followers that were just sending all sorts of lives about policies and\nAlso going after critics in a rather vicious hateful way um and in some cases are trying to incite violence against people\n[noise] so uh on Maria ... uh the the activist I mean she worked for a prominent news website in the Philippines Rappler media and when she started noticing this problem she actually brought it to Facebook retention in twenty sixteen as we learn in the dock here's an exchange between you James and ...\nWere you given an explanation as to why they weren't acting [noise]\nNo [noise]\nI think one game\nAnd they were focused on but the thing is that\nCountries like [noise] ... ... [noise] I don't have this guy is what happens when you bring everyone onto a platform not exercise any kind of rules\nIf you don't have those rules for getting wine country chaos so\nJames what did Facebook tell you about the way they responded to the Philippines and to Maria\nRussia's complaints well Facebook has set a number of things in response to it on one\nThey said they were too slow and addressing the problems that Maria brought to them and it wasn't until Maria\nProduced and published a three part investigative series that exposed the fact that there were these accounts that were spreading hate speech and misinformation that Facebook actually took action on those accounts but as she tells us the problem is ongoing interestingly\nRecently and as a as I think it was an April Facebook is pain Maria rest as organization to be a third party fact checker of things that are going viral\nOn Facebook in the Philippines\nBut as she put it to us recently they're completely inundated and Facebook still doesn't really have handled the problem there does that suggest you know hiring her as a factor that does that suggest Facebook is kind of pursuing due diligence or they were just trying to plug the hole I think that that\nThere are fact checking project that they're trying to do all around the world um is what they're seen as the first step toward a solution or at least containing the problem of hate speech and misinformation have\nPeople on the ground that are fact checking material in the home country in the language and um it's really an outsourcing of it\nAnd what's also fascinated about it is that where you're ... restaurant runs a news organization and she's utilizing resources that would otherwise be put toward reporting and doing fact checking riots going viral on Facebook yeah um if you zoom out of the Philippines a for a moment I mean many of us are\nClosely watching Facebook's operations here in the U.S and abroad and the the big question which you raise several times are they doing enough at Facebook to stop these campaigns whether it's disinformation fake news hate speech uh what do you think after spending a year investigating all this and actually being at\n... you know H cue for Facebook\nWell they um it's an interesting question because what does it mean enough and I asked people at Facebook you know what's the standard for success here\nBecause there's no ability for us to audit them were really left in the position of having to take their word for it and whatever it is that the standard that they set for themselves but there's so much that we just don't know but as a ... this this is a writer Alexis Madrigal from the Atlantic ah\nSays in your dog and it really\nWas a really powerful quote the very things that divide us the most are the things that get the most engagement um talk about that a bit and ... where that's most evident right now well\nWe've got our mid term elections and um and we've had you know the the horrific events here of the past week and scenes that whether it's the shooter in Pittsburgh or the attempted bomber um these are people that are very radicalized on social media polarization and\nFilter bubbles are are real thing on social media and this kind of reinforcement of world views that's the main discussion happening right now I think\nJames after a year of working on this er and investigating Facebook or are you on the platform or what if you were or you know off it I I'm On that I've always taken a I have a very small footprint on their um which by the way it doesn't mean much in terms of what data they collect revenue um but uh\nAnd why not call it a synagogue\nWell pretty ultra orthodox establishment which he represents an Israel conservative and reform Jews or or reconstruction issues or any Jews are not wanted ox Jews are not really considered full juice in her eyes\n[noise] so what do you attribute some of these ten ear reactions as he put it to what happened in Pittsburgh\nI think it's cynical politics you have somebody like Naftali Bennett who is the diaspora administer\nA officially is also a former aide of nuts and Yahoo and now turns rival and uh he tries to always play for based it's even more right wing and Yahoo and he should I Would argue no better\nBut yet he's still found a way to compare the hand that shot down a lemon juice preying on a Saturday morning to the same forces that fire rockets from Gaza\nInto Israel I her ma which I think also shows like a disconnect completeness understanding of history\nYeah I mean not Taliban it also got on a plane to Pittsburgh um there was another reaction to from the Israeli ambassador to the u._s. so wrong ... um he was on MSNBC blaming anti Semitism on both the left and the right he's blaming both sides\nWant to think forces in college campuses today is anti Semitism and no fans of anti semi usually not me I'm not seeing on college campuses they're coming from the radical left so we have to stand against anti Semitism whether it's on single life whether it's on single life yeah\nUm I think here again Israeli\nJews are not following the intricacies of right versus Latin America I think a lot of Israeli Jews would be no firm hold support Donald Trump they don't really care so much credit domestic policies they don't really know very much medicine I think all these it's important to others really due to the Trump support Israel and the Trump support strong Israel so ah\n... comments I think perplexed American Jews than they do Israeli Jews\nAnd to tell me a bit of a reaction among some of Israel's left wing politicians to what happened in Pittsburgh\nUm I think over all although there has been expressions of condolence expressions of shocking at heart [noise]\nThe the new kind of quickly moved on here I think a lot of Israeli Jews don't fully understand the impact that this had on the American Jewish community they don't fully understand the place them in a God life for American Jews they don't\nUnderstand that or American Juniors and synagogue is a second home it's a place where kids grow up and Hebrew school where they hide as I did you hiding out for for me to school in the bathroom with my friend and a place where you would pray to come of age\nAnd that you you know this is a place where people feel at home I share a story I did a lot of reporting about the residents of Pittsburgh and the people from scroll hill and I'm\nOne of the stories that move the mouse with the story of Jerry Ruben ... six years old he was one of the amount of people who were murdered he rushed to the sound of the noise\nWe don't know if you knew the gunfire at that point to go help and that's when he was shot and and as an immoral and Pittsburgh people spoke about how he had this\nInteresting custom dream orders hottest which is the Jewish prayer memorializing the dead and it's set in every single service she stood up\nHe always stood up for the ... and that is traditionally a time and only those who are mourning actually stand up and when asked why does he stand up every single time he said well I have no children and one day there will be nobody to stand for me so I\nStand for all of those who have no one fan for them and on Saturday everybody stood up instead for Jerry in his memory and I think on\nThat sending out to the standing up together is such a metaphor and I think\nOverall Israeli Jews and Israelis in general they don't need to send a guy in the Jewish community because they had their church unity within their own lives and in a way that American Jews if they want to find community they want to find\nA sense of solidarity among themselves that they find it in the wall for the synagogue and that is another sort of way that Israeli Jews and American Jews you know don't can act\nYou know the president does reveal are quite a few differences between American and Israeli Jews what would you how would you sum up those differences like what's the bumper sticker\nHere [noise] me think um\n[noise] that American Jews and it's really just aren't you there and you can pass rate now say American Jews for the most part are liberal like consider themselves\nVery much attached to their immigrant roots and because of that they tend to support rate for immigrants they tend to very much believe in the Senate this repeated in the Bible is an editor tenant would just\nBe kind to the stranger because you two are much once the stranger in Egypt and so there's this very strong desire to knowledge that you know American\nJews have done fairly well to themselves in in America and feel fairly successful and silver and comfortable um and I think that comfort to the lens that just sort of be more liberal and more open where Israeli Jews\nSeal feel under attack they feel very much for the the product that sort of post traumatic coast Holocaust world where they look at\nThings very much in this sort of zero sum game in time you know a person's them whether it comes to Arab neighbors or you know I'm fresh from and somehow an Israeli the trend towards that it's like circling the wagons in fear\nAnd America jewelry and have a transit of toward plurality Jewish pluralism openness and I think his decisions coming more clearly now and for a task tragically in some ways highlights a splintered\n[noise]
