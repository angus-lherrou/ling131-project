Klan\nAnd the spider sad\nWhere I Am I build my home and all things come to me\nAround a thought about what the spider headset and decided that they were words of wisdom and he headed back to his clan\nBut when he told the people he had chosen the spider he was met by many frowns and complaints\nBut he ... them and sad\nIs true that the buffalo is majestic but it must wander the prairie in search of food and it is true that the deer as swift and sure\nBut it must spend his days hiding from the hunter and it is true that the eagle as a sharp eyes hunter\nBut he must fly for ever roaming the skies and search of prey\nBut he must fly for ever\nRoaming the skies and search of prey the spider\nDoes not wandering search of food she has few enemies and does not have to hide the spider bills her home in a good place and all things come to her\nEveryone listened in front about what the runners sad and decided that he did speak words of wisdom and the spider would be a perfect symbol for the sky\nClan invest they made their home in a fruitful valley where the rivers were principal the sun gentle and all\nThings came to them and the two for the story teller the spider is a perfect symbol\nFor as she\nThe storyteller weaves homes of wonder and delight through the Web of stories\n\nIn that vast and fertile continent of Africa where the rivers once was fleeing strongly and the trees are tall and majestic in a small village there lived a hunter named owner room with his three sons and his wife\nOwner ... was a great hunter he\nWould go out sometimes for a week sometimes two or more\nSometimes for months but he always came back with great game and much food for his family and relatives and friends and so one day he had to go on another hunt he said goodbye\nTo his sons and touched his wives largely round belly saying I Hope to return before the birth of our son and she said I Hope you do to dear\nSo weak past two weeks three weeks a month and owner room did not return to months past three months passed and the fourth month his fourth son was born and his wife named Tim techie\nAnd said to the little baby your father should be home soon and he will be so happy to see you\nBut more months passed an owner room did not return on the boys continue doing what they did hunting and gathering and farming\nAnd the little boy peck he began to grow in a year past than he began to crawl around\nAnd another year past than he was walking\nAnd more months passed and one day he was sitting outside playing while his other brothers worked and talked\nAnd everyone was quite amazed when ... spoke for the first time and he said and his little voice is my uh the older boys looked up and said\nThat is a good question panky you were not even born when he left\nWhat could have happened to our father we must go and find him so the older boys added their shields and their spears and they went off in search of their father they walk down\nOne trail down another they search for days and days until finally they came upon a pile of bones next to a rusted sword and she called and they knew that fees belong\nTo their father but instead of crying and breathing the oldest sad I Know how to arrange the bones of the body in perfect order and he did so and the second son said I Know how\nTo cover the bones with flash and organs and he did so and the third one said I\nKnow how to feel the body with life giving blood and the press and he did so and they stood and waited\nAnd soon there father opened his eyes he smiled and stood up and they all returned home\nAn owner own stayed in touch with his family\nFor for a full days\nGetting to know his new friend Peggy and finding out all that had happened then is apps on the fifth day he came out and so a lot as a towel and while the women at the village prepared a feast he went inside and took back Kyle tail\nAnd move it into a beautiful tile tales switch\nAnd he came outside walking through the village fanning himself with his ... switch and it wasn't too long before our neighbors and relatives started walking up to him and saying\nYou know all around you weren't here on my birthday happened when you like to give me that cow tells switch oh\nUncle owned a room you missed our anniversary\nOnes you'd like to give us that cow town switch finally he stopped everyone and said my son's or the ones who brought me back to life after I had been killed by a leopard one of them will get the fuck ...\nSwitch and immediately but boys began to argue among themselves as to who should get to switch I was the one who gave him breath I put the bones back together I gave him skin\nOnce again all our own held up to switch to silence\nThem and then he extended the switch down to ... who was playing at his feet and all the rooms sad for switch belongs to patchy\nFor he is the one who remembered me for it is sad\nThat a person never dies as long\nAs he is remembered and so we continue that tradition to this day as we honor the memories of those who have gone away\n\nOnce in Russia a farm I had the good fortune to come upon a beautiful stallion and all of his neighbor said how very fortunate you are and the farmer said we'll see about a week later\nVery patiently and very carefully\nWell why don't you do the same things with the U.S steps on and finally same nap understood and she went back home\nAnd she continued to cook and clean and speak to highly\n'cause she didn't get upset if he didn't respond to her she didn't fix them any special food or make them any special closed but she was nice to him and treated him with love and respect and kindness just as she did her husband\nAnd about three weeks later highly actually started to speak to saying now about six weeks later he offered to help her with chores\nAnd nine weeks later he invited her to take a walk with him to his river\nAnd one night about twelve weeks later just before he fell asleep highly sad\nI Love you see a map for highly had found his heart was big enough to still love his mother and love saying that the U.S they achieved their hearts desire may use to achieve your heart's desires\n\nMoments in England they're lived an old widow woman who took care of herself by helping her neighbors with their children and occasionally cooking for them and one day she was walking down a path going home and saw\nIn the middle of a path a large black pot and she thought\nOh my goodness what a nice hot if it's in the it would make me a perfect flower pot\nSo she went and lift it up from the ad and to her surprise found a pot full of gold coins\nOh my think happens I have no worry for the rest of my days so she looked at that pot and fought a few minutes and took the scar from around your neck and tied\nIt to the handle and started dragging the pots along the pathway so she walked for quite a while until she got tired as she found a large rock and stopped and sit down and rest that a while\nBefore she started walking again she went to check on her gold coins and when she lifted the lid\nTo her surprise the gold coins were gone and a large\nLump of silver sat in the bottom of the pots and the old ladies set out\nIsn't this good [noise] I was really beginning to wonder how I could take care of all of that gold sheep it from being stolen from having everyone watching to borrow money\nSilver is so much easier to handle I Am so lucky she put the lid back on the pot started dragging it along the path and walked quite a ways because the pot was at this heavy\nBut again she got tired and stopped and sat on a rock and rested for awhile\nAnd before she continued on her way she lifted the lid sure to check on her silver and to her surprise it had turned into a bar\nOf late [noise] oh my goodness this is just wonderful I was really beginning to wonder about how\nI could get rid of that silver but land it's easy to sell in the village I'll be able to make enough money to see me through the winter so she continued on her way\n\nBut just as she was getting to the gate of her cottage she fell to shirk I'm a scarf and turned and looked and the whole pot had turned into a large stone\nAnd the old lady said oh isn't that this wonderful such a perfect rock it'll be just right for holding the door open on these warm\nEvenings and just as she went to pick up the stone it sure worked out of her hands and turned into a large creature big as a horse with ...\nAnd turned into a large creature big as a horse with four\nLegs and long lanky ears and a cow face and it looked straight at her and started long thing and kick this legs up in the air and ran away\nLady open the gate and walk to her house shaking her head and she sat down and said\nI must be the luckiest Roman in the world to have seen their heads a cow and it was just\nThis close\nI Am truly some most lucky woman that has ever live\n\nAccording to a wise old Japanese storyteller once lived a humble man named by young he was a hard worker he had an\nIce house and a little bit of land but he was middle aged an all alone because of my young wasn't to pry their to him vicious and by

finally it was time for by young to return to work so he went out to his fields and try to plant but he missed his wife so badly he returned home\nAnd the next day he tried to go and work and his staples but again he missed his wife so badly that he returned home finally she said since well not do if you do not work how we live\nSo she fraud and went into town and had an artist paint a portrait of her and she gave it to to buy\nYeah and then he took that portrayed with him where ever he was working and he was quite happy and was able to do all that was necessary\nBut one day he was

I'm\nTaking pictures of the um scenery or you know wherever we're at and traveling and\nA lot of times um we we learned a lot when we\nHave medical professionals on our program and they describe a the science of feelings as well\nAs a medical point of view but we also open up a lot when we turn to people who are living a life with either condition or who are family members and so I understand you have a lot of wealth doors in\nUm being a parent of a child with Down syndrome and talked to a little bit about some of the things that you really learn didn't we know that\nSometimes you can read everything under the sun but until you're living beings experiencing then that's when you really know um what are some things that you'd really like to tell parents who might be um in the initial stages\nUm ask a lot of questions even if you um one thing that I've\nLearned is too I educated myself about the disability law under the individual disability Education Act and\nThat follows a child from birth\nTo Twenty one and educational system and um I always encourage families to ask a lot\nOf questions um\nWhether they're in the early intervention program birth to three that goes so fast with in regards for services but then they go into the school system and I'm just asking a lot of question communication is one of the best thing families can do is start I'm communicating to the staff that's working with their child\nWhether it's at home or in the school system and\nUm because that's the best approach and communicating and working out differences and understanding um the process when the child going through the school system and building that foundation for the child there is there can be barriers but again I'm families can\nUm ask 'em what what is that really looked like for my child\nWhat is you know how's that going to benefit my child in the school system [noise] I Know a lot of times um families are asking about um speech meat communication is very\nImportant for the child and as well as the muscle tone if they have weak muscle tell what does that look like from our physical therapy speech therapy\nAnd then also cognitive they're thinking skills and how that's going to support them a lot of times as families we don't think about the future when the child an infant and taking the feature long term\nWhen they're Twenty years old what twenty five years old where are they going to be at 'em I encourage families to dream\nHave high expectations for their child if they\nWant them to be successful and independent living um have a job um those are high expectations for their child [noise] um\nAnd and so you know those are things families can share with the team because there's so many professionals that comes in and out of the child's life in the family's life that it gets confusing and record keeping us the best thing that a family can do is start keeping track\nOf um medical records educational\nRecords evaluations those kinda things keeping them all in order\nIn you talked about that independence even with your own son in um you know hearing his age and how far he's come along with this too you know do you feel proud to be able to say that he's independent and also exciting to hear that he has his own business\nI'm proud that he is um it depended mean\nHe does have his own I'm a\nHomemaker through his long term health care\nA waiver through Medicaid die he receives and so then they come in and help support him ever whatever that he needs um set up to when he sells a lot of times they let him initiate it first before they do or they'll ask camp first um and he likes that because he doesn't want\nPeople just doing for him so um he is very independent\nAnd those areas and I'm just very proud that where he's at instead of just not doing anything at home and so that gets them excited when we tell them that these are\nEvents coming up when we put them on the calendar and then he ... he prepares himself and he he does everything independently which is as far as technology which is I pat and his laptop and he does his own protein and those kinds of things and puts it together for himself\n\nHey hey\nHey hey hey no no no no\nNo\n\nNo no no oh yeah oh\nHey\nHey\nHey hey I\nWon't come back we're focused on raising a child with Down syndrome and if you have questions You're welcome to join us and if you have advice for raising a child with Down syndrome and You're welcome to calling\nTo where at one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for each one eight hundred nine nine made it and with us today on the phone line insurance ... she is the mother of a daughter with Down syndrome she has ... creek in Cherokee\nAre pushing haven't here with us and also here in Studio forty nine is doing harden cheese in early childhood Sam when we asked them\nLeaned more parents reaching out and we thank you for being here and surely turn to you you were talking about things\nThat you have to consider and it really would like to hear your thoughts on um navigating as a parent or even transitioning your life um to learn a new way to be there for your child and and talk to a little bit more I think we've heard a little bit about speech therapy is there\nAny other aspects you'd like to open up please do\nThank you um and I\nThink for me I'd be a kind of an urban area and having a lot of resources available to any credit Saturday than it on so it became a question that I got a lot of questions from other people just need to people saying well what is your tribe do to help what is your tribe offer any programs and it was you know sadly there was nothing much I offered\n'em in the way of providing any additional services or anything but to having I'm a developmental disability like Down syndrome and other than how silly\nI'm going to be the contract tell and so that became in my mind okay my try if something happened to me or my family or anything else what would my tribe what would they have available to help my child today she got to the child welfare system or something you know\nUm how do we set that up because they're trying to make people were supposed to take care of all of our people and everyone is here we learned this in this whole population\nIs not being provided any kind of services or and then we still had a long way to go in the regards to advocate providing services um for people with developmental disabilities\nUm and and my daughter's case now being twenty four you know she's not independent um enough to live on her own wanting to go to calm and\nOf course all the families that you know what you were here we are capable woman or at home or whether it's um but you know you know we can't for her at home and I'm going through work jobs are going and volunteering doing different things\nOr lack capacity than white um but also having a branch did graduate high school she went to a public high school in Oklahoma she graduated when she was Eighteen hours provided services unfortunately says hey\nI'm the waiting list is almost twelve years long for any additional services high school so that would have been a great opportunity for trying to say you know what that's a population that area you can help them because I coach it'd be provides opportunities get them to try\nAnd now you not only created a job or you're a citizen and went on disability for another job for a job for someone\nTo help it works for Oscar I'm great environment again that you have all these other businesses where in our people with developmental disabilities and so that was one thing I took it upon myself I run a far tribal council and I started a large idle legislator over ten years\nTrying to get a program started spreading the recognition to say OK again there's a population of citizens were not even a grassy their needs and how we can help and looking at how they find out how to find their way towards it I feel like\nI'm at a specific me so there's a lot there's still a lot of education that needs to happen yes it's October down to the gym awareness my butt or tribal community just like how do you still have so much harder to go with your help and that guy\nAnd don't want to turn to any more thoughts on how we get to our native communities up to speed especially meeting the needs um with our citizens who have development disabilities\nYes um I Want to share that like with in New Mexico with the um the American families that a lot of it is a can educating the families the whole process to system and um New Mexico does\nHave a weight less for 'em and they refer to as the Medicaid waiver and then wait list is about\nNew Mexico does have a wait list for 'em they refer to as the Medicaid waiver and the waitlist is about that long twelve to Fifteen Years weightless so I'm In order for a person to access services and so I'm\nBest practices to educate families to and register right away so damn my time they get to high school don't get allocated to\nThat long term health care or you know my time they're out of the school system but again I'm In educating the families and within never nation government\nThey do have an early intervention program\nBut that wasn't around when my son was born and wasn't available so um but they have that now but I'm again I'm they reach out and\nA New Mexico Arizona oh print services\nFor families but again it's it's it's trying to encourage families to get involved in the political here's a lot of\nThe people in the chapter houses on the reservation I'm not knowledgeable about what um individuals with disabilities and what their process do you have to go through as well thank you for that in ...\nWhen I hear your thoughts on navigating the school system we heard a little bit earlier from Doris on this um what lessons did you learn that you would like to give to other parents\nI'm afraid we're very fortunate we were in um urban areas that um the school systems that we were involved with had\nUm Johnson O'Malley programs so specific and indeed education programs as well so really reaching out to them but often I found that that wasn't as knowledgeable either but in helping\nComplete I repeat what is an ... you know what does that either me to a lot of families that doesn't even mean anything um but that individualized education plan is what's going to help\nThat you're going to be successful what accommodations will need to be ... by the school um and then you get your expectations for the school and for your child and so you're a student\nAnd so often in the community I come from where we are we've also seen a lot of grandparents raising\nGrandchildren that had developmental disability but they didn't have a vehicle to go to the school they didn't understand when he was with the schools are sticking anything in there just to get by you will and providing the\nMinimum and I just felt like it was important to you and I you know even going through federal consultation with a girl and you're not because you're saying hey we need to make sure that understands that that can help families have a date is just don't understand that and so their students are getting the most out of it\nBecause even at one point we found ourselves that rules being told well she can't get services from this program because you've been there and the Indians can provide that in that that was so traumatized votes like it's just still battle that we were fighting in Beckley I put my ... face\nUp in a place to advocate on her behalf slowly trying to change the system and ideally\nThat system will continue to change it improve and be better and say you know what it is because she's a man does that mean we don't have to provide services she's going to get additional services because she is if it also makes sure that staff understands that can help the families advocates who that\nI'm Matt ... of the papal we're going to school and make sure they're not discriminated against and that she has everything she needed um but yeah I understand I we were very fortunate to be in a very um\nA school with a lot of resources available to her and they had great success but then I looked at some of our our tribal schools in our community schools that are in rural areas that barely have teachers in the classroom but along teachers and Tara professionals that can help I'm a student with all their nice if they may have because not only\nFair they're learning disabilities but then there are physical impairments and\nI'm just the whole gamut of phase of she she has to ride the bus or she helped being fed at lunchtime or needs help on to the restroom all those things have to be taken into consideration and making sure that student with developmental disabilities has all the resources that can be provided to them\nInsure any advice to a vote ... than in others who are in school I'm never duty matches to\n\n\n\nYou're listening to you while I Hope
