P. V. vaccine or eleven twelve years of age and up to Twenty one for boys and up to twenty six for girls so parents out there the H. P. V. vaccine is really important in preventing cervical cancer as well as oral cancers wow I didn't know\nThat the H. P. V. vaccine which is a cancer preventing vaccine actually help prevent um oral cancer too um with project zero I Know that a lot of the focus is on pregnant women so um what are some comment oil problem um that pregnant women face\nSo that we have a three different oral problems that pregnant women face first one is too sick K which I'm Dr Helms talked about a little bit second one is gum disease which is also\nDivided in Korea Don Titus the third one is a non cancerous or grows um including ... granted brand new Loma and that's basically when it's caused by a hormonal changed and the bacteria okay and so it sounds like\nPregnant women can kind of get the same dental problems that anyone can get 'em why is it particularly important for pregnant women um to um be concerned with\nOral health so gum disease has been associated with preterm labor and that's because there's a hormone that I'm pregnant women half that comes off the ground in which increases\nThe information and then the process of ground and um I'd also the hormones that stimulate labor [noise] the second one it's gum disease\nAnd it's also associated with low birth weight and babies the third is if my mom had tooth decay she can pass it on past the bacteria on that causes tooth decay to her newborn baby wow so those are\nReally important reason so the house of a mouse\nDuring pregnancy you wouldn't think about it but it actually um if it's not in a healthy situation could and potentially increase the chance of preterm labor of low birth weight babies that's incredible um and then the other one is that and the\nBacteria that a mother has in her mouth I'm after the babies born a doctor how you were talking about the good bacteria versus the bad bacteria and that um if the bacteria balance isn't good for the mom than not bacteria will get passed\nTo the baby and then um that infant might start off with kind of a unfair shot at having good health and preventing cavities and things like\nIf it's not in a healthy situation could and potentially increase the chance of preterm labor of low birth weight babies that's incredible um and then the other one is that and the bacteria that a mother has in her mouth I'm after the babies born a\nDoctor how you were talking about the good bacteria versus the bad bacteria and that um if the bacteria balance isn't good for the mom than not bacteria will get passed to the baby and then um that infant might start off with kind of a unfair shot at having good health and um preventing cavities and things like that\nSo um or how this extra important for\nPregnant women um so how do pregnant women keep their mouths healthy what should they be doing\nTo the first and most important thing is and brushing we want monster brush at least two times a day for two minute\nSo you can play your favorite song that's maybe two minutes long while you're brushing your teeth are reset your ABC's with your kids um and that two times a day is once right before bed and then when you wake up in the morning and\nWe want to make sure that we're brushing our teeth with flooring containing to see and that's another important that sometimes we get toothpaste and we don't realize it doesn't half right in there [noise] we also want to use 'em a cleaner like Fox or to like ... at least once a day so we're brushing two times a day and then\nWith watching once a day [noise] we want ... um ... as soon as she knows she's pregnant and sometimes there's a lot of mess out there and that is um when you're pregnant you're not allowed to go see the dentists actually are for almost um most of dental um problems so\nDental treatment is safe to alter my masters and in fact the negative consequences of not going to the dentist are greater than the treatment and\nRe [noise] we also want moms to get for it punish treatment to protect their teeth and reduce the bacteria which will reduce to reduce the chance to passing the bad bacteria onto her baby and the first step it is I'm ... so let's all is\nA greedy and and some of the gums and you want to look into your bank you want to look at the ... and that should be the first ingredient and the gum that you have [noise] we also want to reduce their sugar in ...\nWhich I'm we want to do all around not just for or a house but we don't want to drink soda we don't want to drink juice\nAnd we want to limit I read it and she still pregnant women have changes in their diet they might not be as healthy and if I'm pregnant mom has morning sickness she should rent with water after vomiting and not fresh for at least twenty minutes\nThat's because the accent of sitting around them mother's mouth and\nYou don't want the acted to I've been to the teeth if a mom should um brush your teeth right after she throws up [noise] wow I didn't know that either\nBecause I feel like when I'm at least when I was growing up it doesn't taste very good and so brushing your teeth might be something that um someone might want to do to feel better um so it's really good to know that that actually would kinda rubs the acid into the teeth\nSo yeah so this time it's ... minutes after you'll be fine\nAnd then you can do it after twenty minutes okay so um that's a lot of kind of world hygiene uh probably recommended for everyone right though even um any of our listeners out there who are pregnant right now I'm while this extra important for pregnant women that advice\nAnd upholds um in general so brushing twice a day using floss or to fix or Parker is once a day to clean in between the teeth I'm seeing the dentist regularly um and then\nLet's say I'm ... gum I thought was bad for teeth\nSo ... it's almost an ingredient in gum and um maybe Denise can explain a little bit more ... is [noise]\nSure think humor is a total is an artificial sweetener and we usually don't recommend artificial sweeteners but what we have found is ... tall is very effective in reducing the oral bacteria and\nI'm helping your teeth stay healthy so what you want to do when you look at your gum is the first ingredient should\nSay ... tall and if it says I always tell there's a variety of brands out there you can get them at your um ... health food store for some some grocery stores carry this I told them that you want to look for that very first ingredient things I Would call [noise]\nThree five zero zero for more and\nAnd Thursday at one in five PM and you can call safe she's three ah three five zero zero for more information\nExcellence and then to share some about the resources available here um and I hope you reservation Hopi health care center is really fortunate to have an excellent dental clinic staffed by um five fulltime dentists um as well as many Hi Janice\nAnd staff um they offered routine screenings and exams as well as um all sorts of different treatments including dentures let's not as opposed to vote for pregnant women necessarily um but they really have a pretty

In our well child checks for providing for a ... at least so that's not a replacement are going to the dentist but it is an important component\nFor reducing cavities um so that's the way that we're working together [noise] um so I just think that that's the end of our program are there any last thoughts are either if you want to share\nSome we can never um get too much ... miners so if your child can get a ... and the clinic and if there is a community events and they can get another four I find that we just want to make sure that their teeth are protected\nThat's really good to know too

I'm Sorry your medical center in the University of Arizona medical school to prison for ... bared down and that's your model huh yes basically\nAlright well thank you so much Hector for joining us all the way from Tucson I'm you're doing a rotation up here at hoping is that right\nHere so I'm interested in health prevention and I felt people without embrace diversity was offered to come to work with a ... a a palatial and so far is very enjoyable\nExcellent well thank you so much for being here and for sharing your knowledge with our listeners on house calls today [noise] they were going to be talking about men how do the big question why should a man who feels completely healthy come in for a regular check up with a doctor\nWell I Believe him ... prevention medicine so prevention is a way to improve themselves are living in a recession the resources are very few from groups have more risk factor for developing critical decisions such as diabetes and high blood pressure\nAnd hope there was a ... one of them\nThere are many routine testing for me which are easy to do in give us muscles information so we can prevent health problem\nHigh blood pressure the screening as one of the most important ones good and bad cholesterol screening they beat is clean and\nI think basically any credible this shit though we know how\nExcellent so uh we're gonna talk about each of those things and more details um but the main message is that unfortunately someone might not actually feel anything or no anything um to to indicate to that person that they have high blood pressure have diabetes\nSo even if someone feels completely fine healthy and normal it still\nIs important to get checked out so well kind of breakdown you mentioned a few different things high blood pressure screening cholesterol diabetes and what kind of break those things down a little bit\nSo um let's start with high blood pressure do people steal it if their blood pressure's Hi there I'm sure you know\nAnd I'm\nWanting to learn that would be learning more and more I see patients is the issue is just consider the silent killer [noise] um we tend to believe that we've healthy and uh we just go\nAbsolutely so let me just comment on that it will move on to the other things so um you mentioned that sexually transmitted diseases or another reason that\nYoung men especially um would benefit from coming into the house and her to get some routine testing and the reason for that as you mentioned is that a lot of sexually transmitted diseases have no symptoms and a man would have no way of knowing if he did have gone to ... or ...\nOr in a lot of cases the lesser HIV don't have symptoms\nEither um they are all treatable all four of those diseases are treatable and so we do do screening tests\nTo find them and treat them so that they do not progress to complication I'm so that is another really important reason why I'm men can benefit from coming in for a routine screening check ups in\nThe health center [noise] um what are some other health concerns that I think men\nWhen we do have the drugs and alcohol with that for all we know there are some\nDifferent approach the nowadays we're seeing in like even rural areas\nUm we she also hall as well and one on things with alcohol the W. can complicate diabetes can complicate the other problems that we just mentioned like how um high blood pressure and then I did is um then we avoid alcohol which can also talk of the diabetes a problem\nAlso with the drugs um you can complicate your life too so those are really important wants to address well people come and visit us to the clinic\nAnd it's important to know that um you know we're here to support our patients\n[noise] um we she also hold us well then went on things without all the W. can complicate diabetes\nCan complicate their all their problems do we just mentioned like how um high blood pressure and that I did is um family we avoid alcohol which can also talk of the diabetes a problem\nAlso with the drugs um you can complicate your life too so both are really important wants to lead prayers well people come and visit us to the clinic mhm\nAnd it's important to know that um you know we're here to support our patients and to um help provide resources if someone is interested in reducing their alcohol or drug use 'em you know we're not here to reprimand or to um judge 'em\nThat use and so it's important to be open and honest with your health provider about cigarette about um\nRecreational drugs about alcohol so that you know how I'm everything that she provider knows everything that affects your house and I'm\nSo that we can support you in any changes that you might potentially wants to make in the\nFuture just one thing that I wanted to make sure to the listeners actually the\nWe learn in medical school that we don't judge we are here to help the community and I think that's another reason why I'm also here because this is unimportant or in a unique experience to actually learn how to do this and I actually feel good\nOr helping to people and I are the same time\nYou'll see no help with the all the services are they're absolutely\nAnd then um any other health concerns that affect men that she wanted to talk about Hector\n\nSo one one of the things that um we also want to um I guess mention today is um prevent the moral vehicle accidents are we seeing the role you know sometimes when you know when you're driving especially when we are ...\nAre doing it in most many miles per hour um I I Confess I did it once for those away by now there's I learn better and that's where I'm here to\nMention anthrax is a really um you know for the listeners to really consider that when a drive in just make sure where you'll Sybil don't drink and drive\nYou ought to appear on drugs um if you don't feel good also don't drive especially if you are taking a pain medication or ... or you have some problem with um shipping and I think in those up a ... pills also also important summation and you're really tired\nDon't drink a\nIn bribe also bumped drive out all the role she very dangerous to stop all over the little break his leg on at her to undermine if you will get the\n... ... that's really good advice Hector and really important because I'm healthy young men that things that affect them most and um cause death\nFor young men and also causing injury motor vehicle accidents is really high on that list and so I really liked the advice that you're giving about always wearing\nSeatbelts I'm not driving under the influence of alcohol or sleeping pills and I think that's a great point too about how being sleep deprived is just as bad as being drunk and so if I'm you've stayed up\nAll night not a good idea to drive I'm also not to be a passenger in a vehicle with a driver that you know is altered I'm Still a driver who's drunk or who a driver who's really tired just they all get a ride\nLater from somebody else on 'em and to\nNot not be a passenger or even better try to um get that person not to drive at all [noise] um and then the um the thoughts are incredibly important um and really reduce your chance for serious injury with the motor vehicle accidents um so thank you so much for\n'em all of that advice oh and then one other very important one that um is causing accidents these days it's texting\nSo absolutely no texting while driving um and it's hard right you get a text message coming in from is really hard to ignore it um but get a passenger in the car to respond or I'm just wait until you get your destination um but many accidents are caused these days due to texting while driving um\nAnd that's a really important things that we all um should work on 'em and making sure we never do that [noise]\nOkay so we talk now about diabetes screening about blood pressure screening about sexually transmitted disease screening about um\nYou know supportive housing that we can provide in the house center about drugs and alcohol and motor vehicle accidents that are things that um take the lives of young healthy men\nAnd um cause injuries the unhealthy men so those are things that um we want everyone to be aware of um now for the last portion of our\nUm program today about men's health or we're going to talk about cancer screenings um so this is really really important because I'm cancer is a definite concerning the Hopi community as it is an all communities and this is an opportunity that we have as\nUm individuals and as care providers to find 'em and prevent cancer so what kind of cancer screenings do men need and what ages\nWhy show one on one of the um the ones that are winning the considered by colorectal cancer is printed\nInto happens about age of fifty or younger there's a family member with the story of colorectal cancer was younger than fifty years of age um the other one is brought food comes from the screening and this is debatable\nAnd controversial for the good thing is that there's low um wrecked or some initial necessarily uh currently I'm for of course it comes so all\nThe men out there listening to do a program that can come in with a war is about getting a ritual um six I'm a nation building one or\nDo we can do for the first the culture is I'm I'm a blood test\nTo screen the rest of the country in a gym and you can talk to a provider about it from and between the age of fifty five Seventy five truth too good this cruisers while they're doing the initiative to each man to decide what is best for him\nOkay and I do think this is a really really important topic because I'm I feel like somehow for women who get pap smears I member grand um there's a lot more to talk about and I'm a lot more people coming in for their cancer screening and I think um for men it's really important\nThat um there aren't as many cancers that we have good screening tests\nFor about colon cancer we definitely have a good test for\nProstate cancer we have a test that\nCan provide information and it's really a matter\nOf each man talking to his provider about whether it makes sense for him to get the prostate cancer screening tests and so we'll\nFocus more on this colon cancer screening um because that seems to be the most important and most universally recommended cancer screening tests are available for men um so how can you tell me more about colon cancer screening I'm practically what does that look like\nOkay so there are two ways to do a colon cancer screening the first is this ... you take home and framed by yourself or look for for some also blows\nOf each man talking to his provider about whether it makes sense for him to get the prostate\nCancer screening tests and so we'll focus more on this colon cancer screening um because that seems to be the most important and most universally recommended cancer screening tests are available for men um so how can you tell me more about colon cancer

normal ... who don't need another one of them for things you know K.\nSo like any cancer screening none of these things sound like they're fun um but they are important and so I'm Hector was um it sounds like there's two different ways generally for men to get colon cancer screening one is\nThat um take home soil test that can be done in the home um which has to be done every year and the other is to get a colonoscopy procedure done and\nWhich is a little bit more of a process you drink a medicine that cleans\nOut your I'm calling her intestines and then I'm a doctor uses a camera to look inside and but at that one comes back totally normal then you're good for ten years and so this is a a um cancer screening for colon cancer is a um\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [laughter] oh

also thank you for being here with us and I introduced him you being a member of the ... got a nation and some folks might be wondering what is pronounced gonna have to do with Cleveland Indians I'm going to let you have that road talk to us a little bit about I'm\nA connections to your tribe and in some person who has definitely made history oh go ahead and take us to the roots of what some people call Chief Wahoo\nSure so Chief Wahoo\nI arguably a has its roots and ... and I don't remember any well let's talk like this who was a professional baseball player and said for the pain and it was Cleveland Spiders\nI'm for over two years he actually they came to an end to the Indians but it was after he had already left the team and it it's debatable whether or not it was truly gun\nIn his honor or to commemorate his you're playing\nAnd my view is that we're very very proud that he was able to reach us such great success as a baseball player and the parents got nation does not feel honored whatsoever with how the mascot has been here over the years and his name\nThat she'd walk her face is just the terrible caricature of native people and and they always do we feel that that is truly ... the U.S look like\nIn ... you say anything known about what Louis thought about all this from ... through a family members or just tribal history did did do you have any part of that story what he felt about this mascot when he was there when he was a team member\nSure he has a lot of um living relatives and I think that they\nUm you know we we all acknowledge that he was a pioneer in this time and I think are just like I don't want to speak to sorry about how he felt that I Know that you know when he would come out into the field there at the heart of\nChanting and what we would certainly color as racist hate here and heart thing and then his um how good he was a game really led to the level of her back\nSo there's a thought of you know he entered into things as the\nThe low man there [laughter] you know and he was a good at it that somehow people came right after that can and I I think that's really sad commentary on you know that people have to like Marco somehow just to be on an equal level of respect other people\nAnd I know that she struggled I Know that um he he hurt and they hide his\nHis battles and rice and I wonder how much of that either about a fixture in um you know he died at a very young age and I wonder how much of that with internalizing just some of the um the racist than than harmful thing around him\nWell thank you for that and it's interesting to income\nAnd I I think that's really sad commentary on you know that people have to prove ourselves somehow just to be on an equal a level of respect with other people and I know that she struggled I Know that um he he hurt and they hide his\nHis battles and rice and I wonder how much of that either that or the ticks and um you know he died at a very young age and I wonder how much of that was ... they just some of the um the racist and then harmful thing around him\nWell thank you for that and it's interesting to uncover you know some of the history and there have been people who have looked deeply into this um and have a difference awesome where it all came from um what about you do you know about the history of ... who ah where how he rose\nTo be the mascot I'm as well as the impacted has its own native folks uh we look forward to hearing from you one eight hundred my nine to ... to ... ... is the number also here with us today from Portland, Oregon is Jacqueline ... uh she's a writer and author for an upcoming book called standing\nRock or the Bundy movement and the American story of occupation sovereignty and the fight for secrets lands she is Dakota in the navy to

want to join us one eight hundred nine nine six\nTo eight forty oh let's go ahead and say hello to Melinda in Warm Springs Oregon tuned in on\nKey W s so willing to thank you for giving us a ring go ahead you're on\nYour you know\nI'm I really don't know why the Indians want to be offended about all the mascot names that are out there\nI grew up along the Columbia River with my grandparents and my grandfather was proud that uh one of the high schools in the Dell has\nTo do the Indians for their mascot and every time they play baseball for my heels help the lights would come around and he was\nOne of the first ones there he didn't interest or all the stories he was proud that they had to do it All right he co everybody that he was\nHe was proud to me from the delta and the bad teams do the Indians and um [noise]\nI really don't know why they're there was a four month old amazed although maybe names that are on the team they've been there for ever and I'm proud of all the native native names that are out there\nAlready blooming don't let's turn to our guests some and you were thinking too I really appreciate your calling in a they're in Warm Springs Oregon tuned in on keeping us so we are definitely looking forward to hearing from folks would you think about this um and maybe even which I'm Wondering about\nIf you are for the mascots against the mascots and how you feel about the opinions that different from your own you can join us to one eight hundred men need six to eight for eight he's the number and Jack ... since we just said hiding them and give you a momentum is there anything you want to share with our caller when we\nSure um [noise] so I I think and\nYou know I actually quite nice word for it called mask a tree and that and I started this organization called eradicating offensive NATO mascot tree we created the hash tag not in your mouth got\nAnd um and I really focused on the tour mascot tree because issue is the things that they do with it I'm often the image can be prosaic I'm not as grotesque as Chief Wahoo\nOn but it can it still promote stereotypes about native people and um and certainly a lot of studies that come out that that definitely show that he be the case usually the work done by Dr stuff the fiber\nAnd um and and and I'm more I'm On her research has really come out\nRecently that was one of my reclaiming the truth that really shows the connection between these stereotypes any stereotypes\nWet studies show they promote primarily negative um ideas about native people and not only about native people but all in that group it becomes such cascading I'm sort of a fact and\nUm and so it's up I think that you have to think about and also you know when you I'm often enough got it the mascot references only planes culture\nDot com\n\nOh\nDot com\n\nHey hey hey hey\nNo no no no no\nNo\nNo no no no no no no\n\n\nNo no no no no no no no\nNo\n\nThank you for joining us today we're talking about native mascots where

Tomahawk wave ... watching movies were Americans almost always work negative\nThey cap you know with a white people that whole concept if if I'm going to do anything I Would love to see 'em a small display case uh at the Cleveland Stadium ... perhaps they had\nA picture Chief Wahoo and explaining why he was important to culture and that may be quite a lot of standing and letting people know why\nSome Anglo saxon [noise] we don't understand why you don't get why this is happening I think it's really important for them to be educated as well I like what the gentleman left Glasgow reset
