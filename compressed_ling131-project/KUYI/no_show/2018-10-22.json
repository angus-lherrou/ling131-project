Titus ... is inflammation of the gums that's when the gums get red and swore an angry and infected\nAnd then the next one is the paradigm Titus and that's when the infection spreads and gets into the supporting structures around the cheap like the bones and the ligament and those kinds of things and actually can progress to the point that our chief fall out\nThe third kind of oral disease that we have this oral\nCancer and there are things that we can do to prevent oral cancer\nAlthough it's not like ginger by this and I'm ... and tooth decay which are completely preventable oral cancer can be caused by things like smoking tobacco drinking alcohol we can also reduce\nUm some of the other bad habits but we have like picking at our gum tissue one other thing that is really important that we can do is if we're of adolescent age we can have the human papillomavirus\nVaccine and the ages to start for H. P. V. vaccine or eleven twelve years of age and\nUp to Twenty one for boys\nAnd up to twenty six for girls so parents out there the H. P. V. vaccine is really important in preventing cervical cancer as well as oral cancers [noise]\nWow I didn't know that that HDTV vaccine which is a cancer preventing vaccine actually helps prevent um oral cancer to 'em so with project zero I Know that a lot of the focus is on pregnant women so um what are come come in oil problem um that pregnant women face\nSo that we have a three different oral problems that pregnant women face the first one is to the case which I'm Dr Helms talked about a little bit second one the\nGum disease which is also joined divided\nIn Korea Don Titus the third one is a non cancerous or oh gross I'm including ... granted brand new Loma I'm and that's basically when it's caused by a humble not changed in the bacteria okay and so it sounds like\nPregnant women can kind of get the same dental problems that anyone can get 'em why is it particularly important for pregnant women um to um be concerned with oral health\nSo gum disease has been associated with peach farm labor and that's because there's a hormone that I'm pregnant women have called the London which increases the information and then the ... and\nI'm also the hormones that stimulate labor [noise] the second one is gum disease and it's also associated with low birth weight and babies the third is if my mom had tooth decay she can pass it on past the bacteria on that causes tooth decay to her newborn baby wow so those are\nReally important reason so the house of a mouse during pregnancy you wouldn't think about it but it actually\nUm if it's not in a healthy situation could and potentially increase the chance of preterm labor of low birth weight babies that's incredible um and then the other one is that\nAnd the bacteria that a mother has in her mouth I'm after the babies born I'm Dr how you were talking about the good bacteria versus the bad bacteria and that um if the bacteria balance isn't good for the moms and that bacteria will get passed to the baby and then um\nThat infant might start off as kind of a unfair shot at having good health and um preventing cavities and things like that so [noise] um or how this extra important for pregnant women um so how do pregnant women keep their mouths healthy what should they be doing\nTo the first and most important thing is and brushing we want moms to brush at least two times a day for two\nMinutes so you can play your favorite song that's maybe two minutes long while you're brushing your teeth are we saying your ABC's their kids um and that two times a day at once right before bed and then\nWhen you wake up in the morning [noise] and we want to make sure that we're brushing our teeth with foreign containing to see and that's another important steps sometimes\nWe get to safe and we don't realize that that isn't half right in there [noise] we also want to use 'em a cleaner like Fox or to like ... at least once a day so\nWe're brushing two times a day and then with watching once a day [noise] we want ... I'm In a month just either dentist as\nSoon as she knows she's pregnant and sometimes there's a lot of missed out there and that is um when you're pregnant you're not allowed to go see the dentist actually are for almost um most of dental um problems so dental treatment it\nSaves through altering masters and in fact the negative consequences of not going to the dentist are greater than the treatment risk\n[noise] we also want moms to get for it punished treatment to protect their teeth and reduced the bacteria which will reduce to reduce the chance to passing the bad bacteria onto her baby the\nFirst step it is I'm chewing pilots sometimes so say let's all as a ingredient in some of the gum and you want to look if you're buying gum you want to look at the ... and that should be the first ingredient in them that you have\nSome of the gum and you want to look if you're buying gum you want to look at the ... and that should be the first ingredient in them that you have\nWe also want to reduce their sugar in ... which I'm we want to do all around not just for or a house but we don't want to drink soda you don't want to drink juice and\nWe want to limit our bread and tea so pregnant women have changes in their diet they might not be as healthy and if I'm pregnant mom has morning sickness she should rent with water after vomiting and not brush for at least twenty minutes that's because the accent of sitting around them\nUm others mouth and you don't want to act that you've ever been to the teeth if among should um brush your teeth right after she throws up [noise] wow I didn't know that either\nBecause I feel like when I'm at least when I was growing up it doesn't taste very good and so brushing your teeth might be something that um someone might want to do to feel better um so it's really good to know that that actually would kinda rubs the acid into the teeth\nSo at that time it twenty minutes after you'll be fine\nAnd then you can do it after twenty minutes okay so um that's a lot of kind of oral hygiene of probably recommended for everyone right though even um any of our listeners out there\nWho are pregnant right now I'm Wallace extra important for pregnant women that advice and upholds um in general so brushing twice a day using the boss or to fix or ... once a day to clean in between the teeth I'm seeing the dentist regularly um and then what\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] have your own or stole more for the foreign service and bring your own are still more than four\nCounts more than a few miles from forty four times a year from the Muslim world for for Mars for thirty three morals or with a few miles from our cars are\nMore open our windows quarters for Israel's source\nDrilled them would go for instance when you're when you're so overwhelmingly rural areas for\nYour protection for over ... with us from morning 'til six computer motives for him for the phone [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nUm I'm Kendra Johnson one of the providers of health care center I'm and you're listening to house calls are we the program I'm so happy to be here this week with Dr Denise home and nervous that Adam\nTo speak about oral health keeping our mouth healthy so we were just speaking about pregnant women um but project and they're also focuses on children as well I Believe so um why is World Health important for young infant some of them don't even have\nTeeth or if they have to keep its just a couple of them why do we have to worry about their teeth\nSo let me read you a statistic um and this is crazy\nTooth decay and children of my time more common and children then asthma [noise] and uh I think that that in ...\nIn something man is really high in number but it's something that we can definitely prevent for our children and teens are important for our children because we want them to have good speech and if they don't have 'em and if they have teeth missing that might\nBe a little bit challenging for them to talk [noise] um and baby teeth are kind of a seeming space\nFor a permanent visas that we want to make sure we take care of them so when the baby teeth are gone then they have a safe space for the permanent teeth to answer [noise] and so that's helping with the corruption of the teeth yeah because I think\nThat's something that um is um kind of a logical thought well at least either going to fall out anyway why is it important to keep take care of them why does it matter\nIf they get a few cavities than them um but it's actually I'm trying to saving the space for the permanent teeth and determining the thing and the health of the ultimate um permanent teeth that are going to be coming in those first cheap interrupted really important to take care of them and brush them and um get them checked out by a dentist and everything like that um\n[noise] and then what our um common diseases in infants\nA certified patient centered medical home thank you once again to my guests\nDr

new president of the [noise] and um the Atlantic\nThanking us directly I won't be involved in each of these discussions this morning [noise] so I start off with the alumni challenge is hosting another fundraising event [noise] can you share with our KU what our listeners what the event is Justin [noise]\nThe event is an annual fundraising campaign that we hold and I believe that one of the uh [noise] what the strength of this challenge is is this for hope you pull in a lot of snow this is that we're\nVery competitive people that were very spirited and that we show a lot of pride in the educational institutions whether this high school\nOur team in support of this awesome challenge um we know that that ASU in a deal and you know they are sort of the the sleepers a cells of the of the competition they like to wait they don't show\nAll of their cards until the last minute so um but we are out there\nThe Arizona crushers is basically anyone else who is not an alumni with ASU innate you or your day and I want to\nActually uh submitted a challenge to chairman pneumonia must and she is an artichoke to make a donation this morning to the crushers and we'll look forward to it spirited competition and uh we look forward to your continued support and thank you for having us here this morning on radio\nSure so you want to add anything to that yeah\nI'm wow a and a very nice for the challenge there so you have these pressures and they have all kind of unusual names like artichokes\nGang [laughter] um but I just wanted to talk a little bit or butter Hopi students and we have a puppy students who are attending universities across the United\nStates Alaska Louisiana New York a majority of course are in um Arizona but the pressures of course are\nEveryone outside of our three State University and I wanted to mention because it is Halloween time there is actually\nA college um called trans solving a university and we have a hope he's attending that college and they are getting funded because it's an accredited um university and I'm just wondering I Wonder what their um mascot is in there but we got\nTo get them included in the pressure's\nThere you go so hopefully our alumni or an and students right now I'm listening to this and I'm for families out there can you want listeners we do streams so you can go to W. W. W. dot KU Y. I. dot net so sure that information I'm with those that are\nNot here at home so that they can they connect it here and here's this awesome\nUm conversation that we're having with these so it sounds like I'm this challenge can get very competitive\nSo you want to share that with us Justin [noise]\nWe weren't sure if you will for it does get very competitive and it's funny because you know people really do do that the flavors at our website because on our website you can check the progress with the challenge you can see what the donation\nThe visit our website because on our\nWebsite you can check the progress of the challenge you can see what the donations amounts are up to date for each team and so some of the\nThe chief members or friends if ... there'll be a refreshing the page every so often especially towards the end waiting to make their last minute donation to whatever it is that's going to get them over the edge or sometimes you know you folks calling the office\nAnd saying you know we're we're we are how ... how much more do we need to be on top\nAnd then sometimes they'll they'll make that difference over to get them up on top and uh it it does get very competitive and so you know you are if if you're somebody that has a a Facebook account and during the ... church where he'll cut time between you of being a few and you see a lot of the trash talk that happens during that time it had\nThat type of atmosphere is kind of similar to to with our our members and and with our um donors and so it's interesting and it's all for you know a good cause and so the winter's over all our our students and they're the ones that ultimately benefit from\nThe competitiveness of all of that are involved with this challenge\nMost definitely think he dressed in All right so who who who either pass winner who's who's one before\nAnd and so it's interesting to to prep for this interview I had to go back through the archives and the history of this challenge\n'cause I've only been with the ... for short period of time in in this uh the inaugural challenged started in two thousand four and so this year is our fifteenth year of hosting this challenge and so going back through the history of this challenge I told a looming\nThis morning that you know this this\nChallenge may be renamed to the the the in a new alumni challenge because they have one eleven times during the history of this challenge\nAnd each of Arizona State University of Arizona there's an crushers each have one once and so each team definitely has the big three underneath their belt but ah as a with every year coming I think he's a team has a chance to to get another notch underneath are both going forward [noise]\nWow that's amazing and northern Arizona university the lumberjack there are just right might down the road um so you want to add anything to that conversation anything else popping in your mind yeah\nOr something that just come across the and you know she pulled out and even mentioned this earlier being in Arizona State alone being a true true ruin and go from the will is that in twenty Seventeen which was last\nYear uh we we did win the challenge which was our very first victory and you know I think that uh that was kind of a monumental moment for for a few alumni because uh throughout all these years you know at that time he does the fourteenth any also you know fourteen years of challenges to finally pulling out to be victorious so you know that\nThat was definitely something cool to see to be able to seal the border [noise]\nYeah I'm sure your classmates will say how could you forget that [laughter] yeah I had anything\nYeah as a in a U M lumberjack alumni\nUm where where are proud of all our wind but you know because of our proximity of the ... nation to flag we do have a lot more students attending that university and a lot more alumni so truly sheer numbers but I'm both an issue and then you have a as long\nAs crushers um those are much further away but they've started to work on strategies to reach out to their groups and um yeah last year you know I asked you took us all by surprise and\nBoy we didn't we didn't um stop hearing about it until early part of this year and they rub it in and I'm sure they're getting a rabbit and again\nAll right so I'm ... can you show and I came I listen is again when did when did the challenge began and does it end or what what's the plan\nThat the challenge began\nA last week on Monday which was October fifteenth and then the challenge goes all the way until next Monday October of twenty ninth and so Lewinsky to share some information about how to get involved about how are we accept our donations and so that would be the the date to circle on your calendar\nIf you do you plan to donate in October twenty ninth to make sure that your team a becomes victorious so all you from the devils out and hope you land throughout the nation I Hope that you'll rice the challenge\nSo is there a time or is it that come down to the time it\nDoes and and that kind of depends on the way that you plan to donate sore online donations are going to close at ... pm and that's on October twenty ninth\nAnd that would be through our website but if you plan to mail a check or money order then that just has to be a dated by October twenty and I use for it to be able to count towards the uh the competitive side of the total for each team [noise]\nAll right well um how can the alumni\nContinuing to support this effort [noise] yeah the alumni\nCan do several things first of all just mentioned the our use of social media we have a great tool that we call word of the day hope the word of the day and the staff\nOr had created words and they describe it and they sent it out through Facebook while during this two week alumni and challenge each of the groups have been given a two spots two words of the day so for example you know with the University of Arizona\nWe've um we used to be fair down as one of the word and\nThat once you get that information those view of a graduate to get that out and just encourage your friends family colleagues to consider donating to don't people can go to our website\nWWW dot Hopi Education Fund dot org and you'll find that you can either donate\nOnline or you can pull up I pledge form and I run that off and get that over to us we do accept pledges so and they will be counting into the total\nIf they are received before the end of the challenge um that's really important [noise] so um the main thing that alumni can do is get into the spirit get into the competition share this information with your um all of your contacts and that that alone will help add greatly to the challenge [noise]\nGreat\nOkay so we're coming down to they end up our conversation here with the heath whose the Hopi education and down might find if you're just tuning in this case why I have an eight point one s M and this is Bonnie gene here in the studios with\nThem and my neck [noise] Justin\n... and Kansas I'm On now and we kind of coming to the end up our conversation regarding the alumni challenge so um I you know this ... you know it sounds it it is\nA lot of time that challenge is a lot of fun but I'm sure there's a lot of work involved um in you know carrying out um any of that\nWe will refer to them as she's so congratulations ... for your recent selection as president of the education and ... fund can you tell our listeners how long term is as president of peace [noise]\nA Scully thank you Bonnie I'm all he's president serve a term of one year [noise]\nOh okay is that for every year so every year the the heat as you are the huge organizations like someone or are you so much that are you in a\nWhile you are nominated and elected by the executive committee normally a this takes place the election takes place at the annual meeting on which we hold in October and the executive committee will come together and nominate individuals and then those vigils\nThan I'm elected by a majority and\nA person who is elected becomes the president for the air\nWow okay I didn't know that thank you for sharing that with the shore and um what other requirements to serve as president a few [noise]\nWell it is preferred that as you come on board as a board member with the heat wave that you do spend some time getting to know what all of the committees to do so we have four different committees as part of the Hopi education endowment fund we have\nThe nominating committee those folks work on nominating and finding individuals Hopi and non hoping members who can serve\nAs board members we've got the marketing and resource development committee the Finance Committee and the executive committee so while it's not a requirement that you serve\nOn different committees that it's recommended that you at least had an opportunity to understand\nEach role and responsibility that those different committees play 'em to the organization in large part but the the only main stipulation and requirement to be the chief president\nIs that you must be an enrolled member of the ... tribe [noise]\nOkay great thank you for that I didn't realize that the organization has um several committees as well\nAnd that's probably a whole nother subject that we can talk about later on so thank you for sharing that with us and again congratulations ah I'm sure you're I'm feeling like you know you have a heavy load that you're carrying\nWhich you know any\nMore we usually has a low that they're carrying it doesn't matter what what what how you lead the ... when you're leading the people [noise]\nWhat is your vision for the hope your education and development fund [noise]\nWell I think first and foremost um my vision um [noise] as I step into this\nThis leadership role um for the he um [noise] just fill in my heart that\nIt's important to keep our mission at the very forefront of everything that\nWe do [noise] um

ten Fifteen Twenty years down the road and um it's not to say that we knew this was coming immediately but but we knew that there would be a time where\nThe royalty checks would stop coming and so

but um it really took like maybe like three or four dates in\nAnd this is coming from my experience cause for experience can be different but my experience was around maybe a secularist or eight which was probably about two to three weeks and I just really felt this connection that I've never felt with anybody else\nAnd it was an connection in a moment I realized I could\nSpend the rest of my life with this person and we could eventually grow it's just something that you know I as we as we look at a couples that could be so powerful especially in our communities when how good families and good homes we look for those people too\nThat could be so powerful especially in our communities when how good families in good homes you we look for those people to to kind of help our community\nSure and I want to bring in our guest to join us from San Francisco California is Roger Kuhn he's a license marriage and family therapist in private\nPractice in San Francisco and Roger our pleasure to have

how do you know um your your thinking the right thing and and not caught up in some male ah any thoughts Roger\n[laughter] yes I was so much goes into to it to this idea of how do I know if somebody is the one or is there such a thing as the one oh because sometimes people will get 'em will have proposed to somebody maybe three or four times before somebody says yes or they made us their current partner multiple times\nGo for that person has said yes so that is such a subjective experience that somebody might have as to knowing when is the right time\nUm I think when I work with a couples that are thinking about getting married\nI'm In my practice I always ask\nThem about the values that they have an individually and then what type of values would you like to have\nAs a couple I'm from an indigenous perspective this might also be a thought about as a traditions or particular cultural values of that you would like to make sure are a part of your a union with someone and if you and your partner don't know those values\nIt's a great time to sit down with each other and discuss\nHow do we want to have children what are we going to do with our our money um what do we think about banking do we want to\nUm take care of our parents as they get older or do we want to invite other family members to live with us a lot of discussions I Believe should happen beforehand um so that should they ever come up in a relationship you've already thought about it together and that might happen by\nA visiting with a psychotherapist such as myself I'm speaking with different community leaders are just asking around your friends and family what did you do what works in your marriage or if I Want the best out of what might be\nOkay and\nWhere do you think about that advice you ask

pleasure to have a year after my room welcome to the our\nThank you so much for having me\nDr Myra anything you want to add to about knowing when a person is ready for marriage\nI you know I just want to echo what I've heard here um which is really the idea of\nYou know you identify someone you want to marry like this admiration and respect and\nUm you know connection on values and beliefs\nAnd you know I just said that and add to that that really you know that there's the maturity level that's also needed 'em to be ready and what that means as fat I'm you understand that conflict as normal that you're willing to\nHang out at ... and that kept on ask you both grow and change that\nUm that those are not meant at our tease me ... west defensive master criticism button that that people really can create a space of honesty and openness um so that people can both grow individually and also as a cop all [noise]\nUm and I would just mention is while you know as um you know you grow and develop some of your values and beliefs might start to shift is while I'm not only a couple but individually and just being prepared to\nUm keep working on building strength and keeping that connection in the relationship is really important\nAll good advice and maybe you want to add\nSome to one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for me is the number and um we're hearing about healthy scenes and things to consider when it comes to asking someone to marry you but we know that there are different scenarios and so I'm Wondering are there any ribs signs about um\nUh reasons why you shouldn't get married or or you know um any thoughts on on when you get married him and it's not for the marine reasons I'm Katie ... go ahead Roger\n[noise] a thank you\nSo one of the things that I also wanted to to mention that some people might experience or not necessarily be thinking about is that\nMarriage is also a legal concept [noise] um\nSo it is yes about respect and love and also marriage come away with marriage comes as legal aspects as well and to really think about um what might be some of the laws in your in your area that that you might be impacted by should you do or something like I had\nA legal marriage with somebody um so this is one thing that I Want to ask for help people be mindful of as well\nIn what would be some of the things that caution or why those can lead to things\n[laughter] well I'm a you know oftentimes we we we forget that you can have an amazing marriage with somebody and then things might change I'm so for example somebody in your family might pass and leave you a bunch of money\nMaybe you didn't have money beforehand and now there's this new windfall in the relationship of what happened so that money should your relationship then um and er you make different choices in your life\nYou can also be complicated by um issues such as raising a family together um when you get married with somebody then and have children with them there there might be also different legal ramifications to think about as well\nUm I don't think we should necessarily always cautioned against the Galileo thing because because marriage is also this really beautiful aspects as well\nUm it's just something that I when I'm working with people that aren't married that are thinking about it to think about how how we define legally from a structure uh that are important to recognize and even such as a property and on what happens in those types of instances of because they're they're they're really impacted when we find that legal contract with somebody\nAnd I got to throw that should there what about bad credit\n[laughter] yes yes thank you so it is possible you should really check the state that you live in or the depending on the financial structure of the government that you um the area in which you live a but taking on marriages sometimes\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n... listening to native America calling and we are wondering what are some things couples should think about before they decide to get married what's your advice or caution to others about getting married joined us by calling one eight hundred nine and six to eight for each one eight hundred number\nNeeded and with us today from about bringing Montana insurance the friend boys and he is from the black feet nation sharing his story about marriage proposal uh you can share in years to wanting to treat ...\nNative also here with us is Dr around my rent director of health services are actually director of behavioral health at the Native American community clinic in with us too is a license marriage and family\nTherapist Roger ... and I'm Glad to have anybody here with us thinking about this and Roger willing to turn to you too um it's great to hear that parents got the answer he was looking for but um what do you if you don't get into you're looking for does that mean backup walk away or or what next\n[noise] Ah yes congratulations deterrence um how beautiful to feed to see that unfold I watch a video and I I really enjoyed that\nAnd sometimes it doesn't happen that way you don't always get what you might be a happy ending\nThat might not mean that the person that you are I'm sure you know for ever um it might mean that you need to ask them um is there anything that you should know\nAnything that I should know about our relationship or anything that you're not comfortable talking about maybe we can go talk to someone else such as a therapist or in the leader or or spiritual leader a religious leader depending on your fate that might be able to help us um work through this um\nIt might be that there are communication issues are a couple of issues around sexuality that each work through in order for the American to forward in that way [noise] um so I Would say like you don't necessarily have to think of it it's like I Need to give up now but maybe how and my partner and I I'm\nSerious if we're serious how can we actually use this as a mother to learn how we can deepen our relationship make our relationship even stronger so that when we do say I do when we do say I'm the U.S let's get married that will be in a much better place\nAnd Roger I'm you know this from experience to you're married um anything you can tell us about what he was like for you um initiating this process or any loved ones also help you a proposal\n[noise] yeah sure you know um my my story a little interesting um\nI think it's also important to talk about you know ... or any of the true spirit\nOf listeners out there are ... folks that are listening I'm when I when I got married um we weren't on my my partner and I weren't allowed to to get married and we lived and so we traveled to another state or where we could legally married um which at that point with an ... Massachusetts a\nProposal that we had was was actually based on watching the news of the two thousand election\nEnded up being you know happy that President Obama um how one but also feeling very sad that a proposition eight o'clock for ya outlawing gay marriage\nI mean I kind of looked at my partner and he started talking about this you know what would it be like to um to actually get married because we had really thought about it for that because it wasn't an option or else\nAnd it failed at that moment like yes I wanted to click it or to\nBe seen to be counted as a married person and it felt like radically political at the\nSame time it felt scary to me because I wasn't sure how my tribal nation we're going to or what it would accept my marriage so that you know according to also recognize that although a marriage for spirit of\nTea and if people now are all in the U.S [noise] um we we still don't have the stories that we might see what the story or an other stories of people might talk up today because of the impact that I'm\nA lot of negativity about a same gender or same sex marriage in and outside of Indian country that's still a pair there today um I like to say that I Am married but I Do have a husband and I'm real proud of that and we do marriage incredibly well um because of all the ins and outs of shared with all of it\nI like to say that I Am married but I Do have a husband and I'm real proud of that and we do marriage incredibly well um because of all the things that I have shared with all due today because we talk about our values and we talk about um having honesty is the foundation of of our relationship we talk about sexuality and health and moving forward and finances and\nSo we can get to the love part and get all that other stuff out of the way and just be able to focus on the laws and we both\nHave incredibly supportive families or that supported us too and that's important and also a part of your community which helped me a feel positive about my choice to be a married person\nWell thank you for that Roger in them you made me think of family members to in their space for you in this conversation um\nWhat was your room when somebody was proposing or maybe the parents and have some thoughts to you can join us one eight hundred number six to him for aid is the number let's go ahead and say hello to our caller Gregory in Las ... New Mexico tuned in on key\nHim Gregory thanks for calling your on here\nI'm like you I just thought I'm sure it is a subject that I think will solve a lot of ah it doesn't come to everybody from ...\nBut I really think maturity should be a focus of um a lot of of of marriages for myself I got married when I was\nI'm sixty five I got married when I was sixteen and um I think it was much better than if I got married when I was thirty because for me at least I think my a lot more hormones are growing up working for a long time\nI got sixty I realized I wanted to do something besides the vote on my time to myself and I wanted to do devoted to someone else and when I first daughter I'm just at age or you know over a\nYear or so after um something up in laws are have\nYou ever went up for all of a sudden I realized that you know she was the most important person so anyway I'm just saying maturity has a lot ... Lewis I'm motivated you to explore those other areas that you guys were talking about\n... ... ... and ... any thoughts for Gregory\nYeah I just think that that's a really great comment on that he made\nI think I'm a lot of people have kind of misguided beliefs about you know what marriage is that there is a perfect person out there and um\nAnd you know it's in the media and and I'm a part of the cultural belief that I think a vast um and so I think we really need to challenge that as family members and as community members\nIn support people in their marriage is and I'm In a really help them to become better people and um work or not only to support them as a couple but individually as well\nUm and and and I don't know that um we necessarily do a great job at that um so you know the couple working at not only um building their dreams and goals together as we've been talking about but also finding community and family who support the relationship I think is very key\nAnd that's what my right he talked about Gregory talked about maturity and reaching that point where he was ready um are there any signs that you know you are not ready for marriage\nYou know he won that um I see in ... I'm a licensed marriage and family therapist as well in working with couples a\nLot of times when people aren't able to communicate honestly and are not able to let their guard down enough to um you know share some wounds that have happened in the past and really evaluate how that affect their behavior in the relationship\nI think can be a real challenge don't tell somebody able to do that kind of work on their own\nUm I think you can also do that in the context of a relationship if you are already married but\nUm you know just know that that work does need to be done so that you can be honest and open it in a relationship\nBy quantum broadcasts rations native non profit organization [noise] funding is provided by the liberation for public broadcasting support from the public radio satellite service by Britain Michael David Boies the Native American radio network\n\n\n\nYou are listening to tell you why I hotel a eighty eight point one FM and K.

remarkable advocate for women's soccer in Mexico mysteriously and brutally murdered ... thank you very much for telling about ... ... ... it's been three weeks we're still trying to unravel\nThe mystery of Saudi journalist Jamal ... disappearance and suspected murder the Saudi Arabian authorities denied\nHaving anything to do with it now they admit ... died inside the Saudi consulate and assemble as a result of a fight few are buying it all along President Trump is facing mounting pressure to punish Saudi Arabia if it did murder ... for the president has been reluctant to do that\nIn part because he says American Jobs are at stake\nSix hundred thousand jobs more than that and be very hurtful to this country if we said oh we're not going to sell us he's\nSo how many Americans would lose their jobs if President Trump stopped\nSelling weapons to the Saudis arms and security analyst William hearts on studies weapon sales at the center for international policy we looked in a crunch the numbers for us you've heard President Trump's figures he mentioned six hundred thousand jobs in that clip just a moment ago how many us defense jobs actually depend on Saudi Arabia\n[noise] well it's hard to know precisely but you know a year and a half ago the president said it was forty thousand jobs there hasn't been a major platform where they've actually signed the deal is President Trump came into office so even if they you know decided to get rid of some you know they had made\nUnder Obama we'd be talking thousands or at most tens of thousands of jobs not six hundred thousand or even a million which he said the other day as well you know\nIn the economy with a hundred and thirty million people employed it's just a blip I mean obviously if you work in a particular factory or things are built that are getting calls on the savvy to different matter but it's for our economy as a whole it's certainly not much I'm certainly not a reason to arm of murderous regime that's not\nOnly kill the journalists but is bombing thousands of people in Yemen\nThe president talks about Saudi contracts and Boeing and race you on your saying that those contracts date back to the Obama administration so just tell us how many deals are currently signed and what have the Saudis paid for\nAnd there was a big here in the Obama period where they offered sixty billion dollars worth of weapons all of a couple of packages so now does have gone through but uh Fifteen fighter planes Apache attack helicopters those happened and those were worth tens of billions dollars\nSome of that money is already swelled and then started delivering the fifteenth so the money is water under the bridge that's already been spent we're not going to see it again it would be hard for them to interrupt a deal that's been slow because allegedly they need these systems so what's actually on the table that light changes to jail for a missile defense system called bad\nWhich was introduced during the Trump period and\nThey have yet to agree on the details so in theory the south and say well you know this particular deal we're not going to go through with\nAnd is there any risk if Trump or to Rena egg that in China or Russia would pick up any of the business\nSaudi Arabia is whole military is built on us and you have supplied weapons communication and maintenance and repair parts it would take a long time to turn that around\nSo William just give us the big picture here how important is the defense industry like all the jobs from planning to production how much of the U.S economy depends on defense goods and how much is that is relying on Saudi Arabia\nClement with one of the people leading the federal government's effort to help shape for us and other coastal Alaskan communities under the Obama administration when he was hired and twenty ten the federal government has already issued to report describing the threat to these villages in no uncertain terms\nThat said you know thirty plus villages are in trouble and that are going to need some attention\nThese reports said the communities were in quote imminent danger and ... was one of the places on the top of the list\nNow at this point you might be asking yourself why ... in such a precarious a spot to begin with\nI heard something to the fact of the junk asking about why did they why did they build their community and I'm barrier argument and this is Kelly any walk for factored matters because the church and the fear of Indians are fair school\nIt's built any ... any what Cirque and polar council and Alaska Anchorage she grew up in ... and she says until a hundred years or so ago there was no permanent village on Sarah chef island her ancestors lived all along this part of the coast and they used to Ireland frequently but they didn't live here year round\nAnd that's the thing they were kind of line of manic um who didn't have permanent settlements and that sort of thing\nBut all of that changed in the early Nineteen hundreds when the U.S government and the Lutheran Church came to coastal Alaska and build churches and schools it was an extension of the colonization process that had already swept through the lower forty eight states Alaska Native people were told they had\nTo send their kids to the new schools or risk having them taken away over time the population of this part of the coast concentrated on Sarah tap Ireland so this thing called development committed these people to a spot which turns out to be directly in harm's way\nWorse case scenario of course is a a storm comes at it and forces them off that land um this year\nThat actual climate again at the Interior Department she set out to get federal agencies to help protect people and coastal Alaska from the threats of rapid climate change his breath\nAnd other towns were already engaged in planning her own solutions for the sticking point with money moving a whole town is a complicated and expensive affair one federal study pegged the cost\nOf living ... a hundred and Seventy nine million dollars and it's just rough doesn't have that kind of money they don't\nHave any kind of money actually forty percent of people live below the poverty line many homes don't have running water but Congress was not supportive of helping them make the move many members weren't and still aren't willing to accept the human caused climate change is even real\nSo finding dollars was very difficult to manage to get some grant money and some grant program spun up but the boys just embarrassingly difficult to find those dollars within the federal government\nIn twenty sixteen right before leaving office President Obama signed an executive order protecting marine resources and the bearing sea and setting up a new structure for helping Arctic communities respond to climate change climate was optimistic that would finally bringing meaningful action for ...\nAnd he thought it would stand up under the new Trump Administration\nFrankly despite all the anti climate change rhetoric up these new folks uh I wasn't worried about climate\nChange adaptation because ... you know you're you're addressing issues that are very clear in front of you people are being directly impacted by climate change it's not a model it's not a theory it's fact\nIn the course I was being very naive\nLess than four months into the new administration President Trump revoked Obama's executive order the project was that\nIt was a clear shot across the bow that hey uh doesn't matter whether you're working on reducing greenhouse gas emissions or protecting people imperil anything that has a with climate change to it has to stop\nThem a few months later Clemens got reassigned to a totally unrelated job for which he had no qualifications and he wasn't alone\nWhen I found out that dozens more senior executives like me had been reassigned or realize that it was that I was part of the\nPurge Clement found a lawyer and filed a whistle blower complaint which is still pending he also wrote an op ed in the Washington Post and started speaking publicly about what's at stake not just his and his colleagues jobs but the people of many coastal Alaskan communities\nAnd governments should be scrambling to try and find ways and dollars to get people out of harm's way and find innovative ways to do that is what government does and that's what's appalling about this\nWhat would you say to people who are like um well it's your problem why should a state of Alaska or the federal government or anyone else help you if you need two hundred million dollars to move go find two hundred million dollars and good luck\nTo you yeah well they'll just saying the same thing to Miami pretty soon right so I mean what happens up there uh in the face of climate change is an important bellwether for what's going to happen in the rest of the coastal areas of the United states right I mean we're all American citizens and we have some expectation that we're not on\nHer own right and and that's one of the things that makes this country great [noise]\n\nI reached out twice to the department of interior for comment but they did not respond [noise]\n[noise]\nSo given how tenuous the situation is\nI reached out twice to the department of interior for comment but they did not respond [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo given how tenuous the situation is [noise] why don't people just leave shift rough like if they can't relocate the whole village why don't the residents just go somewhere else no are fair banks or Seattle\nThat's the best cultural death to these communities each one of these villages is its own distinct alter their own distinct dialect to ask them suggests assimilate into another village somewhere is to ask them to let go their culture entirely with it I guess it's horrible [noise]\nEveryone I met ... seem to agree on this they want to stay together people here depend on subsistence hunting to feed their families and that food is shared with elders and others who can't go out\nAnd hunt in fact people it's just rough rely on each other for all of the essential for life they visit each other when they're sick they take care of each other's kids and they know that their future depends on keeping\nThose relationships intact\nVoter respect your vicar for or community for and then also a fertile such a way I feel this is Stan Lee talked to the vice mayor of ... that would have to work ... do you know it come from families retarded are good for the community that girl bring from your\nFamilies on the search and rescue team here and he knows better than anyone just how bad things can same gas [noise] he is frustrated by the indifference in Washington\nAre are very rude or proven go ... and climate change and all the credit arrived a look at it or or um you know\nJust really is a case study and how climate change can be understood in isolation from history politics this community is where it is in large part because outside institutions wanted to exert control over these people and their way of life the United\nStates government was very effective when it wanted to make people settled in this particular place but it's so far proven completely ineffective and helping them to get out now that it's clear they need to relocate\nFor America could over Iraq were treated our go toward ruined country\nJohn Clements says that we're likely to lose at least one coastal Alaskan village within the next ten years it could be ... and doesn't take much imagination at all to picture it wins wailing the waves rising and the frigid water rolling and crashing\nOver this island on a dark winter night it's a nightmare scenario and it's completely possible that's why Stanley talked he says they need to relocate and they need to do it together\nWe're not trying to make a new oh we're ... we're going to know these things for them ... to ... results [noise]\nOn some
