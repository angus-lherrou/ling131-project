hundred none none needed\nAnd with us today from Tulsa, Oklahoma is dean Martin and she is a chef and she is Cherokee our pleasure to have shift here with us a tailor a thank you\nFor for kind of open things up here and let's get to taste em because so many people who are wondering okay what is it tastes like are we heard a little bit of French chef men\nIs about some of the food uh he has eaten or prepared um tell us more about how some of the smoking pace and maybe even while you're favorite ways to prepare it\nWell a would be a word that a lot of people like to use whatever they're describing the flavor of world rabbit a is Jamie\n... or ... you know they don't really know what that now or later is um I Would think that that kind of grass fed beef as car got mail and and be a little bit of that at some of our wildlife that we would use for game a hunting [noise]\nOh it is definitely a flavor profile that is a unique to its own uh talked about rabbit Leslie I'm I work with rabbit in\nMy corner a year and a Tony training but we're a little different um but privately they surely similar in fighter ah they have a little bit more ah interesting flavor profile work with\nSurprisingly there fairly similar in favor a they have a little bit more\nAh interesting flavor profile to work with um [noise] so I Would definitely recommend trying it with a after you cook it I'm trying it with little no additional seasonings and then go from there\nJust kind of learning you know how how you like to put it on your plate and I'm Taylor what about the nutrients do we get something special from either squirrels rabbits that we don't from other meats you know\nWell Quil in rabbit tend to be very lean meat\nThey're very healthy it does take quite a bit for your body digests so definitely um they're on lowering calories a so they wouldn't be something that could add interest here way find 'em and\nAnything of course uh that the animals we eat we get that from them so because of their non corn diet and they eat mostly that's and and vegetation um that could influence their\nFlavor and ... nutritional impacts so in my opinion I'm not a food scientist but I definitely would say that you do get um a little bit more than just a regular old crushed life me like or chicken\nOr anything so that maybe we have somebody who's studied some of this you want to add to the conversation give us a ring Wayne hundred Ninety six to eight for each can even share your favorite way to eat small game animals one eight hundred nine six two weeks for eight is\nThe number and I'm sure it takes a certain kind of skill you mentioned a little bit about this earlier Taylor I but what kind of lessons about food come from small game hunting and of course cooking it up\n[noise] um well uh with small game hunting it does take a little bit of it I have to get out and go hide things so you are physically active and you are going to go to church for your food in planning accordingly based on what you bring back um [noise] so\nUh\nThe uh\nUh sorry would you mind I totally lost I thought I was on I was on the phone thing there would you mind repeating the question\nSure we're talking a little bit about lessons you learned from hunting and and preparing these kind of animals\n... correct [noise]\nAh you definitely have to have a level of respect for life worth\nA lot of our um ... and ... a full tales including the smaller animals they all had less straight ties now how big characteristic type but then the uh in hunting these animals that are from our members\nOf a Cherokee um folklore [noise] ah they are to be honored because they're getting their life for you um we would avoid certain animals because of their grandma O'Neill\nUm significant but uh the lesson that was always learn from England you put your effort in and it will give back to you\nAnd I wonder how that compares to some of the folks out there with you or time\nShare your thoughts if you want to share a cultural aspect to all of this of taking small game give us a ring one eight hundred my nine six to ... we're going to introduce folks to an avid hunter coming to us a member of the White Mountain native corporation uh his name is just coaching and he joins us today from\nWhite Mountain Alaska just thank you for being with us\nYou're a good morning\nAnd just tells them about the side of hunting and just as a team or about lesson you learned and um I can only imagine what you're about to tell us go ahead any thoughts about what we learn a when we started hunting small game\nWell there's um a you know I'm In in some parts of rural Alaska you know it's\nUm you know it's almost daily I'm a you know to to grow up there on a daily basis and um I think I think probably one of the lessons learned but everyone is a you know one further Glenwood somebody's planning with somebody I'm and I'm\nHaving a plan on my which location where people would be the first uh um\nArea to look for the smoking um and ah\nI I think the murder is wondering especially when we're kids you know we you know we would find it to learn from you know when we talk amongst each other when we're no first second grade on though would\nBe one of the ... um remember um you know ... years ago or a young age I guess this is uh what are the most\nI'm big into just how does it work when you're going out to I mean do you go out there and say okay I'm going for doesn't ruin for five you know talk to me about one of the hunting trips\nWell we just um you know the we pointed out um you know what would be looking for a widow ... Bruce ... robots um my mom and in many parts of a\nRural Alaska uh we we we mostly on what we're going on on what season I'm is so right now it's fall and we're going to be looking for what we've been looking for ...\nWhich are undergoing now and then just when it snows it's for the last a book about them you know I'm really most switch over to another small\nI'm ... years um three hundred right

when I was [noise] gee that was probably like\nSeven or eight and a I had a wooden bow and arrow that eastern Asia and I had shown that first Jack rabbits with I'm Sorry I Can't tell with a bow and arrow and I was so proud and I ran a home and my father had me put it in a special place\nAnd he came and he\nEmbraced the animal and uh [noise]\nUh forgive me as I get emotional\nUm she feels so proud of me and she started teaching me about respecting the smallest animal because\nOf hearts just like any other animal may have soles they have children and there are a part of our culture but real ground puzzles and I'm\nFrom that moment on my father and I had a bond that no one could have a break and\nHe taught me about the traditional spiritual isn't hunting the game and even the little town hall is to be respected with the most most respect and I I ... some of my cousin ... family members the same when you bring all\nYou know you put it in a special place of the family can embrace\nIt whether it be a tail a jak rabbit a quail um\nGees it doesn't matter it all has heart they all have lungs stay all breeze they all bleed red and\nWhen you're done you're you send it home you send it back to the spirit world you send it back and this conversation is very emotional for me because this time that my father and I went to\n... and you know what I as I feel you and you know many of us can remember greed hunters in our families who taught\nHow to do this in a very respectful way um and even explain why you are give respect these animals and they really appreciate you just even that reminder even though it's small game um it does have an important role\nIn in a place of respect caller I Do appreciate you giving us a ring and I guess with that too I'm\nReal solution good thoughts to those folks who are getting ready to use this part of the season for hunting and remembering stories like this or why are you do what you do when you go hunting lazy we're taught thank you

just heard from a caller on the Mexico um you know very emotional about those connections in lessons he learned about this and I'm Wondering does not extend to the way you were taught to about\nA ... game or even just incorporating it into you know our daily diets go ahead\n[noise] yes and that's actually applied here where we live um [noise]\nYou're looking in a traditional approaches hunting is not just taking the game but also having respect for the animal isn't being and being part of the natural world which is Nicole from Missouri\nAnd while you're in the game is not just just for sport you're taking to feed your family taking\nAir also I'm taking a moment as the man from New Mexico have mentioned you know paying that respect to the animal and because he's feeding your family\nAnd you still part of this natural oil that has his family also but he did was just by creator knowledge to help provide for us [noise]\nAnd so when we think about just even another extension of all this we heard from\nA chef and in taking us back two times before a you know we're people more settled today and we heard from a hunter and then there is a special role of where some of this game goes next in both twins to you and and uh\nUm take it from there and talk about preparing a small team or anything you want to tell us when the about um you know going in in incorporating it into diet uh go

doctor Janine peas is with us she is a faculty member and humanities and social scientists little big corn college although principle of the chicken ... immersion school\nAnd didn't even before the break you were telling us about this rapid word collection each ten days that I'm came together and collected almost Fifteen thousand words and you were mentioning I'm One of The Elders ah\nWas saying that he was using words that\nEr and collected almost Fifteen thousand words and you were mentioning I'm One of The Elders ah was saying that he was using words that he hadn't used a in a very long time please continue\n[noise] well we were I'm able to have you know topics that involved memories from long ago when conversations that they had had with their parents their grandparents a local story tellers or even folks in the community gatherings and\nSome of The Elders were saying well I went home and I was visiting with my wife for talking with my brother and we remembered all these others\nOther words that would pertain to those topics\nSo it was like opening chapters that probably had been you know maybe close for a while\nI'm with the discoveries went on a we found that there were a number of young people really really is it surprising number of young people who had been raised by their grandparents and of course we know who these people are but how much crow do they know\nWell it turns out we call these are folks are college forbid uh children raised my grand grand mother grandparents that we have some young or you might say\nFountains of knowledge who have an amazing a grasp of the whole language and we're um so The Elders were able to recognize and I and some of The Elders were saying to me these young people know so much\nWell you know when they were raised by their grandparents the knowledge skips a generation of ... most them closer to that\nThat time when probably our community was using a solely the crow language for\nAll communications um and you know we've never had a chance to say well let's assess how much we know is individuals the crow crow people don't go in and take a test and no and get to know what they're what the depth and breadth of their vocabulary as\nAnd so individuals came in like after the session they come in and said to me you know something there's\nA new words I've never heard before but there's some of these topics I just know so much and I didn't realize how much I Know that I can share\nAnd the value of it the treasurer of it that was the astounding I think measure across the board is the people that were in the sessions just came to realize I Know so much I Know this and how does this sort of the dimension the depth and breadth of what they they could contribute\nAnd you know a lot of our elders have retired from\nThere or whatever their careers were and uh the potential of their contribution in this initiative goes well beyond our first Eighteen hundred topics we expect in the next year to have one or at least one more rapid word collection initiative\nThat will take another Eighteen hundred topics in our living language and we're ... we're just really excited to see how that that goes\n[noise] well I Want to talk to you more about that this is such a fascinating topic to put a dictionary together\nOf 'em are indigenous languages and to have that opportunity to have elder sit together and uh\nExperience that that's so cool and what do you think about it give us a call the number is one eight hundred nine nine six she we for eight that's what's a one eight hundred nine nine you know one of ... voices into the conversation on the line now we have a ... she is the Choctaw language curriculum coordinator for the Mississippi\nBand of Choctaw Indians where she is also a

... rolled member of the tribe as well\nEither ... or they don't\nAll right thanks so much for all of you joining us today I'm On the other would start with you um ... tell us about the dictionary that that's a you have for the Mississippi ban has talked to\nA low right now what we have is the teaching dictionary that we um put out in two thousand fourteen it's considered a child version and it has sixteen hundred words\nThe reason that we wanted to publish a dictionary was because we were going to be teaching that chocolate language in the schools for thirty minutes every single day and for people who haven't had a lot of conversations in Choctaw with little kid\nAnd I was like a daunting task so we gave them a dictionary that hopefully help them you know I'm a lady simplify the language a little bit for the little kids because\nOur kids are growing up not speaking chopped off and um it's not natural for a um speaker to uh you know be patient and um\nCome up with the word is it'd be you know to simplify for a little bitty kid or non speakers [laughter] that's great and and do what did you hear from the teachers about using this this tool\nWell I think it was helpful because I'm\nThe dictionary that they have access to is the buying tend to one and\nUm it's really um it's really thick dictionary and it's got a lot of obviously words and\nI'm the injuries are really long\nI feel like the simplicity of the teacher dictionary has been really helpful to them and we also gave them access to it um the PDF document so they have it on their phones and they can search for things like you know if they want us a butterfly um especially with the\nSpelling size they know how to say hush hush the Bolshevik but they don't know how to spell it they can look it up on their phones are in the I'm teaching dictionary book\n[noise] decent I understand you guys went recently to a conference and learn a little bit more about putting together dictionaries tell us about that\n[noise] [noise] Oh yes ma'am we had been collaborating with some\nLinguists over the years there and help this document the Mississippi charcoal language and I'm just turned out there I'm

I. T. I. is a brand new stations from you will be in South Dakota it's owned by the shining rivers who tribe and they're airing a native America calling\nFor the first time today hello and welcome to K. I. P. I thank you so much for carrying our show we really appreciate it we're talking native language dictionaries today if you want to get in on the conversation there still time the number is one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for aid that's ... hundred nine nine\nNative I'll be on a TBI is with us She's the Chuck Todd language curriculum coordinator for the Mississippi band of Choctaw Indians and I'm a ... we were talking with Janine before the break about um ... different ways to approach a\nTeaching the language was apps and a new variety of things um how how would be nice decided or\nYou're going to approach you know building a new dictionary when you do something like a rapid word collection\nWell right now I Believe we're just using that data bases that we have um you know somewhere it's from the ... area and\nI'm Erin brought a lot of work from the eighties that if I'm constantly having language development meetings which we just got out of a you know every time we hear a new word I Try to censor Jason and\nHe puts it into the data and that's basically I think how it's progressing we have a ton of example of phrases and a sample Senate says\nThat were written down I'm In the last Fifteen Twenty years that we're going through and I'm looking at a lot of them and I'm like oh it's just ... dictionary and especially when I'm trying to you know correct or not crack by like\n... um I find out that slow these might not be in the database so that's basically how it's growing\nAll right and do you mean um when you did the the rapid word collection was there any time when there was maybe some disputes about a certain word or I mean I you know maybe not like fighting among each other but you know differences of opinion\nVariations of words and how they're pronounced our language is very descriptive and we were involving people from six districts we have three bands of the ... of the uh follow kept people and so we found\nThat um people and we generally are people know that there are differences in the fans and also even some familial or even localized differences are we found that there are families and a localized groups\nThat have named every technology that's come along\nAnd there are others that didn't do that and so um you know if we were originally thinking well maybe we'd have to be inventing where it's we haven't had to but the discovery is it among our people there's variation and we welcome that a discussion\nAnd it got rather lively some of them were saying well this is the way my great grandfather's set it I was a little kid at his feet at this\nAnd it got rather lively some of them were\nSaying well this is the way my great grandfather's set it I was a little kid at his feet at the sweat lodge and I heard him say it this way and someone from prior which is eighty five miles away said well this is the way it was said by and so on like that and they talked about it so but what the what the process allows and a and welcomes actually\nIs to have that variation those don't have to counsel one another out they are included\nAnd that you know the difference maybe a slight variation in the word itself but we want all of that in there because we want to have a a dictionary that represents the living language and it's so important to do that when you start restricting\nWhy it said there's this is a way this word as sad as opposed to this well you know you take the the very vitality out of the language and there's reasons for those differences and they talk about that in the sessions\nYou heard the verbal the discussions that went on and and uh they got really quite lively and sometimes very hilarious and sometimes actually emotional and the sense\nThat there are things they hadn't remembered and the reference to the people from there you know back generations um stories that had been told of even warrior experiences\nAnd battles and all of that came through and so we're\nUm it's it's the whole gamut I guess you might say of reactions but just because one person says it this way and another says it this way doesn't mean that they eclipse one another no\nAnd um but they need to agree also on how it's spelled but listen to it and how is it spelled and they each each of the groups had to appoint among there among the five of them someone that was actually writing down the words and with the proper accents and all of that so these folks\nAre all literate in the language is well we really have a wealth of speakers you know we've got twenty five hundred very fluent crow speakers at least that count actually maybe somewhat slow alone because that comes from the census and you know do people identify themselves that are like when the census taker comes around but\nWe have a wealth of information\nAnd knowledge and we're at a perfect I'm really moment of\nLike you might say it's a pivotal moment for us to be able to collect our language in this way and the dictionary then becomes a major learning tool in wherever these learners are and we're hoping they're everywhere but we of course are very interested in our youngest learners\nHow do you feel about um non native or non crows using the dictionary using the work that you raised in a to learn the language themselves\nYou know from the beginning we're just very interested in having every learner anywhere who wants to learn the language we're a small group of speakers were small tribe there's Thirteen thousand members of our tribe and probably another five thousand descendants this is the location of the of solitaire\nPeople this is it a our audience isn't something that's going to go worldwide\nUm but there are people here in there who are interested in the crow language and all of our apps are free um our books are online can be purchased by anyone and when we have our summer Institute for language learning we have an intense\nA crow language learning for beginners anyone can earn rural were very anxious to have anyone who's interested in and\nNo not the market isn't huge [laughter] but we're not interested in being restrictive at all\n... ... interesting I mean I Know what about you how do you feel about I'm a writer who in the Mississippi Choctaw\n[noise] um well I don't think there's as much interest as some people might think like you know there's not going to be a ... million people coming in and taking the dictionary and you know learning the chocolate language but\nI'm ... ... calling we saw life so much interest from the linguistic community and um I think it's good that they have an interest in shock though because like me personally I don't understand like every grammar rules\nAnd then someone else can explain that to me who looked at the dictionary like I'm all for 'em you know whatever helps\nOur language at this point because we don't want to\nYou know my generation the twenty to thirty year olds to die in Seventy years and take the language with us and all we leave is you know the written word and\nUm I'd rather be able to have it explained to me and then I can explain to someone else can we create speakers yeah and that's going to take a lot of effort is that takes you know people who are members of the Mississippi talk to 'em that's great and whatever like I said whatever helps\nNot you know getting high cook I mean I Do go much much Iraqi make would

upcoming flu season your flu vaccine protects against those viruses it does not protect against other viruses such as cold as stomach viruses or I guess other very different influenza viruses that are not in the vaccine\nCreate so we'll just make sure we get our flu vaccine every year to stay up to date [noise] and [noise] we may have touched on this but can you talk about any side effect of the flu vaccine\nUm we do hear quite often you know people wondering if they're going to get sex and getting them back into\nThat as an excellent question the flu vaccine cannot costs glue illness are it can cause mouth bad effects that may be must be mistaken for the flu comment body flex from the flu that includes stored and us redness swelling from the shot\nYou could also have had a fever\nMuscle aches than idea\nThese side effects are not the flu if experience that all these effects are usually mild and last only one to two days the viruses and the flu shot or not alive they're killed viruses any side effects you experience I not contagious to others\nI think that's really important knowledge and so you cannot get the flu from getting the flu vaccine I'm anti you may have some of the symptom mentioned but that they will go away and wants to today's today\nSo joyous you weren't going to talk to us a little bit about the people that are at highest risk for developing a slap on the mind telling us about that\nIs the people that um we try to encourage or they every other health care a physician and a practitioner try to get the um people that have a diabetes\nHeart disease type a pressure people that go to um dialysis which are [noise] people also there are ... have aids and a\nHalf immune system um problems with their immune system they're the ones that we try and target and that we need to get in as soon as possible so that they won't be exposed to the virus on later on down the line [noise]\n... are just making sure that if you are kind of in one of those categories that you do go ahead and get the flu vaccine as long as it's safe for you [noise]\nUm [noise] so ... how would someone do if they had the flu it talked about the vaccine but now let's talk about how would you know if you have a clip\n'em it's mild symptoms are\nPretty mild sometimes um you can have fever and cough sore throat runny stuffy nose body aches headache chills and just feeling tired Fifteen and sometimes not all the time uh\nDiarrhea and vomiting all those are the main um symptoms that will kind of show up to [noise]\nOkay that yeah that definitely sounds like a slow so having a fever cough a sore throat runny nose body might besides that you might have to live or not but it it's a possibility um do does everyone needs to go to the emergency room that has a symptom\nUm you know ... up these symptoms I mentioned earlier those are mild symptoms and yeah it hurts when you have money eggs but you don't need to go to eat or um because it's a viral infection and when you have a viral infection and there's no antibiotics\nThat well I'm sure it you just need to stay at home\nUm bed rest is recommended a lot of fluids and taking Tylenol or for your fevers can help and\nIt has its encourage that um if you are feeling sick and we're coming up into the seasons where um we're doing our traditional dances our culture um where people are going to the cave us now so um\nIf you're sick you need to stay away from going to the chemo for it to close and passing this virus to other people that are there that's very important you need to if you know you're sick you need to stay home\nI think that's a really important message for all of us that at first feeling sick sometimes at MIT past us to stay home and rest which is what our body so [noise] um [noise] but I Would imagine enjoys that there are certain circumstances in which going to the emergency room would make that would you say that so\nYeah there's always times when you know that um it's more than just a mild flu especially for children to be a tend to get more sick more faster um\nHave you noticed that your child is breathing faster having trouble breathing that kind of have a bluish tens around maybe they're um miles [noise] ah their fingernails and they're not drinking their real tired they're not waking up [noise] um\nWhen you try to interact with them and they're very irritable they're not wanting to eat 'em\nAnd you just start coughing fever you need to um make sure you get them into the hospital Archie are to have them check as soon as possible and also the adults to [noise]\nIf um [noise] adults are having difficulty breathing like having shortness of breath painter pressure to that just are abdomen confusion more\nSevere vomit um [noise] I don't I'm not a mild form of [noise] the flu and the\nGreat so thank you for that clarification so just feeling a little bit by the amount of um ah you know just runny nose and stuff [noise]\nBut Haitians so just feeling a little bit about maybe a mile off some um ah you know just runny nose and stuff [noise] possibly don't need to be seen in the ER but if you are worried by all means like\nYou bring 'em yourself or your child and so that wraps up our talk on the blue um we do have a special guest here today with not a ... a hundred\nJohnson she's one of our family positive about November he'll be awkward for her and I will be passing the Mike over her\nHigh every one I just was listening to this excellent conversation thank you so much for us to protect 'em for putting this show together um and thank you so much that we enjoy for coming out here and for all of the work that you've been doing vaccinating so many people in the community I think that ... I just wanted to\nUm emphasize a couple of things that I was hearing which I think this is really great information as we're providing and especially the difference\nBetween kind of mild flu symptoms where it's okay to stay home and symptoms where you might need to come into the emergency department if you're having real difficulty breathing not being able to keep yourself hydrated those kinds of the one\nI just wanted to share because we were having a conversation without the help under about how we have a lot more availability in our clinic right now so if you're kind of unsure which category you fall into was just something that I can just stay at home and get better or is this\nSomething that is something different or needs to be checked out you can also call for an appointment at that will be how Chris I'm sure just called them a number talked to the appointment unit and we can often get you in with the same day appointment with your provider if you have one or with another provider so that's another way to get\nChecked out um although definitely emergency room with always available\nAs well that's a great point Dr Johnson thank you um and that phone number for anyone listening is Ninety eight seven three seven six hours and and you can offer an appointment if you don't have a provider you can get one set up we're lucky to have a bunch of new providers your\nUm and we have a lot of available detail by all means we would love to the un clinic and these you know ...\nAnd then the other thing that I just want to share is that I've had a lot of peace and I'm\nTold me that they don't want to get the flu vaccine because they feel like one year they got the flu vaccine and then that next week they got the worst that they've ever had in their lives do you guys all talked a little bit about how\nThe flu vaccine can't actually caused blew 'em so I just wanted to kind of share my theory about why that happened I think Mickey you mentioned that it takes two week right for the flu vaccine to actually work so you're not protected from the flu for the first two weeks after you got it\nAnd so if when people do get a really bad blew a few days or weeks after they get the flu vaccine we think that's just\nBecause they weren't protected yet and it was just kind of random chance that it happened after the flu vaccine I Would encourage everyone to get the vaccine um to keep yourself protected um but I also can't promise it's a hundred percent America um it doesn't protect against every single fu straighten right [noise]\nRight well thank you so much for coming out and we look forward to having another house called talk I'm In the near future at your flu vaccine thank you\n[laughter] or or or\n\n... ... and the
