wanted to comment about poetry and how it's affected my life and just that without poetry I\nWouldn't have been able to express a lot of the things in life that needed to get out rather than bottling lust and I just think it's amazing other poets are able to do that and put their lucked out there for the world to listen she has a lot of fear inside just\nSet as lot harder to get out and just

write is to try to go some place that I Would never dare to go\nAnd um there's a wonderful quotation of rain or Maria ... from letters to a young poet where he says go into yourself search for the reason that you write find out whether it is spreading out its roots in the deepest places up your heart [noise]\nUm so so I appreciate that comment and all the comments everyone calling in today thank you so much\nI'm One of the things that I've really enjoyed um especially with this book the nightlife is that I tried to tap into the unconscious and try to go someplace that my conscious mind wouldn't normally\nA feisty unconscious wouldn't normally I'm venture I'm so there you know there are a handful of bunch of Homs in this book that were inspired by dreams\nUm or dream narratives and it was really interesting to me because I I realize that what I wanted to do in the night life is to explore the tension between the life lived in a life and match and\nSo again you know how can you look at the world through a different lens\nI'm as with the other problems I talked about you know I Would keep a dream journal I often would dream between um you know I Am a terrible insomniac so it's kind of funny that I have had so many vivid dreams\nUm but at the time that it was most truthful from me in my creative life or my dream life was you know after like two and four AM there's something called the joke all day\nWhich is when you would wake up at different times I'm of the night and the time that I found most productive cities dream narratives was between the ... and they break and I just had his credible dreams that unfolded\nAnd they arrived almost like a little mini novels um there was one dream and the book that I you know tried to almost ... screenplay out of but that hasn't happened as of yet um but in the dream\nI'm I Am myself but I Am and it's completely different role in my life so there is a dream where I Am I'm a single mother living in Sweden I've never been to Sweden before\nUm there's another dream where I'm you know young teenager\nUm so it's it was very fruitful to have these dream narrative is and when I was trying to figure out the name of the ... of the book I was talking to the problems with a friend of mine and I said I have a very vivid nightlife I my\nMyself but I Am and it's completely different role in my life so there is a dream where I Am I'm a single mother living in Sweden I've never been to Sweden before um there's another dream where I Am you know young teenager\nUm so it's it was very fruitful to have these dream narratives and when I was trying to figure out the name of the ... of the book I was talking to the problems with a friend of mine and I said I have a very vivid nightlife\nAnd my friend said what I and I said do you have any ideas of what I should call my book and my friend said why don't you call it the nightlife\nSo I Try to explore the dream world um the nocturnal world knocks turns I think you know death also as you guys heard with some of the problems I've read also enters into this collection [noise]\nUm so various ways to look at the nightlife\nVery nice I Want to hear one of those

[noise] you know and love is\nLove food [noise] prisoners are two women\nPlus a young child and a baby [noise] twenty two\nShots were fired in all the women and the children were killed but it was unclear who was shooting or where this happened at first glance\nOf guests might be that it's somewhere in Africa but that's about it then a team from the BBC's Africa I investigative unit went to work and thanks to science and technology they managed to zero in\nOn not just where these killings happened but also the identity of the likely shooters those alleged shooter's are now in custody tell me a lot of people as the b._b._c. Africa's security correspondent joined us from Nairobi are really outstanding piece of investigative journalism Tommy what made you and the team think you could actually practice case\n[noise] well I think first of all it was just the shock that gripped everyone who saw this video right from the beginning\nAnd it began you know just\nConversations across Twitter though a different research is reaching out and saying does anybody know whether this is so anybody have any idea what the what the terrain um links to and that's how the conversation started and lots of people talking and then the b._b._c. picked up on that and became a for a long investigation\nI mean I guess the first challenge was to figure out what country this happened in them and getting more specific details about where in that country how did you figure out the location and what role did open source technology plate in that\n[noise] well [noise] I mean it's part of this whole collaboration festival looking at that that could be anywhere in the ... which is why it across western Central Africa a botched with\nMany heads put together I one of them was Amnesty International the rights group which had been researching northern Cameroon and about the military that and you know also when people when you listen to the video and you know\nLooking at the uniforms listening to some of the dialogue in it I'm an amnesty with their research as well they suggest that this was camera and this was northern capital of course that's also a vast region but over time\nTrying to match the topography as you could see in the video that sets and distinct outlines of the mountains in the video and using those reach lines matching them to Google and digital globe and other imagery providers using geo location that's how\nYou know this whole all moved on and and the location was matched\nI've found that part a little bit difficult to kind of understanding how you were able to know that that ritual on match the contours of what you found on GPS I mean that's the only original and that has that shaped and all of Cameron\nIt's painstaking work it's it's not something that was very easy bought the\n... so many clues put together not just the rich line I could be any Richland but when you have one clue when you have another clear you sort of bring them together and that narrows the results you get so for example looking at different times for example when setting buildings existed\nWas when they did not so going back in time and looking at different elements of that an addict everything together so it's it's something that took quite a bit of time and more than a dozen people working on it\nYeah and you also worked with belly Kathy open source research group which is seriously experienced in this kind of stuff I'm ... how did you figure out who was responsible [noise]\nWell first of all the government tried to deny initially that these ... soldiers they said\nYou know that the uniform on was not watch um the soldiers are the way up north um they said the guns and not the ones issued to ... soldiers but we did identify some of the guns one of them as a staff I Am Twenty one which is used by some divisions of the union army will suffer from some of the the uniforms\nOr indeed coming in ministry uniforms and and so we were able to to festival identify and ethical found that those were kind of ruined young soldiers but then in the dialogue as well some of the soldiers were saying each other's names one of them was was referred to a church or a another one is called sign guy but\nAround the same time before the b._b._c. investigation came out the camera and government actually arrested seven men seven soldiers so they change their tone and said well they had arrested said and people in in relation to this video and\n... from the BBC's own investigation were able to match these names that were mentioned in the video to some of the ones that were arrested and some of those names when nicknames but on the on the official list they had the official name zone so we could match that we can use Facebook as well to match some of those details of\nYour parents do show you found church on Facebook right yes indeed um that's that's the nickname of a soldier cold Syria ... and a fall from just his Facebook you know we found a way to speak to form a camera on your soldier who also confirmed that they wasn't each also somebody who who knew them\nHave you been able to find out and the team been able to find out any possible motive for this violent crime to women to children including a baby\nAt the beginning of the of the video we see them are referring to these are women as Boko Haram was saying that they are members or at least affiliated with Boko Haram\nAnd there's a point where I'm One of the soldiers sort of a tells us child that um you know sorry we have to do this kind of thing and and and um basically saying it's it's the parents' fault that you are getting killed as well um so\nYou know the soldiers are not floating these women and children any any access to to fat trial to a fair trial or they just you know execute\nThat's going to be coming out in the next few weeks\nYou know what to say the details of the world's Margolis telling about the new NAFTA known as the United states Mexico Canada agreement thanks very much ...\n[noise]\nThe Trump administration's treatment of undocumented migrant children is in the news again over the weekend the New York times published a report about a tent city in West Texas where many of these children are now being held the sense that in the town of tornado Texas has been massively\nExpanded and hundreds of immigrant minors have reportedly been ferried there from shelters elsewhere in the country in the middle of the night one important no these are not the same kids who were separated from their parents at the border early in the summer some of them\nAre still being held in process by the government this is a different population these miners in West Texas camp are mainly teenagers who were detained\nAfter trying to enter the country by themselves Leah ... is an attorney with the women's refugee commission\nThe tent camp is you know pretty remote it's very far from\nEl Paso which I think is the closest that if there's not a lot of vegetation is you know I think the picture's really speak for themselves filters rose in both of those tents that are that children living quarters or they have a couple of other facilities on site dining facilities and the like but but\nIt you know does remote and it and\nIt feels like you're kind of in the middle of the other\nI Know that you are at the women's refugee commission have concerns that this large scale camp makes kids more vulnerable can you elaborate on that how how does it does I\nMean let's say that a child was moved by the way they were maybe thirty bad I'm happy for each other and so it's much more of a home the environment they have access to education or do receive some kind of classroom instruction and decent\nYou know basic subjects Clinton English the also have regular attention they'll have regular access to medical care to um you know mental health support college a lot of these children are suffering I may have experienced trauma either you know in home country is the reason for leaving and or\nPossibly route and so and so it's very important that these children have\nYou know the attention that they need and the access to the chill and so I think in a big facility when we turn to these big facilities like tiny an emergency facility we see that\nUm you know there isn't the same provision for education [noise] um ... ... you know we were told the kids get work box but\nThat's not a education you know a far cry from classroom education and um in terms of any kinds of mount mental health care you know emotional support anything along those lines it's really hot it's really the onus has been on the child to ask for it but you know they've just been transition they're\nCommitted ... and they don't know anyone there disoriented possibly upset about it and so I think it's really difficult in those situations with dean with thousands of kids you know hundreds of other kids I'm an IT table I think\nYeah and then the mind kind of boggles when you think about the Thirteen to Seventeen year olds and what they're thinking legally I mean they have any legal help that they can access\n[noise] um well that's a great question so um you know it doesn't happen in every facility but you know by and large children at the prominent shelters are provided with an you know your rights\nEven teach and um they received screening and so in some cases I mean the children are able to get some little support through those avenue [noise] um\nYeah because the children are transferred from other facilities between you know you know my understanding is that they're not receiving any more no you're right that when you know I'm at the time in Kansas City and you know the access to legal services there has been very difficult so again it is concerning\nMeantime the administration and its supporters say the immigration system is broken and Congress needs to fix is um how do you respond to that [noise]\nSo I mean you think we had a system we have a a\nProtection system in place a lot of these guys are seeking protection in country we have that in place you know could improve short I think what's really missing is investment incest and there's a huge backlog of cases\nWe need more immigration judges more support faster those judges I mean I think we need to really invest in the process instead of saying oh the passage doesn't work because it's so slow or oh the pass it doesn't work for other reasons I think it's it's chronic lack of investing in um [noise] we we need to prioritize\nGetting kids out as getting children out a detention and it's just not appropriate for them\nIt's just kind of price not a long time is not a good solution and we need to get out of detention and we need to continue to work on the immigration on excuse me on the immigration court system\n[noise] um are are you hopeful\nI just I mean I think we need to really invest in the process instead of saying oh the passage doesn't work because it's so slow or oh the passage doesn't work try their reasons I think it's it's chronic lack of investing in um [noise] we we need to prioritize getting kids out as getting children out of detention it's just not appropriate for them\nIt's just kind of price not a long time is not a good solution and we need to get out of detention and we need to continue to work on the immigration on excuse me on the immigration court system\n[noise] um are are you hopeful\nMy hopeful you know I Am on the thing that I think I'm I'm I'm you know the public is engaged on this issue I think on Congress has been very engaged in this issue um and you know doing what isn't it it's certainly a different shelters looking at this this issue holistically from um a rival\nTo the immigration courts so I'm hopeful there's a lot of oversight on this right now but I'm obviously it's one thing to have that versus you know commitment to finding you know and and hiring more judges and you know to really think children she appropriate and have sponsored as soon as possible\nLeah travel as an attorney with the women's refugee commission thank you for your time where thank you very much\nPresident Trump's crackdown on immigration has taken many forms over the past year and nine months one of the latest a proposed rule change regarding how the U.S government decides whether someone is eligible for a visa or permanent residency this change what essentially mean\nAnyone deemed to be at risk of becoming a public charged with the government by access and government benefits like Medicaid or housing subsidies for example could be denied a visa or a green card advocates fear this could lead to families\nHere in the U.S doing without benefits or even medical care for fear of putting their legal status in jeopardy laundry for Lucy says she's already seen it happening but Lucy is a pediatrician and Washington and a spokesperson for the American Academy of pediatrics says this proposed\nRule as a vast expansion of what can be used against an immigrant who was applying for a visa for\nPermanent residency so what it does really from my perspective as a pediatrician is that it presents are immigrant families with an unfair choice to either keep\nYourself and your children healthy but risk being separated for using these services such as Medicaid or snap also cops and stamps\nOr forego those vital services that include health care Nutrition Assistance and your family can remain together in this country so really this proposed rule is a dangerous threat to child I've certainly health\nSo the rule uh obviously still in the proposal phase but what chilling effect so are you already are seeing and hearing from families\nSo I've been seeing the chilling effect for months already with families deciding to descend roll from these vital services just in case it could be used against them in the future\nAnd this includes even opting out of programs again like snap\nAnd even awake or the women infants and children program and four months parents have been asking us if it's safe for them to access these programs and it's tough because it's a very complex proposal the draft of which is nearly four hundred and fifty pages so parents are choosing to play it safe and remove themselves from programs\nThat they qualify for it so it's a very confusing scary time for the families I see\nI'm Wondering if you can tell us about a specific conversation you've had recently with a family or a parent who is facing the dilemma you're talking about\nSo I'd say that one of the many situations that troubled me in particular is that more and more I'm seeing new moms with newborns who are only a few days old choosing not to sign up for these services so as recently as\nLast week I cared for baby who was only four days old and as many new moms I'm the mom was motivated to breastfeed was having a difficult time doing so as\nShe was also concerned that her family was not able to afford fruits and vegetables and other healthy foods that are vital especially for breastfeeding mom and so they usually do I talked about\nThe many benefits of federal programs\nThat provide breastfeeding support or formula is needed or food assistance but she declined I'm and she said that she had heard that\nIt could jeopardize her family's chances of staying together here in the U.S [noise] so so I worry about this baby and many babies in similar situations who are starting their lives without all of the support that\nThey could get if their families were not being placed in the situation of fear and uncertainty and that's one child I saw last week but so many others over the last several months and I've seen in that same situation\nSo families individuals are looking at the trade off between access to medical care and across and possibly limiting their chances of getting permanent legal status\nRight right so they're being forced to decide between their stability in the U.S with a new status or choosing their family's house which is really an impossible choice so the message that immigrant families are\nHearing is that they have to make that choice either health care and food or seeking permanent legal status in the United states\nRight and it's not just medical benefits that will be affected right I mean it's a whole range of other benefits that could ultimately have an effect on people's health\nRight exactly so with the the programs that are affected include Medicaid so which\nWhich really is a lifeline for a lot of my family is they would not be able\nThe puppet
