[noise] [noise]\nAnd um you know it's interesting you know when we were able to welcome folks back to talk about this that means things you still happening and um since she was joining Scott I'm any thoughts on hearing the moves that I'm ... I'm a went through when a nuisance he reached\nOut to them in him again here we are looking at ease auction house oh Scott any thoughts\n[noise]\nI usually I Know when ... were in charge\nScott any thoughts\nWell number I obviously have ... with that and so I Can't speak on behalf of ah the auction house in the same was true receive\nBy specializing in the art work I work with any number of both artists auction houses galleries museums and private collectors\nAnd this is a very important discussion that of course thank everyone for participating in because\nIt's only through these types of conversations on through greater education if we're going to be able to hopefully accomplish to think\nIn the first is to clean up the market and so far as the small amounts of illegal material that you can use to be bought and sold and\nAlso to try and instill amount of confidence in terms of not only the native art market but especially in terms of native arts and so\nWhat are your thoughts on knowing in working with all these different types of folks um about making this flow better is there a need for tribes to open the door or um any thoughts on on how we can do to a point reduction houses now once we have an item first thing on\nThe list let's check with the tribe um talk to me\n\nOh I can only speak for her as my experience with some of the auction house was ... and there are those times when the material is culturally sensitive\nAnd it's only by knowing what is culturally sensitive that we're able to them and for him to come signers of the problems with the peace and informed them of some of the options that they have and so far as not taking things to sail\nBut as Shannon pointed out earlier the other types of Avon such as donation\nHowever one point of clarification is that while the number of nations are willing to sign the\nVirus form eighty to eighty three which puts a monetary value on a donation many nations have objections to doing that for him obvious reasons and so what I like to see is that\nThe institutions that are beginning to pop up on cash charitable donations\nThey're trying to help facilitate these returns whether it occurs through something like buybacks which is what happens with the previous sales at ease and we of course thinks the Annenberg Foundation so they're helping the buddy other instances where\nPeople can Joan banked property and it's still a tax deduction\nAnd yet be serving as somewhat of a middle man\nThe five but when you see free comes in return the item unrelated use to the nation so that they're not put in the position of having to put a price on a sacred property\nThanks for that and I do want to remind folks ... if you'd like to join us one eight hundred nine\nNine six to ... eat is the number anything or any are collectors listening a how do you feel about efforts like we heard earlier to get items food from an auction does it make your job more difficult can be considered not collecting native items because of the attention they get at these auctions you can share your thoughts\nWhen he'd hundred Ninety six to eight for each is the number\nAnd Scott when we hear about some of these um disputes or what is the ideal outcome 'em over these kind of items\nI feel like I'd like to think that one objects are sacred\nBecause they are returned to the nation I Do think as a means to be more education on the part of the public and specifically as far as the market and so far as what is and it's not safe for it\nAnd just because something is old as not necessarily always means that it's straight for it\nYou know Shannon had mentioned something earlier and so far is stolen property and unfortunately that happens however there are other instances were items are viewed her say legally purchased or they are just it from\nA member of the nation to someone who was a collector\nAnd the um goes situations you know the the legal issues I think are very very clear um [noise] so it's a situation of where the market has to correct itself\nAnd the ways that it's going to be able to do that is by working not only with the nation's um but of course with collectors so that they have a better understanding of what can and cannot be sold\nThanks for that you know what I'm also wondering if we have any tribal leaders in the audience to we think about all this money to hundred and Ninety six to eight in the number and you know I'm definitely want to hear your thoughts on this in any maybe even\nApproaches you nation is taking but like any thoughts to start off with\n[noise] ah what were his one start with Senator Kerry Ali sensitive and it's it's so important considering um there were things that types are going to at the moment\nUm I think it's important first of all I think that this is something that everyone has sort of work on collectively but if we were to think about where does it START I think it's important for try to engage with institutions\nLike museums or cultural centers because unfortunately as we all know\nNot very many tribes have culture centers are museums and\nSell 'em typical office in a culture departments it's sort of their responsibility to sort of create some sort of information that is supported by um like the tribal council administration and then share that with these institutions so that may be an auction house\nHas questions and they can get a hold of someone who is part of the tried they held the confidence to be able to maybe get get into contact\nWith someone who's working with one of the institutions to get an idea of what is sacred because there is a difference between a culturally sensitive sacred and objects patch on the right and when we're talking about law there's a difference between of things and\nWhen I uh went to some of the things that I went to create a created a collection guide for the Smithsonian and I may I and I went back to my tried I went to the um when I was seven which is a group\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd\nEven listening to native America calling them parakeet would and we are talking about predicting secret items were being sold at auction in what about a month would you like to see stronger laws to prevent items of cultural patrimony from\nBeing sold um DC fat I'm\nA there are ways to improve relationships with some of these places enter tribes uh what about art dealers are individuals who sell them or were they fit into the conversation phone lines are open everybody's enjoyed it invited to join us you can call in and wanting to hundred Ninety\nSix to ... feet are with us on the line from Santa Fe New Mexico meaning Sanders and she is a curator writer and cultural consultants come to us from them combination and Nina thank you for being here with us in just won't give you a moment to um wrap up your side door or anything more\nOn on what this really means go ahead\nAbsolutely [noise] um so I had a kind of add to what I mean I think he he has a really great idea there needs to be sort of a centralized non profit if you will that handle a lot of the thing you know that\nTheir responsibility would essentially be two tribes in creating collections care management\nEducating helping to educate collectors a tried lawmaker auction houses universities tribal colleges the students and travel colleges\nAbout what is a sacred object what is it an object of actual money and\nHow do you handle those things and I think it would also be beneficial for them to help us to try to build culture centers and build museums or a place where they can hold these items where these items are safe\nAnd I think that would kind of\nThat would help with a lot of this because there are quite a few institutions and individuals they're willing to return these items that tribes don't have anywhere to keep them and um these aren't obviously like for us\nWe have things that we wouldn't return to the river to the mountains there are things that we could keep in storage facility that neat standard [noise] um\nBut that isn't going to happen in how we have heard of someone that create like a centralized place where all this information is happening at everybody trust\nIn and I'm Wondering make sure I'm Wondering to what room maybe are\nMuseums complain all this money ask that question to our next guests Neal thank you for that um we're going to go to Mount Pleasant Michigan right now to fail to shine and Martin and she is the director\nOf the ... Center for an issue not be culture in life we ... we should ban the pot of water meat Indians also a descendent of the could hurry band of Lake Superior Chippewa my pleasure to have her here Shannon I'm\nAnd she said what do you think about this idea that's been tossed out and you know expanded further um of of a central place do you see museums are needed museums fitting into this or\nUm any thoughts on how to make things better\n[noise] well it was you and then to win a monitor uh yes there there are always ways to open up lines of communication so that tribal communities\nAre given a information regarding these types of of options as well as a active and ongoing looting of archaeological sites secret spaces that are that still happening to this day throughout the country and I want to commend my colleague\nUh Shenandoah Laughlin who is the executive director of the association of American indian affairs and they have taken a very active role\nIn providing a platform and opportunity and a network of forests to address these very critical issues as it relates to auction houses private donors\nAnd an underlying that uh the Native American graves protection repatriation act\nAnd how we can uh strength and this act as well as a strength and relationships with the United states a department of state and homeland security when these are options are are um are happening overseas\nAnd when we think of the laws shouldn't even how much stronger do they need to be\nThere are um a happening overseas\nAnd when we think of the laws shouldn't even how much stronger do they need to be very specific line if you could write one into one of these laws um that I think needs to be saying or put into protecting um any thoughts about laws changing them growing them or even indeed\nWell amending laws like ... and the ... archaeological resources Protection Act to um extend beyond what we would call you know nineteenth and Eighteenth century arrows I mean these laws\nAre don't always protect our our ancestors that live long ago so when these items oftentimes that are looted from mounds or very old sites a fall into the hands of private donors these laws don't always\nA extend that far back to provide any type of a recourse for tribes 'em to pursue as far as a legal action and penalties\nAnd soon when we think of ... a year from her two nations in their room in on this um what are your thoughts\n[noise] we'll tribal nations uh we need to continue our our network of information and granted there is a diversity are always within tribal groups and and regionally\nA but we need to you know stand together to um provide more support to organizations that are are raising issues nationally and internationally regarding these issues [noise]\nUm I ... the second\nA triple Indian tribe or Michigan and the ... center\nWe are part of an alliance here in Michigan that represents the twelve federally recognized tribe to ... to ... state historic tribes\nAnd that's called the Michigan ... cultural preservation and repatriation alliance Mac ... so I Would encourage other tribes and other regions to take a look at our website are bylaws\nAnd we have a very hard stance regarding\nA protection of our our cultural um items are sacred and ceremonial items as well as sacred sites and the return of our ancestors from museums and institutions nationally\nUm through our work we've also began to develop a protocols and communicating with a historical societies and I would take a look at historical societies as well they're often private and many of their collections come from private donors and\nTheir funding is is um sometimes month to month and when these historical societies close\nTheir doors their collections then become a open to any and all who may be able to purchase them but we work with these Historical Society is trying to compel them to donate their items back to the original tribes or or the aboriginal territorial tribes that ah they came from\nAnd so she knew when it comes to issues like we raised earlier in our mode um auction houses like one in New Jersey and the one in Paris selling items that possibly could be a cultural patrimony\nAnd getting those items back Shane what is your side to work with the auction house or just mind back in her new she's with that\n[noise] well we prefer to work with the auction house and try to reach out to the private donor\nI'm speaking to them directly regarding the the moral and ethical issue of trafficking a sacred and ceremonial objects and or a burial objects\nBurial goods are fewer belongings are often times on the auction block and you know what we need to understand that you know and and to speak with him that these items are not art you know that's that's something that\nGets a justification for them to uh sell these items to the highest bidder when they classify them as art so we need to uh um provide opportunities\nRadio satellite service can buy bread Michael

are still young enough to take the challenge and have a ... and a and a half of the big heart\nBut what does that American Heart grow smaller asks I way way we'll get to that and a few minutes I we ways name became well known here in the west after he was targeted by the Chinese government for his activism before that he was working in relative obscurity in Beijing in the mid nineties and for some years in New York City I look back\nOn those years now as an important season in his life\nIf you're among the winter then you come to spring here come to summer more and more pressure as us time his new book\nCapture some of those times it's called I way way Beijing photographs Nineteen Ninety three to two thousand and three and several photos he documents the final days of his father I change what a China is fine as modern poets and an artist who like his son felt the wrath of Chinese authorities\nAfter he passed away I feel your failure\nAlone and they don't belong to anybody and uh and maybe that's a moment you want to act so that's a a psychologically ... parish and for me to become a\n... suffer myself a new boss of yourself yes just like the godfather fail\nSo I'd like you if you would tell us the story of the preparations for his memorial after your father died in Nineteen Ninety six because the Chinese officials had their own ideas about how that offend should really unfold right\nYes is this a communist society Irish and have a clear hierarchy you know so he was a kick out from\nA Communist Party and he wants the same generation is a state leaders chairman long drawn out of people they weren't together but uh but he was having to criticize us or writers in someone against the party so your father was in that inner circle with now\nOh yeah yeah they're really core which is support sort of ... or ... ... of course have being cut out a from a party\nOr the untied revolution and uh spend about ... years somewhere yeah I well not just allowed to write towards his name's totally disappeared in the public as a memorial how did that memorial first they decided\nHis body has to be covered by communist flack is very high on there and uh I mean you're you're part of it is a revolution but I feel\n... uncomfortable you know I said you know you should not do something to somebody already passed away which you know it's me and goes to his way so I made that argument that says we don't need to cover his odds flag did they resist ... yeah they they told\nMe this or that you'll find that doesn't just in Ontario family\nWhich is very good argument they say a recent belongs to\nThe Communist Party or states was it a convincing arguments though no it's not as a ... is ... just her mind and has suffered so much that they took being covered by that\nPiece of red but I'm ... with his Hummer and cause that sickle said cool yeah I'm All right for me it's brutal hurts me and then there were the flowers flower as\nThis kind of Sarah money\nThey owe you seems to have a paper flowers you know if someone you know spend the next day a week later somebody dies they oh yeah I uh same I Will walk in the room I feel no no no we don't need to use an isn't being used before so they say why they're going to do I said that\nWell buys a fresh flowers my father's point his art has seen he life us so much relate to the highest a static document\nOn a moral judgment so I said I have to change it solely send out a A R people to follow them all they'll fight for some Beijing city well I Know they made a\nFresh for bad so he can sleep in the middle but still covered by this red blanket\nWall your father was ill you\nDid this performance I that's all I can call it a you intentionally smashed itching dynasty ... and a ... dynasty earn and you were a photograph smashing another are and how did these ideas come to you especially well your father was was dying not very much ideas is there any attitude\nOr some kind of a stupid ridiculous uh action ... to that kind of ... and all the time was your intention to shake up the Chinese public no it's not possible you'll have no path for the rest of society is seeing the sleep and they don't care\nIt was interesting when you said about smashing the vows you felt it was almost like a child acting out\nAnd I want to ask you about the middle finger because it's a photographic motif that you've used pointing a finger at the Hong Kong's skyline appointee middle finger at the Eiffel Tower Chairman Mao I felt like when I saw this it's like a rebellious teenager has just gotten a camera for the first time what is up with\nThe finger is just so sad to say about ... now I realize that don't do that anymore because I'm a girl older you know and the U.S individual in this society when I was kind of do I mean it's just ...\nSo you spent a lot of time in the United states do you feel you can still count on the U.S to be kind of the beacon of free expression around the world\nI don't race sinks

quickly these billions of tons of carbon might be released\nI think the the scary part is that we don't know what an extra four degrees of warming will do to this huge amount of carbon that's Stuart hearing that from ... we're trying to actively to figure that out here and\nHe says it's hard to accurately assess greenhouse emissions from Arctic soil because the whole system is so complex but it's also hard because humans have never won the planet up like we are now\nWe have nothing to compare this to at least from our species perspective wearing what climate scientists call no analog situation

when imagines things go from here with\nConsumer spending more and more and more for the past seven months without wages ramping up you might wonder whether some kind of issue is going to

enough money to fix the roads they just keep diverting the money so we don't need to add the cost of living burdens to working families to fix roads they should be putting the existing gas tax into roads rather than increasing it\nBut even if the gas tax word stay the same it wouldn't be able to keep up with the demands for one thing these prices haven't been indexed to inflation another reason
