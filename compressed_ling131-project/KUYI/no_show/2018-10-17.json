I I'm located five miles north of the intersection of a road one and the I wrote to I'm In the first Hogan on the left three miles up from a\nYoung lady you know didn't let me ask you that and then how how is it is it just because the nine one one operator in the area you know um where people are and so uh when they're calling their like this come out to our our house I mean it's something must be written down somewhere\nWhile it's it's a problem that they're continuing to work on in Indian country because there are homes even today that they haven't matched up with with uh nine one one system but what are the things I should I should point out and this is especially important in terms of even voter id requirements\nSo the national voter registration act allows you to have a physical description through by drawing a map of where your house is located\nSo that even if you don't have a physical address the traditional address you can still registered to vote and under federal law the election officials are required to accept that the problem that we've seen as we have testimony for example from Arizona\nWhere there have been instances in which a local election officials have used the physical ... you know the the map description that voters have given that they are allowed to give under federal law and they've actually use that as a basis for purging voters\nBut the main issue you know in terms of um you know when you're talking about a ministry elections it's not just confirming whether or not someone to set aside\nThe bigger issue from an election administrator standpoint is making sure that you're assigned to the proper precinct and you can do that without having a physical address if you just simply describe where your house is located at federal law says that's enough\nRight Don thanks for giving us a call from Newtown we appreciate it and you're listening in North Dakota or anywhere else and you want to talk about voting\nAre you going to vote in this upcoming election or have you experienced barriers to voting give us a call the number ... ... hundred nine nine six to eight for eight and sort of prairie rose she is in North Dakota as well hey there Perry Rose now a Monica\nHey everybody thanks for taking my call\nAbsolutely okay North Dakota are you are you concerned about uh being able to vote this year\nI'm I'm not but um I Do need to tell you that when I when I first moved to Newtown a few years ago um I moved into a new apartment building just north of northern light in Newtown um and I had to wait over a year to uh to get an address from the nine one one\nDispatcher so to say that we we we all have an address that's not true because our our family we got home down in rows grand um North Dakota which is near white shown on the corporate hundreds of Asian and we appeal boxes because it's a rural route there's no like physical home address because nine one one has included that to come out yet and there's a PO box that right\nSo that year that was the fourteen I'm I voted with my tribal ID and I didn't have to have is going on there right but because I had my tribal IDs and I lived in North Dakota are choosing at a minimum number of French Conan I gave them my eternity bell I was able to vote 'em\nAnd I do have to say to that um you know North Dakota we got rid of the affidavit system of voting because there were some elders who voted a Mad Men election cycle to the center I'm ... I'm\nBecause people about them and so we totally got rid of that system too and so there are very real barriers\nYes in Newtown Dakota to voting um and I just am honesty and it's crazy to me that the indigenous people in this country are being denied voting because we don't have proper residency like that's total craziness and so\nThird anyone was comical comes to Albuquerque November sorting through the fourth indigenous creators illustrators writers designers actors producers from a world comic books doing so I thought\nThat was the film TV and graphic novels indigenous Comic Con highlights amazing work and brings understanding about these two Jews experience to the world popular culture informational weekend passes him a chance to support me to be\nAt indigenous Comic Con dot com [noise] [noise]\nOh no no no no\nNo no no\nNo uh uh uh\nOh\n\nHey hey hey hey\nA a a a\n\n\nA a you know hey I'm home\n\nYou're listening to native America calling today we are talking about voting and barriers to voting and there's still time to get in on the conversation give us call one eight hundred nine six to eight forty eight Jim checkers with us he is from Wilson ulcer\nAnd a gym before the break you were mentioning there was a hotline you can call if you feel like I'm you ah have experienced the barriers to voting\nYes yes I was going to make two suggestions one is that\nIf I'm before election day one of the things that would actually help out a lot of those states where you have voter registration deadlines which is most states\nAnd many of those deadlines already passed or will be passing in the next few days because we're close to the election it actually would be helpful for voters to contact their election officials confirmed that are on the voter registration lists\nIf they're not um and they should be or if they experience any kind of problems or issues between now all the way up through the election they should contact the election protection hotline which is run by some of our coalition partners with 'em and see in the lawyers committee and that number is one eight six\nSix our votes um and again it's one eight six six our\nVotes and what happens with that information is it's communicated out to people on grassroots organizations like courtesy used as well as um organizations like the Native American rights find um that have lawyers and again we will try to work with for voters to try to address those issues as they come up on election day\nAll right let's take some calls that Gilbert in Farmington New Mexico tuned in on K s U T either go\nA little bit more because I Want to pay my two cents in on just listening to talk of\nMexico is I won't go long term you turn to [noise] we'd have elected officials who um\nWork with the county government than I guess what they've done is mapped out county aides in the house members fools researchers\nLike Shultz show the county itself has done on this work places Seoul mapped out so I just thought I Would throw down in\nOkay ... thanks for sharing nuts and let's go to Lucy in Santa Fe tuned in on K.

substance but as you pointed out that's not an excuse that doesn't make it okay I'm In it usually isn't the cause of it more of an amplifier um and then um sometimes\nPeople who are actually a victim will turn to alcohol or other substances as a means to kind of self medicate from either a\nPast or an ongoing trauma or stress or painful experience so there's a big connection with um substance abuse and I'm preventing and treating substance abuse can make it easier to prevent and treat domestic violence\nBut one isn't necessarily causing the other one as you pointed out um what are some of the effects on children exposed to a domestic violence\n[noise] one thing that we always need to remember too is on domestic violence is a learned behavior so children I only have a tendency to have trauma from Whitney skiing or experience domestic violence but they may start to learn that kind of behavior and think that it's normal um\nA lot of sense does the trauma include um depression sadness I'm no hope for the future although there are some examples of [noise] um some of the things that they start to think about and not being able to trust authority even um\nAnd having heart having a hard time in school not just with the situation they're experiencing at home but their trauma that they're experiencing sometimes doesn't allow them to learn effectively so on top of them having a hard time and missing school with an incomplete homework\nThey make 'em [noise]\nThey may have a hard time absorbing material because a lot of time when when children are in these situations is involved a lot of science and and it impacts their brain as well and including learning so that has a huge impact on them on all aspects\nTheir physical health their emotional health and even um how they'll be in the future and\nWith their relationship mhm and that's a really important points um in terms of kind of how cycles happen within families too and um you mentioned something about how\nUm children can potentially learn that um that kind of behavior is normal and even though it might seem like someone who grows up in a situation where I'm One of their parents is abusive towards the other parent or abusive towards them it would make them never want to I experienced that but sometimes I'm to the contrary um\nIt kind of normal lives is that and there can be a risk of repeating and the next generation\nSomething that was experienced during childhood [noise] um so that's one of the really important\nReasons why we want to try to intervene and try to prevent and then a tree and stops domestic violence [noise] um so this is kind of a grim picture here amber about\nUm domestic violence and about how\nUm how common it is\nUm which I don't think we actually mentioned you know needs to just just off the top of your head about how common domestic violence as I was just playing some up um [noise] quit which is at the national level um one in three women and one in four men have been\nThe victims of some kind of physical violence by an intimate partner in their lifetime so that's really high one in three ... um\nEven higher for on native peoples and so um we kind of really stressed out and all native communities we need to be talking about\nThis issue right and I think I'm a lot of times people who are in a domestic violence situation\nCan feel so alone and so isolated in it and um you know it's probably true there is no one else in the bedroom no one else in that home necessarily um but to know that you know one in three and probably higher um means that you know a lot of the women that we know of 'em have been through this and that\nIt's not something that I'm One person is only experiencing um so what are some other resources out here and we talked about how\nUm common domestic violence is how extensive it can be how um cycles can develop where it's hard to be able to end or leave a domestic violence situation um so what are the resources out here at the um for someone who is experiencing a domestic violence situation\nYes and a lot of places are resources are very low and so out here on hoping we actually have quite a bit um for the first one that we always work with is the Hopi domestic violence program they offer\nA lot of ... uh services and resources including education legal advocacy victim advocacy men's education and even more we also work with the Hopi behavioral health services substance abuse prevention center\nHope the social services hope the resource enforcement services the bureau of Indian affairs office of justice services victim services sorry that's the one [laughter] and there is also on the national um\nHop NATO's help line um called strung hearts needed help line and they have a balanced tailored specific meters on\nPeople and so on and you share that phone number with our um our listeners just as something to put into um anyone can put into their phone and call 'em for resources I'm In support over the phone\nYes I'm their number is one eight four four\nSeven six to eight for eight three\nAnd they provide services at no cost from Monday to friday from nine AM to fight thirty PM okay so now that these are not a\nTwenty four seven hotline but I'm kind of um a daytime um central time um during the weekdays um a resource specifically targeting I'm native communities and anyone I'm looking for resources or help with domestic violence so that number again is one eight war for\nSeven six to eight for eight three\nAnd that's a strong heart native help line so that's a good resource um that anyone can access um but there's also quite a few resources here I'm On the ... and I have um been able to work with the all the domestic violence I'm French\nIn program um and they are really wonderful advocates and I've gotten them involved with um [noise] patients than um community members and so that's a really great resource that we have here and then um I just wanted to share for anyone who's joining us that this is house calls on K. U. I.\nEighty one ask them I'm Kendra Johnston your host\nFor this week a provider I Hope you health care center and I'm here with my guest\nAmber ... was the membership and outreach coordinator for the whole the tea well women's coalition to end up you know\nA really wonderful organization out here at home or be working to address prevent and I'm intervene with domestic violence so amber I'm let's talk about safety planning which is an important topic for\nPrevent and I'm intervene with domestic violence so amber I'm let's talk about safety planning which is an important topic for\nI'm someone who is in a domestic violence situation and I'm trying to figure out how to end that situation how to get out and and what exactly is safety planning um and how can um how can we help someone with safety planning [noise]\nA safety plan is defined as a personalized practical plan that can help you avoid dangerous situations\nAnd know the best way to react when you are in danger this plan includes ways to remain safe while in the relationship finding to leave or after you leave so it's a lot like planning for any other emergency like or dangerous situation like a fire drill on\nAnd then it can include things like emergency exits important documents important phone numbers or even extra cash for food or transportation so a lot of time on this is very individualized for each person and meet them where they're at and\nThe people that can help with safety plans are um dopey domestic violence program the strong hearts needed help lines or even the national domestic violence hotline um\nIf they need help um you can also do it on your own too and they're just on the Internet mhm but it is an important thing to think about because I think a lot of sometimes our first reaction\nWhen we hear about somebody within a um abusive relationship as well why didn't they leave right um but it can be a dangerous time is that um and so it's important to um have support and plan um and that's something that um you know in leaving I think there's an expression about how\nUm you know leaving as a process not necessarily a a single act and we're going to get for that too um so that there's a a planning process that can happen and safety planning has an important part of that and so how can um a friend or\nFamily member best support someone who is experiencing domestic violence\nAs friends and family members we can uh it really can be as simple as being supportive and listening and telling them that you believe them and support them in their decision on no one knows the perpetrator better than the victim\nAnd we need to believe her or him when they say that they're scared and not to blame them and ask them why don't you leave where when are you going to leave 'em\nBecause like you said leaving is a process and not a single act and oftentimes when that's that ... that time that they're leaving it is very dangerous [noise] so continuing to encourage them and let them know that there are strong and affirming their\nExperiences and and letting them know that you're there that they're not alone is something that that can go a long way\nAnd the and the day\nAnd ... and and\nAnd hanging\nOn the day and the other day and I and\nHang out\nAnd\nYeah\nYou know\nAnd I hang out and [noise]\nI and I [noise] I hang out here and\n[noise] and [noise] and\nAnd and\nAnd I\nSay I am and I am\nMarried and and I am I and\nAnd I show and\nAnd [laughter]\nAnd and and\nThe\nBank to\n\n\nBuying or or or or or or or or um or they're\nJust really ... me down and they have\nBeen around been through my ...

and that does then it became\nReally intense notice them and came out together and\nActually even talking about one particular person that wants to ... fans because they see this and one of those moments when people talk and then it took us out\nWhat's been public reaction alike to me to how women reacted andme men\nI don't know how to put it you know for the audience so just a site now but it just a moment you can go to a mixed reaction in only didn't notice the men and men who are seemingly limited and\nThey see that this is a moment of truth in India which has been vacant for so long and

kind of backlash water that you know the ...\n... what he'd be brief that it's going to affect a lot of men who were innocent but I think overall support has been banned and overall has GED given that

that have prompted national conversations over sexual assault and abuse in India I think the twenty twelve gang rape of geology saying uh she was given the name nearby uh there was a lot of media attention in India all over the globe but then\nAfter the trial for the perpetrators international discussions it kind of felt like that news quietly went away and then there'd be another attack that wouldn't get much attention to situate for us what's happening now and what feels kind of like a pattern up to now is this different\nIn each one has and they've seen that happen and thousands of men and they came out and treat protesting and demanding the law in our life there were changes it became most shake definition of rape was why didn't they passed that did use violence against women you know\nIf you look at the data the number of violent incidents again Roman has not gone down this is also true that more than in a folder to do both dead cases of violence\nThat laws because I Know of

that is a big move and they much more as he ... that you cannot just lie down and take it I think\nBut I think that is a big move and they much more ... that\nYou cannot just lie down and take it I think for me as an Indian woman this is a big change it has taken they they don't just like the end of this is a problem and that just has to be dead debate and each one of us have to come forward in
