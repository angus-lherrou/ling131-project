to the Indian child welfare act today and if you have something you'd like to share give us a call\nThe number is one eight hundred nine nine six to ... for each and right now we can go to Portland, Oregon seeing regular guests David Simmons\nAnd he is the government affairs in advocacy director for the national Indian child welfare association also known as well thank you for joining us for another nice America calling David\nThanks for having his hair\nAnd he would just want to give you a momentum we heard from Matthew ... you're talking about this case and definitely its significance to equal um is there anything you like to share any concerns you have about this particular case and when he could mean for\nOther tribal nations and just even the authority of this law go ahead David\nWas sure I mean the summit mad if you have a great summary of what the case was about some other concerns I think here we work a lot with national cars American any of the other Indian organizations in one of the things that we are concerned about is\nNot just what would happen if this case when in a bad direction for a quote but also how it affects other Indian laws as well um what did you start attacking a constitutional authority of Congress to regulate tribal affairs in certain areas um through\nLegislation and the courts then you start to kind of move into a territory that is very concerning for a lot of other Indian law federally the law as well [noise] um I also like to point out that even though we have these kind of challenges and we've been seeing these on a very consistent basis for\nA few years now um states in tribes and our observation are doing more than they ever have since the passage of the twenty sixteen Indian child welfare act regulations\nTo try and bring practice with Ecuador more in alignment with all the practice for all children Eighteen different organizations leading child welfare organizations indoors stick whereas a standard bearer for what good show off or practice looks like so\nIt really shouldn't be that it takes more work should be that it promotes that good practice that we've lost she for all children to we've seen we see more and more people sort of embracing that moving forward with it\nAnd even took a little bit about the claim that this is ray space in um can you unpack that a little bit more in you know we have tried saying no this is about a political relationship between nations um talk to me a little bit why we constantly hear and then going back to race\nI think it's because it's a it's an attractive argument I'm not saying it's not necessarily effective argument but in this country we have under the constitution called equal protection and that means that you can't discriminate based on race and other matters and so for\nPeople to say look this is discriminatory and and they're saying essentially it's discriminatory against\nNon Indian people who want to foster or adopt native children as an attractive argument there's a lot of pushback we see this currently a number of levels where people are pushing back against a how anti discrimination and housing anti discrimination in\nOther areas and so they think well maybe we can make this argument fit with that but it clearly if you look at the text of it while\nIt talks about tribes is sovereign governments commerce clause which it's talking very clearly about tribes and their citizens not Indian people as a racial category\nAnd David when we think about the people who are involved in is in a lot of times um we hear whenever is best or in the child's best interest in what do you think it's cloudy when we start taking a look at this and understanding why equipment there\nWhile we um you know if you take a long look at how welfare history and you know in trouble for it and it's a form of trouble for in this country is not really that old actually uh you can see that the idea of the best interest has been around for a long time during that period\nBut it's often been defined differently has never been defined by the federal government and so it gets to find case by case\nIt's cloudy when we start taking a look at this and understanding why Clinton there\nWell we um you know if you take a long look at it\nHow welfare history and you know in trouble for in this form of travel for in this country is not really that old actually uh you can see that the idea of the best interests that has been around for a long time during that period\nBut it's often been defined differently has never been defined by the federal government and so it gets to find case by case and so the question we always ask is well who's best interest is the child's best interest determined by this group of adult this judge\nThis attorney who is a determined by and I think what any child welfare act says is that we're taking the long view of what the child needs and best interests are not just\nToday tomorrow or next year but moving all the way into adulthood and their relationship an affiliation with their tribe and all the benefits that flow from that\nIn my is it that this one seems to be a hard one to two people to grasp that he's he can work in a lifetime as opposed to just right now in seems that people have him\nOn how offers a very emotional kind of thing and as Matthew describes some of the media coverage you know that we've seen where people are\nSlashing these very dramatic pictures of children on the news and\n... and things like that we we know that in general I think we sent tend to have short term views about a lot of things\nIn this country and we're looking for that sensational\nImpact and when you start talking about what somebody's life going to be like base because of this decision Twenty years from now also that most people don't think that way it's not the way that we think without long term thinkers in some ways like that and the child welfare system itself\nAs has been set up in this country doesn't necessarily look at those issues either\nNeed to take a look at these key specifically takes his versus ... I'm In any excuse me\nIs a journalist reading long papers still allow me to um but but the mentioned that the parents are also a bully scene in in even on the side of the people who want\nTo adopt a child you know can you explain a little bit more about why we put forth even use the needed parents are coming forward and saying we support the adoptive family\nWell first of all you know there are a lot of blended families in Indian country who are involved at some point maybe in child welfare proceeding so ... isn't always native parents that there are the ones that might have some concern or questions\nSo I look at that first and then I think secondly I Would look at you know whenever you're having your child will be removed adoptions are even in foster care of course there's gonna be a lot of emotions a lot of things going on\nWe don't it's hard to reduce what people's specific concerns are are to just oh look it's native people or non native parents who are raising concerns about this we have to remember there was a very large number of population of people were talking about here\nAnd maybe one or two or a few in these cases have those concerns on this and those should be addressed and they often are a when given the opportunity\nBut we have to be careful not to over generalized these things\nTook a little bit more about Steve in ... words um it could mean\nA lot it's a state is challenging are those are the cases that make him nervous can you explain that a little bit more about what it means um Wednesday challenges or or any science and why he thinks the two stepping up to\nA ... there's I guess the biggest concern is is rather than sort of individuals involved in a particular case and\nAnd if you know the history about sort of these challenges over the many years almost all of them came from private adoption cases so they were brought by private adoption attorney is in their interests are who have in our opinion sometimes a conflict of interest they might even be representing both birth parents as well as adoptive parents in some cases\nIn cases we've been involved and\nSo there are concerns about those conflicts but when it when a state and government so this is not just individuals as our government is asking for relief from the Indian child welfare act or challenge in its its implementation\nI think it puts it on a different bar now it's a government challenging with the federal government and their ... and as you heard math you talk about they're saying hey I thought you I thought the constitution allowed us to be able to regulate and control these kinds of proceedings and now you're saying we have to follow this federal\nMe me me me me\nHe I mean the\nUN hang\nMe that\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nHe he seems to be a little early\nIn the\nMan a\nGuy and he\n\nThinks who tune in today we've been discussing the challenges to the Indian child welfare act the law turns forty this year and you can see the law in the gold standard for child welfare law but some organizations and now three states are challenging the validity\nOf the long way do you think about that but mine through the number is one eight hundred Ninety nine six to eat pork beat a with us today from Hartford, Connecticut is Stephen ... he is a senior staff counsel for\nThe racial justice program at the American civil liberties union also here with us today is David Simmons and he is the government affairs in advocacy director for the national Indian child welfare association gentlemen plus you have you here with us and before we moved here in a little bit about South Dakota\nA David wanting to get your thoughts on\nWhy you've seen some of these organizations um are trying to get it repealed into court instead of trying to get it to get Congress to repeal it\n[noise] I think that there's a Congress you know tribes have been working very very hard for any number of decades and more but to a\nWork to establish relationship who could rational people both the house and Senate um they formed in a way I Would consider to be very um strong bipartisan relationships\nUh and helped educate members of Congress about the you know the responsibilities that they hold 'em or in terms of Indian affairs and\nAnd federal agencies a survey to people so I think it's probably a little bigger live for them and Congress I'm In that regard and certainly there have been attempts or in other ways to undermine other federal Indian programs and laws are different times but I think that the they see\nThe courts as probably the best opportunity uh so I think that's probably why they've chosen to take this into litigation direction\nI think that the evening and we know that we have people who work in law field who regularly tune into the conversation um if there's something you'd like to just knowing what this means and you can share your thoughts\nTo incite or maybe even specifically to try that you were working with were connected to one eight hundred nine nine six to eight he's the number ... closer to what\nIs going on in South Dakota give us a little bit of the background when we started seeing Oklahoma's who tried versus then unique\n[laughter] back in two thousand Thirteen the ACLU was contacted by a number of families in rapid\nCity and to Indian tribes the glove sue and roast but to uh and uh they told us\nI'm a style ending information it was hard to believe that this was actually happening in the United states we we we wound up calling us the gun and sixty\nSeconds a welfare case I'm a ... as a federal court ultimately filed a what a\nFamilies and tribes are telling us was absolutely correct that a hearings were being held to determine custody of and and children and you know those hearings the parents who are not permitted to offer any testimony are not permitted to offer a defense\nThey couldn't confront a social worker who was accusing them of wrongdoing they weren't given a copy of any of the papers are those papers were given by the state in secret to that judge or they were denied counsel and then the judge made a decision\nIt as hard as it says to believe made a decision whether to keep the children in state custody or return those children to the parents this was at the emergency\nCustody hearing every state has a process where if a child\nGets into streetcar study for one reason or another\nThe parents having immediate right to a hearing well at these hearings a process\nThat are Indian families were being given it any uh tries to where it was so cursory that it was a ridiculous and a federal court as soon as that are found\nA rat or this evidence existed or declared those uh procedures unconstitutional and and issued injunction\nIn what's the big takeaway in terms of rooting for or against tribes in a holding equal in in even jurisdiction go ahead\nWell as the federal judge found um these procedures violated both the Indian child welfare act and the due process clause fourteenth amendment of the constitution and as a result\nUh the court issued an injunction ordering state officials to do the right thing and to provide a family isn't tribes with all the procedures that they're entitled to um the right to present testimony in the right to cross examine the right to counsel the right to see\nAll the papers um [noise] I should uh quickly say that the state appealed that injunction and about three weeks ago a circuit reversed not on the ground or the judge was wrong and issuing a jump in the injunction part of it\nEr during state officials to do the right thing and to provide a family is in tribes with all the procedures that they're entitled to um the right to present testimony in the right to cross examine the right to counsel the right to see all the papers\nUm I should uh quickly say that the state\nAppealed that injunction and about three weeks ago the ... circuit reversed and not on the ground or the judge was wrong and issuing a jump in the injunction but they are claiming that the family should have raised these issues in their state court proceedings\nUh it's known as the extension doctrine that federal court should abstain\nAnd whenever a somebody has an opportunity to present these claims and in the state court proceeding we filed a petition for re hearing because those those families didn't have a a realistic\nOpportunity to raise these federal claims and that type of proceeding I just described a that's a a just a ridiculous to say that that these on counseled a family is a Paris should of a sad\nWell judge you are violating my rights under the Indian child welfare act that just didn't happen and wouldn't be expected to happen in the proceeding like that\nIn the remote which some of the

Catherine Osborn in Rio de Janeiro\nHere at home mid term elections are just around the corner people like Jonathan Morgan are closely watching social media for signs of disinformation campaigns targeting voters Jonathan is founder and CEO of new knowledge it's a company that built technologies to spot these campaigns so far he says they've seen action from both domestic and foreign players\nThe foreign actors are the typical cast of characters Russia Iran Israel but here in the U.S it's a\nIt's mostly political operatives and I think this is where there's a really interesting question the for techniques are similar they might be operating a network of Web sites but doing it in a way that is opaque to the audience of those Web site so to\nTo that audience it appears that there's dozens of publications and there's a consensus around important political issues amongst those publications when in fact it's not really a consensus it's a few people are just reading that\nMessage and that might be amplified by thousands of social media accounts that are coordinating their activity either\nBecause they're automated like botnets or their little armies of humans trying to spread a message intentionally as quickly as broadly as possible um and so these are the characteristics that we associated with foreign influence operations but there again being done by folks who I think assume that they're just\nKind of hustling to get their message out as political operatives even if it's a little shady or a little disingenuous and in terms of foreign actors or Russia\nDoesn't surprise me but but what\nAre Iran and Israel at two very similar things similar to Russia maybe networks of accounts focus on their foreign policy objectives thought what's interesting is that when there's a really contentious domestic issues here in the U.S\nLike the cabinet nominations example they do turn and focus on amplifying both sides of that issue of sowing discord which is again really similar to what we found twenty sixteen\nOr these campaigns are targeting specific races and specific states\nEven in racist that have been very high profile for example the crews ... Senate race in Texas right well there is a lot of social media engagement around that race and there are some\nTactics being used again by we think domestic actors that are arguably manipulative we're not seeing a lot of foreign application of um of one candidate or another and in those races generally how would you say these operations are right now compared to what we saw\nIn the twenty sixteen us presidential election both in terms of the end goal and uh the strategy how it's actually done what we're seeing an evolution of tactics so this is definitely an arms race the social media platforms haven't proved to their ability to detect certain types of tactics that we know are associated with foreign influence but\nOf course new tactics are evolving a new proxies are being developed\nOr new human assets are being cultivated so that foreign actors can operate through real Americans and op you skate their activity um and in terms of strategy I'd say that's been largely consistent from one election to the next as much as there's been a huge focus on\nWhether or not the Russian operation was focused on supporting the Trump campaign over the Clinton campaign ultimately I think what we've seen\nOver the long term is that they're real strategy was focusing on things that were very divisive and of course presidential elections are very device and and the more device that they can make that conversation the veteran the Kavanaugh nomination and the me too movement of the allegations of sexual assault I think of course that's been a\nVery sort of an open wound for the country right now so it's really no surprise but these accounts were tried to um exacerbate that uh that just court\nSpeaking of social media tactics we just heard a story about Facebook working with fact checkers\nAre on the ground and Brazil to prevent the spread of this information or as people there had to polls over the weekend this coming weekend or Facebook and other social media companies doing the same kind of things here in the U.S\nThey are and I think working with fact checkers is certainly one part of the solution of course we want the information that gets disseminated on line to be authentic and correct but\nWhat we think about if this information is actually less about the\nTruth or the authenticity of any given story and more about how it's distributed is the platform being manipulated to elevate one story or one narrative at one point of view over another and I think that's where the social media platforms are also starting to work with third parties to identify the sort of manipulative distribution [noise] I\nI just want to ask you about the the news today the department of justice the charging seven Russian military officials for hacking into anti doping agency's and activists as well as a Pennsylvania nuclear energy concern um it's kind of apples and oranges compared to what we're talking about but it does suggest more Russian meddling how do you see\nThese charges against the concern of more apparent election meddling I think this is actually an indication that what we traditionally think about as\nCyber warfare and what we've started to think about his information warfare are actually one of the same and the more that we think about these two things as being synonymous are overlapping the more we'll be able to defend ourselves against these types of attacks in the future and thoughtfully engage with our adversaries around what isn't isn't acceptable\nOr you know what are the rules of the road in terms of this ongoing combat
