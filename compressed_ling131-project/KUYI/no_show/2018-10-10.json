know topics that evolved memories from long ago when conversations that they had had with their parents their grandparents a local story tellers or even\nFolks in the community gatherings and some of The Elders were saying well I went home and I was visiting with my wife were talking with my brother and we remembered all these other ...\nOther words that would pertain to those topics\nSo it was like opening chapters it probably has been you know may be closed for a while I'm with their discoveries went on a we found\nThat there were a number of young people really really a U.S it is surprising number of young people who had been raised by their grandparents and of course we know who these people are but how much ... do they know\nWell it turns out we call these folks are college by beta children raised my grand grand mother her grandparents that we have some young or you might say fountains of knowledge who have an amazing\nA grasp of the coal language and we're um so The Elders were able to recognize and I and some of The Elders were saying to me these young people know so much well you know when they were raised by their grandparents the knowledge skips a generation of Maine's most them closer to that\nThat time when probably our community was er using solely the crow language\nFor all communications [noise] um and you know we've never had a chance to say well let's assess how much we know as individuals the coals hope people don't go in and take a test and no and get to know what they're what the depth and breadth of their vocabulary is\nAnd so individuals came in like after the session they come in and said to me you know something there's some new words I've never heard before but there's some of these topics I just know so much and I didn't realize how much I Know that I can share\nAnd the value of it the treasurer of it that was the astounding I think measure across the board is the people that were in the sessions just came to realize I Know so much I Know this and how does this sort of the dimension the depth and breadth of what they they could contribute\nAnd you know a lot of our elders have retired\nFrom there or whatever their careers\nWere and uh the potential of their contribution in this initiative goes well beyond our first Eighteen hundreds topics we expect in the next year to have one or at least one more rapid word collection initiative\nThat will take another Eighteen hundred topics in our living language and we're ... we're just really excited to see how that that goes\n[noise] well I Want to talk to you more about that this is such a fascinating topic to put a dictionary together of\nAnd in our indigenous languages and to have that opportunity to have an elder sit together and uh experience that that's so

either to Laura\nHow they do All right thanks so much for all of you joining us today I'm going to start with you um it tell us about the dictionary that that's a you have for the Mississippi ban of truck to\nUm well right now what we have is the teaching dictionary that we um put out in two thousand fourteen is considered a child version and it has sixteen hundred word\nThe reason that we wanted to publish a dictionary was because\nWe um we're gonna be teaching the chocolate language in the schools for thirty minutes every single day and for people who haven't had a you know a lot of conversations in Choctaw with little kids and it was like a daunting task and so we gave them a dictionary that\nWill hopefully help them you know I'm a lady simplify the language a little bit\nFor the little kids because our kids are growing up not speaking Choctaw and um it's not natural for a um speaker to uh you know be patient and um\nCome up with the word does it'd be you know to simplify for a little bitty kid or non fevers [laughter] [laughter] that's great and and do what did you hear from the teachers about using this this tool\nWell I think it was helpful because I'm the dictionary that they have access to is the buying tend to one and um it's really I'm really thick dictionary and it's got a lot of obsolete words and\nI'm the injuries are really mom I feel like the simplicity of the teaching a dictionary has been really helpful to them and we also gave them access to it um the PDF documents so they have it on their phones and they can search for things like you know if they want us they butterfly\nUm especially what the spelling plus they know how to say hush hush the bullshit but they don't know how to spell it they can look it up on their phones are in the I'm teaching dictionary book\nJason I understand you guys went recently to a conference and learn a little bit more about putting together dictionaries tell us about that\n[noise] [noise] Oh yes ma'am

I. T. I. is\nA brand new station from evil Butte South Dakota it's owned by the shame rivers who tried and they're airing a Native American calling for the first time today hello and welcome to K. I. P. I\nThank you so much for carrying our show we really appreciate it we're talking native language dictionaries today if you want to get in on the conversation there's still time the number is one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for eight ... hundred nine nine needed around a TBI is with us She's the Choctaw language curriculum coordinator for\nThe Mississippi band of Choctaw Indians and I'm up here and I we were talking with Janine before the break about um ... different ways to approach a teaching the language was apps and a new variety of things um\nHow how do you guys decided or you're going to approach you know building a new dictionary will you do something like the rapid word collection\nWell right now I Believe we're just using that data bases that we have um you know somewhere it's from the ... area and\nI'm Erin bottle of work from the eighties that if I'm constantly having language development which we just got out of a you know every time we hear a new word I Try to Jason and\nHe puts it into the data and that's basically I think how it's progressing we have a ton of example of phrases and sample Senate says that were written down I'm In the last Fifteen or Twenty years that we're going through and\nI'm looking at a lot of them and I'm like oh it's just ... dictionary and especially when I'm trying to you know correct or not correct by like\n... um I find out that flood these might not be in the database so that's basically how it's growing\nAlright and Janine um when you did the the rapid word collection was there any time when there was maybe some disputes about a certain word or I mean you know maybe not like a rape fighting among each other but you know differences of opinion\nIt variations of words\nIsn't dictionary and especially when I'm trying to you know correct or not correct by like match the spellings um I find out that some of these might not be in the database so that's basically how it's growing\nOh right and do you mean um when you did the the rapid word collection was there any time when there was maybe some disputes about a certain word or I mean you know maybe not like a rape fighting among each other but you know differences of opinion\nDefinitely variations of\nWords and how they're pronounced our language is very descriptive and we were involving people from six districts we have three bands of the of the ... people and so we found that\nUm people and we generally are people know that there are differences in the bans and also even some some illegal or even localized differences\nUh we found that there are families and a localized groups that have named every technology that's come along\nAnd there are others that didn't do that and so um you know if we were originally thinking well maybe we'd have to be inventing where it's we haven't had to but the discovery is it among our people there's variation and we welcome that I'm discussion\nAnd it got rather lively some of them were\nSaying well this is the way my great grandfather's set it I was a little kid at his feet at the sweat lodge and I heard him say it this way\nAnd someone from prior which is eighty five miles away said well this is the way it was said by and so on like that and they talked about it so but what it was a process allows it a and welcomes actually\nIs to have that variation those don't have to counsel one another out they are included\nAnd that you know the difference may be a slight variation in the word itself but we want all of that in there because we want to have a a dictionary that represents the living language and it's so important to do that when you start restricting\nWhy it said there's this is a way this word as sad as opposed to this well you know you take the the very vitality out of the language and there's reasons for those differences\nAnd they talk about that in the sessions you heard the verbal\nThe discussions that went on and and uh they got really quite lively um and sometimes very hilarious and sometimes\nActually emotional and the sense that there are things they hadn't remembered and the reference to the people from there you know back generations um stories that had been told of even warrior experiences and battles and all of that came through and so\nWe're um it's it's the whole gamut I guess you might say of reactions but just because\nOne person says it this way and another says it this way doesn't mean that they've eclipse one another no\nAnd um but they need to agree also on how it's spelled and listen to it and how is it spelled and they each each of the groups\nHad to appoint among there among the five of them someone that was actually writing down the words it with the proper accents and all of that so these folks are all literate in the language is well we really have a wealth of speakers you know we've got twenty five hundred very fluent crow speakers\nAt least that count actually maybe somewhat ... a low because that comes from the census and you know do people identify themselves that are like when the census taker comes around but\nWe have a wealth of information and knowledge and where to perfect a really moment of like you might say it's a pivotal moment\nFor us to be able to collect our language in this way\nAnd the dictionary then becomes a major learning tool in wherever these learners are and we're hoping they're everywhere but we of course are very interested in our youngest learners\nHow do you feel about um non native or non crows using ah the dictionary using the work that you raised in a to learn the language themselves\nYou know from the beginning we are just very interested in having every learner anywhere who wants\nTo learn the language we're a small group of speakers were small tribe there's Thirteen thousand members of our tribe and probably another five thousand descendants [noise] this is the location of the ... people this is it a our audience isn't something that's going to go worldwide\nUm but there are people here in there who are interested in the crow language and all of our apps are free\nUm our books are online can be purchased by anyone and when we have our summer Institute for language learning we have an intense a cruel language learning for beginners anyone can earn rural were very anxious to have anyone who's interested in and\nI'm not the market isn't huge [laughter] but we're not interested in being restrictive at all\n... ... interesting I mean I Know what about you how do you feel about um outsider who in the Mississippi Choctaw\n[noise] um well I don't think there's as much interest as some people might think like you know there's not going to be a ... million people coming in and taking the dictionary and you know learning to talk of language but\nI'm ... ... ... we saw like so much interest from the linguistic community and um I think it's good that they have interest and talk I'll be going like me personally I don't understand like every grammar rules and there's someone else can explain that to me who\nLooked at the dictionary like I'm all for 'em you know whatever helps our language at this point because we don't want to you know my generation the twenty to thirty girls to die in Seventy years and take the language with us and all we leave is you know the written word and\nUm I'd rather be able to have it explained to me and then I can explain to someone else can we create speakers yeah and that's going to take a lot of effort if that takes you know people who are members of the Mississippi talk to\nYou can make a key

even some of those last words that uh the senator shared\nAbout not mean believe that's a really large thing and\nFrom what I read and what we hear a this is one of the big reasons why people don't disclose a what a to hear your thoughts on just what I'm I'm is going on in the person who is you know a survivor and and they're feeling if I speak\nNo one is going to believe me or talk to more um go have when\n[noise] yeah um well I I think that\nIt's just what we what we have seen 'em really\nPay that extra very well that no matter who the person is um whether what their races um their age I think coming out and and speaking out is such a hard hard thing to do because\nFor whatever reason and maybe it's\nThat their value is the worst of of when and when they speak but they just are not elite over and over and over again we see that victims survivors when they come out at them that at the focus is on its its questioning you know why\nWhy were you in that situation what were you wearing what did you do to cause the situation there are a lot of it is I Am victim blaming and then\nAnd then just not understanding how that situation could have happened\nAnd so they are not believe and I think time and time again we see that in our communities we see on the the victims are are just um pushed aside that they that they are not believed\nThat that um\nThat they're you know there is there's this this this feeling of of I I I don't know what it is it's just not not believing what they're saying um but I think it's such it's such a it just goes back to\nWhat the um what what you want to believe and and what we what we see within our communities\nUm but yeah I I think it's something that um it's something that just happens within our communities over and over in I'm Sorry I\n\n\n[laughter]\n\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\nIn light of national conversations about sexual assault more talking about reporting and not reporting sexual assault going

need someone to talk to a here are some numbers to life lines that are available the natural national sexual assault hotline is one eight hundred six six for six seven\nThree which is also a hundred six five six oh also the strong hurts me to help line is one aid for four or five and six to eight for eight\nThree or four four seven media here with us today from chemical Oklahoma is Rebecca Nagl she's a writer and advocate and she was a citizen of the Cherokee Nation I'm Rebecca you're sharing your thoughts are before the break in just want to give you a moment to go ahead and incomplete you thought\nSure I'm saying I think because I'm a native people we use their actions is not just reflecting on us in our own character but also our families and our community\nThat especially with a small community for every one family knows each other it can be harder to come forward as a survivor and I think that an extra burden natives survivors have\n'em and just to conclude that um\nYou know for any survivor his both thing you know it's not your fault and it's not your burden or you're showing to carry and I hope that we can all work together to create communities where as a community we carry that burden on instead of placing it on the individual\nAnd it's interesting to see that too you know creating mixing space in something that I have seen a in reaction to news headlines and things going on in the media or people simply putting themselves forward and saying if you need someone to talk to I'm here or this is a reminder\nI'm I'm a part of your support system and just kind of openly putting you out there for anybody in need and maybe that's how you took an approach to this do you want to tell us why you did that you can call in to one eight hundred\nNinety six to eight

back to naval station Norfolk the problems with people getting to work on that naval station how to do not with the military site but with infrastructure outside of\nThe military base so there's been
