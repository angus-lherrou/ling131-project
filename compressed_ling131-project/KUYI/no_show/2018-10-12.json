but um you know what do you think about something like that happening in your own community print you outline sugar in this way I go ahead Dr\n... so so so that's a\nTremendous news to me um I supposed to do is consistent with what has happened in other communities I knew for example in New York City they reduce the size of a sodas that could be offered there's also talk of having a sugar tax\nOn food for me I think that you do the best way to kind of make sure our children are eating well as to eat well ourselves you know to have a meals prepared for kids and\nTo kind of observed limits in in what they can eat and kind of continue to raise them in ways that's consistent with healthy eating and it's not made any easier by town truculent and other things\nAnd Kim as a dietitian

encourage\nJust a little I'm saying is\nShe each or fruit don't drink it and for her to eat the the whole for it because it's higher fibre and the amount of sugar in it is less because it takes three to four orange is their apples to make a cut the Jews and how you're getting a lot of extra sugar the other thing is that they go ... and\nThe unlimited amounts have sugars we drink many people are getting as much sugar in one week and they did and an entire year ah we used to teach classes on the historical intake of sugar\nIt is to each or fruit don't drink it and for her to eat the the whole\nFruit because it's higher and fiber and the amount of sugar in it is less because it takes three to four orange is their apples to make a cup and Jews and so you're getting a lot of extra sugar the other thing is that they go ... and\nThe unlimited amounts of sugars we drink\nMany people are getting as much sugar in one week if they did and an entire year ah we used to teach classes on the historical intake of sugar and looking back a hundred two hundred years ago the sugar we got was from\nFruit when it was in season sometimes a little bit of honey but through the process thing we have a lot more sugar available and so we just try to raise awareness\nAnd set good examples and\nTry to limit that amount of added sugars sweet and fruit juices sodas sunny delight things like that\nAll

day over thirty eight\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI think that's a great question and it's a question that we often have to deal with when managing patients that have chronic kidney disease or not and that's how to manage the aches and pains of daily life how to make sure that you're able to do the things you want to do while still being safe for your heart and your kidneys\nI'd say often when I see patients who tend to have chronic kidney disease I Would advocate for you know Tylenol and the usual doses as long as that didn't interact with any of their other other medication\nIf Tylenol herself isn't really enough uh to to manage the joint pain or whatever pains are having ibuprofen or\nCould be a reasonable alternative as long as it's kind of okay by your physician sometimes when you have diabetes or chronic kidney disease you tend to be on a number of medication for example the average number medications or dolphins patient takes us Thirteen\nThirteen different pills and\nYou know over you know and people have diabetes and\nHigh blood pressure can also end up on a lot of POWs so we you know when you're using either talent or ibuprofen it's important to kind of check it out with your position just to make sure that there is no drug drug interaction um you know if you're given a okay by your position and you're taking it to improve what you're able to do\nAnd that's important to you than it might be a reasonable thing to do\nAll right Morris thank you for your call we're going to go now to Pine Ridge in South Dakota and see who would Sam listening in on camera I

what I was sort of is or what it does and how how they can help a supportive because I'm\nGoing on a second here uh when I first was diagnosed and went to a dial up for this I was scared\nI was scared and I wasn't really sure what what was going to happen I wasn't informed and also like\nOh we need us for part group to a meter your house for a walk through there so they don't just go into a\nHouse as a unit and I\nThink when all what's gonna happen and you know kind of scary 'cause you know we don't we're not really sure what's going to happen but yeah it's pretty good to have a community support a family and friends and a lot to check to check on the outs with patients\nAnd even just being able to compare things or bones things also somebody who maybe has been on it longer and Cheryl I really appreciate you sharing your story and even just talking about you know how it was at first in a really great to to hear that you have\nAlso a scene the importance of having that support from friends and family Cheryl thank you for giving us a ring we appreciate your story or we're going to take another call we're going to say Hi to seen it in Newtown North Dakota\nTuned in on ... senior thank you for giving us a ring your honor\nOh hi yeah I've known people that were on dialysis but they've passed the way the longest I heard of anyone living on dialysis for Twenty years and here is to be that the people would have to go to\nThe mark or will stay\nAnd um\nIt didn't mention that diabetes can be heredity and not necessarily all die\nYes that that's those are great points to bring up to ... see now is there something that has changed that the people don't have to make that long distance anymore\nI truly great they have their little van and\nAnd they just go to the local communities they have to travel only fifty years thirty miles that's Alice\n... and that's really really hard in yeah I can see why some tribes are saying hey we need something close here we need something that maybe I'm worried minister green thank you for that you know and a doctor in return to you anything for callers\nI I think that uh I'd like to talk briefly about shows comments as well I think that um for\nMe it's important to realize that it is a very scary thing to have to start dial says now have to change your life and many influence the lives of those\nThat care about you I think her point about long on family and friends is very important and which one thing I really liked about working in the dialysis unit is that you develop a partnership and a team with\nBoth the patient the nurse\nIs a social worker the nutritionist and the technician so it's a whole group of people working together to maintain your health and that's one real strengths of the kind of the program for dials says I also think that while\nWith the caller from North Dakota while a thirty to fifty mile trip is a lot less than they previously need to make is still a lot and\nThat's a added on to the three or four hours that they're on treatment and you know we need to kind of recognize that some folks that are doing ... really are working for three days a week just to uh\nYou know kind of maintain themselves through dial says the point that a diabetes is read it or is also a very valid one that there's a hereditary component as well as an environmental component\nAnd so even understanding what a loved one who's going to me\nYou know down the road be something that you really have been paying attention or or song they were managing it or even just mean I'm a loved one down the road um in helping maybe even your partner a doctor I Know I mentioned before the break what if you skip an appointment what happens um what happens then\n... says the point that a diabetes is read it or is also a very valid one that there's a hereditary component as well as an environmental components\nAnd so even understanding what a loved one who's going to mean\nYou know down the road be something that you really have to be paying attention or or saw they were managing it or even just mean I'm a loved one down the road um in helping me name and your partner a doctor unreal I mentioned before the break what if you skip an appointment what happens\nUm what happens then or you know what does it do to your schedule go ahead\nWhat is it to you know when people skip it probably causes by heart does get the ... the uh golfers treatments you know our three times a week that is a a a ton of by a ease of practice\nFor the system as much as for the patients I the the dialysis treatments are replacing your kidney function or by doing three or four hours\nEvery couple of days versus your kidney that works twenty four seven\nSo when you skip the treatment it means you could go as long as five days in between treatments so usually I Would ask patients not to skip or if they do need to miss a treatment a lot of times the dialysis units will have the flexibility to schedule them or at least try to schedule them at another time\nAnd then something that's important to know is that you can travel when you're on\nDialysis as well so that if you're going to visit friends or family or you can set it up ahead of time so that you can still get your treatment and and so see your friends and family\nOr a green advice hate commerce thank you very much too and if you find this program in our podcast on our website or you can also leave your thoughts on our website native America\nCone dot com or you can even tweets them to us Facebook Instagram however you do your social media or you can share we appreciate any time you do and\nGive us a little more insight into how this affects you in your tribal community um and Kim my turn to you as a nutritionist um we see the role\nOf the advice and information you have in all of this and we've got a couple of minutes before we're wrapping things up here but you know what are some of the vital things you'd really like to tell dialysis patients especially about nutrition\nOkay thank you well I Know we focus on foods we can't eat and I'm In a briefly go through that list but we also can eat a lot of foods on dialysis and that's where if you work with your dietitian she can help you come up with a list of those foods and incorporate them into some recipes\nSo when you were on dialysis you need to avoid alcohol you you'll probably need to limit your fluid and along with that is limiting sodium or salt which causes us to retain fluid and that's found in as many processed foods as in the salt shaker on the table\nAlso potassium is another mineral that we need to limit and that's found in a lot of fruits and vegetables\nAmerica calling from the national Albuquerque\nOne project liberation the native non

changed\nI Know where people are coming from I feel the same way but what\nI learned when I was living through these disasters and especially the experience in Haiti is that to be perfectly honest is not about us and it's much more important that people who actually live in these places where the survivors\nThemselves who society cultures these are are taking the lead in their own rescue and their own recovery and people are kind of scrambling and\nPart of the scrambling in trying to figure out who's in charge and who has the power and that's something that the people who aren't experience with

beginning [noise]\nMy last question is you know you wrote a whole book about the whole Haiti experience and and the role of foreign aid what were your biggest takeaways from that experience one of the lessons learned and to what degree are they being applied now I think the biggest thing\nIs that I I think there was a sense from a lot of people in the world that Haitians were bystanders in their own disaster\nAnd actually being there and seeing the way that people came together and then ultimately took charge of their own rebuilding in their own reconstruction really showed me the way in which that completely backwards the best thing that foreigners can do is uh people in their own efforts\nAnd they kind of get out of the way and I think one of the most important things that we can do

S. government sets a minimum\nPrice for milk and provide some subsidies us also has its own high tariffs on certain dairy products or cream for instance it's I think it's\nI don't know exactly it's like grandma Lloyd the c._e._o. of the dairy farmers of Ontario couldn't put his finger on the exact amount the U.S sour cream tariff is one hundred and eighty seven percent and Lloyd says there are a lot of other us tariffs on other cheeses and I have like fifty percent terrorists\nLloyd says this whole milk spat with Canada it's just politics\nWisconsin being a significant important states the Republicans I knew when he was the speaker Ryan and it was a state that carry Trump became a political lightning rod and that is what started the whole\nProcess back on the farm fill up arms says the new NAFTA agreement to address the fundamental problem American farmers are producing too much milk and Armstrong believes opening a little bit more of Canada will make a dent in that\nFeel I feel for the dairy farmer in the United states is ... what was happening to her a fear but it has no impact on their you know on their wellbeing it all\nAgain plenty of Wisconsin in New York farm or see things differently they're glad to have more access to a Canadian\nMarkets still there's an ironic twist here many American dairy farmers in organizations are actually now looking into a reply management system of their own\nSimilar to Canada's for the world Jason Margolis salad on Ontario\nI'm this week we've been obsessed with what could be a murder story the victim journalists on October second Jamal can show he entered the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul and it's not been seen since we're not the only ones obsessed\nInside Saudi Arabia and outside I think we're all trying to figure out what has happened to have a hot a hot ... is a Saudi journalist and filmmaker who made a documentary critical of Saudi Arabia she also new Jamal ...

experienced an unknown failure during lunch\nAnd the Kagan Alexi of chin and landed safely in Kazakhstan lessen our leader the cause of the border to launch is being looked into and our concerns about how the incident may affect operations on the international space station\nLauren ... is a reporter for the verge she covers space learn walk us through what happened yesterday after the lawyers rocket launch\nSo everything started off completely normal they took off from the block and your calls me drown in Kazakhstan at four forty am eastern time and then about two and a half minutes into slight\nWe got an education that something had gone wrong with the booster and if you're watching a live stream you could see that they were joking about kind of violently and there was some kind of break up\nIn flight and that initiated the emergency airport sequence and the capital that they were writing on pro forma what's known as the\n... century and that's when you come in at much steeper angle when you land on earth so I think they experienced nearly seven jeeze which are seven times or Saturday So pretty intense flight but they landed safely and they were able to be reunited with their families and\nUltimately it was a good and happy ending\nSo how high were they when they had to start their land and I believe they're about thirty miles up so they weren't quite in space that but they were almost there\nThe astronaut noted that the experience to nominate weightlessness which I'm not supposed to be failing at that part of the flight and I think that had to deal with the fact that there were no longer wanted with the bitter and then at that point they start spending and unless the grand jury and then the parachutes deployed to slow them down to that they could land safely\nThey're not spending as they're racing to the earth fine yeah they are [laughter] God I've done what is known as the ...\nThat's when you feel weightlessness for a moment to try and and during the ... experience extra fees and it feels like something is pressing down on you like a mattress I didn't experience nearly the level that they did but just imagine kind of feeling like you're pressed up against something you're ill so much heavier that's what they were feeling and it can be pretty intense\n[noise] are there any new details about what might have caused this problem I don't know if they traced\nThe exact origin but I Believe something happened during the stage separation so when rockets launched pieces of hardware shed a way to save on weight and the ... has four main boosters around the center core and they were supposed to break away but\nRussia I think that maybe there was some contact between one of the boosters and us and our core will when really there was a separate completely this was the sixty ... of this particular players rocket so it's been around for decades [laughter]\nI don't know if they know what caused that contact\nBut I think that's the leading theory at the moment\n[noise] now the U.S and Russia they're frequently at odds especially these days when it comes to politics but they cooperate frequently when it comes to space flight wires that\nNASA has been kind of shiny beacon of hope in our relations with Russia and I think it's just because when it comes to space we cannot let geopolitics enter now I'd definitely creeps into other aspects\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine that kind of sparked a debate about whether or not the military should use Russian\nRocket technology to launch satellites into space so it has had an impact on other parts of our states infrastructure but when it comes to NASA we just can't let those things get and the way we need then at the moment because\nThe soy is is the only way to get humans the international space station so we have to continue cooperating and hopefully not that Russia will lead to a politics and the way that\nIs significant setback for the international space station I Would say\nIt's definitely concerning about the station teacher we currently have three astronauts into orbit on the station and they are going to have to come home eventually they got up there and it's way as as well and the phrase hospitals can't last forever and or but they have a two hundred or the whole day lifetime\nAnd we're about a hundred and thirty days into that\nSo they're slated to come down in December they could probably stretch that January but not very long so either they're going to have to come down to you know or Russia could possibly launch an empty raise capital and send that up to the station and give them an extra two hundred days to stay on board\nBut that hasn't been determined yet we don't know if that's actually going to happen\nIt just depends on what the
