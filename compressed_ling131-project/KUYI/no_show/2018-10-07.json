ten days that I'm you came together and collected almost Fifteen thousand words and you were mentioning I'm\nOne of The Elders ah was saying that he was using words that he hadn't used a in a very long time please continue\n[noise] well we were I'm able to have you know topics that evolved memories from long ago when Congress Asians that they had had their parents their grandparents a local story tellers or even folks in the community gatherings and\nSome of The Elders were saying well I went home and I was visiting with my wife for talking with my brother and we remembered all these other ... other words that would pertain to those topics so it was like opening chapters that probably had been\nYou know maybe close for a while I'm with the discoveries went on a we found that there were a number of young people really really a U.S a surprising number of young people who had been raised\nBy their grandparents and of course we know who these people are but how much crow do they know\nWell it turns out we call these are folks are college for a bit of children raised my grand grand mother grandparents that we have so many young or you might say\nFountains and knowledge who have an amazing a grasp of the whole language and we're um so The Elders were able to recognize and I and some of The Elders were saying to me these young people know so much\nWell you know when they were raised by their grandparents knowledge skips a generation of may move them closer to that\nThat time when probably our community was a it using solely the\nCrow language for all communications um and you know we've never had a chance to say well let's assess how much we know it was individuals the crows crows people don't go in and take a test and now and get to know what they're what the depth and breadth of their vocabulary is\nAnd so individual came in like after the session they come in and said to me you know something there's a new words I've never heard before but there's some of these topics I just know so much and I didn't realize how much I Know that I can share\nAnd the value of it the treasurer of it that was the astounding I think measure across the board and the people that were in the sessions just came to realize I Know so much I Know this and now the the sort of mentioned the depth and breadth of what they they could contribute\nAnd you know a lot of our elders have retired from\nThere or whatever their careers were and uh the potential of their contribution in this initiative goes well beyond our first Eighteen hundred topics we expect in the next year to have one or at least one more rapid word collection initiative\nThat will take another Eighteen hundred topics\nIn our living language and we're ... we're just really excited to see how that that goes\n[noise] well I Want to talk to you more about that this is such a fascinating topic to put a dictionary together of 'em are\nIndigenous languages and to have the opportunity to have an elder sit together and uh experience that that's so cool and what do you think about it give us a call the number is one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for eight that's what's a one eight

do All right thanks so much for all of you joining us today um I mean I Would start with you um it tell us about the dictionary that that's a you have for the Mississippi ban of Choctaw\nA low right now what we have is the teaching dictionaries that we um put out in two thousand fourteen it's considered a child version and it has sixteen hundred words\nThe reason that we wanted to publish a dictionary was because we um we're gonna be teaching that chocolate language in the schools for thirty minutes every single day\nAnd for people who haven't had a you know a lot of conversations in Choctaw with little kids and it was like a daunting task so we gave them a dictionary that\nWell hopefully help them you know I'm a lady simplify the language a little bit for the little kids because our kids are growing up not speaking Choctaw and um it's not natural for a um speaker to\nAh you know be patient and um\nCome up with the word does it'd be like well you know to\nSimplify for a little bitty kid yeah non speakers\n[laughter] that's great and and did you what did you hear from the teachers about using this this tool\nWell I think it was helpful because I'm\nThe dictionary that they have access to is the vital tend to one and\nUm it's really um it's really thick dictionary and it's got a lot of obviously words and\nI'm the entries are really mom\nI feel like the simplicity of the teaching dictionary has been really helpful to them and we also gave them access to it um PBS documents so they have it on their phones and they can search for things like you know if they want to say butterfly um especially what the spelling\nSize they know how to say hush hush the politic but they don't know how to spell it they can look it up on their own lives are in the I'm teaching the canary book\nJason I understand you guys went recently to a conference and learn a little bit more about putting together dictionaries tell us about that\n[noise] Oh yes ma'am we had been collaborating with some linguists over the years they had helped us document the Mississippi chalked home language\nAnd I'm just turned out that I'm Wondering ... Dr Aaron Broadwell who has completed a grammar on the Choctaw language\nOr he recently moved to the University of Florida um as a professor over there and was hosting the cold laying conference which is an opportunity for linguists and indigenous language\nAll activist and scholars and and people like us to get together and to work on different projects and they created a special a mini practical them where we were able to bring our project and get some support from student linguists and other professors\nOr for two weeks and I was really helpful a program that was back in June of this year\nHow it is I'm a Mississippi Choctaw different from Oklahoma Choctaw\n[laughter] well ah as you stated I Am in Oklahoma Choctaw although I didn't grow up in Oklahoma\nUm where I came from I didn't have access to the language because it wasn't passed on to my father and so when I decided I wanted to learn Choctaw I knew that the Mississippi Choctaw language was a little more alive and so I decided to move to Mississippi and\nFor the code of western court\nDot com [noise]\n\nUm [noise]\nThe call [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] um [noise] [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise] you are listening to Native American calling Mrs Monica bringing\nI'm sitting in for a parakeet would and we want to welcome a new station K. I.\nT. I. is a brand new station from you will be South Dakota it's owned by the shining rivers to try and they're airing a native America calling for the first time today hello and welcome to K. I. P. I\nThank you so much for carrying our\nShow we really appreciate it we're talking native language dictionaries today if you want to get in on the conversation there still time the number is one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for eight that's ... hundred nine nine native\nAround a TBI is with us She's with Chuck Todd language curriculum coordinator for the Mississippi band of Choctaw Indians and um we were talking with Janine before the break about um ...\nDifferent ways to approach a teaching the language was apps and a new variety of things um how how do you guys decided or you're going to approach you know building a new dictionary when you do something like the rapid word collection\nWell right now I Believe we're just using that data bases that we have um you know somewhere it's from the bind to the dictionary and I'm Aaron ... from the eighties and I'm constantly have the language development meetings which we just got out of\nA you know every time we hear a new word I Try to see like Jason and\nHe puts it into the data and that's basically I think how it's progressing we have a ton of example of phrases ... samples sentences that were written down I'm In the last Fifteen or Twenty years that we're going through and\nI'm looking at a lot of them and I'm like oh is this ... this is a dictionary and especially when I'm trying to you know correct or not correct but like\n... um I find out that I Love these might not be in the database so\nThat's basically how it's growing\nAll right and do you mean um when you did the the rapid word collection was there any time when there was maybe some disputes about a certain word or I mean you know maybe not like outright fighting among each other but you know differences of opinion\nDefinitely variations of words and how they're pronounced our language is very descriptive and we were involving people from six districts we have three bands of the ... of the ... people\nAnd so we found that um people and we generally are people know that there are differences in the fans and also even some familial or even localized differences\nAre we found that there are families and a localized groups that have named every technology that's come along\nAnd there are others that didn't do that and so um you know if we were originally thinking well maybe we'd have to be investing where it's we haven't had to but the discovery is it among our people there's variation and we welcome that a discussion\nAnd it got rather lively some of them were saying well this is the way my great grandfather's set it I was a little kid at his feet at the sweat lodge and I heard him say it this way\nAnd someone from prior which is eighty five miles away said well this is the way it was said by and so on like that and they talked about it so but what the what the process allows it and welcomes actually\nIs to have that variation those don't have to counsel one another out they are included and that you know the difference may be a slight variation in the word itself but we want all of that in there because we want to have\nA a dictionary that represents the living language and it's so important to do that when you start restricting my sister is this is the way this word as sad as opposed to this well you know you take the the very vitality out of the language and\nThere's reasons for those differences and they talk about that in the sessions you heard the verbal the discussions that went on and and uh they got really quite lively and sometimes very hilarious and sometimes\nActually emotional and the sense that there were things that hadn't remembered and the reference to the people from there you know back generations\nUm stories that had been told of even warrior experiences and battles and all of that came through and so we're um it's it's the whole gamut I guess you might say of reactions but just\nBecause one person says it this way and another says it this way doesn't mean that they eclipse one another no and um but they need to agree also on how it's spelled\nLet's listen to it and how is it spelled and they each each of the groups had to appoint among there among the five of them someone that was actually writing down the words and with the proper accents and all of that so these folks\nAre all literate in the language is well we really have a wealth of speakers you know we've got twenty five hundred very fluent crow speakers\nAt least that count actually maybe somewhat ... alone because that comes from the census and you know do people identify themselves or ... when the census taker comes around but\nWe have a wealth of information and knowledge and where to perfect a really moment of like you might say it's a pivotal moment for us to be able to collect our language in this way and the dictionary then becomes a major learning\nWe really have a wealth of speakers you know we've got twenty five hundred very fluent crow speakers\nAt least that count actually maybe somewhat ... alone because that comes from the census\nAnd you know do people identify themselves or ... when the census taker comes around but we have a wealth of information and knowledge and we're at a perfect I'm really moment of like you might say it's a pivotal moment for us to be able to collect our language in this way\nAnd the dictionary then becomes a major learning tool and wherever these learners are and we're hoping they're everywhere but we of course are very interested in our youngest learners\nHow do you feel about um non native or non crows using a dictionary using the work that you raised in a to learn the language themselves\nYou know from the beginning we are just very interested\nIn having every learner anywhere\nWho wants to learn the language or a small group of speakers were small tribe there's Thirteen thousand members of our tribe and probably another five thousand descendants this is the location of the of solitaire if he's all this is it a our audience isn't something that's going to go worldwide\nUm that there are people here in there who are interested in the crow language and all of our apps are free um our books are online can be purchased by anyone\nAnd when we have our summer Institute for language learning we have an intense a cruel language learning for beginners anyone can earn rural were very anxious to have anyone who's interested in and I'm not the market isn't huge\nBut we're not interested in being restrictive at all\n... ... interesting I mean I Know what about you how do you feel about um outsider who's in the Mississippi Choctaw\n[noise] um well I don't think there's as much interest as some people might think like you know there's not going to be a ... million people coming in and\nTaking the dictionary and learning the chocolate language but I'm ... ... ... we saw in a life so much interest from the linguistic community and um I think it's good that they have interest in hospital because\nLike me personally I don't understand like every grammar rules\nAnd there's someone else can explain it to me who looked at the dictionary like I'm all for 'em you know whatever\nHelps our language at this point because we don't want to you know my generation and a twenty to thirty year olds to die in Seventy years and take the language with us and all we leave is you know the written word and\nUm I'd rather be able to have it explained to me and then I can explain that someone else can we create speakers yeah and that's going to take a lot of effort if that takes you know people who are members of the Mississippi talk to 'em that's great and whatever like I said whatever helps\nSeason about how many uh fluent speakers are there\n[noise] um I Believe there's somewhere between three and seven

I'm Out of northern Arizona university dental hygiene department I'm tired and some of the ... I have a bachelor's of science and community health I'm from northern Arizona university excellent thank you so much\nTo both of you for joining me I'm curious for each of you um how is it that you ended up working on oil help specifically what is your\nStory and where to enter come from well I started\nWhen I was in high school there was a cooperative education program in which students were able to spend half of the day in an office and half of the day I'm doing class work and I was first ah placed in an office that had a real estate that sold real estate and that was not a good match for\nMe I didn't enjoy the work and was not very happy and my teacher could see that so he found another office and it happened to be with an oral\nSurgeon and I was the person that did all the errands and cleaned up all the instruments and those things in the office and I absolutely loved it um I was fortunate enough that throughout my dental hygiene education I was able to work in the same office\nAnd it encouraged me to be able to reach out to people and see that I had something to give to them to help them better there or oh how wonderful\nAnd how about you or is that what was your journey to become involved with oral health\nSo I have two children a six month old and a two year old and I'm prior to this I was in cancer prevention\nAnd then a home visit chair for on children zero through five and I um worked out here on the community and I really um\nAll the different health disparities that we face in our own house with one of the ones that come up and I know that that's a big push for the try a health initiatives so when this opportunity popped up to where\nBack at the university and oral hygiene I was I Can't I Will do it and um I think it's important for us especially um I saw these because our dental curious rate is four times um\nHigher than the normal um the average people so that was kind of my push for this wow four times higher than the general population um so now I'm really happy to have\nBoth of you here to share some of your knowledge with our listeners about oral health because I think if I'm a part of our body that we're not always as attentive to as we should be so what is oral how so how its mouth\nFree from tooth decay which is a chronic preventable disease gum disease and oral source including oral cancers so we're going to be talking a lot about your gums your lips scare me your mouth the Mont and your teeth all your thumb\nUs we want to help to keep them nice and healthy so that won't be focusing on today [noise]\nAnd then a doctor how what are some common oral diseases\nThat uh we should be aware of\nToday we're going to talk about three common oral disease that sets tooth decay gum disease and oral\nCancer so took the case is caused by the bad bacteria in our\nMouth by eating the sugars that we eat so there's good bacteria and our mouth and there's bad bacteria some people have more good bacteria than they do bad bacteria and some people have more bad bacteria than they do good if we have too much bad bacteria and we eat a lot of foods\nCarbohydrates in particular that has sugar the bad bacteria\nBreak that down and cause tooth decay the second a common oral diseases gum disease and there's two different types of gum disease there's ginger bite us in ... Titus ginger bite is is inflammation of the gum that's when the guns get red and\nThe war and angry and infected and then the next one is a true done Titus\nAnd that's when the infection spreads and gets into the supporting structures around the ... like the bones and the ligament and those kinds of things and actually can progress to\nThe point that our teeth fall out\nThe third kind of oral disease that we have is oral cancer and there are things that we can do to prevent oral cancer although it's not like ginger by this and I'm ... and tooth decay which are completely preventable oral cancer can be caused by things\nLike smoking tobacco drinking alcohol we can also reduce um some of the other bad habits but we have like picking at our gum tissue one other\nThing that is really important that we can do is if we're of adolescent age we can have the human papillomavirus\nVaccines and the ages to start for the H ... vaccine or eleven twelve years with age and up to Twenty one for\nOr don't tied to a tooth decay which are completely preventable oral cancer can be caused by things like smoking tobacco drinking alcohol we can also reduce um some of the other bad habits but we have like picking at our gum tissue one other thing that is really important that\nWe can do is if we're of adolescent age we can have the human papillomavirus vaccines and the ages to\nStart for the H ... vaccine or eleven twelve years with age and up to Twenty one for boys and up to twenty six for girls so parents out there the H. P. V. vaccine is really important in preventing cervical cancer as well as oral cancers\nWow I didn't know that the H. P. V. vaccine which is a cancer preventing vaccine actually helps prevent um oral cancer to 'em so was project zero I Know that a lot of the focus is on pregnant women so um what are some comment oil problem um that pregnant women face\nSo that we have a three different oral problems that pregnant women face the first one is to decay which I'm Dr Helms talked about a little bit sick when the gum disease which is also\nDivided and hurry and dumb Titus the third one is a non cancerous or grows um including ... granted brand new Loma am and that's basically when it's caused by a homeowner changed and the bacteria okay and so it sounds like\nPregnant women can kind of get the same dental problems that anyone can get 'em why is it particularly important for pregnant women um to um be concerned with oral health\nSo gum disease has been associated with preterm labor and that's because there's a hormone that I'm pregnant women have that comes off the ground in which increases\nAnd you're not drink or any um see anything\nAfter we brush our teeth that's another good point so if we brush our teeth and baby wants to eat something at a time I want to see something we want to re brush their teeth again before they go to sleep for the night when you want to read do 'em and have no ... or bottle after the age of ... [noise]\nWe also want children to visit the dentist before the age of one [noise] we don't want to put any honey and types of fires we hear that on something like my mom would do on my grandmother would do in their time is\nTiny and they said the fire and we definitely don't want to do that [noise] and we want it clean the pacifier with water warm water and washing just like how we would do wash a bottle we don't want to clean\nUp a pacifier with a baby's mom smells like sometimes the jumps on the far oh we'll just put it in their mouth and um give it back to baby but that\nIs where the bacteria transfers from mom to baby so we don't want that to happen they also have these cool little pacifier whites that we can buy like at Wal Mart but um we can carry around and watch them off with [noise] and with when we brush our our toddlers teach we want to be ... and you shift a\nLittle green space amount of toothpaste on there for a baby and then ... if they're able to ... we can use that piece ice amount of\nSpace and same with adults that we don't want to over used to feed and that's I think something as a as a new mom I was putting a bunch of toothpaste on there until I realized oh my gosh I'm giving my baby too much and\nUm this is a question that I'm just curious about um how do you know when a child has so it's just those two front teeth um so we're supposed to\nStart brushing do we also brush the gum or just those two little ... well if you're brushing correctly you can actually brushed their teeth and the gums at the same time so when we first we recommend that you take the angle of the toothbrush\nIt about a forty five degree angle so we're getting actually in between the gum tissue and the tooth itself and we do little tiny circles and that'll help clean the baby's both\nThe guns and the teeth at the same time so we don't need to separately brush the gum tissue okay how about um if\nThe rest of the guns don't have any teeth on them should we be brushing Moser leave those alone we could use a ... again like we do a child without any teeth just don't warm damp washed costs just rub their tea especially if they're starting to think that warm rubbing motion feels really good to a baby you seemed just relax a little\nBit so and again it gets them used to fingers in the mouth gets them used to a toothbrush so we want to have that gum tissue stimulated\nTo for the fact of getting used to it excellent parts of the mouse that are just gums no teeth yet clean those with a warm damp um wash class and then when the teeth come in rush both\nIt'd be brushing Moser leave those alone we could use a damp washed cloth again like we do a child without any ... warm damp washed costs just rubbed their teeth especially if they're starting to think that warm rubbing motion feels really good to a baby you seemed just relax\nA little bit so and again it gets them used to fingers in the mouth gets me is to a toothbrush so we want to have that gum tissue stimulated\nFor for the fact of getting used to it excellent so parts of the mouse that are just gums no teeth yet clean those with a warm damp wash class and then when the teeth come in fresh both\nTeeth and the gums adjacent to the teeth with a toothbrush correct tirade\nI think I got it from my house at the dollar store and they have the squirrels fingers I'm cleaning\n... like I said they have they stopped for those on there and we used for babies too so it just goes right over your finger and you just touch the baby's comes with that too so that's another way to clean excellence\nAnd then um I think it's really important to point out the snacks\nChoices is really important and so senior not how to cut the um the vegetables and defined shape so they're exciting to eat um cheese and that's where a good alternative that don't have quite so much carbohydrates that are going to sit on the teeth and cause\nCavities excellence and so as we wrap up here in our last couple of minutes I wanted to ask a little bit more about um project zero women infants um what is this project and um what is this mission why is it called project zero I'm and how can listeners find out more about it\nSo we are called project zero limits and infants because the goal is to have zero cavity that's science hero is in there on our mission is to expand\nOpportunities for access to direct our own health services increase delivery of ... practices for our own health care and enhance the white dinosaurs [noise] our girls for P. C. W. I.

me so that's not a replacement are going to the dentist but it is an important component for reducing cavities um so that's the way that we're working together [noise]\nUm so I think that that's the end of our program are there any last thoughts are either if you want to share\nSo we can never um get too much for and minors so if your child can get a ... and the clinic and essays that community

a back on\nA obviously tend to go to rich in translation to hoping Kenya [noise] yeah and the purpose behind that was during a promote a\nGenuine in a different perspective knew about the Gulf Oil in

there yeah that's right the last year I didn't know right right in the area now or the\nUh he can never can areas in an area and so and then it also goes at a conference were Colorado\nColorado now but the idea that was to promote that we were uh somehow or prevent uh escalate the developed and um\nOther tribes not no significance of Grand Canyon or to your coffee or we sit there and so the

in the first one and a little girl and this is something that a historic we're hoping we're say\nAnd so we recorded that they're a it was kind of unusual because um we could do it during the daytime or yeah cause of all the people going in there so we went in there at seven o'clock at night uh-huh we recorded until like three thirty four o'clock in the morning or larger all night in there and\nSo if you listen to the you should be able to purchase CDs or lying\nOn a ... a [noise] Amazon and I to run but you can um you'll listen to it and the natural uh acoustics of the ... and especially on

the playing of instruments and also the point that they selected new special uh\nPhotos but they have must have been in a collection of the heat so that is out there but you know that was my purpose
