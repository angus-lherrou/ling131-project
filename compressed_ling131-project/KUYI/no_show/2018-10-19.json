um I think all of the books that I've read um it's kind of like a personal hobby of mine ... personal finance books and the un always there will always say you could talk all these complex languages the end of words and formulas but it's just\nSpend less money than you make and that's what I practice\nIn college so I didn't try to go over and above like I Would have to I Would attend like extra

real basics of a budget you know we've mentioned apps we've mentioned other kinds of things [noise] anything else you want to add\nAbout ... you know really just the basics of a budget\n[noise] um [noise] I Would like to echo Audis comments to keep it as simple as possible you know there are a lot of really fantastic technology tools apps and spreadsheets and whatnot but\nAnd like to echo had his comments to keep it as simple as possible you know there are a lot of really fantastic technology tools apps and spreadsheets and whatnot but\nWhatever works best for an individual I think is ideal and I tell you a little story I first started using budgets\nBack a few years out of college I was working in Albuquerque is a pizza drivers and every night I Would keep track of how much I made and chips and I would write that I'm Out on a calendar and also when I got paid every two weeks I'd write that amount as well and I've got an older sister and one day she came over to my apartment\nAnd she saw that challenge or on the wall she said hey Sean hold on you you need to get up to age or you can put to solve a spreadsheet it'd be really quick crunch all kinds of ...\nI was like no no no no no this works for me calendar with a pin every night I add up my money works perfect I'm not going to change it and it worked for me for years and the eventually in later years I did start using spreadsheets and excel and I think those are wonderful tools but again I keep it simple something that you can\nYou just developed at positive behavior something that you're used to be able to stick with if it's too complicated are too many steps involved you're going to get discouraged you're not going to keep doing it\nYeah absolutely I think I like the idea of that visual representation of like this is how much money I earned this night and you can see the whole month that's pretty cool um we're talking about budget today\nGive us a call the number one eight hundred nine nine six to eight separate Denise as in Taos New Mexico hey they're Denise what would you like to share in the morning for taking\nMy call now [laughter] um I just wanted to add that um I helped\nMy daughter with her budget she she has the same\nIssue in her life and we have found that I'm just being held accountable has someone you trust and there's not going to be judgmental to kind\nOf check in with you at the end of each week and just say so how's it going where are we with the budget you know well what did you did you have to spend anything extra did you go crazy [laughter] you know and just kinda it it helps it seems to help her a lot she's really made sound good improvements when we do that so\nThat that's just another tool maybe others can use to if you have somebody you can trust\nDenise are you the person I'm so you said you're the person who helps her how old is your daughter\nOh\nHe's thirty eight [laughter]\nYou know what this is this is a skill that you can build over your entire life you know it's not something that you just read one book and then suddenly a everything you know everything about it I'm Denise thanks so much for giving us a call from house we really appreciate it and Madonna what do you think how long have you been working on\nUm budgeting and understanding this stuff\nWell I started with that being serious about the budget and twenty well when I started and I buy the book and I agree with that many on in the years there's at their bed sheets\nBut what a worked well for me the bad place to claim notebook and keeping track every single night I in a tiny twelve and right now I had I had the feel of it but it's been new\n... every single month and the way that it was um listening to talk radio and hearing on different financial people talking and I actually thought I was doing pretty well in twenty tall I 'cause I had a good job I\nWas making minimum payments but I Would still like that and that came when I was in college\nAnd so I didn't have any savings I Would have an emergency on and I had nothing for retirement at that time uh that was the lights\nTake take get everything on paper and they get organized to start thinking we're spending he liked to cut back and where I can get saving so yeah I was from twenty twelve on and I agree like what works for you that way you should stick with\nWhen I tried to do with that cheap I turned on my computer and I get distracted so personally paper and pencil work better for me [laughter]\nSean our caller Denise ah brought up you know having a good person in your corner to help you with that how do you how do you decide you know what who that person should be\nWell ideally somebody who really trust a lot like like a you know a relative or or even a good friend and I keep it interesting example of how to actually play out\nA few years ago I was working with a tribe in the mid west and they've got a pretty big per capita payment of the kids come into a pretty good lump sum when they turn Eighteen and the money that goes into a trust and we actually had a football player a guy who just finished college he was a ... who is the first round draft pick of the NFL\nAnd he came out to talk to the kids about you know managing money can a newfound wealth and just some of the challenges he was facing as a young athlete and how it compared to these these kids in the room that we're we're coming to the routine money [noise]\nAnd he was getting inundated with all kinds of people come in and ask them to borrow money and you know because suddenly had this big NFL pro contract and he told him he said well you need to talk to my mom\nMy mom is my financial advisor in any requests for loans are handouts Ernie up like that she's the one that makes the decision\nAnd it worked out really well for him because that way he didn't have to tell people know you could just calmly transfer them to his mom\nAnd his mom could go ahead to handle it so\nI thought that was a really interesting approach I think it was really affected the him and obviously we're not all NFL rookie he's dealing with a dollar amount but I think the same thing applies you know again a good ... parents a good friend and then you know the event that you just don't have a financial role model at home and sadly I think\nA lot of times if we are struggling financially especially in a lot of her native to use\nWe might not have curves that were that great of managing money or we're not familiar with budgeting and things like that so\nAnd actually it's again I Would really you know look online look at some of these resources that are available because there are some great blogs out there and just all my information is more information about personal finance and managing money\nThan ever before and they're just so many people out there that are sharing ideas sharing insight and um take advantage of that you know definitely you'd have to roll up your sleeves and do a little bit homework to do some research but you can find some great information out there\nUm if you don't have a specific financial role model in your life\nWe're talking about managing money budgets the emotions behind all of that give us a call and share your thoughts and ideas we maybe have a question I've got a stellar lineup of experts sitting here with us today\nNo\nNo no no no no no no no no\nNo\n\nNo no no no no no\nNo\n\nBut it is native America calling we're discussing budgeting today do you find it difficult to talk about money or do you wish the others would discuss it more when the number is one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for eight we've got Alina\nAnd Barbara California he there Alina\nHi thanks for taking my call absolutely [laughter]\nSo my situation is um I ... my husband is maybe we've been married about three years and um [noise]\nShe's always been in charge of all the money and he's been great about it she took budget you betcha everything and [noise] lately like in the last oh maybe three or four years\nShe's been more concerned about my taking over some of these responsibilities as anticipates passing before I and he worries about\nMy ability to manage our home and um you know our kids are grown and everything I think she now he's just worried about me and I find myself ... every ... every month and keeps a budget on she says her she told them up and you just want to use a computer and that's fine\nBut every ... because okay we talked about this and it's like these soldiers come up right away it's like I Do about it but I I Know I have to you and I'm just trying to figure out a way to to just open up a little bit more to talk about money and how it's you\nKnow we don't we have some stocks not a lot I'm just enough to kind of play in the market but he he wants me to just be more aware and participate more I just find it all the time\nYeah I can imagine I mean it's it's hard to to get into something like this especially if you've been telling yourself something like I'm not good with money or that's not my thing that's my husband's saying um\nTo make that transition how do you do you have any

mouth ... continues to unfold how it's been unfolding though that's what we want to focus on right now sometimes gruesome details in the case appear to be coming out in\nA deliberate slow drip courtesy of Turkish officials there the once\nRight now the sometimes gruesome details in the case appear to be coming out in a deliberate slow drip courtesy of Turkish officials they're the ones who first put out the story that ... was brutally murdered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to learn more we got in touch with Carlotta Gall assemble bureau chief for the New York times\nSo Howard Turkish officials getting their information and how the person you know what they know\nWell that's what's so interesting is I think they've known from the very get go I'm literally from the first day or evening um what happened was that the first week the Turkish officials I'm\nOld anonymous all ... not to be quoted started reaching out to foreign media which was interesting because it's not usually what they do share cause I then became a big story in the west and it was clear that that was that am they want it to be listened in the west they wanted to be believed so um it's being said they'd be\nThey'd be cautious and tough with how they have\nReleased um what they know the details coming out ... budget I'm\nIn a way that has kept it in the news every day\nSo how much of a problem is it for journalists both foreign and Turkish to report the Turkish findings when the people in charge of the scene of the crime is out is or not really corroborating anything right now\nVery difficult I mean that's you know and and it remains this mystery in many ways this little ... now that coming out in the Turkish press which we conquer the client or with one of the one of the things with the record the audio recording maybe came from his uncle ... that was quite quickly shut down\nBy ... but I'm the photos that were released of the Fifteen Saudis who are being accused of being scored who flew in that day and throughout that day we had teams in you know and they were checking to just to try and match them with open source to\nSocial media stuff has gone we found people who were uh\nEasily recognizable from\nYou know the ultra of ah the crown prince of Saudi Arabia mounted been someone they were caught on um you know photograph news agency Toto grow\nSo those are the things we never to match up there are others that it's difficult to work out who they are all\nThese leaks ah have gotten a lot of attention in part because the killing is a reporter to be hideous and a ... he was tortured some are going to see this as a threat not something that went to arrive in your reporting have you come close to understanding this [noise] um\nNo not yet I mean I think first we need to find what exactly happened and then we move on to why and why in this way but you know this wasn't a a a shooting in a dark\nAlley um that could be pinned on low\nOn this is a very brazen attack and so I think the Turks have been tough to that as a threat against them against their own government and president\nI'd run himself so that's why that particularly in ranch dressing and so now people are looking at the relations between turkey and Saudi Arabia which all roses and diplomatic different they do have differences considerable difference it\nAnd so now you see in the pro government call them the quieter ought to anger spilling out particularly ... um\nThe crown prince be removed so it's it's going going very high\nCarlotta Gall to New York times bureau chief and

dollars each more than a week later officials are still surveying the damage but when they're done the repair costs will not be added to any running tally of military spending related to extreme weather or climate change\nBecause that doesn't exist\nI think it is fair to say that the military does not know what the costs of climate change will be going forward\nThat's John konger he oversaw environmental policy and then in ... for the department of defense during the Obama administration [noise] last year the government Accountability Office recommended that the military start tracking the cost of extreme weather and climate change and all their installations ... wrote that recommendation for the watchdog agency\nWe think it's important to cash or the distinction between a normal maintenance and repair versus the closer because of a severe storms so that it helps to guide future adaptation projects\nWhat part are nice it's a lot easier to justify the cost of an adaptation project light strengthening a hanger roof if they know how much you've spent repairing hangar roots in the past and how much more you might stand in the face an increasingly intense storms and he points out it's not just about the money\nWe have military bases to support a military mission and if the base is out of commission by definition is not supporting the military mission\nThat department of defense responded to the watchdog agency is called to track climate and extreme weather class by saying no thanks actually they did say all of them are they responded that quote associating a single event to climate change is difficult and does not war at that time and money extended in doing so\nFour or five years ago that said was correct\nTrevor how there is with the economic research company radium group\nThe science was not yet at a point where that kind of attribution was possible but thanks to a lot of research work over the past few years we can do it\nScientists still don't usually say a specific drought or hurricane was caused by climate change but they can say for example that an individual drought was twice as likely because of climate

insurance companies and government agencies\nThan Italian children same for writing the school bus the resolution was supported by Italy's far right interior minister materials housing but he was forced to backtrack after outrage from activists and politicians on the left\nLorenzo ... as a reporter with the guardian has been following the story so tell us more about this resolution how did it work and how much was the costs for immigrant kids\nThe costs a resolution signed by the mayor and all the ... parents to declare their assets\nIn equally and in their countries silver each in in order to qualify for this time the cost of meals out this is a very difficult if not impossible requests for migrants you know we are dealing with refugees who often you know they come from Syria to come from Afghanistan to come from every trip\nAnd they left everything there I mean it's kind of\nCruel asking them their assets since they had seriously nasty\nAnd selling to provide houses details meant they had to pay the highest rate five here it's a day or child for the school meals\nFamilies but it also required to pay to hundred and ten ... each quarter for the school bus and then he obviously was forced to do so or talking about ... sometimes don't have a job how can afford two hundred and ten years\n[noise] so what does this mean for immigrant kids like what were the eating at lunch and how do they go to school and how do they get home\nThe feeling is that before signing a low at first seemed oppose ... trying to figure out the consequence of diversity shit and convenience they would totally aware\nMigrant children without being forced three separately from their cost me there was his older load that prevents keep from bringing their own food from whole inside that class obviously it was a problem for their parents because they were forced to take the eastern school in the morning\nThan some of them were taking their kids back home for lunch and then sending them back\nSo they had to do back and forth from the house of school like three or four times a day to provide their keys some food\nHow have Italians been reacting to this\nThere was a reporter for ... for many tidy MTV program for first report that the case and they went to low income from some of the seats and lo Dee asking them what do you think there is a dish and you know what they were pretty happy with it\nBecause they perceived migrants invaders but things were different you know after a few days when the news got huge an equally\nAnd as I say first ... support that there is a dish should but then when you figure it out that a massive ... finding to help the migrant he's had already and race sixty thousand euros you said that a ... of us it would have been enough to go out on the school meals\nThere was one left wing politician in Italy called this resolution apartheid ah how many Italians feel that way\n[noise] yes there is addition is being described as an are tied as a former federal gay Sharon or\nThat he's feeling that we are going seriously to fire ... Italians are now starting to see that you know this is probably the most far right governments in the end of the world war second any tele for sure and let me interrupt\nYou know for kids it's never easy arriving at a new school and then you face these regulations that alien that you're from other classmates have you spoken with immigrant families and did they tell you how their kids are dealing with this\n[noise] I did speak to her mother ... she came from Tunisia and she was telling me that she felt humiliated she felt you know she was angry she wants to seriously you know these are pointed\nAnd humiliated by a low time by politicians were totally aware\nOf the conditions for migrants in lowly so they felt the world's injustice and it's very hard for them to express their anger and frustration because often they are invisible any of the\nInterior minister Mattel solving he supported this resolution but then backtracked as I said has the mayor of ... also backtracked\nNo she didn't know she didn't she said that she will consider a self sufficient but the federal yes it as a way to guarantee school meals the kids but she said that she was not the ... the\nGuardian reporter Lorenzo ... thank you thank you\nSpeaking of things that sound wrong imagine a TV show like cops but for ice as an immigration and Customs Enforcement you know show would follow ice agents around and they conduct raise looking for suspected undocumented immigrants and the purpose of the TV show ... entertainment\nYou may be surprised to hear that a TV show much like that does exist in Japan Nevin Thompson is seen as he's Japan editor for the online news ... news organization global voices\nWell it's like a typical uh reality talk show in this case immigration office or go out and seek out um I guess these over scares people who were working against the terms of over their reason Japan is say go people\nYou're there with them in the car um they they capture them in target them and then um as the title of the show the just there to court in the next plane type thing wow what what\nUm they they capture them in surrogate them and then um\nAs the title of the show the jazz through the court in the next plane type thing\nWow what what's the name of the show either in Japanese or a translation and English in Japanese goal died hike during those ...\nWhich I guess translates as caught at the moment of deportation wow minutes actually modeled on another a cop show it in Japan called title ... which is like caught at the moment of arrest sounds like a trend well yeah I mean there's a lot of these shows everywhere in the world you know I'm In Canada\nWhere I'm from for example we had a show like this that Canada border's services agency collaborated with with the producers and actually the any government help funded\nAnd so they would go out and look for so called illegal immigrants and stuff like that very tasteless\nAnd it was only taken off the air because of the contribution privacy regulations kind of what is the tone of the the Japanese program and what were your impressions of it well I mean it's it's very literate and breathless um\nYou basically have a a Japanese person I'm narrating what's happening is just such kind of odd because like their tone is very tricky and in writing pleasant so now the the immigration agents are on their way to eat\nThe dormitory were some Vietnamese a guest workers are suspected of of of hiding out in the ministry of marriage\nIs a it's a very um\nYou know and I'm a very say you're you're with ... with them in my car there is a a camera you know you're driving down the road and it's kind of odd because like because Jeff Japan also has very stringent privacy regulations you can't really show anybody space so everything was word out including the like the neighborhood where it is\n'cause like like say if you show the neighborhood\nUm the people who live there would probably complain and criticized and so it's just like this was like an hour and a half\nOf what worry blurt out images you can't see people's spaces voices are the guys was quite an art program\nThis was a two hour episode aired earlier this month is that a one off or are they going to be more episodes that follow these migrant raids and deportations\nI imagine there probably will be a because of the the program did to cooperate with uh\nThe Tokyo branch of the national Grisham girl\nSo they I mean there's people have put a lot of time and effort into fitness thing up and and just also because the the immigration bureau is going to be elevated to the immigration agency\nAnd get more resources I'd assume is going to be some work your effort like this too I gather there's been some backlash to the show in Japan or what have active it's been saying well I mean yeah I like online\nThere was considerable backlash from\nAnti racism activists who are are very well organized in Japan Japan is a very vibrant\nAnti racism a movement and so yeah they they basically said why are you trying to introduce entertainment like why why you showing people being deported how can this be entertainment and then um the the mainstream media picks it up so you know various newspapers ran articles about you know how degrading the show is I mean\nIs it shot in front of cars I mean like the bad guys aren't really bad guys they just are looking for a job and you know trying to stay a little longer to make some money and overstay their work permits\nWell I mean I guess the obvious appeal is racism because people I suppose have\nBiases the boats people from other countries have a they don't speak our language or they look a bit different and and they're coming over here and taking our jobs type thing so I I personally I must surely the I think it's just kind of a ... kind of a cheap TV to watch\nI remember the cop show theme song ended it by getting samples all over the place so they have a a catchy same town that everybody's not singing\nYeah I mean I I guess you you might think also we live within time\nWhen around the world I think people are feeling less secure than ever before\nJust because of a say for example Donald Trump or ... or invasion of Crimea so many people are just feeling I'm less secure in their own countries perhaps these sorts of shows provide some reassurance that someone's doing something to protect us here\nHave been times in Japan editor for global voices thank you very much for telling me about this a somewhat bizarre show oh You're welcome was great to talk with you\nKnow\nInvesting
