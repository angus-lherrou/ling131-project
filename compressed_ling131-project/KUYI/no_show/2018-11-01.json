I have a bachelor's of science and community health I'm from northern Arizona university [noise] excellent thank you so much to both of you for joining me I'm curious for each of\nYou um how is it that you\nEnded up working on oil how specifically what is your story and where does the interest come from well I started when I was in high school there was a cooperative education program in which students were able to spend half of the day in an office and half of the day I'm doing class work\nAnd I was first ah placed in an office that had a\nReal estate that sold real estate and that was not a good match for me I didn't enjoy the work and was not very happy and my teacher could see that so\nHe found another office and it happened to be with an oral surgeon and I was the person that did all the errands and cleaned up all the instruments and those things in the office and I absolutely loved it\nUm I was fortunate enough that throughout my dental hygiene education I was able to work in the same office and it encouraged me to be able to reach out to people and see that I had something to give to them to help them better\nTheir oral health wonderful and how about you or is that what was your journey to become involved with a real house [noise]\nSo I have two children a six month old and a two year old and I'm prior to this I was in cancer prevention\nAnd then a whole visitor for on children zero through five and I um worked out here on the community in a really um all the different health disparities that we face and or a house with one of the ones that come up and\nI Know that that's a big push for the try a poor health initiatives so\nWhen this opportunity popped up to where back at the university and oral hygiene I Would say I will do it and um I think it's important for us especially I'm at peace\nBecause our dental curious rate is four times higher than the normal um the average people so that was kind of my push for this wow four times higher than the general population\nUm so now I'm really happy to have both of you here to share some of your knowledge with our listeners about oral health because I think if I'm a part of our body that we are not always as attentive to as we should be so what is oral health so our house\nIs amount free from too sticky um which is a chronic preventable disease gum dizzy and oral source including oral cancers so we're going to be talking a lot about your gums\nYour lips scare me your mouth the Mont and your teeth a your stomach\nWe want to help to keep them nice unhealthy so that's what we'll be focusing on today [noise]\nAnd then um ... what are some common oil diseases but uh we should be aware of\nToday we're going to talk about three common oral diseases such tooth decay gum disease in oral cancer so took the case is caused by the bad bacteria in our\nMouth by eating the sugars that we\nEat because there's good bacteria and our mouth and there's bad bacteria some people have more good bacteria than they do bad bacteria and some people have more bad bacteria than they do good if we have too much bad bacteria and we eat a lot of foods carbohydrates in particular that has sugar the\nBad bacteria break that down in cause tooth decay the second comment oral diseases gum disease and there's two different types of gum disease there's ... impaired on Titus ginger bite us is inflammation of the gum that's when the gums get red and\nSwore an angry and infected\nAnd then the next one is a paradox Titus and that's when the infection spreads and gets into the supporting structures around the people like the bones\nAnd the ligament and those kinds of things and actually can progress to the point that are cheap fall out\nThe third kind of oral disease that we have is oral cancer and there are things that we can do to prevent oral cancer although it's not like ginger by this and I'm ... tooth decay which are completely preventable oral cancer can be caused by things like smoking tobacco\nDrinking alcohol we can also reduce\nUm some of the other bad habits but we have like picking at our gum tissue one other thing that is really important that we can do is if we're of adolescent age we can have the human papillomavirus vaccine\nAnd the ages to start for the H. P. V. vaccine or eleven to twelve years of age and up to\nTwenty one for boys and up to twenty six for girls\nSo parents out there the H. P. V. vaccine is really important in preventing cervical cancer as well as oral cancers wow I didn't know that the H. P. V. vaccine which is a cancer preventing vaccine actually\nHelps prevent um oral cancer to 'em so with project zero I Know\nThat a lot of the focus is on pregnant women so um what are come come in oil problem um that pregnant women face\nSo that we have a three different oral problems that pregnant women face the first one to ... which I'm Dr Helms talked about a little bit the second one the gum disease which is also divided and pray and Don Titus the third one is a non cancerous or oh gross um\nAnd a little bit sick when the gum disease which is also\nDivided and hurry and done Titus the third one is a non cancerous or oh gross I'm including ... granted brand new Loma and that's basically when it's caused by a homeowner changed and the bacteria okay and so it sounds like\nPregnant women can kind of get the same dental problems that anyone can get 'em why is it particularly important for pregnant women um to um be concerned with oral health\nSo gum disease has been associated\nWith peach farm labor and that's because there's a hormone that I'm pregnant women have called caustic London which increases the information and then the ... and I'm\nAlso the hormones that stimulate labor [noise] the second one is gum disease and it's also associated with low birth weight and babies the third is if my mom had tooth decay she can pass it on half the bacteria on that causes tooth decay to her newborn baby\nRouse so those are really important reason so the house of a mouse during pregnancy you wouldn't think about it but it actually um if it's not in a healthy situation could and potentially increase the chance of preterm labor of low birth weight babies that's\nIncredible um and then the other one is that and the bacteria that a mother has in her mouth I'm after the babies born I'm Dr how you were talking about the good bacteria versus the bad bacteria\nAnd that um if the bacteria balance isn't good for the mom than not bacteria will get past who the baby and then um that infant might start off with kind of a unfair shot at having good health and preventing cavities and things like that so um or how this extra important for\nPregnant women and so how do pregnant women keep their mouths healthy what should they be doing\nTo the first and most important thing and brushing we want moms to brush at least two times a day for two minutes so you can play your favorite song that's maybe two minutes\nLong while you're brushing your teeth or reset your ABC's their kids um and that two times a day is once right before bed and then when you wake up in the morning and we want to make sure that we're brushing our teeth with Frank containing to see and that's another important sometimes\nWe get toothpaste and we don't realize it doesn't have fluoride in there [noise]\nWe also want to use\nThose two little ... well if you're brushing correctly you can actually brush their teeth and the gums\nAt the same time so when we brush we recommend that you take the angle of the toothbrush would about a forty five degree angle so we're getting actually in between the gum tissue and the two to sell and we do little tiny circles and that'll help clean the baby's\nBoth the gums and the teeth at the same time so we don't need to separately brush the gum tissue okay how about um if the rest of the gums don't have any teeth on them should we be brushing those or leave those alone we could use a ... again like we do a\nChild without any ... warm damp washed costs just rubbed their teeth especially if they're starting to evening that warm rubbing motion feels really good to a baby you seemed just relax\nA little bit so and again it gets them used to fingers in the mouth gets them used to a toothbrush so we want to have that gum tissue stimulated\nJust for the fact of getting used to it excellent so parts of the mouse that are just gone no teeth yet clean those with a warm damp wash class and then when the teeth come in rush both the teeth and the gums adjacent to the teeth with a toothbrush correct All right I think I got it from I ...\nAt the dollar store they have the squirrels finger I'm cleaning pollster like plastic they have these thoughts are still on there and use that for baby too so it just goes right over your finger and you just touch the baby comes with that too so that's another way [noise] excellence and then um\nI think it's really important to point out the snacks\nChoices is really important and so singling out how to cut the um the vegetables and the ... states that are exciting to eat um cheese enough for a good alternative that don't have quite so much carbohydrates that are going to sit on the teeth and cause cavities excellence and so as we wrap up here in our last couple of minutes I wanted to ask a little bit more about a\nProject zero women infants and what is this project and um what is its mission why is it called project zero\nI'm and how can listen to find out more about it\nSo we are called project zero limits and infants because the goal is to have zero cavity so that's why in the euro is in their ... our mission is to expand opportunities for access to direct oral health services\nIncrease delivery of ... practices for oral health care and enhance the white that is the first is our girls for P. D. W. I. R. to provide support and assistance to ... facilities throughout the state of Arizona and they plan implement\nIn it that integration of our house into their maternal and child care we also deliver education unfair practices in oral health care to live\nIntegration of our house into their maternal and child care we also deliver education I'm practices in all health care delivery and referrals for maternal and child health care provider since Sandy come on the radio just share information with your heart [laughter]\nThat is excellent and so for anyone listening who um is inspired to potentially um seek some um dental care for it themselves or for their children and what are some resources that are available [noise]\nSo we invite you to our next that we have at the end they use and so high teens department and that's in Flagstaff on the in a youth camp [noise]\nWe have some kind of when facing serious face one in five PM and you can come face to face three on three five zero zero from our information excellence\nAnd then to share some about the research and available here I'm I'm hoping reservation I Hope the health care center is really fortunate to have an excellent dental clinic um that\nStaffed by I'm five four times and tests on as well as many Hi Janice and staff and they offered routine screenings and exams as well as on all sorts of different treatments including\nDentures let's not as a flick of us have pregnant women necessarily um but they really have I'm pretty comprehensive services that are available I'm In the central\nClinic at the health care center is open each have five Monday through friday and phone number for the ... center is Ninety eight seven three seven six thousand to call and get more information about I'm getting an appointment in defense of funding [noise]\nThank you Dr Johnson for having us and I am thrilled to say that some of the high tennis that are at the whole the health clinic are in a U dental hygiene students so we're thrilled to have people in either relocation please join us as your dental care provider\nExcellent that's fantastic [noise]\nUm and then the only thing I just wanted to share is that um we have on the medical side of things at the clinic and collaborating with that dental clinic and I'm In our well child check for I'm providing for a ... at least so that's not a replacement of going to the dentist but it is an important component for reducing cavities um\nSo that's the way that we're working together [noise] and so I I think that that's the end of our program at any last thoughts are either if you want to share\nAnd we can never um get too much for and finer so if a child can get a fried fish and the clinic and essays that community event and they can get another front I find that she just wanted to make sure that their teeth are protected\nThat's really good to know too and he can't overdose on the floor and writing an excellent well thank you so much um to all of our listeners to house calls on ... idiot quaint went FM I'm kind of transcend your host for this\nWeek and a member of the medical staff at the Hopi health care center a certified patient centered medical home thank you once again to my guests\nDr Denise home a professor at the end of your department of dental hygiene um and maybe teaching some of the Hi Jen is that we have out here at home the that's fantastic and thank you so much to Marissa Adams I'm program manager for projects zero women and um and a local experts from here on the reservation says thank you\nI'm also a big thanks a KU AI for allowing us the opportunity where on the air twelve thirty to one him every Wednesday with house cause\nTo share information unimportant how\nTopics that the community next week or we will be discussing ...
