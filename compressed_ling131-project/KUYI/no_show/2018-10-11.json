call and share what you think about the project the number is one\nEight hundred Ninety six to eight for eight and here in Studio forty nine with us today Jim you know he is the c._e._o. of the Colorado Plateau foundation lifelong farmer and a citizen of\nMany ... I probably should have him here Jim looking back\nAt you\nAnd she took a little bit about I'm just exactly what we see in the first episode and ah some of the things that you are sharing in there and you definitely um or in a very special place to ... people um talk to us a little bit about um some of the things that were shown in in how you feel about it\nWell\nFirst let me say that my my parks on on screen really is very minimal I don't have much presence in the show I had more of a back room rulers ... advice\nAnd about the appropriateness context content so is it a visor I'd say that um there are a couple of things around what's being shared I think that's a correct term to use because it isn't really about revealing it is not a a series that is using\nOld school salvage a graphic filmmaking which is not that it is really about putting control the message in in the hands of the voice of participating\nIn it is so there's there's a bit about how we got to where we are and really setting the record straight is another thing\nOh emergence of measure this described taco cannon and relationships to other other native peoples all throughout the continent and what I like about the messages that even the title itself native America\nIt says that people that are in South America Central America North America\nAbout messages that even the titles so native America\nSays the people that are in South America Central America North America are Americans we're all Americans\nReally so I Would describe myself as a citizen of the United states first as a Sunni but as a citizen of the United states when we're all Americans so it just says something about that and I think that's very important to know when people I mean look at the peace and say well that's that's the some very interesting forward\nIdea of putting some some uh sharing of of these for example ceremonies and things like that that's really been up to the communities themselves to share\nMy maybe some people might think that will who has the right to say those things sure those things and I'm really not communities made up of many many kinds of different people as matter more to this thing\nIs made up of people with differential access to resources on channel some influence but we rely on leaders and it was many of the leaders\nIn these communities that made the decisions on how to Sharon Sharon I'm up to share what so I think it was very powerful and that way but I think setting the record straight and it's going to be a very important in central theme to create a more informed citizenry\nAt a time we definitely needed more Native American to share that with the rest of the nation\n... understand that you were hesitant at first then what changed your mind\nWell has been only because you know there's been a long history of of\nFilmmaking storytelling everything from school books to\nConventional mainstream television and movies too even mascots for the worst is up to the people have been telling the wrong story about native peoples and\nI thought well maybe this is already progressed far enough that I Would just have a minor role but actually I came in at just the right time to be really um\nAn advisor that would help move there isn't the right direction to give power to the native voice\nAll right thank you for that when I go hand in ah teach us to Arizona to add to bring in\nAnother voice here with us in Studio forty nine in gym you know also on the line from Norman, Oklahoma in union of Brennan and she has a series producer for native America comes to us from the commands the nation and um right now we're going to say hello to ...\nWe see on mine and he's the former director for the Hopi cultural preservation office he is healthy from ...\nIn front of the village of luckily\nHe's had mentioned having here with us we welcome to be our good morning and really um I guess just initial thoughts on what you think about the series in in winning shows about obey\n\nThe proposal was brought to attention about three years ago and you know of course a historically the hope yes always frown on ... ... per se\nBut as we learned about the focus of the shooters or advisory team which is composed of twelve represent this from the top ... village just thought it out\nAnd and\nFelt that this document you would be within the mission of the whole the cultural preservation office which is again\nPreserve and protect the Hopi\nHistory and the south is in this case it would document or cultural and spiritual interest to a place called charcoal a place we call ... ... that features so much in our migration traditions\nAnd we felt that this was a way\nTo document that and that have that available for future generations of hope you so based on that ... team voluntarily sent it to see\nAny lately\nWhat are your thoughts on and and I really understand Dina wanting to have this kind of information you know traveling into the future for other generations tend to read about on the side of sharing it in this format where um\nAnyone who turns on their TV mama series airing finds it on line and we'll be seen this and and that's\nBeyond hope the people I'm Talking about that\nWell again with always been in the ... maybe the whole bit cultural preservation office and consulting with so many agents is both state federal and museums to\nReally put four or five cultural interest in the south was and I think the specific interest to some of these sites is not well known I think if\nNone of it that's been spoken by a try and solve such is hoping so I thought is directed that this would become a voice\nTo share that and that in the ... the hope he is still one living culture but also his demonstrated connection to a place called charcoal\nSo any special please go ahead continue\nWell that would be valuable looking for the public to learn\nAnd I think you know um when we think of ... times would you see the ruins in in\nYou know these empty spaces and new people are more easy we see aerial than the map and since this series um\nConnects leaving people to it only um is Jim mentioned a very ceremony a featured in this documentary and that's where a un featured any um any thoughts about sharing ceremony\nIncentive to land in in what it means to have this part of hoping story\nTold\nWell with a lot about that\nBecause of course I'm\nThe sea sick when the film in the great he charcoal where we all sat down and\nOut that a symbol of smoking and I want to put that into context why don't we travel up there as individuals or groups hope you mail can't smoke anywhere to\nTo to pray and think about or they're at\nSo is is a very common practice that we thought would illustrate that we are serious about our trips to these places where we have clear reverence for the place so\nPlease who's a meeting the individuals who are from those places and even talking about um you know their philosophy in life as well as history and\nSo um if you haven't heard about any of this and what you've heard so far most this approach about talking about a meter nations and there's something you'd like to share look forward to give you Rene you'll be like Mountain Dew dial in one eight hundred mining speaks\nTo eat for each and right now we can go to Santa Fe New Mexico and Jean Meyers on the line she is she works at the museum\nOf
