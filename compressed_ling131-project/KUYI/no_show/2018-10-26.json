organization set up so\nWe as a project of the Hopi foundation and we are physically sponsored by the Hopi foundation on similar to how key why it on the foundation is a\nNonprofit five oh one C. three organization and I'm sure I used to have the community um help themselves and in various ways through radio through substance abuse through youth development um and various other um\n[noise] initiatives and so we are just one of many programs in the Hopi foundation [noise]\nGreat so when did the work begins with voice\nSo for the for the rest of this conversation can you why I listen as

E. Y. I. listeners um we're going to move into another um discussion with the whole\nPie use or hoppy opportunity you in this shit and um I Will get this right so um\nStay tuned well we have um Hannah will continue the conversation with us but we're going to introduce new gene and if you didn't hear earlier he's when he said data a person for the um the opportunity years initiative\nYeah okay so let's move forward here if you're just tuning into can you why it's nine Twenty one here in the studios any writing October twenty that\n[noise]\nOkay so we're going to get into the discussion of top ways and that's what the whole\nThe opportunity use initiative [noise] um [noise] refers to with all the different areas that they work and so let's start with Hannah and ask her um what are the ways that you work with\n[noise] so\nSo let's start with Hannah and ask her um what are the pathways that you weren't with [noise]\nSo [noise] the pathways me just define pathways first and then\nWe'll go into gene who well I'll let you know what these athletes are that we are just so pathways are are we have for a while I like to consider for and there are different areas that we address with you [noise] um\n[noise] and these are ways to activate their communities to own\nYou know the work that we're doing 'em\nAnd says around ... data collection through it do you think a trend and data collection effort engages an entire community to help carry out um programs or on\nTibet for better and more collaborative we so I'm pathways are away to different areas of our work that we we focus on 'em and in doing so we're bringing you think community to inform\nThose pathways [noise] All right great thank you for that [noise]\nOkay Jean Cody um can you share with our KU I listeners what are the different pathways that you work with ... on\nYou must I must have no yeah I'm so there's four passwords as hunger mention and their service learning mentoring culture wellbeing and data [noise]\nAll right so each ... each one of those areas I'm sure has a lot that he won with\nBell says he says he has his own like part of explanation\nAwesome so I'm Mr Coney we learnt that you're the data person yes and so with that said that data pass away let's talk a little about that component and um can you share with our listeners a little bit about what information has been elected and how how is it shared [noise]\nUm so we collect data that pertains to the state of youth such as graduation rate college and career readiness high school enrollment employment and as um as well as challenges such as dropout rates and risky behaviors with behaviors but what I can share\nWith you or the number of years that we serve so as of August two thousand a team there are fourteen thousand five hundred and four enrolled Hopi members and whole east target ages are between fourteen to twenty six\nAnd there are currently three thousand one hundred and forty six use copious enrolled in ah the tribe between fourteen and twenty six [noise] however there are some that live officer is in some that live on the road so the number though where you served that live on the wrist is one thousand six hundred and forty minute [noise]\nWhy thank you for that that's very very informative and that was a lot of information so you know what let's repeat that again for arcane why I listeners\nAnd um [noise] you know just that let them get used to those numbers because I think that sometimes some of the issue sometimes we don't always have that concrete information and so that was really great so let's let's give you a gene to Flora again and have them share that data within [noise]\nSo I'm like I said as of August two thousand Eighteen they're fourteen thousand five hundred and enroll pope you remember an employee serves um ages fourteen to twenty six\n[noise] and so of the fourteen thousand there's three thousand one hundred and forty six use and rolled in Hopi however from live off resin somewhere on roads and we currently ... ah\nWe're sticking ways of serves the ones off roads but we um they're the ones on risk for now and that number is one thousand six hundred and forty minute [noise]\nThank you for that so when you say ... you mean Hopi Reservation right okay All right we just want to make sure\nThat thank you find that I'm a Eugene that was really useful information and I think that's probably what Hannah once referring to earlier about all this work that they're doing you know they started in twenty Thirteen so I'm sure there's a lot of other um data\nThat you've elected that we can share about later [noise] um\nSo thank you for that um what are some of the challenges that the organization basis with in these particular\nPathways that we mentioned\nEarlier [noise] of some of the challenges that we faced with the data pathway are mostly is I'm having to deal with um issues such as for but HIPAA\nAnd so we're as um stuff are trying to get um training in those areas\nSo we can work with our um our partners and you know we'll be violating any privacy issues [noise] uh that's one of the biggest things refers um [noise] yeah I'll say that that's all\nThat's fine and you know you you used the acronym for ... and HIPAA and they I'm sure spell out something and they refer to um privacy um you know information\nOf um students are family or whatever you can you just kind of explain that a little so the lesson is maybe get a little idea of what that might be may they might be a young parent that's finally getting a maybe they have a senior now and\nAll of a sudden there's all the acronyms in LA oh gosh that sounds scary but it's really not right so this kind of break it down for that\nOkay for F. E. R. P. A. is a federal statute that protect the privacy of students and education and the in academia you know and that's that would be a high school and college and then ... is the health insurance portability act and what they protect is I'm\nA medical information [noise] okay\nI Hope you got that came I listeners that's not that's okay we're we're going to continue to talk with them and I'm trying to get this information out to you so it doesn't sound so scary\nI remember being a parent and you know when you're doing things for the first time it can be pretty frightening so um it'll be okay [noise] all righty\nSo some of the rewarding things that you've seen or you wouldn't like to share with our listeners in the way that you do [noise]\nUm one of the rewarding things I've seen is um having\nUm our ideas takes shape and form and then being implemented into the community um so uh I've sat through some groups are were somehow nominee and um [noise] my coworkers here we rushed out ideas with our use they gave us ideas and we helped them shape I'm I I'm\nI guess shape [noise]\nPrograms or something I Would say and we've seen it developed from the idea stage into full blown a implementation of the reservation you know so it's costing these ideas flow and work and come alive that's rewarding to me that that knowledge is being passed on and moved on [noise]\nOkay KU I we're back here and now with um misled the James\nAnd Hannah and we'll start off with Hannah and ask her um\nCan you tell our listeners amount that the two committees and you have with the whole the opportunities initiative\nSharp um and this is a reason why we have where do you know we use\nAcronyms a lot because it's a mouthful every time we talk about these groups about um we have the community advisory board um which is um for short cab and then our youth advisory committee and if we call it the ... for short um\nAnd so the community advisory board is these are two I've been using which youth and community can and\nSit in an informed the worst that we're doing and so um they're ... they're both they both served as um advisory roles\nTo the work and so we we um for example the cab um [noise] they they'll attend quarterly meetings participate in outreach and fundraising activities each year um [noise] and they and they are representative of of us\nAre ... and so [noise] um [noise]\nSo it's not just us providing information but once we we get the the news out there about who are members are you're you you as a community members can approach them and I I mean or what kind of work are they doing what you know what the progress that they're having in in our community community\nAdvisory boards can serve as resources to inform the community about the work that we're doing [noise]\nUm [noise] do you that ... committee is also a an advisory role um and it's made up primarily of years ages fourteen to twenty six\nAll right great thank you for that [noise] and um [noise] can you let our listeners know when you kind of mentioned some of the roles that um these advisory boards\nPlay um do you want to do and to let them on the town maybe it was they use advisory committee advise and I think you did share a lot of what what they're expected to do but is there a same expectations on the use advisory\nYes so they we call a quick call we've been calling on them a lot more um in in the past few years to inform I work and you know give us ideas you know what you know they really informed\nThe approach that we have 'em\nIn and like she lost her a little bit later about you know the kind of experience as we've had with them but um\nThey primarily for serving the same role as a cabin is just with the youth and other peers are age that we get them together and talk about um [noise] you know our project that we're trying to pilot or ideas on you know different you know ... or ... or um or\nUm we have they'll come with us on fundraisers you know um Arizona gives day is one of our our huge fundraising activities um that we have once a year and so each year we try to have used president and you know advocating for you know funding\nI'm twenty I'm so those are one ways we call on them to help you know help us find grace\nUm come come and join us our um our outreach boost 'em and then just share\nYou know share with other kids their age that want to get involved they want to you know\nUm learn more about what we do um there are advocates for use on nuts and and so they're both they're both um most groups are advocates for the work that we do [noise]\nThank you Hannah so moving forward can you our listeners that we're going to do um [noise]\nProbably I said this is where we're going to be kind of break this down into two components\nEspecially when we started talking with like sea because there's a lot of information that we're sharing and I know it's probably a lot trying to absorb everything so I'll Try to break down this elephant into little bite size pieces so we\nCan we we hopefully can get it [noise] um so we will refer to the when we when we're talking about the community advisory board we will refer to them as they cap and we begin to talk about they use advisory committee they will refer to them I Know\nYeah I had mentioned [noise] so I have one more question for you Hannah\nBefore we move on to like see or their qualifications required for anyone to serve on either one of well I guess to serve on a member of the community advisory board\nTrack 'em if anybody any adult elder that wants to inform the work that we do um they can be an education nonprofit an artist someone who's willing to share I'm ...\nI'm I'm anyone that's knowledgeable with data for our pathways mentoring service learning and cultural wellbeing\nI'm so any any adult that's invested and wants to help 'em address you development in these areas in our passed away so we we\nHave um we are we are currently seeking members or our membership\nAlways open um\nSee we have um where\nWe are currently seeking members or our membership is always open um we we are we are targeting ten members\nUm and so far we have we have we will we will be um recruiting more and you have your choice of serving I'm two\nOr five years terms and those those terms will be staggered so that you know when when one person it you know doesn't want to renew this information can be carried over with other members that are still there\nUm and then\nSome of the requirements that we we have are like I mentioned before attending quarterly meeting\n'em and um let's see\nHelping with outreach and fundraising so if there's ever a time where we need you to be present at a\nOutreach to help with surveys maybe you know you're going to be called upon to help and then fundraising you know we're we're trying to be more strategic and how we find rate because we do want this work to continue and um we are a nonprofit organization that has to apply for granted and so um we continuously\nHave to fund raised for two to sustain\nThat work and so you'll you'll be called upon to help\nWhen I'm fundraising whether it's some kind of pine for events or under um annual Arizona gets day\nEvent and then last but not least just to be a voice in the community and bringing your voice bring your knowledge bring the hat that you want to wear to these meetings that\nWe have around and what kind of knowledge on a share and how how do we help and support you use an advocate um\nOn on on our behalf and for those that the for those used that you have in mind when you come to these meetings so it's not a lot it's a very um\nInformal and so there's no you know the only commitment we have for you is just that you commit to two years or five years and then you have a choice and um\nOther than that you know it's it's a very informal and we invite you know\nCommunity members that want to you know get involved is just one of the new you can you can see\nAll right thank you for that ... so we're going to move on to miss like see James and I believe she lands on so let's start with a use advisory committee um since we've talked a lot about [noise] adult advisory board um that can you share with us um\nWhat is the role and expectations of 'em I use advisory committee member to assist\n... yeah so\nWhen we do have projects going on or when we have something we're trying to get off the ground the uh we like to call on them and ask them does this work is this really unable to use 'em as an understandable and there's something we can change or things like that so just um\nWe asked them to be as honest is with us as\nPossible because it it's pretending to them and this work is for them\nAnd their years so that was one of the main expectations\nAnd just like Hannah said be voice I'm kind of\nJust giving to use the reassurance that this work is for you but it's also kind of built by you so there was a movement I kind of like to model after um nothing about us without us for making sure that they use voices ever president with the work that we do\nAwesome so you provide them a means of being able to share that whatever it is that they're experiencing yes um\nWhether a student at the the first time we used to yeah I was with our photo challenge that we had and they um\nThey were really um detrimental and making sure that the hashtags for the month where\nUnderstandable um they even came up with\nThe theme um whereas respect for yourself and they even went as far as to translate into Hopi I'm self respect and making sure that everything that we had planned for the month for our photo challenge was ready and reliable and they just took it and ran with it ended up even designing\nThe whole picture for the for the photo challenge\nSo hot at one know about this phone challenge how\nHow how do they know that this photo challenge was happening\nSo we we blasted out on Facebook and we even created an Instagram account to make sure that we reached those followers a\nLike see James here I Apologize areas are set up to a youth that keep us we're going and anyone who is um [noise]\nA great

it happened um he sent out of Lebanon letter I'm an email using his MCI account\nUm two tribal leaders to you know members of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee to all kinds of people all over D.C even um the just\nOffer his version of events are free his defense I guess for the various allegations have been made against them and and in that letter I Will say that he offered quite a few details about um\nThe allegations against him so so I guess I'll be quoting I can quote from his letter\nI Will say that he offered quite a few details about um\nThe allegations against him so so I guess I'll be quoting I can quote from his letter and that sense um one of the things that he allegedly happened was that I'm back during the ... and meteor conference for NCAA back in twenty sixteen I'm\nThere'd been a gathering of people um after the conference and that that day\nOr several in theory I I'm staff met for drinks and I'm One of the women there according to him gotten pretty uneasy rated and uh and was having trouble walking of wanting to go back to her hotel room so he said he decided to help her get Becker hotel room\nAnd he said I'm through the course of this you know you had to hold her arm I'm kinda hold her up at certain points to get back to a hotel room\nI'm at one point when they got close to the hotel she became scared and alarm she's you know may have Congress to some extent and realize that he was holding her arm we've got scared and and stuff out in toward traffic um now he said he grabbed her\nAnd pulled her back you don't want the onto the curb or onto the sidewalk and at that point she went their separate way and went into the hotel by herself\nAnd he said he thought that was the end of it um but later he found out that this woman had 'em all the complaint with him\nWhich Reykjavik data and um that are needed alleged that he had a sexually harassed her\nWow um [noise] so I mean that was that's that's his version of that story we've we've certainly understand a different version of that story um but I'm not I don't really feel comfortable\nRight because you're dealing with anonymous sources and this is you know one of the things that journalists do is uh have conversations with the sources about\nWhat's on the record and what's also record and what what can be shared um publicly so um we certainly would never ask you to cross that line Kevin I'm it\nWhat what are you going to be following up on next when it comes to this story\nWell\nWhen the\nWhen the MTA board of directors voted this past Saturday to suspend Jackie paid a\nA I think the conclusion of an internal investigation into um these how she handled these various allegations of sexual harassment\nUm there's going to be now obviously an internal investigation by an ad hoc committee basically you know kind of a subcommittee on the board um that will be investigating these claims and how she handled them so we following that investigation to whatever extent we can now obviously this is an internal investigation\nAnd can be difficult to get details of that um so I don't know if you know how that will happen if that will happen but will certainly as much as we can try to keep an eye on at least the\nConclusion of that investigation what happens as a result of it now obviously\nEverybody is sort of waiting with bated breath to find out whether she'll keep her job I mean 'cause there's a possibility that you know the board to set a committee decides that um she didn't handled these things very well because there could be a decision made later on to ask her to resign or Terminator employment but I'm certainly hasn't happened yet\nSo I'll be following that um and there are other issues too is that we certainly a\nA wants to keep an eye on related to all of this um various other allegations you know\nRegarding how all of this was handled not just by Jackie by some other members of the board even um who were currently made aware of these things\nUm and we don't know how they responded defeated responded to to being made it from wherever these various obligations over the past year or two or maybe longer\n[noise] hang on Kevin um we've got a caller an anonymous call her on the line that I Want to take um hello thanks for giving us a call what would you like to share\nHi I just uh when I agree of course that everything that a Kevin is saying I'm Indian dot com and high country use has\nA we definitely appreciate their coverage of this serious issue that's happening in Indian country and happening in this organization\nAnd um it's really uh it's it's almost ... well I wouldn't say it's on us it is bad if\nThe at the conference um cut that our leadership is just putting doubt in people's minds that were disgruntled employees that would like to see the organization be torn down\nAnd that that could be you know further from the truth the reason so many of us didn't come forward is because we want to make sure that and say I have with a mission and\nWe didn't want to see the bad things happen to something that was started by our elders you know it's not the ... were not disgruntled employees at all um we just believe that people should be held accountable and that\nYou know things that happen people need to know about it\n[noise] so you're saying you work to ends yeah yeah\nAll right thank you so much for giving us a call today we really appreciate it and you can also get in on the conversation the number is one eight hundred nine nine six to eight free Kevin anything else\n[noise] no I Would just ask people to uh

thing that happened at\nUs and this year it was on Governor Bill Walker um\nOfficial apology um you know here he is the apparently the first um high ranking official for the state of Alaska to apologize for um boarding schools um like endured trauma\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] this is native America calling I'm Monica brain today is our monthly news round up you can get in on the conversation if you want the number one eight hundred nine six to eight or eight [noise] we've got Jordan Bennett began with a she's a reporter\nAnd producer for any country today and Jordan is than they welcome to native America calling Jordan\nThank you for having me great to great to have you on now are you an ca I right now [noise] Ah yes I'm at the NCAA convention in Denver, Colorado what's the atmosphere like a bear\nOh I'm well now being a friday they're closing out so people are packing up and leaving but I Can't say all week it had then I'm pretty tense and\nAwkward [laughter] as an awkward um especially that yeah I'm not only have I like her just for like in the hallways guy um you can tell atmosphere with kind of weird because everyone I Know that there's an elephant in the room\nAnd it was addressed by president tried to kill 'em at the first and all of a family on Monday but after that it just seems like you know the elephant is still there\nUm it's in there and people are wondering especially when I'm Jackie is walking around here though that's what makes it awkward and I know I just walk by people in the hallway stacked with Dave I'm I've been hearing\nWell you got a chance to talk with to feel your fire under um a at in ca I ah you have a piece called we can do better humor and honesty from Sicilia fire thunder [laughter] um ... what did she share with you about you know the the feeling how things were going on on at the conference\nOh she's very um [laughter]\nShe was very energized by just talking to people because she is a very social person\nI'm very passionate and I think that is also a part of the energy here too and not only is that al ... people are still trying to work you know for their communities and trying to tackle those issues so she pretty much um\nRadiated that energy to um she was just it really passionate about events gets woman I talked about how the trauma um\nYou know and and try to push through for education resolution of right now um she's very funny and she also radio that spirit of just socializing and that worked with\nThat ... that if people here um because you just see people that you know you know you visit with family athletes going on and trying to stay there trying to figure out ways they can collaborate and improve our community\nAlso didn't hurt but it was her birthday\nYeah [laughter] it was it was her birthday on Wednesday out\nHere like I Know a where it was one of the I Would have how well people are kind of salad at her but she loves it there and everybody's like treading happy birthday a face like everyone was um [noise] but I did ... actions I only I it's funny they didn't really intend to write this profile until I'm\nMark ... editor Kathy jak today and I thought you must be really good idea because that's so exciting rationed occur over three days and those\nWere unintentional but I got so much from her personality and what she was doing right now I'm just that if it hurt it kind of fell on my lap and um\n[noise] and I actually didn't know that she was for the first woman president of the ... so that would be [laughter]\nYeah that's what I Love about native media is that you have this opportunity to you know do things that um wouldn't necessarily or at the top of news but a profile and somebody is important is Cecelia fire under um fits into covering a NCAA I\nOh yeah no definitely I mean like I like that you're just trying to push through a resolution there so I'm hoping to follow up with her on that and um she was really fun person and um\nI got you know her unintentionally which is great I'm thankful for that and I'm Glad to any country got you know or as well\nAnd what is your education um the the education piece that she tried to push through\n'em so she tried crispy this resolution that uh that would change the wording in the Indian Health care improvement act um is that where you're trying to change\nSolution that um that would change the wording and the Indian Health care improvement act um is the word is you're trying to change is trying to allow tribal I'm a hundred and thirty tribal schools to have access to purchase health insurance under the federal\nHealth insurance program at the same um insurance is by federal employees and employees of the Indian affairs\nI'm to operate the school I'm just ... and so it made sense too because if the uh leaders who are educating our kids and who are trying to change its kids' lives if they can't take care of themselves as going to be hard for them to take care of these children [laughter] um so that's what she's trying to push through right now\nI Want to talk about this other articles or you wrote just recently um it was called why is red face okay parentheses it's not [laughter] um [laughter] are you surprised once again it's Halloween and we're having this conversation\n[laughter] um I let it Congress the sending us we're going to be having over and over again um\nUnfortunately until you know the rest of society learned is that not OK and right now I Know I'm like what they require native truth I'm reporter project that just came out and collaboration between researchers on a project they are coming out with data that is\nTrying to you know I'm tell people that the stereotype that perception of the people and pretty much our invisibility of native people\nUm in pop culture and media is not OK I'm Stephanie ... on that story and she is actually I'm conducting a study right now to talk about the L Y is the difference between red states and black face you know everyone sees blackface\nOut that's not okay but then when it comes to red face their thinking that's fine you know and she's wondering like why is that is different you know and it just saying it just got to be a citizen and visibility of that then\nYou know just not having a voice out there I'm so her study result the result of that study will be coming out in a few weeks I'm so be interesting to see you know what she's fine\nNow definitely yeah I I was going to ... I have a question to you know I mean we're hearing the Megan Kelly might be fired because of her you know\nPossibly because of her comments about you know she didn't really see what the problem was with blackface um but at the same time we see people wearing dresses and things like that all the time and they generally don't lose their jobs what do you think about that\nOh yes um [noise] I mean [laughter] I used to seeing on like her so they had Pocahontas up there and they had like the um ... you know impersonating a an exit can and if they think you know\nShe did say those comments about philosophy at those pictures that's fair to when they're um\nAnd it is a conversation that we're going to be having to having to educate people all over and over um I but I think in a country with the help of social media is kind of\nUm cracking down on people who are perpetuating stereotypes through Halloween costumes um they're having conversations you know with boutique owners\nYou know about these conversations and protesting and I know a return to report on these situations are going on especially with the most recent but is it ... ... ... and that's going on among um\nAnd there is there's another one I was going I Can't remember right oh yeah Andy I'm Down in a country is just the U.S stepping back right now\n... we're going to talk about that on Native American calling on Halloween Amanda Black horse will be on the show to discuss um efforts that she is working on two jets the costumes out of um you know those costumes removed well Jordan thank you so much for taking a\nTime out of fear I took him and talk to us today we really appreciate it\nI don't I ... and you after and a great job thank you so much for having me\nThings curtain we will definitely um follow up with her in the future she is a reporter for Indian country today\n\nYou our listeners who you are ... you don't want to ask them screaming on line or two why I don't know I tell you why are lp upper ... nine point one FM projects will be will be foundation and your neighbor marriage from public radio stations\nDo one on one more call doing that [noise] ...\nStarted going cold turkey ... at least when I'm In the car and I know we shouldn't do it but it's so hard to stop that's why it for myself so I won't be tempted I used to do with all the time I stopped by locking in my last compartment to my friend used to do it way too much\nSo we'll be tempted I used to do with all the time I stopped by locking in my glove compartment my friend used to do it way too much now I turn it off right in the car my solution is simple I just don't do it there are lots\nOf ways to stop yourself and others from texting and driving a will you stop tell us stop text outbreak started work brought you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the\nCounsel I was just the math I was homeless within about six or seven months I'm so baffled how I lost everything so quickly and that's just as far as we sang\nVisit drug free dot org a message for partnership for a drug free America Arizona affiliates\n\nWell\nYou know when you're when you're little doll you check it out of it but I'll tell you when\nYou were saying that [laughter] no no\n\nWe're not too late to go out on the job\nOf when we all know about\nYou what is your role model of all I Know about who you\nKnow a lot of\nFollow suit [noise]\nI don't know why [laughter] too [laughter] I\nDon't know right [laughter] do you make me want to shout\nOut as you know like\nI don't know man I really [noise]\n\nOh I Know that I got a real\n[noise] you\nKnow [noise]\nYou know to me you know you may\nRemember what they found myself in an\nOpen you know stopping now doctors just don't know that goes on now but still no I don't know I'm not\nGoing to do something no no I don't know what was the smoking gun ho ho ho ... no\nNo no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no\nNo no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no\n\nNo no no no no no no no no no no no no\nNo no no no no no no no\nNo no no no no no no no no no no no\n\nNo no no no no\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nMm\n[noise] oh no no [noise]\nOoh\nOh\n\nLaura and Tommy were lovers you wanted to give her everything ... the president had most of all of a wedding where he he he\nThought blind forests not call every thousand dollar right ... ... ... you can log on on the phone call we do to her mother's Tommy say in the\n...

out the vote I Know standing voted in his campaign geared toward native populations in the U.S and in a big part of it it has to do with the Supreme Court upholding this North Dakota's voter id law

phones and eavesdropping something that a German Chancellor Angela Merkel experienced herself the news this week is that China and Russia has been routinely eavesdropping on President Trump's phone conversations what are the parallels with what's happened to the ongoing Merkel\nThere certainly are some parallels I mean what's different about the reporting is that a ... it was almost like how could are\nGood friends and allies be doing this to us if you talk to people off the record you know not on camera they would say yeah we all know that this sort of stuff going on all the time we know that all major countries eased drop and cry on one another but they shouldn't be doing in such open\nCrass way that the students got the last year you know it's not as being more\nReported on as you well you know this is just another son that Trump doesn't do what he's doing that he's reckless as he's endangering the security of everybody it hasn't generated nearly as much heat as paint the

how does it feel in Berlin yeah I I was pretty much agree\nWith that is I mean I think I'm Greece's lot smaller than Germany doesn't commands or tension here probably as much as we demand there at Central air but I think that this sense is that you know the Greeks has done a pretty good job of trying to get the\nEconomic problems under control they basically done what the Germans have asked them and that they should be given a break and of course\nYou know I'm a little medical has much bigger problems with some other European leaders you know I mean competitor like ... or bond and hungry
