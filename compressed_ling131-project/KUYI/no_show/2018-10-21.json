Titus\n... is inflammation of the gums that's when the guns get red and swore an angry and infected and then the next one is the period done Titus and that's when the infection spreads\nAnd gets into the supporting structures around the cheap like the bones and the ligament and those kinds of things and actually can progress to the point that our teeth fall out\nThe third kind of oral disease that we have is oral\nCancer and there are things that we can do to prevent oral cancer although it's not like ginger by this\nAnd I'm very ... tooth decay which are completely preventable oral cancer can be caused by things like smoking tobacco drinking alcohol we can also reduce\nUm some of the other bad habits but we have like picking at our gum tissue one other thing that is really important that we can do is if we're of adolescent age we can have the human papillomavirus vaccine and the ages to start\nFor the H. P. V. vaccine or eleven twelve years of age and up to Twenty one for boys and up to twenty six for girls so parents out there the H. P. V. vaccine is really important in preventing cervical cancer as well as oral cancers\nWow I didn't know that the H. P. V. vaccine which is a cancer preventing vaccine actually helps prevent um oral cancer to [noise] um so with project zero I Know that a lot of the focus is on pregnant women so um what are some comment oil problem um that pregnant women face\nSo that we have a three different oral problems that pregnant women face the first one is to decay which I'm Dr Helms talked about a little bit second one the gum disease which is also\nDivided and hurry and Don Titus the third one is a non cancerous or oh gross I'm including ... granite brand new Loma am and that's basically when it's caused by hormonal changed and the bacteria okay and so it sounds like\nPregnant women can kind of get the same dental problems that anyone can get 'em why is it particularly important for pregnant women um to um be concerned with oral health\nSo gum disease has been associated with preterm labor and that's because there's a hormone that I'm pregnant women have come off the ground in which increases the information and then the ... and um I was also the hormones that stimulate labor\nThe second one is um disease and it's also associated with low birth weight and babies the third is if my mom had tooth decay she can pass it on past the bacteria on that\nCauses tooth decay to her newborn baby wow so those are\nReally important reason so the house of a mouse during pregnancy you wouldn't think about it but it actually um if it's not in a healthy situation could and potentially increase the chance of preterm labor of low birth weight babies that's incredible um and then the other one is that and the\nBacteria that a mother has in her mouth I'm\nAfter the babies born a doctor how you were talking about the good bacteria versus the bad bacteria and that\nUm if the bacteria balance isn't good for the moms and not bacteria will get passed to the baby and then um that infant might start off as kind of a unfair shot at having good health and um preventing cavities and things like that so um or how this extra important for\nPregnant women um so how do pregnant women keep their mouths healthy what should they be doing\nTo the first and most important thing is brushing we want moms to brush at least two\nTimes a day for two minutes so you could play your favorite\nSong that's maybe two minutes long lion brushing your teeth are reset your ABC with your kids\nUm and that two times a day at once right before bed and then when you wake up in the morning [noise] and we want to make sure that we're brushing our teeth with flooring containing toothpaste and that's another imprint that sometimes\nWe get toothpaste and we don't realize it doesn't half right in there [noise] we also want to use\n'em a cleaner like Fox or to like their backers at least once a day so we're brushing two times a day and then with lots of once a day [noise] we want ... opinion among the their dentist as\nSoon as she knows she's pregnant and sometimes there's a lot of myth out there and that says when you're pregnant and you're not allowed to go see the dentist actually are for almost\nTimes there's a lot of myth out there and that is when you're pregnant you're not allowed to go see the dentist actually are for almost ... most of dental problems so dental she meant it saves through altering masters and in fact the\nNegative consequences of not going to the dentist are greater than the treatment and\nRe [noise] we also want moms to get for it punish treatment to protect their teeth and reduce the bacteria which will reduce to reduce the chance as testing the bad bacteria onto her baby and the first step is is um ... pilots guns\nSo let's all is a greedy and and some of the gums and you want to let your mind gum you want to look at the back in the ... and that should be the first ingredient in the game that you have [noise] we also want to reduce their sugar intake\nWhich I'm we want to do all around not just for a house but we don't want to drink\nSoda you don't want to drink juice and we want to limit\nOur bread and tea\nSo pregnant women have changes in their diet thing that might not be as healthy and if I'm pregnant mom has morning sickness she shouldn't rinse with water after vomiting and not brush for at least twenty minutes that's because the accent is sitting\nAround them um others mouth and you don't want the acted to I've been to the teeth as a mom should um brush your teeth right after she throws up [noise] wow I didn't know that\nEither because I feel like when I'm at least when I've thrown up it doesn't taste very good and so brushing your teeth might be something that um someone might want to do to feel better um so it's really good to know that that actually would kinda rubs the acid into the teeth\nSo at that time it twenty minutes after you'll be fine\nAnd then you can do it after twenty minutes okay so um that's a lot of kind of oral hygiene of probably recommended for every one right though even um\nAny of our listeners out there um who aren't pregnant right now I'm while as extra important for pregnant women that advice\nAnd upholds um in general so brushing twice a day using floss or to pick for Parker's once a day to clean in between the teeth I'm seeing the dentist regularly um and then what's the um ... gum I thought was bad for teeth so\nIt's almost an increase in income and um maybe Denise can explain a little bit more ... is [noise]\nSure think humor is a total is an artificial\nSweetener and we usually don't recommend artificial sweeteners but what we have found is ... very effective in reducing the oral bacteria and\nI'm helping your teeth stay healthy so what you want to do when you look at your gum is the first ingredient should stay violent tall and if it says I always tell there's a variety of brands out there you can get 'em at your um ... health food store or some some grocery stores\nCarry this ... that you want to look for the very first ingredient beings I talk [noise] wow\nThat's great to know because I'm sure that the sugar containing gums would be harmful to chew so it's great that there's an alternative that's actually having a positive effect on our teeth I'm that's fantastic\nSo just another side note ... spends within [noise] so I'm not with disease so if you're looking for for\nA really good point X Y y how high T O L violets all thank you for that clarification or you're listening to you why idiot point when asked them I'm I'm Kendra Johnston one of the providers are hoping health care center I'm In you're listening to house\nCalls are we the program I'm so happy to be here this week with Dr Denise home and nervous that Adam to speak about oral health keeping our mouth\nHealthy [noise] so we were just speaking about pregnant women um but project and they're also focuses on children as well I Believe so um why is World Health important for young infant I'm of them don't even have teeth or if they have cheapest just a couple of them why do we have to worry about their teeth\nSo let me read you a statistic um and this is crazy\nTooth decay and children five times more common and children and asthma [noise] and uh I think that speaks for itself in the woods\nAnd and something that is really high end number but it's something that we can definitely prevent for our children and she's very important for children because we want them to have its beach and if they don't have 'em if they have teeth missing that might\nBe a little bit challenging for them to town [noise] um and baby teeth are kind of a saving space\nFor a permanent even though we want to make sure we take care of them so when the baby teeth are gone then they have a safe space from the permanent teeth to answer [noise] and so that's helping with the corruption of the teeth\nSo we can never um get too much for minors so if your child can get it for a warrant issued in the clinic and if in that community events and they can get another four I find that we just want to make sure that their teeth are protected\nReally good to know too and he can't overdose on the floor I'd run an excellent well thank you so much\nAnd that's really good\nTo know to you and he can't overdose on the floor and right and you know excellent well thank you so much um to all of our listeners house calls on ... and ... then your husband this week and a member of the medical
