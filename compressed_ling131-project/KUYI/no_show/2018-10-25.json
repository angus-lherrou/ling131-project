and that he has you know forty\nThree employees and a three point seven million\nDollar payroll huh and he's looking at actually\nGrowing his old in a greenhouse that's under construction and then you know sort\nOf see the sale and he has\nQuality control a lab equipment I don't know how many thousands he spent on that but\nYou know they actually take staff or like a great break it down to compounds in potency all the things that the federal government wants to do in terms of their regulation is making sure that people get product that is going to harm them that is that is transparent about the potency there's when they're they're doing all this stuff\nAnd so what they did before October Seventeen as the ... so which hadn't done anything to regulate this they were concerned that if they were told they are given a legal advice\nIf we don't come up with something to quote occupy the field and the original regulations\nAround the distribution sales are going to immediately apply and we don't know what will happen if that happens the thing is you know trying to make us very sovereignty minded and they have their own police force small police forces those seven officers and they really even if no matter where you stand on the candidates the fake there's this basic sovereignty\nArgument that they don't walk outside police forces like on chairs don't you police forces come in the community so if there was ever a rate it would be a situation so the bad council passed their own laws around candidate to regulate it to licenses issued their own licenses and it's\nSort of sort of take over the eventual laws on not because they're legal advice was Ontario may have overreached in terms of the regulation and they may be able to challenge um those those regulations\nIn court so that's where they are right now so the pastor law that the before October Seventy and\nNow they're they're starting to actually develop a broader powers laws out there do\nMultiple months consultation but now that that they hung out on the window it's dial up to the province to negotiate with the first nation to figure out how this has got to work out to to maintain some semblance of solvency over this and the other communities have done the same thing\nAwkward sauce which is a Canadian side of the St Regis a try you know it's on the\nNew York state Ontario uh conduct order they also\nPassed around their own in term can of this law or another mohawk community gotta walk game which is that the Montreal is also working on the law I just visited a community of ... community\nUp in a north eastern a tobacco ... they also passed a cannabis ... law to regulate the industry so this is happening to me is our past year old laws yeah to take over the industry so it's like I was raised to be seen how the parental governments are going to react\nYou know it sounds very familiar and we we uh the last\nShow that we did about this here in the United states in California I tribes are are doing the same thing they're passing their own minds are passing their own regulations and the state of California if you want to get licensed in the state you have to sign a waiver that says you give up your tribal sovereignty when it comes to ... to this um\nYou know selling cannabis and so what do you think about that what do you think about having to negotiate with the federal government to be able to sell ... I'm On your reserve whether it's in Canada or here in the United states on the\nReservation reminder up in the number is winning hundred nine\nNine six to eight for eight sprinkler voices into the conversation joining us now from Toronto is ... McLeod he's the founder co founder of seven oaks and he's a senior vice president of regulatory affairs and general counsel for believes and he is me teach welcome to me man hauling grant\nThanks very much a pleasure to be here\nWe're glad to have you also joining us from that possibly act ... mission is Christian Sinclair he is a new ... new chief ... he's also co chair of Manitoba in northern economic development strategy\nAnd he's on the board of directors directors of national access candidates and director of track home\nFinancial welcome when he can use Sinclair today\nAnd good afternoon how are you I'm good I'm good thanks so much for joining us a grant let's start with you um has pushed back in your community or from your community about um cannabis business\n[noise] I'm definitely and says Jorge sort of mentioned we have three different indigenous groups in Canada um the first nation anyway and to me the first nations in any way tend to have a lens faith and ah as a was alluded to earlier first nations um\nHave reserves in Canada and they do have a land based whereas\nThan me tea were based in um ah Manitoba which is a province of Canada and don't have a sort of set aside reservations system\nI'm so in terms of the participation of make the uh in in discussions in Canada generally it's always been sort of a sore spot because\nHaving a land based gives you some jurisdiction to be able to administer on various aspects that we can debate whether uh there should be more autonomy or not but having that land based gives you the truth\nFiction whereas for me the not having that land based move said sometimes for over a book and certainly um you know we're very happy to hear that there was a lot of first ... participation and she and Claire is one of those people participating in the retail or in Manitoba\nBut the reality is that the may tea or from Manitoba and we had submitted a retail application as had them at AT T federation and given that I Would say you know upwards of thirty percent of the population in that province army the um it was a little bit disappointing\n[laughter]\n\n[laughter] [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] you're listening to native America calling\nMonica brain sitting in for Tara gate which segment legalization of marijuana in Canada or sometimes you want to get in on the conversation give us a call the number is one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for eight on add one more voice to the conversation joining us from Winnipeg, Manitoba in Manitoba, Canada is Rebecca shore trend\nShe's executive director of indigenous strategy she's in ... from pine creek for his nation and meaty welcome to native America calling Rebecca\nThank you for having me auntie\nI'm it actually is Monica thanks so much for joining us we appreciate it um so uh I understand that you will be teaching a class on getting into the candidates business tell us about that\n[noise] [noise] right I Know I'm not actually teaching a class of myself but I'm more of the driver behind um the creation of our cabbage one on one course which will be taught at starting November sex\nThe actual structure for chorus will be Dr Shelley Turner who um [noise] ourselves as a first nations from across lake here in my Toyota\nAnd until it's focusing on helping 'em indigenous folks uh get into the candidates business basically\nUm well the course itself as an issue aided by the school of indigenous education for that one of our schools here forever for college so red or colleges largest I'm a\nCollege heard Manitoba that offer as I'm over two hundred programs um annually to students wrote Manitoba um [noise]\nAlthough with an initiate it by the ... education it's open to anybody who is indigenous or non indigenous and I think it's important to understand how the chorus came into development was\nWhich was really a call to action from um our first nations communities and leadership who do have um retail rights to sell cannabis in their communities such as Christian Sinclair himself was ... hours on the your caller earlier\nMhm [noise] yeah I think this is the most fascinating part of all of this as we've been talking a lot about the regulation behind it or whether or not where you know you guys are headed for\nUm maybe a sovereignty fight in the courts and things like that but then there's the actual business side of it\nAnd particularly for first nations are getting into a new business venture when maybe you don't even have the experience of it and in the past I Know here in the United states like some unsavory characters\nHave gotten involved with tribes and lead them a stray on\nBusiness ventures and things like that and so it's it's normal to sort of be cautious about all of those things um ... what kind of areas rule will you be covering in this class Rebecca\n[noise] so of course itself is um I took thirty six credit our car so it's a standalone course that's not a full a program\nOn the courses bury a tickets foundational in the sense that we're trying to get people um [noise] enough information to understand how things are unfolding um what the cannabis industry both federally per eventually in locally\nAs well as within our first nations community so of course is going to cover um it's gonna be modular based it's going to have her I'm a number of areas including a safety regulations\nAs well as looking at the plant anatomy it functions um\nBudding out the difference between recreational and Medicinal Cannabis\nAs well as a look at a opportunities to grow into the industry everything from\nYou know looking at retell a to transportation processing\nUm we really want to give people abroad um oversight of you know what those rules and regulations are but then again I consider how they can grow into the industry that might help them figure out what you know what other training they might need\nGrant this is kind of in your wheel house you know getting into the business of cannabis um I have you thought much about you know what the learning curve is or for entering something like this\n[noise] um I've had no choice but to think about the learning curve I mean the reality is that a lifted it started\nLast year after returning from where I work for the U.S government corruption and what's really looking for a job or an opportunity back in Canada and in a ... and it was happening and suddenly\nA a a job or an opportunity them back in Canada and then uh everything that was happening in Canada that certainly\nHave the regulatory government focus I really view this as a as an opportunity to jump into\nThat being said um I definitely was missing something like that knowledge or the experience to have a fully functioning Canada's business and in fact um when we first started out we started out as a an applicant\nTo be a licensed producer which is a massive undertaking and requires a lot of capital and a lot of expertise and then moving forward you know we tried to do retail we finally\nEnded up on it a distribution model which was successful but what I've always done and what I Would always suggest that you have to acknowledge what you're good at and what you're not good\nAt what expertise to do you have a wedding parties you will need 'em and you have to sort of goes out and and and kept them and the name of the game I think in this industry as emerges is partnership and if you look at what national access Canada's cheap Sinclair able to do um it's really phenomenal because\nYou have different pieces of the puzzle that are required to do these like south pole and so definitely\nYou need to be cautious because at the same time um I've had a number of people approach me I'm\nAt various um um points are says ensure seeking to you know offer consulting services seeking to offer a variety of services and products seeing the world in terms of what they can deliver but you really need to get your partner is that your consultants and that you're\nOn the people that you bring on very closely because the reality is that a lot of these people can live up to the problem is that they may and you're just going to end up spending a lot of money and time I'm In a way that are actually going to further your objective and you know I'm certainly um you have to know what you're capable of what you need to do and make\nSure that you speak to a friday people um to to get the best hope that you actually need\nYeah what has teach and clear about that as well you know how did you know that this was a good company to get involved with and you know what kind of fat processed did they try to go through in terms of the you know deciding this is these are people that we went online align ourselves with\nAlmost any a\nBusiness venture going to go on to you after you do your due diligence and we decided very early in the when we attended a meeting just by chance was a gentleman who was retired from the royal Canadian mounted police five years is the most senior anti drug enforcement officer and he was promoting this opportunity to the first nation was so what we did the and one of the\nQuestions asked them was while you were on the er police instead of it at one point to now you're promoting this obviously you recognize that lucrative nature and giggle than the\nStuff yet it it's going to be and\nYou know he brought legitimacy to that presentation as the most senior on the drug enforcement officer or so when we started going to the discussion about there's an opportunity or ... you get in on on this\nA company instead of being a host of a regional say how do we become owners of this company he says well it's going to take an investment in the minds what knocking position\nOf all how much do you do you have and I said well how much do you need recognizing we were your third party and bankrupt but a couple of rabbit out of the houses are [laughter] bombing that uh\nThere was a gentleman than they did they seem they call them as the godfather of Canada's Canada's truck\nGraffiti when I told him I said we're serious ask your numbers if there's an opportunity so he said well I'll make some calls and I said mom you're doing that you know Chuck receipt you giggled than the EU says how do you know track I said I don't but I Know what family researched him and he's one of the keepers of moving cannabis to legalization\nHe said well he happens to be our German and that's where the planets started to align for us and we said well this is definitely a company we want to do business with them they had a long term strategy with a\nStrong emphasis on that just kind of a ... almost ... with education and social\nResponsibility and not with our piece of what we want to insure was the first a party and recognizing\nThat that was complimented yeah social or economic benefits which has\nSo what do we change that discussion that put us in a very unique position actually put us right in the driver's seat very quickly so from a first meeting for the daily signed a deal to forty five days well\nFrom the public radio satellite service music is by Britain Michael Davidson

Saddam is not comic activity all of these things are tests of the loyalty of the week are subject to the Chinese state\nThey're trying to see how patriotic these people are willing to participate in hard cultural activities one of the things that the manual that the Huntsville into one of the things that they advocate in that you asked the children because you'll get honest answers from the children concerning the allegiance of the parents\nDo the Han civilians who are in these homes do they report on their host to like some higher authority\n[noise] yeah that's one of the primary goal of what they're doing it's a fact finding mission so they have\nThese manuals that they're using and they're starting to manage what they fill out whatever activity they've been involved in if they've seen anything religious on the walls of the home that sort of thing they're making recommendations as to whether or not the way that they're spending time with our safe or unsafe whether or not they should be done to the re education camps to get formal education or not\nHow are the weaker is reacting to this well many many years that I've spoken to have had ... on civilian staying in their homes\nHave told me that they experience isn't the pretty extreme climate\nPaternal with them a kind of in ... they feel like it's a violation of their personal space and of their family life\nThere particularly concerned with the way that the harm civilians are treating their children their training their children to speak Chinese leader languages now something that's forbidden in school they might see their parents as backward which is what they're basically being taught by the state and we go parents feel as though they have\nNo power to stop that sort of activity\n[noise] so how do harm civilians view their roles in this government project\nSo I found a variety of perspectives it's it's complex because there's harm people that live in the province who have lived there for decades those people that are from the older group many of them grew up with the guards in school in their neighborhoods from their perspective what's happening too eager to the polling\nMany of them talked about this as being something similar to the cultural revolution in the Nineteen sixties and seventies where\nPopulations were polarized and extreme way and all\nSpeech and action was politicized so there's a lot of concern there from the older group the newer group of people that I met people that came to the province more recently are much more\nPositive about the approach to state is taking they see it as something that needs to be done has essential or many of these newer folks that I met were wearing lapel pin had Xi Jinping's faith on them or the Chinese flag they call each other comrades\nOr sort of a patriotism fever among them also seemed as though they enjoyed dominating the faces of leaders like in a restaurant for instance there's a long wait for food they would demand that they'd be served first so it seemed as though they were taking up the position of the occupier or you know to conquer\nKind of enjoying the privileged they now have there certainly are resonances that goes with earlier projects to control unwanted populations the way they frame their final solution is lasting stability or long term security\nBut it's quite big we don't know exactly what that looks like it seems as though they're thinking that the whole people for a generation either in the camps or in tight surveillance\nAnd then maybe the next generation the young children that are going to the Chinese medium schools now that they'll be able to assimilate into mainstream society so their position is really quite fraught precarious\nDuring ... is an anthropology professor at the University of Washington Thank you very much for being with us down but it's my pleasure kinda feels like it's a global campaign season right now Brazil has a presidential runoff this weekend we have\nThose midterms coming up in less than two weeks and in Jerusalem\nThey're holding municipal elections at the end of the month one candidate there's running to become the first Palestinian on the

city council to try to change that this is a Tibetan here\nThis is the kind of garbage she showed me a vegetable garden and that's part of an leaving new community center he helped get failed when he was the head of the show by her neighborhood council now\nYeah a vegetable garden that's part of a meeting new community center he helped get built when he was the head of us are about her neighborhood council now he says it's time to work from the inside to get these kinds of resources for other Palestinian neighborhoods in the city he's created a local party of Palestinian candidates what's the name of your life\nIt's it's just sort of is my city\nIf he's elected ... says he'll improve education in East Jerusalem and fighting Israeli practice of demolishing Palestinian homes built

controversial here most Palestinians in Jerusalem or not Israeli citizens instead they're legal residence they can vote in municipal elections but the majority choose not to it's a protest of Israel's annexation of their side\nOf the city in Nineteen sixty seven Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state ... as he's gotten death threats and he believes Palestinian opponents tried to kidnap his three year old son\nDo you think that was connected to the election\nSo he's taking a quiet approach to the campaign he has no election posters because he's afraid other Palestinians will tear them down instead he speaks in private homes in mosques and on social media and diverse hired a religious Israeli campaign advisor to open doors in city hall\n... for me because I have a my sister is a ...\nA recent Hebrew University poll found that fifty eight percent of Palestinian surveyed in East Jerusalem agreed that Palestinians should vote for their representatives in municipal elections but speaking to people outside the community center I Can't find anyone who says for sure they'll cast a ballot\nAs a woman named Sarah ... says the city should get rid of the mice that feed off of raw sewage the INS amen next to her ... month says the problem isn't the sewage and mice in the astronomical cost of building permit but would you vote for Bush\nWas the other side of it but I Will not vote\nAnd I don't trust anybody he says his leg and has had these days you can't believe anyone dry out ads\nAnd the community activists tells me that voting and the Jerusalem election is basically saying you can send to Israel's rule another Palestinian Aziz Abu Sarah announced a run for Jerusalem mayor earlier this year the world spoke to him in September\nWe cannot only complain about what's wrong here we come up I we have to do something in action is given up and where would you be you know\nBut ... ultimately dropped out of the race he says Israeli authorities
