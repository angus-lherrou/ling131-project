the same but it's going to go to a being a very lucky to live in the day of it on the one of those only ... the other than I Do want to be specific\nYou know I'm the experience started\nOut kind of on a stiff basis we were weren't sure how it was going to work and we were bringing to pee in together people who were well they were acquainted but there were unrelated nevertheless um we got into groups\nAnd we had a we welcome people to settle themselves into a group that they were a entirely comfortable with it started off\nOur first day was a a bit slow sort of getting used to the approach\nBut one of the one of The Elders told me that as the the group proceeded he was able to think of words that he had used since he might have been a child or even talking with his grandparents in the Nineteen\nForties and I own a lot of fascination that came up in the groups people were just really a excited and intrigued by the um the mental and intellectual energy that it brought

we want to hear from you the number is one eight hundred nine nine six to eight great doctor Janine ... is with us she is a faculty\nMember and humanities and social scientists little corn college also principal is a chicken he lives immersion school\nAnd didn't even before the break you were telling us about this rapid word collection he's ten days that I'm you came together and collected almost Fifteen thousand words and you were mentioning I'm One of The Elders ah\nWas saying that he was using words that he had used a very long time\nPlease continue\n[noise] well we were I'm able to have you know topics that evolved memories from long ago when conversations that they had had with their parents their grandparents a local story tellers or even\nFolks in the community gatherings and\nSome of The Elders were saying well I went home and I was visiting with my wife for talking with my brother and we remembered all these other other words that would pertain to those topics\nSo it was like opening chapters that probably has been you know maybe close for a while I'm it would the discoveries went on a we found that there were a number of young people really really a U.S a surprising number of young people who had been raised by their grandparents and of course we know who these people are but how\nMuch crow do they know\nWell it turns out we call these are folks are college forbid uh children raised by ground grandmother her grandparents that we have some young or you might say\nFountains and knowledge who have an amazing\nA grasp of coal language and we're um so The Elders were able to recognize and I and some of The Elders were saying to me these young people know so much well you know when they're raised by their grandparents and knowledge skips a generation of may move them closer to that\nThat time when probably our community was er using solely the crow language\nFor all communications um and you know we've never had a chance to say well let's assess how much we know is individuals the coals hope people don't go in and take a test and no and get to know what they're what the depth and breadth of their vocabulary is\nAnd so individuals' came in like after the session they come in and said to me you know something there is some new words I've never heard before but there's some of these topics I just know so much and I didn't realize how much I Know that I can share\nOn the value of it the treasurer\nOf it that was the astounding I think measure across the board is the people that were in the sessions just came to realize I Know so much I Know this than uh the the sort of the dimensions that depth and breadth of what they they could contribute\nAnd you know a lot of our elders have retired\nFrom there or whatever their careers were and of the potential of their contribution in this initiative\nGoes well beyond our first Eighteen hundreds topics we expect in the next year to have one or at least one more rapid word collection initiative that will take another Eighteen hundred topics in our living language and we're ... we're just really excited to see how that that goes\n[noise] well I Want to talk to you more about\nThat this is such a fascinating topic to put a dictionary together\nOf 'em are indigenous languages and to have an opportunity to have elder sit together and ah experienced that that's so cool and what do you think about it give us a call the number is one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for eight that's what's a one eight hundred nine nine neither one of ... voices\nInto the conversation on the line now we have a ... she is the Choctaw language curriculum coordinator for the Mississippi band of Choctaw Indians where she is also a member welcome to native

here Jason\nHow you're thrown into the lord Saunders she's the coordinator of the tribal language programs at the Mississippi band of talked to Indians and she is in ... role member of the tribe as well he learned to Laura\nHow they do All right thanks so much for all of you joining us today um I mean I Would start with you um it tell us about the dictionary that's that's a\nYou have for the Mississippi ban of talked to\nA low right now what we have is the teaching dictionary that we um put out in two thousand fourteen it's considered a child version and it has sixteen hundred words the reason that we wanted\nTo publish a dictionary was because we um we're gonna be teaching the talk of language and the schools for thirty minutes every single day and for people who haven't had a you know a lot of conversations in Choctaw with little kids\nAnd it was like a daunting task so we gave them a dictionary that will hopefully help them you know I'm a lady's simplify the language a little bit for the little kid because\nOur kids are growing up not speaking Choctaw and um it's not natural for a um speaker to\nUh you know be patient and um\nCome up with the words does it'd be you know to simplify for a little bitty kid yeah non speakers that's great ... and did what did you hear from the teachers about using this this tool\nWell I think it's helpful because I'm\nThe dictionary that they have access to is the buying ten to one and\nUm it's really um it's really thick dictionary and it's got a lot of obviously words and I'm the injuries are really long I feel like the simplicity of the teaching dictionary has been really helpful to them and we also gave them access\nTo it um the PDF documents so they have it on their phones and they can search for things like you know if they

eight hundred nine nine six to eight for eight that's ... hundred nine nine needed around a TBI is with us She's with Chuck Todd language curriculum coordinator for the Mississippi band of\nChoctaw Indians and um\nWe were talking with Janine before the break about um ... different ways to approach a\nTeaching their language was apps and and the radio things um how how do you guys decided or you're going to approach you know building a new dictionary when you do something like the rapid word collection\nWell right now I Believe we're just using that data bases that we have um you know somewhere it's from the ... area and\nI'm Erin bottles work from the eighties that is I'm constantly having language development which we just got out of a you know every time we hear a new word I Try to censor Jason he puts it into the data and that's basically I think how it's progressing\nWe have a ton of example of phrases and sample senators that were written down I'm In the last Fifteen or Twenty years that we're going through and I'm looking at a lot of them and I'm like oh it's just the addiction is this a dictionary and especially when I'm trying to you know correct or not correct by like\n... um I find out that flood these might not be in the database so that's basically how it's growing\nAll right and do you mean um when you did the the rapid word collection was there any time when there was maybe some disputes about a certain word or I mean you know maybe not like fighting among each other but you know differences of opinion\nVariations of words and how they're pronounced our language is very descriptive and we were involving people from six districts we have\nWords and how they're pronounced\nOur language is very descriptive and we were involving people from six districts we have three bands of the of the follow kept people and\nSo we found that um people and we generally are people know that there are differences in advance and also even some some illegal or even localized differences\nUh we found that there are families and a localized groups that have named every technology that's come along and there are others that didn't do that and so um you know if we were originally thinking well maybe we have to be inventing words we haven't had to but the discovery\nIs it among our people there's variation and we welcome that a discussion\nAnd it got rather lively some of them were\nSaying well this is the way my great grandfather's set it I was a little kid at his feet at the sweat lodge and I heard him say it this way and someone from prior which is eighty five miles away said well this is the way it was said by and so on like that and they talked about it so but what the what the process allows and a and welcomes actually\nIs to have that variation those don't have to cancel one another out they are included and that you know the difference maybe a slight\nVariation in the word itself but we want all of that in there because we want to have\nA a dictionary that represents the living language and it's so important to do that when you start restricting there's this is a way this word as sad as opposed to this well you know you take the the very vitality out of the language and\nThere's reasons for those differences and they talk about that in the sessions\nYou heard the verbal the discussions that went on and and uh they got really quite lively [laughter] um and sometimes very hilarious and sometimes actually emotional and the sense that there were things that hadn't remembered in reference to the people from there you know back generations\nUm stories that had been told of even warrior experiences\nAnd battles and all of that came through and so we're\nUm it's it's the whole gamut I guess you might say of reactions but just because one person says it this way and another says it this way\nDoesn't mean that they eclipse one another no\nAnd um but they need to agree also on how it's spelled and listen to it and how is it spelled and they each each of the groups\nHad to appoint among there among the five of them someone that was actually writing down the words it was the proper accents and all of that so these folks are all literate in the language is well we really have a wealth of speakers you know we've got twenty five hundred very fluent crow speakers\nAt least that count actually maybe someone will alone because that comes from the census and you know do people identify themselves or when the census taker comes around but\nWe have a wealth of information and knowledge and we're at a perfect really moment of like you might say it's a pivotal moment for us to be able to collect our language in this way\nAnd the dictionary then becomes a major learning tool in wherever these learners are and we're hoping they're everywhere but we of course are very interested in our youngest learners\nHow do you feel about um non natives are non crows using in the dictionary using the work that you raised in a to learn the language themselves\nYou know from the beginning we are just very\nInterested in having every learner anywhere who wants\nTo learn the language we're a small group of speakers
