welcome it Michael hearing a little bit from a net about the need to speak up about corn and keeping it as traditional as possible um well I think when you're hearing that especially how it relates to your own community in ...\nWell I was thinking you know it's it's it's really for us it's really the importance of corn you know I Hope the coroner's considered a mother you know if you take care of her so take care of us so it's really it's really ingrained veep entered into our society in fact\nThat there's really no separation between spirituality and an agriculture at home to one of the same one cannot do without the other um and I think you know as far as what you were talking about about how what is going into certain location our our corners basically placed basis travel with us wherever wherever we went to\nA fact Opie I think is is is one of those places I Know where corn is made to\nTo to the environment and not like GMO corn which they army distracted made to fit the corn\nAnd so that's how how deep it is with us as ours is ours um as far as he's concerned it's also used in a lot of our you know it it it's the forefront of using all of our ceremonies us prayer meal and we make over forty two dishes out of corn so it's at a very very big significant ... culture are with us it will be\nIt might go any thoughts on what science in genetics is seen about each

travel with that I'm from the south up to the north and we've scattered over different locations that we came back the Hopi but corner has always been with us um it's it's as a genetic but if you were to take our priorities and I'm sure\nIf you would look at the end they would match pretty much the base and they would match pretty much of what they were growing in Mexico if you look at the similarities and that way you can see can see the the reality of what's being presented\nRight thank you for that I Want to know more um and we're going to visit more with Michael here but you can

any thoughts for college ISI\nWell according to archaeologist they said it goes back around ten thousand years and that includes places like chocolate canyon Mesa Verde hum and that goes back pretty far okay I think you'd have to go back to time immemorial in so\nI started an exact date and that some of that's hard to prove scientifically but that's just are part of origin stories and so that's how far back I think um that I that I'm aware that it goes at least at least ten thousand years back\nOkay thank you for that you see and maybe there's somebody out there to who knows a little bit more about that and you want to share your knowledge give us doing one eight hundred nine Ninety six to eight for each right now we're going to go\nTo Bartlesville, Oklahoma I just say hello to a

to see a little to her Brittany welcome to the are\nHi thank you for having me\nAnd bringing we heard a little bit about the importance of protecting corn as well as how important it is to knowing who we are as indigenous people and even a father who's raising a child alongside the corn in so uh when we take a look at what the bow and arrow brand is doing um\nYou're taking this a little further to in in thinking about how can this be I'm a source for even print providing more for the company tells a little bit more about ah the corn growing in harvesting the bow and arrow is doing\nAll right so um we are a a\nCorn now owned and operated by the mountain tribe in southwest Colorado and we are growing at three non GM varieties a white yellow and blue [noise] any so um [noise]\nI guess as you know in addition to um creating an opportunity for economic growth out\nWith and the tried um we have chosen to build that now which is a four years old I'm about four years old to vertically integrate um the current business of farming which has done by a parent company you farm and ranch enterprise\nAnd where did that come from what was the inspiration to turn to corn and turn it into a business\nSo originally the farm and ranch in ...\nCreating an opportunity for economic growth uh\nWithin the tried um we have chosen to build the ... which is a forty years old I'm about four years old to vertically integrate um the current business of farming which has done by a parent companies are you from in ranch enterprise\nAnd where did that come from what was the inspiration to turn to corn and turn it into a business\nSo originally the farm and ranch enterprise had been producing and filings sweet corn but\nBecause of our remote location we're on the four corners area um it made it hard to keep it fancy as they say and the uh grocery retail sector so the turnaround time I'm from\nBringing it from that little remote location and shipping it\nOut to these grocery stores across um the four corners area uh just became quite a challenge\nSo we decided to go with a product that would um last longer and story a little bit better using the dried corn instead of the ah fresh sweet corn\nAnd what are some of the different kinds of corn that you were going for this\nSo we are growing up um the non GMO white yellow and blue and orange and we make them into a variety of dried Klein products including corn meals a pull integrity and corn flowers and just to know um\nI did hear some other people talking about the nutritional value of the native corn it's definitely true you know we send all of our stuff and for nutritional testing and\nSpecifically something that caught my eye as we were doing it and we used to produce and India and an Indian corn ah which was multi colored along with the blue but both of those specific varieties hot were higher and natural sat in protein than the white and yellow\nAnd what do you think about um providing this source to a place is beyond our tribal nations we're hearing how important it is to me to people but you're also welcoming others to connect to it\n[noise] sure um you know I think it's important for everybody we're all a part of each other's world rental one way or another um you know we're neighbors I'm\nHistorically a native tribes would use um some of their staples for trade 'em and while that's not exactly what we're doing them I guess in a way it's I'm kind of similar we're growing something and then we're no [noise]\nSelling it and we're trying to provide 'em you know jobs and um [noise]\nAlso provide the
