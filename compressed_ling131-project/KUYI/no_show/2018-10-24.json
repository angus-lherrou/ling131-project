a has a great effect on them you know mentally and I'm about you know there is help you know\nThat that's part of what our program does you know to help people you know through learning new cognitive behavior she no new thinking skills so that you know they're not having to always think so negatively about themselves\nRight I think that's a really good point because they becomes that kind of a cycle where if you're feeling low self esteem and low value most software and then you might drink to kind of treat yourself for that and then you for worst about yourself and so there can be that kind of a cycle is I think it's really important and we'll be highlighting a lot of a different programs that exist out here on her be asked for\nAn intervention and support and treatment um because I think that's a really good point um substance abuse is a medical condition it's not a personal failure right yeah something that requires a lot of hard work too I'm addressing shift um but that is really really important to um not necessarily um\nHave it take away someone's software is to be I'm dealing with a sense says\nYeah you know an alcohol you know also you know I think most people think to\nUh see that it's an individual problem but they can do it it's like I said it's been here for a long time you know so there's many generations you know where families you know come from a\nIndividuals come from families you know where alcohol has been a big part in their family history and their upbringing you know so it's not just an individual problem but it's you know it's a family problem\n... community problem society problem and and the medical problems so yeah it's all interconnected um how methamphetamines um tell us a little bit about um some of the health effects as an amphetamine okay\nA for a methamphetamine or when it's taken you know the method of crystal or or what they called G A it for the user you know it it tends to create a false sense of wellbeing and energy or saw a person to use this will tend to push a\nHimself or herself a further and faster you know then what the body is meant to go or the drug users can experience you know severe crash\nOr a physical and mental breakdown after the effects of the drugs where up and up because continued use of the drug decreases natural feelings of hunger\nOr users can experience extreme weight loss or negative for ... you can also include a disturbs sleep patterns hyperactivity\nOr nausea delusions of power increase aggressiveness and irritability ah some of the other serious effects you know can include insomnia confusion hallucinations anxiety and paranoia and in some cases uh excessive use of can cause a convulsions you know that may lead\nTo death [noise] Mm So that's a pretty intense substance even in just a short time period can cause some pretty intense physical or mental um effect from a user or how about in a long term\nOr for a long term I think Mitt users you know uh the misuse can cause you reverse irreversible harm or this can be increase heart rate and blood pressure a damaged blood vessels in the brain that can cause strokes or an irregular heartbeat that can interns cause a cardio vascular collapse or did it\nAgain or deliver a kidney and lung damage and the users may suffer brain damage as well including memory loss and an\nIncrease in the ability to grass abstract thoughts you know those\nWho do recover argues the subject to a memory gaps in extreme mood swings\nMhm yeah methamphetamine something stimulant on the body in a long term it it's hard for the body to keep up with that and so um you know it's one of the um can cause in a very young person than things that we don't usually see into older people like heart attacks or ... and things like that\nSo um it is a pretty intense um medication NFL so highly addictive it is I can see yeah um how about marijuana we talked about that being a a common um substance and used as well yeah I I think\nYou know most people will\nTend to look at the drug is being a harmless drug a marijuana you know it's also a mind altering drugs are so many of their health effects you know impact the brain which includes a short term memory loss\nOr making it difficult to learn and to retain information or forget phone is impaired motor coordination interfering\nWith driving skills and increasing the risk of injury or other health effects you know include change in mood and impaired or body movement\nMm [noise] yeah and then how about in the long term\nOr the long term use ah can cause I'm altering the person's brain development or resulting in low IQ and cancer and to throw in the lungs and in some cases can cause a reproductive issues in both men and women\nYeah so I think we know we as you were speaking there's kind of a reputation for marijuana being I'm more of a harmless substance and there is now starting to be medical marijuana use in Arizona in some states are legalizing recreational use and I think that does speak to some\nOf the farmers are potentially less than some of the other I'm like methamphetamine cocaine but alcohol is also a a legal substance in\nMany parts of the country not here to help the ... and um\nBut it doesn't necessarily mean that it's totally benign and safe mhm I'm studying is important to know that it can alter judgment um and then regular lease especially in adolescence can affect brain development um and ... percent it's kind of cognition and and judgment and\nUm [noise] uh educational potential for the future\nUm and then let's talk a little bit shine about one more kind of a substance to opioids so tell me about the I'd\nPay 'em you know opioids you know it's just a one of the substance it's you know that I think is slowly coming about you know as as being abused or one of the drugs being abused and uh for opioid when you start to manage pain or they can be very\nEffective but as soon as they are taking notice prescribed or they become extremely addictive or they're in the long list of short term effects from abusing the drug or which speaks to the drugs impact on the brain and central nervous system\nOr the drug works to slow down the chemical process uh therefore someone abusing opioids can have slurred speech and the lack of focus or inability\nTo concentrate or they may also experienced a shallow breathing and they've taken in large amounts at once can go in and out of consciousness\nMm okay [noise] um and then they think I'm there is also the concern about tolerance can you talk about that too\nYeah I think you know ah with the tolerance you know as the drug\nThere's also the concern about tolerance can you talk about that too\nYeah I think you know ah with the tolerance you know as the drug takes more control of the body or the temperatures you know can fluctuate rapidly uh for some users or this causes hot flashes or chilled and the person or will experience mood swings or the more the drug is used\nTo hire to users tolerance level so the vicious cycle and potential for overdose increased is ... and I\nThink you know they have a\nWe do have you know some of the\nLocks on knows how with individuals you know that may have overdose from a prescription drug use and um [noise] you know fortunately you know we haven't had to you know use that yet\nRight and that's a really good point chance of the um the reason that people are dying across the country from a few ISIS because if it's\nTaken into higher quantity I'm or mixed with alcohol or other medication\nIt can make a person stop breathing and there is a reversal agent for that call them accent when she mentioned that are the emergency medical services carries that'd be a law enforcement carries and I hope you ... percent services that's our first responders and scary um which is excellent\nUm and we at that will be health care center are working very hard to um has I'm kind of a rigorous policy and procedure around opiates and only prescribing these pain medication when they're really necessary and in the minimum amount that's necessary\nAnd to try to protect 'em and having an espresso they all go in the community um because they can they have a purpose when they're prescribed it um but they can be very addictive\nAnd people can um you know share them or by cameras tells them and then potentially um develop an opioid addiction and we really want to try to prevent that\nSo we prevent um people from feeling that need are seeking more opiates I'm a which for example includes heroin which has a injected form of being that is a street drug um is that common especially in urban areas and we really want to try to prevent that from arising out\nHere yeah yeah and I think you know through some of the prevention work that we do and I'm learning about or\nAre you what you know I think the people that are using opioids you know will eventually you know the possibility to use heroin you know increase is you know and I think that's one of the more dangerous drugs you know that um that anyone can use 'em especially when you know injected intravenously friends you know so uh\nRight now you know I haven't heard any of our reporting cases of heroin or\nBut you know just from you know a clients that we work with you know our word in the community you know that I think there are you know few cases you know where individuals you know maybe using heroine but it's not at a level you know where it has taken over I saw some of the other drugs have\nRain and so we definitely want to try to keep it that way and support 'em and support um prevention so um it more generally shine um what are some of the negative impacts of substance abuse on an individual\nPlay um other negative impacts\nOf substance abuse on an individual include the loss of one's own self respect\nDavid report in applying to schools in principle the recovery or through our programs\nAre satellite locations an hour after hour assistance or we create they places for healing we provide mentoring education and a devotion to getting individuals in creative um creating positive change towards like a lifelong
