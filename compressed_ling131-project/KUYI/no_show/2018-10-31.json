issue but also around race that's my God\nI'm you know I think one thing that's important for people to keep in mind with um you know things like sports mascots in Kolkata costumes and thought there was this within a weight of us in second real representation of people and so you know we're not in textbooks are not on television when on the news\nAnd so that not only the public when you know understanding native identity and thinking about contemporary native people I'm really only a partial stereotype to draw upon um and I think um another point that's really important is um you know particularly around\nThey've harmful stereotypes to draw upon um and I think um another point that's really important is um you know specifically around like the\nIssue there's been a lot of um public opinion and social science research around you know how does that actually affect people how to that effect\nI'm what I needed people think of ourselves and what non native people think about this\nAnd you know what the research shows specifically the work of Dr Stephanie fried bird um shows is that it has a really damaging effects even on people who say that as honoring and so a mask up like the Washington football team on you know people who said that they supported it\nOr you know white students that colleges with any and I thought she said that they supported it tended to actually have more negative views of native people um to uphold our invisibility and not think that we're contemporary to that we still like that and for support and had a negative stereotype about us you know that we're lazy or that you know\nI'm we're not good people and so I I think that we when people like um you know yeah Andy corporation than the um the\nCostumes are really about honoring Native American I think that that lip service and when we look at the impact of this type of racist and misery it clearly harmful\nYou know what we hear that seem willing to when we do talk about mascots and it's interesting how how much this conversation is related to that folks what are your thoughts today one eight hundred number six to record heat let's go to our phone lines were going to hear from a

they won't be as receptive as to you know listening to why maybe that does us and so I think well it is but I have to raise awareness and we have to you know maybe be aware of people's feelings I Can't we just need to all be careful not to be\nSheila Sargent or else it kind of contributes to the war I did grow up in California and I went to high school were\nA mascot was an Indian and we ended up changing it um but our school was really really emphasize the importance of wearing why instead of just you know we had a group of kids that were speaking out saying this is wrong we need to change that we kind of had to tone down their anger\nAnd make sure that we were educating why and we had to do it in a way that he worshipped as listening to it and so I just think it's a it's a hard one to

I'm a shrimp Montana and I was just like to say why don't we clean up our own backyard\nBefore rebuilt complaining about our neighbors\nUm that being said I mean my mom specifically powers if you look at it through cultural of all new to Americans\nEagle feathers world in the high regard or whether it was ... war do you do with her and through or religious Sean market goes through where you look at our culture today and they're everywhere I\nMean they trade you should kriegel parts like for\nYou know just some object when in fact most cultures them highly significant [noise] so that being said I think we should work in our own backyard before skirt trauma center funded in Roanoke about costumes when I was ... years of their masks crude\nAlright cameras thank you for your call Mary in Phoenix, Arizona\nYour thoughts today are also welcome and one eight hundred nine nine six to eight four feet let's take one more call we got a caller in white river Arizona tuned in today on key and then be oh we're going to say Hi to be no thank you for calling\nIn Miami now\nOur own and will be no go ahead\nOkay and how were or were good about a line ... little a\nOnce a year thing where you could go out dressed up in costumes [noise] doodle why people get offended more Native Americans or dress like white people or the Afro American address right white people the first time I walked through your bang for maybe maybe maybe\nTo dress up and go out and get some candy I think we're getting way out of hand and on my way out of hand and talking about math gods from um college in America from their own\nThat's all I I Am there's just cheaper down low and Bob Baer can be worried about the costume well you know you\nBorrowed movie no thank you for giving your opinion one eight hundred nine six to eight point lead in some number to join us when turned back to our guest a man to any thoughts on what we're hearing from our callers\n[noise] yes um I think that there's sort of this I'm\nFeeling I think in ... and we saw this year though the mascot\nIssue in the struggle and trying to you know address that is that there's been sort of idea that we don't want to and\nI'm white people we don't we want to be nice we want to we don't want to cause you know trouble um you know just let them be you know that that that sort of idea I think\nYou know any time that there's change happening in communities or in this world or where anywhere um there's there's always going to be a discord there's gonna be you know I'm issues there's gonna be it's not going to be pretty it's not um\nIt's not a glamorous thing is there's going to be um\nProblems and and you know I think that shows that we are doing something that we're changing though changing mind\nUm 'cause we can't sugar coat raises them we can't um we can't try to make things less offensive because we're not getting to the court issued a user societal problems use or racism is decided to issue that needs to be confronted\nAnd I'm In is all I Want to go to the point that to the caller's reason we shouldn't do this with anger what did you think when you heard that\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBanks for to me today to native America calling we are exploring the world of offensive Halloween costumes and can see it is very spooky\nAnd why do you think the customs originally party city ... and others continue to sell native stereotype Halloween outfits even after they've been presented with petitions asking them to stop a\nMini people speaking in public scene that these are offensive you can share your thoughts today one eight hundred nine\nNine needed and why are so many of these costumes available what about the people buying\nIn sports and sharing your thoughts at one eight hundred Ninety six to eight port\nEat with us today is Rebecca ... a writer and advocate also here with us as an activist and social worker I meant\nThe black course when you think you for being here for the conversation or we're going to go to the phone lines again in the home to el in any look South Dakota a tuned in to K. L. indeed el thank you for calling Iran here\nSo thank you for having me I'm a\nUs so we should forgive him toward you know what to do sort of ... percent offers to feed the homeless\n... they're like OK yeah thank you for your call let's take one more we got learn in Palmer, Alaska tuned in on can be lowering thank you for calling going ...\n[laughter] yeah so I have a question here regarding what is appropriate and inappropriate comments including what Rebecca Traister [noise]\nUm the sexual connotations and the slogan\nHere is very problematic but we're what ... what if we're taking your character of history and um maybe ... or ... or some sort of one but ... I'm getting a comparison or if I Want to dress as George Washington or maybe ...\n... is offensive to me it was my question\nOkay Lauren thank you for your call there in Alaska and Rebecca my turn to you any thoughts were color Moran\nYeah I think there was a really big difference between dressing up as a person and dressing up as a race and so when people dress up as you know like a Cherokee print that\nUm they're making a character of the church and you tried um you know I think like an example I think of if somebody wanted to be Jim Thorpe and dressed up like a football player from the Nineteen twenties or you know an Olympic athlete\nI I personally wouldn't find that offensive but I don't think that would be like I said a ... family and his tribe I mean I think I guess for me I don't understand um\nThe why it's so difficult for um I just I'm for people who are not native to just listen to native people I mean I think it goes back to another kind of a previous caller had about how um as native people sometimes they they were the draft of other tried but I don't know\nEvery instance but in Oklahoma and in the ... if you wear the clothes that is not from your tribe you explicitly have permission and somebody from that tried\nI not only giving him permission but dress you so I went to a power and I just war they call it because I wanted to\nI I wouldn't be asked to stop and appropriately so and so I think that that kind of cultural exchange is of 'em were backed and permission is actually something that we had ...\nUm in our culture and it's how we practice um our tradition in our dance you know we don't we don't practice\nThings from other tried we practice things from our own tribe\nWithout permission I mean there are things within turkey culture that I don't have the knowledge and the permission to practice or to teach other people and if I did I Will do rightfully called out for doing so you know or you know taking someone else's artwork or someone else pattern\nAnd so I I think that we do have that culture of respect within a native communities\nAnd what we're asking for is that non native people just show what the thing that you know when he said that does that does not represent native people well it perpetuates harmful stereotype 'em that they listen to us and respect that\nI think you for that and I'm In a lot of this um it really has made hits\nI um that they listen to us and respect that\nI think you for that in a minute\nA lot of this um it really has made headlines recently too with um offensive costumes The Handmaid's tale a came out and there was a backlash of the costume got pulled um there were words or that came\nOut as to why this ... and yet we still have needed costumes with as much uproar and maybe even more um consistently for years and and nothing has been done um I did want to get your take on that ah any thoughts their Amanda\n\nYeah um I think that um that speaks to the the invisibility of native people\nUm and how you know The Handmaid's tale call fumes um if anyone watches that show I mean I I watch his show\nUh I you know actually fan to show 'em and it's about women's oppression and how women were use a or use as I'm On a very good and they're forced into the ... the um and um and it's just it's a really\nDifficult shows to watch because it shows a lot of sexual violence in there\nUm but you know that was polled um after Twitter backlash within hours\nAnd the end even issued I'm as an apology 'em but yet you know like you're saying you know we had been asking for this for ... I mean over a year and yet we're drowned out and were you know they\nDon't want to communicate with us and want to pretend like we don't exist um and I think that shows that you know\nHere we are if needed people you know we're constantly say hey you know we deserve um a seat at the table we ... we had something to say we have these issues and that's just not even just with costumes but I think that goes into other issues as well you know was police brutality with\nYou know what happened at Standing Rock with a lot of land and resorts and brought her rights issues that are happening in our own backyard here in Arizona ... and\nYou know I mean there's so many different things um and here in in Phoenix with the ... to expansion I mean there's so many issues that we're trying to gain visibility\nOn and we can't and she even they were not even allowed the right to be offended you know it's like how dare you guys be offended um and I feel like that's that's really how we are treated ... by the end that's the problem\nAnd we hear this were to about their sensitivity people being sensitive I Want to play something for you a TV personality Megan Kelly recently lost her position on NBC's Today show the announcement came after she questioned whether wearing black fleece robe Halloween is offensive to other host the today show\n[laughter] it's really you do get in trouble if you are\nA white person who was on last week or a black person who puts on weight we like I was a kid that was okay as long as you're addressing character feels like something is offensive to them when you should say it in a fair game\nAnd Rebecca turn to you any thoughts on this cause further in that conversation um they were talking about people's opinions and what people find offensive um one is taking it too far and of course we've heard on the program today about people\nReacting and it's about being sensitive or were overreacting um can you help us make sense of this in in what is it like when somebody chairs and opinion like that and their met with well you mean too sensitive you're overreacting\nThat's your opinion on any thoughts Rebecca\nYeah I mean I think that that's a really common tactic when people of color point out racism um or people teams\nTo dismiss are valid concern um I think that the\nFrom where I stand in my world view and my values um whether or not something is offensive is up to the offended and not up to the offender and I think um you know a lot of comments are a lot of callers talked about how how fun Halloween is\n\n[noise] what\nDo you like what you

center medical staff and you're hosted house calls this week\nI make to present the gun and educate the community regarding important health issues on hope even live yeah we hope that you will find that prevent interesting and learn something from it but remember it's not the place of is that your own primary care provider\n[noise]\nToday I Am pleased to be joined by my guess Georgetown for the Halloween edition of house calls to discuss something very squishy\nBed by\nWelcome George thank you so much for joining me can you introduce yourself and tell again that there's a little bit about who you are and what you do\nShort waltz first of all thank you for having me super excited to be on the radio all the numbers but a story about myself um grew up in Boston went to school there uh lived there all my life until December of two dollars and Fifteen when I moved up to Phoenix for\nA for a job with I address and\nI was there for about two and a half years until this\nPast August or accepted a position up here and hoping and are excited to fear I write excellent and so you went for the Indian Health service back we do do you know I Am located in the office of environmental health and engineering at the\nHope you after senator and a lot of my work deals with you know the environmental health uh\nAspect of it and so what is environmental health um it's it's a branch is a public health branch that is concerned with all aspects um you know the natural and manmade environment that\nCould affect human health and so you know uh it's it's it's pretty broad range of topics you're right and so actually what creates things like food safety um disease surveillance intervention life safety occupational therapy et cetera et cetera and so you know everything that we\nDo our inspections in our assessments our trends that we provide our clinics grand events that we hold gets alter or to prevent people from getting sick and injured and\nExcellent and that is so important in our health is so dependent on our environment and all kinds of different ways so we're really happy that you're here I'm serving the Hopi people all the way from um the far east coast and I'm thinking so much for coming on the air to talk about and something that's been coming up a little bit around\nIn the floor and ... you don't want them I'm coming out the same place team and\nSo [noise] any ... any discard any insects in\nWhich a items that you're willing to discard so you know if you're not willing to guard the items you know want to put him back and set aside\nFor a treatment but with that\nYou can either go with you know I he treatment or ... or kill off the bed bugs those would be things like your clothes and linens or she is and what not right [noise] so what's a ... you don't want to um [noise]\nYou want your items to be a heat it up to at least a hundred and\nTwo hundred and twenty degrees for a few hours that's the temperature which goes bedbugs will be killed off right\nAnd cannot be done in our dryer like an ...\nSo the one of the recommendations I Will will will say is to wash it\nIn hot water and then later in the drier with um [noise] uh [noise] on dry heat or [noise] [noise] yeah and if you're not satisfied with that just continually dry it over and over again until you think you've got 'em all okay but with\nThe freezing treatment um the temperatures that you don't want to [noise]\nUh with uh your clothes or whatever items so you want to freeze is zero degrees Fahrenheit for at least four days and so to that can be a bit tough 'cause I Know I don't know if the presidential freezes can reach those temperatures so that's why we typically recommend a washer and\nDryer can you just put everything outside overnight when it freezes that I get mine now at least not enough yeah oh my goodness [noise] All right and you're listening\nTo KU I point one asked them this is how often can or John from one of the providers the health care center and I'm I'm here with my guests George Chung\nFrom the office of the mental health and human health services talking about at that and still think he joins you're going through that kind of step by step process that\nI'm a a family could go on to try to south street and home for the bugs and we didn't talk about the pesticides\nComponent of things and if I'm what pesticides are available to treat at that [noise]\nSo if you're going to apply pesticides I won't say that if you know afford to go west central professional cars going with them they have the experience and license apply those pesticides effectively and safely\nAnd often times still actually have access to some of the stronger stuff that you usually can't buy off the shelf at Walmart or Home Depot or whatever so that's my recommendation for them but if you are going to buy pesticides\nI Would go with the dust so these will be your ... or ... and ... and you know I don't know the exact mechanism but ... is shown to I'm essentially destroy\nThe bed bugs and so it does take longer to kill the day but\nBut it is effective in you know nice to meet this earth is essentially just spotlight algae so it's more of a natural\nYou know it doesn't have any synthetic ingredients in it and so it's it's pretty safe for the environment okay that's kind of nice that it does have rattled kind of toxic chemical right absolutely\nAnd but it is um like a dust that you probably don't want to inhale too much\nI Know you don't write [noise] and and then when I'm about to have to say and so I'm so going back to science majors there's a you know\nJust only applied as much as you need in those cracks and crevices or wherever you think they're coming from 'cause all you needed a little bit just a a ... um\n[noise] I Would say that one thing that you could do is a recommendation is to move your bed away from the walls and furniture and then pour some ties\nMissions earth into a container and said sit the bed frame legs ... into the container\nSo that way as the bed bugs are trying to call your bed they're kind of forced to first crawl food the I mean there's ... evil eventually you know kill them\nOh that's a great idea so you know it's one possible it\nAgain I'm actually in science majors are for 'em in the garden and it's just it's kind of white powder and\nSo as far the chemical pesticide was sprayed some farmers if you really want to purchase them um there are a few things that you want to keep in mind right so all use pesticides are registered by the U.S if\nYou want to look forward to your CPA registration number on the label and make sure that they are labeled to control bedbugs right nobody don't don't buy any ... if it doesn't say you know\n... a joke by bugs though or make sure that it's intended it's during what some type of [noise] um breathing instructions on\nProper application don't apply pasteurized directly to your body 'cause we have heard stories of people don't have that in my made about healthy um don't do it and don't use outdoor pesticides indoors which is the thing and\nIf you do decide to hire ... company make sure they have experience with that folks um you know make sure the register and then that they employ licensed applicators\nLack of don't want to play with these chemical ...\nThat can be pretty intense and pretty and\nYouth improperly either by a professional or by someone with a home treatment trapped could cause some serious damage to their skin or um if inhaled et cetera and that's very good advice not to put them direct skin so this isn't you know for other things were put on\nThe insect repellent they'd be for the ticks and for the um mosquitoes but that's not part of what we're doing for there\nAre no repellents for bedbug so no zone if it says you know a skilled Palin settle for bedbugs and one won't work yeah\nAll right so we've kinda covered now and what that does our and and how to treat them if I'm a infestation does develop and how can we avoid that sounds much better to avoid it [laughter] if we can much cheaper to keep it yeah\nUh so when you're traveling you know well like I said there are bedbugs are his record spreads so when you're traveling you know stay where they vigilant\nWhen when I'm On travel and and I have to overnight a hotel I\nAnd his record spreads so when you're traveling you know stay where they vigilant you know when when I'm On travel and and I have to overnight a hotel I always actually during the session of the room so you know what I Do is when I entered the room I'll put my luggage\nIn the bath tub [laughter] those are so because I mean you know I thought that that's the snow that easily\nQuaint little surface November will be um you know hiding in hiding in there so I put my luggage there and then I Walk over I take out my phone with a flashlight on take out my phone and I go through the pillow cases make sure there aren't any you know again bedbugs\nFor eggs or or that can whatever and if that's pillow cases are clear I go over the sheets I slowly tear away the sheets one by one\nUntil I get to the actual mattress and then ... I just go through the same doesn't mattress you know along the edges and just check you know and and they're they can be very small\nEspecially so it's hard to tell that's why the ... really useful to sign on him and wants to ... to clear I'll look under it and then I'll just go through the rest of the room you know the base boards or the head board and then\nSometimes the annual tells the was the chairs and so for myself I'll go through all of that and just to make sure and so you know again it's all about saying vigilant and being aware of your surroundings and um [noise] uh and uh when you get home\nMhm flash across ... to ... how water dry on high seat setting because you know again you know real yeah or whatever however however you got home on the car and the boss airplane you never know where I'm living in the airport you never know where to get them from\nOkay and then how about and if you um someone dies by used furniture for example um is there any precautions that we should be taking\n'em if it's new furniture eyes probably not a high risk there but if it's a used furniture and you don't know the history behind it and yeah definitely I can you know\nDoing inspections just you know pull out that flash like opening scene you know\nLook for the science of bedbugs da to seek will droppings and and and hopefully there aren't any there may be saying he obviously you know\nDon't get in a cut it up so that no one else uses I Am wrong with it you know [noise] this\nMy everybody always tells me how to wash my clothes and I buy them at a Starbucks primary them yeah\n[laughter] that'd be a bad idea [laughter] probably a good idea to okay I'm going to start doing that [laughter]\nAll right um so our question judges we kind of wrap up here and can you cherish some kind of come in ... that you hear 'em about bedbugs come and questions I think that people who use\nYeah so I got a list of myths and realities I read it off [laughter]\nYou can't see a bedbug reality you should be able to your bed bug um ... what's your take it I miss bed bugs live and dirty places reality bedbugs are not attracted to dirt and grime they are attracted to warm blood and common\nDioxide power clutter offers more hiding spots Mm I'm miss bedbugs transmitted disease or reality if there had been no cases are studies that indicate that bugs transmitted disease between humans [noise] um is that bugs won't come out if the room is brightly lit\n... ... ... ...\n... ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ...\n\n...\n... now a ha ha ha ha ha ha\nHa ha ha ha ha\nHa\nHa ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha\nHa ha ha\nHa ha ha ha\nHa ha\nHa ha ha ha ha ha\nHa\nHa ha ha ha ha ha\nHa ha ha ha\nHa ha ha ha [noise]\n\n\n\nYou're listening to tell you what I what Bela idiot when one F.

S. speaking with voters and filming a documentary about it what struck him so far here's what he said and mind you this was before\nHe's been traveling around the U.S speaking with voters and filming a documentary about it what struck him so far here's what he said and mind you this was before the Pittsburgh synagogue attack division\nMost struck by the amount of division in America I mean I've been traveling here since Nineteen Ninety six tubes of presidential campaigns and I've never seen anything quite like that everybody here and there is in their respective camp\nAnd it's almost impossible to find anybody who is sitting on the fancy they're all in one camp all the ... and have very very strongly held views about Donald Trump he is the story and\nI don't get a sense that Americans are very happy politically right now even those who are on either side I think there's a sense of disconnect and it upsets people it's the same story everywhere we go on happiness that really seems to be on the painting a lot of what we see and\nSaid this quiet I think which is ... American society right now even for people who are very strong Trump proponents and would probably say themselves as being in the ascendency so that's a hard road that I think Americans are taking right now\nSo the big question you're trying to answer talking to American voters is what matters to you how varied have those answers been\nExtremely paper are Trump supporters as I say Trump has been somebody who's just shaking up the country in a way that has never been done before and they believe that he's achieving things and then I'll cite North Korea is an example\nOf that the tariff walls with China on the other side of the coin it's division it's the shouting out its they singling out of minority groups and individuals that people find very offensive and\nDrives a lot of their intentions in this midterm election\nYou know I mean the trade war on terror is that's not necessarily a good thing for people in the middle of the country farmers for example are you finding what\nThat is a fascinating thing you know we're just in Breckenridge, Minnesota just a few days ago and we conduct a little focus for their\nPrimarily amongst farmers and what they told us was that even though\nChina's not buying their crops the down by about twenty five percent and returns that were prepared to give Donald Trump\nA chance to sort out this war with the Chinese but then went straight to other ...\nThat is well and good but ... now\nFull and if we can solve this problem out really soon we have another hobby of snakes you are not going to have anything to do with it so it's interesting that sometimes their emotional attachment to a personal choice will cause can out why the\nHip pocket and as we call it in stride but usually megabytes people's biting intentions of going to be\n... have you ever seen that dynamic like back in Australia it's very rare\nExcept in a study we do have something of a Trump phenomena and it usually comes with people who were once calling the shots in a society where they feel they're being left out\nLeft behind and I will sometimes support candidates who don't represent their interests and that happened a few years ago when we\nHad one called polling Hansen she still around and she ran a practical one nation very populist and she was upsetting Asians and ... but people in tourists dependent electric with voting for her and sorry yeah sometimes people vote against their interests\nI read an article once and it said was to try to vote for Thanksgiving sometimes that it just happens to the question now I think that we're gonna have to be asking\nIn two years' time if we come back as well has Trump delivered on the big things that he said he was going to because right now what we're saying is that people who might be sitting in the middle I'm more inclined to cite will give him a\nChance to see how you guys and that my main that this article blue wise that's coming might just\nBe more of a trickle how much does an issue like immigration or what we're talking about earlier ... how much did the opinions you heard from Americans vary depending on the region\nWell it depended to a large extent actually in South Carolina\nYou cannot get away from rice as an issue and people of color they were very very distressed that I felt that that were being singled out by Donald Trump and in fact we spoke to a Seventy seven year old man African American who grew up in the eyes of segregation in South Carolina\nHad refused admission in the lunch counters in restaurants and sort it has roared and he said he had never seen\nAnything like Donald Trump in his lifetime he'd never seen such of racism and he's coming from a president or somebody in such high office he said it was much more subtle in the past and he felt it but he'd never felt this roar\nExposure that's extraordinary [noise] Bruce you've been in the U.S before and as you know the mid term elections historically have low voter turnout what's it like in Australia or greater sense there that you have to take care of the civic responsibility of casting a vote\nWilling to try and we have compulsory ...\nSteak 'n that responsibility out of our hands and tell us we'll be fined if we charge but estranged taken for granted really that they have to vote on election day and we have Ninety five percent turnout\nAnd then of course changes the nature of politics and it's dry\nIt means that the politicians are much more focused on the Santa rather than having to energize the base all the time if you are have compulsory biting your politician and astray you know that your traditional but as I got to come out and support you it's the people in the middle\nYou have to convince and that means that as time politics even though it sounds very to visit the times still is much more inclusive in the basic tenants that on the pain\nThe major political parties for example or you know we have a national health scale which would never be touched by eyes with the major parties on I think in my lifetime it just is not an issue that I Know that if I were to the pot from that that would be the end of their prospects of winning an election\n[noise] do you get the sense that Americans are more motivated to go to the polls this year\nMassively more motivated everywhere we go way hearing reports from journalists\nAnd others that turnout is greater with early voting that also is registration that they Kevin uh issue has\nMotivated and energized democratic voters particularly women side on both sides with seeing this remarkable energizing I'd be very surprised if we can\nSay ... me too I'm voting turnout and we're all getting at reports that inside like Georgia where there's allegations of oppression that that is how to reverse effect and\nThat there's been a very high turnout before the election day by people who presumably are offended by what's happening there and one of the things that are being doing is talking to young people and asking them oh what do you think about Donald Trump and the priorities that he has and I basically site that\nSo charisma impassioned key for leadership are zealots do good leaders and where does charisma impassioned start to turn into zealotry\nWell it's interesting charisma impassioned are usually good and we as followers are attracted to them but just like they can take us to the wrong place and what we found with our zealots has like a flame that burns so hot that burns the oxygen in a room in the case of Zarqawi\nWe killed him but he was necessarily going to die because he was burning too hot for the environment\nWhich he was and even the Iraqis who followed him didn't share the same level of commitment he did so by the time we killed him I'd like to believe I was at the point where I understood that he believed in his cause just as much as I believed in mind\nMaybe more and who's to say he's not right\nI mean in reality had I been raised in his background and exposed to the things who's to say that I wouldn't have been exactly on the side of the line and and I think that's what's important for all of us to remember just because you disagree with something doesn't make you write\nSo can we talk about your own role as later because you lead these highly\nClassified missions in Iraq that led to massage all Zarqawi in two thousand six being killed you are also the top us commander in Afghanistan a war that's now entering its Eighteenth year as soldiers are signing up as you know who were not even born when the war began is that a colossal failure of leadership\nWell I don't know if it's a failure of leadership because there's been some good leaders are certainly a failure of policy or its lack of success a policy if we're talking Afghanistan in particular or you had troubles with the Obama administration your bosses and your tenure in Afghanistan was terminated where did the leadership there fail\nWell I mean part of it on my end the reality is although President Obama had a different policy view than I did not hugely different I was you know very supportive of what he asked me to do but at a point and news story came out of a media story in rolling\nStone magazine that I didn't think was fair but at the same time\nI'm a commander in Afghanistan and is not\nIt's my job not that led hot stories land on the desk of the commander in chief so that was my failure whether I disagreed with it or not General McChrystal let's talk about current leadership you're retired now and we're seeing us troops play new rules this week we learned that the Pentagon and sending more than five thousand troops to the Mexican\nBorder uh five thousand more than double the number of troops in Syria what does that decision tell us about our current leadership\nThe decision to send U.S forces to somewhere like the border is a symbol and in the minds of some Americans have probably says how we have an invasion coming oh we have an emergency we have to protect the homeland\nAnd while that's not the case it creates that mental image and sending regular military forces down their sins of the idea that we're going to be decisive prefer really defending what we ought to do is put drones out to get targeting\nAnd do airstrikes on the migrate convoy and just stop it before it gets close but of course that's absurd\nAnd that's moral and that's not something that we're even thinking about doing we shouldn't even send the idea that this is going to defend the walls of the Alamo\nHowever in some ways it is a crisis it's a crisis because up close we're going to have the arrival of a number of people who want entry into the United states in many cases they have a\nPretty valid reasons for wanting to leave Honduras or Guatemala [noise] a lack of opportunity plus threats to them and so now we're going to be up close and personal with a moral issue\nSo I think it's when we talk about\nPutting military around we almost confused the issue 'cause the route issue here is one of our immigration policy and then America's values and we've got to look in the mirror decide butter values are addressed our policy reflects those and it's got to be a compromise because not all\nAmericans are going to agree so how do you feel our country is being led laid off for me what is your take on the on the tone being set by the oval office\nI don't think our country is being led well it All right now but I Would expand it beyond the oval office I Would say on the left in the right there's a ... to the rhetoric now and this gets back to what we talked about earlier in values we need instead of looking at the TV and yelling at whatever side we don't like we need to look in the mirror\nAnd we need to say All right what are our values\nWhat do we want from our leaders since I don't expect the president to have the answers\nI expect the president to create an ecosystem in which the answers can be reached but I expect the president\nTo reflect our values I expect to reflect the values for me I I expect the president to inspire me to be better than I might otherwise be when I Am weary and impatient I expect the president\nTo be the kind of symbol it says well\nI Need to be a little more patient I Need to be a little more energetic whatever it is I Need to be a little more courageous a little more compassionate I expect the president to reflect all the things that we hope we can be and does Donald Trump reflect your values does it reflect American values\nI think each of us has to ask ask ourselves that question I'm I'm at ... does he reflect your values\nGentle I like I just answered that question I I don't believe that President Trump reflects a kind of inspirational leadership that I respond to\nBut I'm One person and the real question is how each of us do and we need to we need to be very honest with ourselves first and then with each other\nThe question is how each of us do and we need to we need to be very

family members was now the undead creature consuming his sons to feed his phone on the holy immortality they had to do them all up first Mary\nAnn Mary ... they were basically she composed as you
