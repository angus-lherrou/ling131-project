M. K. U. I. O. P. upper upper milk I might wanna be like a key way your public radio station\n\n\nCame on the twenty ninth of march next year or that basically until the thirty first of December the following year in other words twenty twenty or economic and trade deals between the u._k. and you would remain unchanged and now they're talking about extending yet another full year in order to increase the chance of negotiating a full treaty\nAnd meanwhile hanging over all of this is just the specter of it Britain might leave the EU without a deal might just crush out\nYeah and that's something that everyone is it's quite worried about um besides AQIM have snarled borders in price hikes for good or if it would be a problem for a lot of the countries including Germany for example where analysts say that the cost could exceed a hundred and Fifteen billion dollars if there is a hard bread that as it were a hundred and Fifteen billion\nWhile NPR sort of hard enough and reporting from Brian thank you sir right You're welcome Mary Louise\nSo what would a hard Brexit means for British and European\nEconomies George Parker has written about this piece of political editor at the Financial Times joining us from Brussels where he is following the negotiations welcome back to the program I like if there were to be no deal at all what immediate changes would take effect on march twenty nine when the u._k. leaves you\nWell they could be quite severe original depends on what kinds of new deal we actually end up with if it was a tightly chaos chicken acrimonious no deal with everybody ended up firing places each other in person left to you in very ...\nDon't you and indeed than you could see some very serious serious impacts on the border say you would have a immediately you'd have to check some real good coming in and out to the u._k. which doesn't happen at the moment\nThat will quickly to she use cues the pool is coming into person I'm very quickly the companies in person which rely on seamless flow of goods across the borders in Europe they would run out ... structures were closed down\nOn the bank of England is full cost this could be actually a very tales can damaging actually for the British economy which could last for months there's all sorts of contingency plan and getting on the case in case this happens to cook stockpiling of medicines\nFears the fresh food could run out very quickly there are ways you could try to mitigate the effects of that by having some sort of informal agreements but nevertheless if there's no deal a tool that will be quite bad\nAnd the pursuit call me will secondary because\nSo you're saying that in the worst case scenario there is a lack of food on the shelves or lack of medicines and pharmacies\nYeah I mean there's been a some sort of stockpiling some certain types of medicines don't you go to school districts the place where there are ... for the moment you could have she's running about ... miles and miles and miles twenty thirty mile\nCues things just wouldn't be coming through sites so there are concerns that they will be shortages something more distant from the pool it's a pretty serious sets of our series of being considered by ministers\nWhen you look at the longer term economic impact what's the best sense people have of what the effect would be\nWell the treasury UK treasuries made an estimate says about what happened in the medium term\nIs Britain was to leave without a deal with I should be once the initial shock of cost you would end up with just a lot more\nBureaucracy and that type of the borders and that without to business costs will make it ... percent less attractive place to invest because if you have less access to the European market to potential fatalities as well and he got treasuries estimated that within about Fifteen Years UK economy would be about\n... percent smaller than otherwise would have been the case which is a pretty big hit as productions has sort of an aircraft crutch a losing Heisman\nThis RINO to immediately but I have a time for some of the airport place can otherwise it would be\nTough those are the potential consequences for the u._k. what about for the rest of Europe if you have leaves with how to deal\nWith for the rest of your this has always been something that you're a skeptic some person of clung to the idea that you wouldn't allow such a scenario to play out because ... percent of the major destination for European experts say they will the U.S an effect on\nA manner of European produces a third term and they won produces them from the top producers in Germany or you name it they ... they will be affected because you pay off the production will become the biggest single\nExport destinations for movie of the European Union countries but the point is is a symmetric shocks most it's true that to other European countries was suffering as a result of the new deal\nThe biggest losers will be the u._k.\nThe Brexit vote was more than two years ago and here we are less than six months from the deadline and does the idea of going crashing out without a deal now seem almost inevitable or is this sort of thing where you're only going to get a deal when you're pushing right up against it\n[noise] I think it's more of a lesson to be honest I I mean we all questioned the Y. yes I think the wire will be really just before Christmas this year so there's not a couple of months ago\nThe differences between the two sides and not really a steak is I often percentage or by the politicians there was another potential problem which is to reason either put his promises ... can proceed she that has to others to have very divided policy back in London and I think actually ... which are shaking a deal\nInside the British Government could actually see the positive and negotiations with our European\nPartners type anything could happen but I think my face assumptions still despite all the negative noises around is a common sense will prevail on that will be at the at the end of the day\nGeorge Packer the political after the Financial Times thanks for joining us as always a pleasure\n... um [noise] [noise] ...\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News when most people make a mistake they say I'm Sorry\nBut what's your company do when it makes us take a recent study looked at the economics of apologies Stacey Vanek Smith hosted the podcast the indicator from Planet Money spoke with Benjamin how he's an economics professor at Vassar about why saying sorry is not as easy as it might seem\nLike really really interesting study as a way to study apologies so the study was a part\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou bet butch super low unemployment presents his own problem how do you recruit people into jobs that me\nAnd for the next few people clan and I'm a citizen of the Navajo Nation thank you so much for having me today I'm really excited it's\nSuch a great topic I let me add one more voice to the conversation on the phone we've got jak Soto he's a college readiness pathways program manager at the American Indian college fund and he's to me and ... will come back to needed my calling jak\nI think you have to say more\nFree if you want to introduce yourself a little more\nUm you know I'm fine thank you\nAll right well Janine and let's start with you um so you know I mentioned a couple of these common apple or questions that are you know a ... most of the seniors are probably filling out the common after a to apply for the colleges that they want to apply to um ...\nWhen you get there the whole list of them you know I think it's like seven or eight different questions that you can choose [noise] ... what do you um how do you like help students decide which one of the questions is the best one for them to pick for writing there I say yeah\nOf the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services on me\n[noise] [laughter]\n[noise] my\nWedding won three in this last seven I Can't stand the\n[laughter] well we\n\nDon't [noise]\nMrs native America calling I'm Monica brain sitting in for care gate would it's time to start thinking about getting our high school seniors off to college if they already know that they want to apply the next step is the application which includes\nAn essay give us a call if you have questions about writing a college essay the number one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for eight or if you remember writing a college essay and you want to talk about what you wrote about uh give us a call we\nWant to hear that as well the number again is one eight hundred nine nine native on the phone we've got jak Soto he's the career readiness pathways program manager at the American Indian\nCollege funds and here in the studio and we have to in a dorm me she's the associate director of college horizons\nAnd I'm jak before the break we were talking a\nLittle bit about uh how you write about yourself without sounding sort of egotistical and and things like that um you have any suggestions for really hitting that\nThat first sentence I Know you know in journalism that that first sentence that you write the the first thing that you say is is really critical because you want to draw people in\nTalking to us about that\nWell I mean I think that you know one of the man you know as I'm inferred from the work that goes riser\nDoes with the students is really sort of getting to that um or the who the individual is so I think that you know the one thing that I like the students to think about it like when they when they sort of ensure that these are two\nParts of it went in knowing that you want to go to school to make a difference in something I'm so consensual I think you know what does that look like you know is a pretty straight\nGo to school to make a difference in something so consensual I think you know what does that look like\nYou know is it pretty straightforward you know type of way of entering the conversation and yet they\nAre thinking Lawrence actually about your future and you're wanting to sort of demonstrate that you really have been I'm thinking more critically unintentionally again about like what you're doing and why is a school that you're writing to re fit\nInto this broader church so you you need to you you need to include a little bit of information about like your your reflects to major in that and that's\nAnd that's a part of it they ... really is just to be able to sort of tell people you know I Am going to school because I Want to be calm or I Want to make a difference or I feel like this and it was a track that you know\nI'm as a directory though I I Want to put my you know in the past\nTwo but I mean those are I think that that's a pretty very basic you know way of thinking about it\nAnd then a is there anything in a college essay that you really should not be writing about that'd be a question I so I used to be on the admission side of things and we got\nEssays about all kinds of crazy things come you know we had as we've come across a despot of many different topics and I always emphasize the fact that it's\nIt's again much less so about the topic and it's more so about how you write about yourself you've got to remember that the ultimate topic is do you\nRate so um you're really wanting to be reflective as Jack was mentioning and it's always important to have another set of eyes on your essay to avoid anything that might be a little bit off base or inappropriate or maybe just it doesn't sound like you so I'm at our program the the folks that are actually acting\nAs counselors at our program they're going to be represented admissions representatives from our partner colleges so we work with a little over fifty partner colleges um from around the country and those admissions are ups are going to be working with our students and\nYou know we've got high school counselors working with our students and really just helping read through that essay and make sure that sounds like them I always suggests the students you know have someone else from home who really knows you well maybe a teacher a mentor a counselor look over your essay and and make sure that it it you know your voices coming through in in that way\nWe had a caller Arlene who from New Mexico called in and suggested that young people should be writing down their experiences as they happen so that they're fresh and that can give them an inspiration for the essay so what do you think of that suggests it I\nWas a great idea I mean I think journalism your ideas you know be helpful but um you know just like we said it sort of like a conversation that you're having with and it was an admissions representative or in in mission committee really letting them know what your goals are\nAnd why you want to go to school which is something that the jak keeps emphasizing that I really agree with really thinking about what\nWhat's that college education means to you what it means um you know to your nation to your family and and really getting students to understand\nNot so whatever process works for them is important um er is is you know effective but I think you know writing is a process and and the students should remember that that it may take several draft me may take some time and they should allow themselves that kind of time [laughter]\nYeah yeah I Want to talk a little bit more about the procrastination of this process I mean this was October I don't even really know like if this is the this is when they should have started or maybe it was in September or was it last year that the students were supposed to begin\nTo you know there there's really no I'm hard starting time or for a student I'm generally this kind of the early admissions application season and then I'm kind of the regular admission season where things get really crazy for a lot of students happens between January in March so on the earlier\nThe better you know we always say whether you're asking for recommendations whether you're writing your essay starting earlier um\nYou know the earliest you can is really it's really the best way to go we're talking about writing your college essay to get\nInto college or grad school today and if you've got\nQuestions about that give us a call the number is one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for eight also love to hear from you if you wanted to share what you wrote about hum when if you applied for college again\nOne eight hundred nine nine native I'm let's add one more voice to the conversation on the phone we have an ... she's the director of student advancement and alumni support at the red cloud in the in school and she's ... welcome to Native American calling the ...\nThank you so uh you know it's just talking with today about the the process where are you at right now with with your high school seniors\nUm yes so we're we're right now focusing on on some of those students\nAre I'm looking at possibly doing like early decision at some of the the um Ivy League schools for their son working on essays there we actually have um some scholarship essays that are coming up a one event one of the common ones right now\nFor our school is is like seeing all the time when you experience failure and and how did it affect you and what lessons did you learn um that that's been kind of one of the common ones with our kids currently because that's that's always hard like for\nAnybody to to talk about you know something that didn't work out for you and and the and how you overcame it um your adverse cities um and I think for the students that I work with here at Red Cloud um it's really hard to to talk about yourself\nLike as in our culture we really talk about you know to be humble and and you know you don't put yourself out there but in these essays that's really hard to do to put that to have our kids to do that I'm so that that's kind of what we've been working on it at least I've than the last last month\nI is there a way to to be balanced about that to to still feel good about being humble and and honoring\nUm your your heritage and honoring what you've been taught but also I you know I Know the ... the majority of these folks who are reading these applications are not native so they're not going to understand 'em when you're you know not sharing these things McCain oh\nYeah yeah I definitely think that balance like and that's something we're constantly really trying to um to share it with our students like finding this balance between because yes like here in Ninety nine percent of our students here at the\nSchool or or Native American um and here they are they're going to be going out into the world to college to a school where you know that they're not going to be that percentage\nSo so definitely a lot of 'em are counseling and stuff and and that transition from this place to the next um definitely trying to help them do that um it's just so much into so much with our students\nYeah I uh oh yeah ... uh\n\nHey hey hey hey you know\nA a oh yeah yeah\nYeah yeah yeah I Know\n\n\nYou're tuned in to Native American calling thanks so much for listening today we

Renee and do you do you recommend bats level of persistence\nWell I think the process is a little bit different now um when you look back on my own college application journey a college right inside a really big part in it for\nBut different now um when I look back\nOn my own college application journey a college or I even had a really big part in it for me I I work for the program now but I'm also an alumni of the program and I think it really it really changed me because it it got\nMe to think outside the box I I wasn't really thinking about schools out east or really that far away from home um and I think once I realized those things where\nReality if I worked hard and I really maintained a good relationships you know with my teachers with my counselors there is some level of persistence that goes into that\nYou know I I went to um Albuquerque high school right here in Albuquerque and we have a lot of students that are counts or have a really heavy load there and ah you know I really commend the work that they do and I certainly had to be\nPersistent about showing up to their office and checking in and letting them know what you know things I was involved in and what things I wanted out at the college process and so I Do recommend that students um you know take take take that kind of responsibility on in the process\nAnd the ... are you having similar conversations with your students about being persistent taking ownership of this process\nOh yes I mean we we we are constantly having those conversations with I'm not just the seniors but all grade levels\nUm I really think like in the last five years here we have um [noise] um we weren't so technically savvy I'm five years ago and then we've really stepped it up because we've gotten a lot of students on to college and\nUm you know they have to be able to to step out the outside that box in and ask for and that's a big thing is asking for help um for for not just our students but I Would think made a student who um just because they're so used to their their family\nEither you know and then to their external family extended family um so I think really trying to get them hey can I Do this or have check check in um [noise]\nIt looks like classes changing right now [laughter] sorry about that [laughter]\nNo I I Know that you you've also actually like gone by people's houses and and the checked on them and made sure that they're getting their stuff in on time [noise]\nUm yeah yeah that's something I'm I really like I I Love what I get to do and trying to get these students to\nTo see 'cause a lot of them don't see that potential so it's really um they're just like oh okay and then but like when I see that but hey man I think you guys can do this I'm\nI'm Out there um there was like our share this

WLS you right now everyone watched her job hunting you know\nAs soon as he fled Saudi Arabia he now lives in exile in London where he founded and directs the human rights group I'll ... thank you very much for speaking with us at the around Washington\nAn update now on a case that also touches on issues of freedom of expression you may recall the name Laura I'll ... she's a University of Florida graduate who was accepted into a master's\nProgram at Hebrew University in Israel Uncle Sam was granted a student visa to travel there but when she landed in Tel Aviv two weeks ago Israeli authorities revoked her visa and barred her from entering the country reporter Daniel ... has been following the store and she joins us now so there is news on on cause some case today Daniel what happened\nWas the news is that the Supreme Court in Israel rural pet her student fees that should not have been revoked and she is now being released and her lawyer is on the way to the airport to pick her up\nSo take us back and remind us what's the dilemma was for Israel and for Lara al ... who is she in why did Israeli officials detain or upon her arrival\nAt the heart of this issue Marco is that Israel passed a law in twenty Seventeen that allows it to bar entry to foreigners who are involved in calling for a boycott Israel\nIsrael state lawyers said that al ... is a Palestinian descent and that she was the president of student protests in Palestine a pro Palestinian group while she was at the University of Florida and she present an ongoing risk of\nCalling for a boycott well in the country until now the lower courts have sided with the state Breyer's but her lawyers said that she hasn't been active in that group or more than a year she's also said that she wouldn't support a boycott while she's in Israel\n[noise] so how does the kind of dominated conservative political class in Israel see the judge's ruling\nBringing her first name the court is our our costs\nAnd even center lawyer backer up education minister Naftali Bennett who's from the far right Jewish Home party he said that that that was improper move by the university and when I was at the court case last week and tell you I asked Israelis in the neighborhood what they thought a lot of caution\nCase and they said you know if she doesn't like this country\nDoesn't need to come but there are definitely other people who I've heard say this does not look good for a country that calls itself a democracy and as opposed to the hearing that I attended in Tel Aviv at this change I just seem to be very skeptical of the way that the Israeli authorities were interpreting is two thousand Seventeen law\nSo now Laura al ... is ready to go to classes at Hebrew University any sense of what her life is going to be like when she gets or is she going to face pressure not to get involved in activism\nMr John was able to keep feeding his family because his job as a traitor gave an easier access to the black market but he remembers the horror of watching children waste away in the streets\nWhen we use machines or your reasonable so\nSo whenever he goes to work with the body for people piled up on the street who's tied up hunger [noise]\nLate one night in Nineteen Ninety nine Mr John was sleeping when officers raided his house\nAnd the rest of the time with no explanation they tortured him in a dark room with other prisoners for eight months Mr John went through something called pigeon torture for soldiers tied them into a crouching position with their hands change to the wall behind their backs\nTeacher picturing the best for the United nations years ago along withdrawing from people being the end and eating rats and snakes to survive\nOn when we started in June he still haunted\nBy nightmares Mr Jong couldn't even hold themselves up by the end of this month his weight shop from a hundred and sixty five pounds to about eighty it turned out someone had accused Mr Jong as being a spy he eventually made a false confession just to get the torture to stop\nThen Mr John was transferred to yo the prison camp I heavily guarded labor calling me with about forty six thousand political prisoners including children at your up prison camps armed guards\nFor sisters young too hard labor for sixteen hours a day seven days a week the winters are so cold the dead bodies of other prisoners would freeze and to what he calls big jelly blocks of flash and Mr John would have to break them apart with a shovel and bury them as part of his job\nAs you can go\nDo you look at any rate that as a human who was treated like when the animal and the\nThree years later and two thousand and three the government decided that Mr John was actually innocent and they released from the president kept [noise] but he found that his house had been sees and his family but it's gone to search on friends had already help them flee to China\n[noise] Mr Jong bought a Chinese cell phone on the black market one that the government couldn't monitor and he managed to track down his family\nJust twelve days after leaving the prison camp Mr Jones snuck across the border into China by swimming across the two men river he reunited with his family and together they cross through Southeast Asia with the help of Christian missionaries the south Korean embassy in Cambodia\nThen help them reach soul and when I asked him about it he almost\nSeems to block it out [noise]\nWhat do you remember from that time whether it's you see something similar there just fully focused on surviving and making it safely to south\nKorea who [noise] there's there's nothing he could really remember it's not like the price team or the other thing\nIt's been fourteen years since Mr Jong made it to South Korea\nFourteen years of rebuilding his life but never forgetting the people he left behind his friends neighbors fellow prisoners even family Mr John has a younger brother and North Korea who calls him about once a month using a burn or cell phone\nSo let's get back to the car with Mr Jones and the focus of the day the lending food and us based on drives ball of forbidden media to North Korea is all just dirt path from here to the shore and you really can't say anything it's always a lot\nOf comedy films sliver I finally [noise]\nAfter two hours of driving we've crossed over a bridge to an island just eight miles across the water from North Korea [noise]\nOkay so we're at the show a breath ashore in there and on packaging the bags of right is in cycles when [noise] when you're meant and\nEverything else gives me to ... inches away from the water\nSome groups like no chance then goods to North Korea using drones are balloons or even smugglers on the border of China\nMr Jones latest send over strategy is a little different he sends the packages in the water he waits for the lowest possible tied which happens twice a month and then but the currents carry the packages to North Korea [noise] the packages are waterproof\nThe rice and us bees are in recycled to leader water bottles they're stuffing bibles donated by a church and just sealed plastic bags and then taping them to decide for those bottles [noise] aids center North Korea as often supplied by Christian churches\nAnd missionaries are also known to get involved with North Korean human rights they even funded an\nEntire technology University in North Korea [noise] today in total Mr Jong in no chain\nOr sending Fifteen hundred pounds of rice four hundred USB some drive for hundreds parasite treatments two hundred bibles and hundred and fifty US dollars [noise] once the tide is at its lowest [noise]\n\nBottles of price and other goods for the last\n[noise]\nThey are on the bottom of price and other goods into the water and you're starting to see them slow down the current towards North Korea [noise]\nAnd about six hours to packages will reach North Korea and they'll probably be picked up by young soldiers men who are often under fat and forced into their job Mr Jong is okay with that outcome\nOf the hopes\nThe U.S these will be passed along to each one can have an impact on multiple people some North Koreans the wealthier one do have computers in the smartphone\nThat the government has the power to monitor them very closely [noise] a lot of North Korean devices can automatically detect foreign media files and stop them from opening in some cases the vices even believe that North Korean sons are also now into automatically\nTake screen shots and police catastrophe that whenever they want [noise] at least one big name has taken an interest in Mr Johns\nWhere we have a very special group of people with us today user escape fees from North Korea\nOn January second she thousand Eighteen President Trump's invited Mr John and other North Korean defector to the White House to talk about North Korea's human rights abuses\nI thought through our really fabulous interpreter we could probably go through a couple of the stores 'cause they're incredible and very inspirational\nMessage on was the second person to share his story yes\nGo ahead ... to ... when I was also in North Korea political fitness I Lived there for three years old she ended up unfit among the search on\nGoes on to describe his work with no chain he also tell Trump the he was moved by a speech he gave at the south Korean national assembly three months earlier he translated Trump's speech and included and send over\nNorth Korea thank you very much hope it helped them and it's great\nIn June months after this meeting President Trump had his big summit with North Korea's leader Kim Jong un that search on was not optimistic\nAnd my father in law who founded a few of them in blue he doesn't really understand why people think Kim Jong un it's more like a\nMessenger for peace he rather things that he is a devil down with a smile on his face he killed his brother is estimated his brother and also\nHe killed one of the relatives so he's the person who doesn't really treat the people in the way they should be\nTrump claims he mentioned human rights during the summer but there's no public record of what you said Mr Jong wants to be hopeful but he's not convinced that the summit will had any real effect on the still unfolding tragedy of North Korea he called it political theater\nLast question Mr John do you think you'll do this work for the rest of your life and\nWhat are you hoping for in the future of course uh eat the teen ...\nComes in I should go on now is you know we just couldn't be on there though he at some point he wanted to give up but\nNow he feels like he has a sense of responsibility you can go in the sense of duty to make this work especially considering that there are some other people and friends back in\nNorth Korea and the concentration come and he was the only one really knows he feels another put up some kinds of responsibility to make you make it work for the rest of
