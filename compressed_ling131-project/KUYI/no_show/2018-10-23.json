has not claiming that she's an enrolled member of a federally\nRecognized tribe but in a video with the help from genetic researcher Carlos Bustamante she sent the tests prove any link to heritage she's maintained all along\nAnd urging them did fine by segments of Native American ancestry with very high complement to where we believe the error rate is less than what I mean now the president wants to call my mom a liar\nIt is very high rate is now president like to call my mom a lawyer would say you have a New Jersey or whatever\nThe backlash from Native American was swift and strong ... secretary of state Chuck ... junior said using the DNA tests to lay claim to any connection to charity the Cherokee Nation or any tribal nation even vaguely is inappropriate in\nWrong Warren had earlier suggested Cherokee heritage you only Cherokee currently serving in Congress markwayne\nMullin calling for her to apologize rather than for lean to dispute rooms action spurred a whole new round of rhetoric that exemplifies exactly what her detractors warned about here's Sen Lindsey Graham on Fox and friends last week responding to a question from host steep do see\nShe can be anywhere from ... through one thousands of Americans\nYou have a challenge I'm going to take advantage of you know I've been told him my grandmother was part Cherokee Indian it may all be called but you got to find out in a couple of weeks because I won't take this I've taken it and the result is going to be really old here this is my problem\nIs I Would say you I just I'm dying to know that you know I didn't really think much about it but she's less than one tenth of one percent I think I can beat or I think I can beat her reader will us for a million dollars from the president do not want to go to the enemy but [laughter]\nSo today we want to know what you're thinking what do you have to say about DNA a native ancestry is it a matter of principle orange it's science nuns native DNA equal heritage when the phone lines are open the number is one\nHundred nine nine six to eat for each also doing what you know that we did reach out to Senator Elizabeth Warren and invited her to be on the show today did not get a response by the started the program\nEvening on them none of us we don't need to and not always the based on that one eight hundred three eight to five nine ... it'll die patients it can't be health care doc emitted from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid service had\n[noise]\nWay way\nWay way way\nWay way\nWay\nWay way\n\nWay\nThis is native America calling them ... into the we are talking about identity DNA and the discussion touched off my Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and how do you feel about the republic battles Senator Warren even with President Trump\nOver her insist tree is the spotlight and good opportunity to have some meaningful discussions about identity in our own tribal nations phone lines are open the number is one hundred and nine\nNine six two week for each with us today is Dr Kim told there and she's also the author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise of genetics science she's an enrolled citizen of this is a ...\n... oh my pleasure to have her here also joining us today out of\nThe Oneida Nation in Wisconsin is Norbert he'll he's the former director of education for the imagination of Wisconsin and co editor of the Greek vanishing act blood quantum and the future of NATO nations Norbert\nIs an enrolled member of the United nation of Wisconsin and is also a mohawk increase our pleasure to welcome him into the conversation Norbert things for being with us as well\n\nAnd nobody don't want to get your take on anything you'd like to share your thoughts on senator warns DNA test in what this means for our need of nations\nIsrael does not make an orange to truly she's supposed to be concerned\nI'm pretty much just backfired on her and in some ways it's a blessing because it's a wonderful moment\nI think pretty much just as backfired on her um and but in some ways it's back here the busing in Indian country because\nIt's a wonderful teaching moment for all of us you know of the Indian outrage and conversations that we're having 'em in Indian country about DNA but quantum sovereignty or Indian civics so\nUm you know Elizabeth Warren can't be a convenient Indian or for personal and political gain\nUm she had an opportunity to step up a you know on on the on the pipeline issues on Indian missing Indian women um even when Indian law students at Harvard ask for help or tend to meeting she she ignored them\nSo if you're going to put it on your resume you have responsibility and she never stepped up so um I think is this was a giant step out of the blood quantum box of our reliance on blood quantum is a measure of citizenship\nThank you went in and do my folks and we did reach out to Senator Warren to be a guest on today's program but did not get a response again for mines are open one hundred and Ninety six to eight four in the number and normally do some also sounds a little bit too like when\nWe hear the discussion about a one drop makes you a race and we think about that in in what happens when we started using one drop a meta blood you're needed\nYou know uh you know that's the worst measure that we could possibly think of you know in Eighteen or Ninety five a senator\nI'm from ... so you know the only way to get rid of the root of Indians is through inter marriage and that that kind of discussion was was going on all the time so I'm One drop does not make an Indian I think we have to rely on on our own a citizenship naturalization or laws\nOf how we interact with each other were locked into a dual is um in terms of American citizenship\nYou know I Know about the pledge allegiance to the national anthem that sort of thing but I also have to know my own subjects of um of one of the nation and be able to operate in in the world as well\nAnd so what do you think this could have been taken to not to receive such a huge backlash I'm On senator warns part\nI'm well I'm happy about the backlash because it just proves that we could have a conversation within their selves about who we are um you know we just can't continue happened have senators or anybody else to find who we are\nI I think it's time that we have our own discussions and and redefined ourselves outside the blood quantum criteria that we rely on\n'em right in their folks who you want to join us to one eight hundred mining thanks to eat pork eat I'll let's go ahead and take a call we had ... in Anchorage, Alaska joined us today Jill thank you for giving it to bring your own ear\n[noise] hold so much for the call so my question comes back to your speakers today and thank you so much everyone here to share it gets that really is what the caller is allowing a a good dialogue close\nSo my question is lifted me about that definition up for the uh the settler a columnist definition of what it needs to be a digital fall a lot today starting led quite good but what I'm interested in hearing what the definition is all digital community of about a ... is\nThe part of their culture and having that a a lake and your everyday actions that party a community or\nOr how how is it the guy because as I said I Would like to be correct and stuff to lie all conscious about how to how to express how in a non racist way\nAll right thank you for that deal and you know what it's many things and I'm going to turn to our guests to also give you a response to anything you want to share with Jill\nYeah I'll Try to keep it simple this is a very common question and it does not have a one size fits all answer a the most one size fits all answer I can give is that ah we determine these definitions in collective today\nAnd you have seen throughout the twentieth century particularly the later twentieth century with Indian self determination as a policy\nUm more authorities um recuperated by by tried spy tribal governments in terms of determining our own membership and citizenship [noise]\nSo I Would say it's you can't strictly say it's culture versus biology the way I think of it and and and the way that I see it working out in many tribal I enrollment ordinance says\nIt's a combination of biological defense from named ancestors along with a political status and we especially informally\nTry to assert notions of of culture and language and things like that but it has been very difficult for us or after the reservation era to incorporate those quote unquote traditional cultural practices into our political citizenship status and this is an act of an ongoing debate in Indian country\nAnd we're having this debate and we are constantly revising our citizenship laws to try to tweak them I think to be more in line with our own traditional understandings of what it is to be a member of our particular nations but we do not get to step outside of that that those colonial in positions that has historically been imposed upon us and those are what we act if we push back against\nThank you for that number your thought\nWell you know there was a millions of Americans who claimed Indian ancestry as of some sort you know\nAnd and it comes down to Indians are we members of a club or citizens of the nation for citizens of the nation and we have certain responsibilities\nSo um I think it's important that I'm not a new people or or they call themselves answers as they can become an ally but they are becoming a authentic you know their place um so uh you know that's that's my response\nIn when you said there a place where do you mean\nWhile they're playing you know they can't claim to be Indian or or or or be of princes or anything of that sort [noise] um they know their place you know we we need our allies\nAnd ... and the mascot issue a and I think I think we have authentic people who know their place and and uh and can be an ally without claiming some part of our heritage says they have no business climate\nRight thinking for that and you can join his to winning hundred nine and six to me for he is the number we are focusing in on senator\nWarren because it is the part of a large debate going on here in the country about her heritage or in history I her DNA test but what about on a smaller scale have you taken one of these DNA tests did he show that you have\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nThanks for joining in today we continue our discussion about DNA and identity and hope you'll be a part of that did you take a DNA test or learn more about your ancestry call in and tell us about it also if you're opposed to ... in general want to hear from you\nToo the number is ruining hundred Ninety\nSix to eat for a week we are talking with Don gunning deal George in heat in the vice president of dying wants to Institute for\nIndigenous knowledge also here with us is Norbert he'll he's the former director of education for the United nation of Wisconsin also the co editor of the great vanishing blood quantum\nIn the future of NATO nations also here with us his educator and\nAuthor Dr Kim told their I enrolled citizen of Massachusetts in ...\nOh yeah the folks my pleasure to have you here today I Will get a caller on the line we're going to say hello to Daryl in recruiter re listening in on W. O. J. B. in Wisconsin del thank you for giving us a ring you're on the air\nI think you you know one of the things I've listened to throw this whole thing is first off I Want to point out nobody has mentioned the fact is Elizabeth Warren ... any of this to be brought up just speaking about something of that but we are always learn if you had any\nPart of your your heritage that that was made of that you recognize that doesn't mean that you said okay I get all these rights and all this but you recognize who you weren't because that was important entities and we are what makes us support in our lady\nSomebody else treat to us how we identify ourselves as native and I think\nYou know we're jumping too much on that bandwagon we're forgetting about who we are what we stood for and the honor we and\nYou know as far as I'm concerned that's all it she mentioned was that in our yard that admired and at the same as you mentioned anything else you heard as far as your DNA tests that she took I think that that was kind of pushed on\nHer she had the opportunity now that it's part of scientific or an hour to some things you know some pre modern day and she took advantage of that to respond to some you don't have to respond to Trump's um\nPoints on her in the\nStreet she should be respected for what she did um I think is completely wrong we we have a tendency to shoot ourselves and afford a ... a piece of cheese are there and we run with it and we shouldn't be doing that we should be saying All right we are NATO\nDarryl thank you for sharing that they're in recruiter re enlist turning to our panel any comments on that Kim your thoughts\n[noise] ah yeah I I guess some thoughts I mean I from what I can pull out of the last caller's comment those some of those issues are things that I think are pretty really answered and a lot of the\nNative I'm an hour set us has come from scholars and activists and other people around these points but I Do have some other things in relationship to\nOn the street or just comments as well which I think intersect what the caller um [noise] it was an Donald Trump is not the only enemy of Indian country subtler colonialism broadly the enemy in Indian country the ... of what Mr George called the great American story\nIs problematic for Indian country because that this notion of the American dream is deeply tied up with us imperialism in violence both with and what is now the United states and abroad\nOr it not only estimating indigenous people at home and abroad but it's also got saving the planet because he was imperialism is deeply implicated in severe environmental degradation both at home and around the world\nSo I really do object to that notion I don't know what what ... the great American story mean beyond maybe American dreaming in this notion of multi cultural inclusiveness there's a whole bunch of literature out there that would counteract that\nI think it's more important to put out there that's kind of counter narrative that I think is a very widespread among indigenous nations which is this idea of good can ship and living in relation and I go back to my previous point and this also articulate twist Mr George's notion of seeking shelter as he defined that narrative\nBeing in relation and I go back to my previous point\nAnd this also articulate with Mr George's notion of seeking shelter as he defined that narrative of seeking shelter\nThat sounds like a narrative and which one when one comes into a community as a newcomer again one learns how to act appropriately and with appropriate humility and my dad can a court and also according to a nation to nation relationship again Elizabeth Warren has not done that she's been bad can and she has not fulfilled the obligations of a true nation to nation relationship\nI think he's where they came Doug anything to add\nYeah sure when I say the great American there it's not necessarily a positive\nIt's a nightmare or that you know those people the death of a loss of life and as you correctly point out the ultimate and ending the structure of the wind and as we do what\nWould I Do for us is the power of ritual and the ... and and uh uh who able to persuading can hurt someone who one perspective\nOne way of thinking one another and that's a ... or or traditional teaching what I Am saying is that we we make our lives of people who are naturally empathetic towards the ditch and the people\nIn that person is found to have even the single strands of DNA oh ... you know and that's\nConcede that need to be watered and we need a warrant on our side and all she did it for what her family had told her and those stories are sacred to each one of us in our respective homes\nWe have to understand it was it wasn't a\nFashionable to claim native ancestry up into the Nineteen Seventy\n... you know what I only I think we definitely need to spend\nMore time on this and thinking about that um I definitely a slow discussion we could go into that I think he's more that side I'm there had dug in I got a call ... want to bring in um we're going to go now to Blackfoot, Idaho and say hello to him lean listening in on key only\nIn you and we
