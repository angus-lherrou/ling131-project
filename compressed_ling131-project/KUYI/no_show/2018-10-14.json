[noise]\nRight so that is important people often ask what is a healthy normal blood pressure and\nWhat do these numbers mean so I'm a hundred and twenty over eighty is kind of faded as\nA normal blood pressure so anything below that is good you do not have high blood pressure and if it goes up by about a hundred and forty over Ninety that's definitely a high blood pressure and often is treated with medication and then in between it kinda depends on you um if you're in the one thirties\nUm if that I'm concerned are not sort of depends on other factors\nUm but generally one twenty over ATF you're below that I'm not good you don't have\nHigh blood pressure and okay so ... and we weren't always feel it right I could have a high blood pressure not no at\nRice do one or the important things but um we know now I'm the even though we don't we don't feel that there's a you put yourself a higher risk or transferred forget a struggle her her problems later on in life and those are the ones that we want to prevent their highest come a like a big part of a\nWater pumping really high pressure throughout all the you know ... and then at the end you can cost more damage than good [noise]\nUm the

blood pressure so you know if I'm a person walking around out there with high blood pressure and doesn't feel any way from it and why is it important that we find out about that and initiate treatment\nBy so like I mentioned in the um public pressure complicated by these folks\nAre the chances to get a stroke or her Turkey's higher when high blood pressure not only the hearts and distrust but also condemn attractiveness the long run [noise]\nYou can say lots of vicious throughout your life by preventing long term dishes them that Freeman 'cause there's no one bothers dire the exercise of medication like you mentioned before\nAnd that's a really important point right is that it seems like extra work to go get checked out and then you get put on a medication prevent potentially for a high blood pressure that isn't even bothering you but in the long term because it reduces\nA person's chances of getting a stroke a heart attack it's actually going to save you doctor's visit and it's also important to know that there are other treatments out there besides just pills um and so if I'm someone is diagnosed with a high blood pressure we often are able to start with recommendations about diet decreasing the\nSalt intake in the diet and increasing exercise losing weight and sometimes a person can actually\nControl their blood pressure or cure their high blood pressure on their own with out medications and sometimes medications are necessary\n[noise] ah so that was\nBlood pressure which is one of the screening tests you were mentioning um Hector you also mentioned a different a disease\nState that it's important to be screened for are checked for 'em that affects men as well as women um and that's diabetes is diabetes and what someone always have symptoms from having diabetes\nOr you're so let's start with what has diabetes diabetes is basically I'm a disruption all the way your body uses sugar plain simple so there are different types of diabetes we\nTend to know more about it it's always interesting more diabetes type to the altar or other provisions enough business type one minute because diabetes type one is is more of all I'm\nBeing born with a problem in in in the ... are produced insulin which is why he talks to 'em to bring the sugar\nDown and put it into your cells the cells that are needed to um\nA lot of sugar to to be officially a to work efficiently and so sometimes\nYou can um the insulin cannot be produce all too much for the their bodies resistance eventually with two diabetes does what usually happens to body your soul resistance to um there's so much sugar in the body that can cause a lot of problems\nUm so ... British symptomatic mostly times I'm both\nSometimes where able to see symptoms like\nA medium through urine is often ... and ... and those are very worrisome or symptoms because that can damage really close to them um organs but we need [noise] for our daily life [noise] um\nMost people ... do not have any symptoms at all like I mentioned and so the food does while you support them to come to the to the screen [noise] for like that is\nExcellent summary there so diabetes is a disease that most people have no symptoms of whatsoever have no idea that they have it until they get a blood test for screening and it in more advanced age can cause some of those symptoms you were mentioning like intense person\nAnd you to hear any more often so why is it important if someone doesn't feel any way from having diabetes um why is it important to find it and treated early\nWell so like any orders issued the complications by having this couple problems given those type two diabetes might not make you feel sick and you can cause serious problems over time the reason I've treated so disorder can lead to higher tax\nWhich is one of the problems that were seized well I'm the nation's ... like I mentioned to me this is a\nVision problems and the bin Laden is [noise] you can also cause pain or local feeling in their hands and feet sending it to her fingers toes all their body parts removed and potatoes with colors all all the problems are actually preventable your diabetes is diagnosed early and treated\nAnd that's really really important actor I'm Glad that you mentioned that so\nI think uh we hear a lot about all of the um bad things that can happen with untreated diabetes and sometimes that can cause some unease about getting tested for it you know why would I Want to know that I'm going to have something that might cause me in the future to need to go on dialysis or to get infections\nAnd my toes cause me to potentially need an amputation and um something that I always tell my patients is that all of the complications of diabetes are caused by the high blood sugar or they're not caused by the diabetes itself\nSo getting a dose of diagnosis of diabetes is actually\nAn opportunity to control those blood sugar levels so that\nUm these different concerning complications that we were mentioning do not happen\nSo it's kind of an opportunity and then there's also something called borderline diabetes or pre diabetes that we find a lot when we screen people and that really is a golden opportunity to make changes to diet and exercise and prevent people from progressing\nTo diabetes so it's one of these um diseases\nThat although um it is complicated and can cause other complications if it's detected early and treated well if the blood sugar levels are maintained at normal levels it can a person can lead us completely normal life without any of these complications even with diabetes [noise]\n\nYou're listening to K.

I'm Out of northern Arizona university dental hygiene department I'm fire clan and from the ... I have a bachelor's of science and community health I'm from northern Arizona university excellence thank you so much\nAnd Graham manager for a program called project ... I'm Out of northern Arizona university dental hygiene department I'm fire Klein and from the ...\nSo yeah so this time it twenty minutes after you'll be fine\nAnd then you can do it after twenty minutes okay so um that's a lot of kind of oral hygiene uh probably recommended for everyone right though even um any of our listeners out there who are pregnant right now I'm\nWhile as extra important for pregnant women that advice kind of holds um in general so brushing twice a day using the ... or to fix or placards once a day to clean in between the teeth I'm seeing the dentist regularly um and then what's the um ... gum I thought was bad for teeth\nSo gum if I went to listening ... and gum and um maybe Denise can explain a little bit more what they little is [noise]\nSure think humorous as soon as I told is an artificial sweetener and we usually don't recommend\nArtificial sweeteners but what we have found is I look tall is very effective in reducing the oral bacteria and I'm helping you to stay healthy so\nWhat you want to do when you look at your gum is the first ingredient should save violet tall and if it says ... there's a variety of brands out there you can get them at your um ... health food store\nOr some some grocery stores carry the stylist Holcomb but you want to look for that very first ingredient things I look at all [noise] wow\nThat's great to know because I'm sure that the sugar containing gums would be harmful to chew so it's great that there's an alternative that's actually having a positive effect on our teeth I'm that's fantastic so\nJust another side note they're totally spends within [noise] so I'm not with disease so if you're looking for for\nA really good point X Y y out of high T O L violets I'll think humorous but for that clarification\nUh you're listening to K. U. I. idiot point when asked them I'm I'm Kendra Johnson one of the providers at the Hopi health care center I'm and you're listening to house calls are we the program I'm so happy to be here this week with Dr Denise\nHome and Marisa Adam to speak about oral housekeeping our mouth healthy so we were just speaking about pregnant women and projects that are also focuses on\nChildren as well I Believe so um why is the world health important for young infants some of them don't even have teeth or if they have teeth it's just a couple of them why do we have to worry about their teeth so\nLet me read you a statistic um and this is crazy to decay and children in five times more common and children then asthma [noise] and uh I think that that in ... in something that is really high end number but it's something that we can definitely prevents for our children and\nShe's very important for our children because we want them to have a good speech and if they don't have 'em if they have teeth missing that might be a little bit challenging for them to talk [noise] um and [noise] maybe teeth are kind of a saving space for permanent visas do we want to make sure we take care of them so when the baby teeth are gone\nThen they have a safe space for the permanent teeth to answer [noise] and\nSo that's helping with the corruption of the teeth\nYeah because I think that's something that um is um [noise] kind of a logical thought well these teeth are going to follow it anyway why is it important to keep take care of them why does it matter if they get a few cavities in them um but it's actually I'm kind of leaving the space\nFor the permanent teeth and determining the facing and the health of the ultimate um permanent teeth that are going to be coming in those first cheap interrupt it's really important to take care of them and brush them and um\nGet them checked out by a dentist and everything like that um [noise] and then what our um common diseases in in in\nThe most common disease in infants is baby bottle tooth decay we used to call with that and now we call it early childhood carries and what happens is a child is put to bed with um a bottle that has\nSomething other than water and that does include diluted fruit juice that includes milk\nIf they're put to bed with that carbohydrate on their chief the bacteria in their mouth again eat that carbohydrate ether sugars break down and it causes tooth decay so perhaps you've seen young children that have their front teeth that\nAre Cade it's that baby bottle tooth decay early childhood carries and it can happen also from a child having fruit juice or something sugary in their ... the cubs so we recommend nothing but water in the city cup and nothing but water in the baby bottle\nIf they're put to bed with that carbohydrate on their chief the bacteria in their mouth again eat that carbohydrate ether sugars breakdown and it causes tooth decay so perhaps you've seen young children that have their front teeth that\nAre decayed it's that baby bottle tooth decay early childhood carries and it can happen also from a child having fruit juice or something sugary in their ... so we recommend nothing but water in the city cup and nothing but water in the baby\nBottle pay so really an infant you know we were talking about with adults they can get a oral cancers and gum disease are really in young children we're focusing on the cabinet is the carries um so how do moms and other caregivers I'm keep infants mouse healthy\nSo before teeth come in we want to wipe them out with a warm damp watch law and that's just kind of massaging the gum since I'm getting there comes a little bit wet but also cleaning them at the same time we also want to reduce or sugar intake like we had talked about was pregnant women\nI'm so limiting your Britons have Jews and then having to send the model and nice after ... said he would never want to put a baby to bed that has some males are juice and that we if we want to put them to make me want to put some water in there [noise] okay so\nThose are really important thing and to make sure that we're not contributing to that um baby bottle tooth decay or the early childhood carries 'em by providing um even diluted you I'm In bottles um what are some other suggestion but you have\nFound limiting snacks between males sometimes are made me skins um wanna eat all the time but if we want to give them snacks me wanting to some good healthy snacks and\nShe says the good alternative there's not um veggies they have some cool ideas like putting them making veggies in two different animal shapes that helps some can teach them a little bit more and once the teeth are and we want him brush at least two times a day just like the adults\nOut make sure we're using free toothpaste once right before bed and do not drink or any um eat anything after we brush our teeth that's\nAnother good point so if we brush our teeth and baby wants to eat something at a time I went to see something we want to refreshed I keep thinking before they go to speak for the night we want to read juice\nAnd have no ... to use our bottle after the age of one\nWe also want children to visit the dentist before the age of one [noise]\nAnd you don't want to put any honey and types of fires we hear that on something like my mom would do on my grandmother would do in their time is tiny baby the fire and we definitely don't want to do that [noise] and we want it clean the pacifier is with a\nLot of warm water and washing just like how we would do wash out and bought all we don't want to clean up a pacifier with babies are mom smells like sometimes the jumps on the far oh we'll just put it in their mouth and um give it back to baby but\nThat is where the bacteria transfers from mom to baby so we don't want that to happen they also have these cool little pacifier whites that we can buy like at Wal Mart but\nUm we can carry around and watch them off with [noise] and with when we brush our our toddlers teeth we want to be sure and use just a little green size amount of toothpaste on there for babies\nAnd then ... if they're able to we can use that piece ice amount of toothpaste and same with adults that we don't want to over used to be and that's I think something as a as a new mom I was putting a bunch of toothpaste on there until I realized oh my gosh I'm giving my baby too much and um this is a\nQuestion that I'm just curious about um how about you know when a child has those just sort of two front teeth um so we're supposed to start brushing do we also brush the guns are just too little piece well if you're brushing correctly you can actually brush their teeth and the gums at the same time so when we brush we recommend that you take the angle\nOf the toothbrush it about a forty five degree angle so we're getting actually in between the gum tissue and the two itself and we do little tiny circles and that'll help clean the baby's both the gums and the teeth at the same time so we don't need to separately brush\nThe gum tissue okay how about um if the rest of the guns don't have any teeth on them should we be brushing Moser\nLeave those alone we could use a damp washed cloth again like we do a child without any teeth just don't warm damp washed costs just rubbed their tea especially if they're starting to evening that warm rubbing motion feels really good to a baby you seemed just relax a little\nBit so and again it gets them used to fingers in the mouth to some used to a toothbrush so we want to have that gum tissue stimulated just for the fact of getting used\nTo it excellent parts of the mouse that are just gums no teeth yet clean those with a warm damp um wash crop and then when the teeth come in rush both teeth and the gums adjacent to the teeth with a toothbrush\nCorrect All right I think I got it from my house at the dollar store and they have these clothes stink or I'm cleaning pollster like plastic than the ... on there and\nUse that for baby too so it just goes right over your finger and you just touch the baby comes with that too so that's another way to clean excellence and then\nUm I think it's really important to point out the snacks\nChoices is really important and so figuring out how to cut the um the vegetables and defined shape so they're exciting to eat um cheese and not for a good alternative that don't have quite so much carbohydrates that are going to sit on the teeth and cause cavities\nExcellence and so as we wrap up here in our last couple of minutes I wanted to ask a little bit more about a project zero women in in since uh what is this project and um\nNa na na na na na na na\nNow than like the\nDark and put it on my job than guns\nI mean now we gotta get back in time we're borrowing and then go in there a balance but my ...\nYear rainy and conscious and at a time when they\n\nHave a dream a man on a\nVery dark around\nWhere I'm standing on our water transfer

like he's an actor\nAnd he is the may ... in synch in welcome back to Native American calling for having so much for having me\nYeah it's great to have you back in the studio it's been it's been a few years has yet [laughter] so um let's say it was a little bit of your history when did you know that you want it to be an actor\nI think it was something that never really I think occurred to me like it was such a weird um\nThing I think like in elementary school I remember one of my friends and classmates was actually an extra\nIn I think that that moon movie with that shot here with a Africa some weird film that was shot here about a man like making a spaceship and his farm house [laughter] and uh like she was an extra in it and it just seemed like such a weird foreign thing it was like\nShe became like a celebrity in our school because she was just like extra and she was like oh I had a line but then they cut it and then but I'm Still in the film and if you get it like you can see it and it was just like such a crazy thing to be on the screen and I think as time went on um you know I got into like acting classes I\nStarted just doing like improv at um selecting academy and doing a small theater stuff at Albuquerque little theater and\nUm it was crazy and like it was just fun for me I think it was I mean that was\nAn escape and something that was you know just like it was if this space where anything can kind of the possible anything that you can conceive of can just you can create in front of you and you don't need anything else just besides yourself as a beautiful little\nI'm sort of exercises or it's just all play and eventually I started auditioning for films through a and an film dot com where there was open casting calls and\nUm I started going out for stuff like that the first thing I went out for was ah Chris air film that unfortunately it hasn't been made um it's called man called buffalo and through that process of going out for it I met a woman named Renee Haynes who's one of the most prominent casting directors of native people today and\nUm she kept their tabs on me and then eventually just sent me a lot more material and I got a bunch of parts they fell through pretty much all of them until revenue and so I guess that's kind of my process and journey\nWhat was the audition for food around and it's like\nIt was insane I think so much of that process was where I learned how to act\nI'm the first time\nI sense in the south taped I'm the director really liked it and I guess found some kernel of truth in it because\nThe second audition I had they sent my now acting teacher a woman named Angela gives a to my house and she like\nCoach me through the process of um of what this character might be feeling when he might be thinking and she just helped me find the character and I sense in that tape and uh then I was flown to LA where I met the director and I\nSpent the entire time like an hour just speaking with him before I even went into the scene and um\nWhen I went to the scene he told me to just throw away all the words and just say one two three and go through the action of the ... and like oh interesting yeah and he just wanted this level of truth and this level of authenticity that\nHe could see without even hearing words and I think that's the beauty of um you know like I was so fortunate to work with artists like that because from the get go it was never about like\nThis label or this character that you're playing or like oh like your native or you look native ... straight hair you or whatever so your this character because you look at it was like you know let's put all that aside and if your eyes and your whole body\nTruth and this level of authenticity that he could see without even hearing words and I think that's the beauty of um you know like I was so fortunate to work with artists like that because from the get go it was never about like\nThis label or this character that you're playing or like oh like your native or you look native ... straight hair you or whatever so your this character because you look at it was like\nYou know let's put all that aside and if your eyes and your whole body isn't telling the truth of the scene than what you're doing is fake and\nIf you can say one two three and scream at me and like\nUm go through this really intense scene and I believe you than truth is coming from somewhere deeper and I think I took that with me um since that audition and it's definitely influenced how I Do future roles\nWe're talking with actor forest gridlock today he is on needed in the spotlight and if you have a question for him or comment give us a call\nThe number is one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for eight that's her for one eight hundred nine nine need and if so do you have anything that I'm sort of you imagine or goes through your mind\nWhen you're getting prepared for role do you do you have any kind of method\nUm yeah I think every role is so different and that I mean when I go and like first I Try to see who this character is and see what about him is similar to I Am and what about him is very different from what I Am and from there it's like\nYou just have an array of tools that you can use and I think every character so different that along the process I'm Still\nLike learning from the characters and like whenever I tried to use different tools to become them or to feel where they're coming from um you start to realize what work works and doesn't work um\nAnd then from there you have to get creative and then try to find what works for you like 'cause I delving into your own past or your own person and pulling up emotions and feelings and a times in your life that made you feel similarly\nAnd using that in the scene and um that can be powerful or it can also be super emotionally draining where it's like you're going back to this a horrible moment in your life and uses juicing that for the emotion of it\nAnd then the scariest moment is when you're doing that it's like when you come up dry and like you're squeezing that sponge and it's just dry and you have to look somewhere else or somewhere deeper\nOr use something that's completely different like what if this was actually happening to me and um there's just so many told them I'm not a classically trained actor I'm not\nI never went to the acting school\nA per se or rather than just like classes but I think I've been fortunate enough to like be around people who are so smart and so it's awful with their process that I've just been able to watch them and basically see\nWhat they did and use that for myself and I think you pick up different tools along the way and do you ever do that\nAny kind of research on the Internet about the subject of the the the you know film that you're doing or anything like that\nYeah I think um with like the Mets education of camera post playing out I'm ready goal was interesting because you know as a native person I ... a man that had Alzheimer's Shannon than I and I come from this crazy like grab bag of native cultures so\nAnd um I bought a pair of skate and I immediately went to\nThe Albuquerque rank up on a tram way and just went every day and the first thing that I like tried to do was just learned to stop and I was like if I if I can stop like I'm good so I spent two weeks like a crazy person going back and forth from these walls\nUm like on the side of the rain just trying to stop trying to stop trying to stop and finally getting it and\nUm I've been told later because one of the teachers who was their wife initially\nLearn from after I learned just basic skating was like yeah I saw you are for weeks and you were like such an odd ball and I just saw you trying to stop\nLike a hundred times and then after two hours you just went home and I was just wondering who you were what you're doing because usually they just get like teenagers like taking selfies while the eye's been ever just get some random kid like super into trying to learn to skate\nWell it is the middle of the desert here so ice skating is not non not healer what was the area where you where he filmed in horse and what was it like\nUm it was really amazing we saw in ... Ontario and Peterborough, Ontario\nSuch an odd ball and I just saw you trying to stop like a hundred times and then after two hours you just went home and I was just wondering who you were what you're doing because usually they just get like teenagers like taking out before the eyes they never just get some random kid like super er into trying to learn to skate\nWell it is the middle of the desert here so ice skating is not not in the last what was the area where you where he filmed in horse um what was it like\nUm it was really amazing we saw in ... Ontario and Peterborough, Ontario and the first place we shot at was abandoned none hurry I'm where he's at school takes place so it wasn't a formal residential school but um it kind of\nI don't know I guess once you imprint that story upon a place that kind of is less little changed so it's kind of interesting to shoot there and um the other places we shot him just hockey rings across Canada and the hardest part about shooting this is we shot\nDuring um little league championships\nSo it was actually like it was finding like an hour or two between little league games to try to chew on the ice and\nIt was a complete nightmare but somehow the scheduling and everything we we finished at all [noise] did you ever as fall down or having in Santa Rosa awful like we actually had to shoot in period\nSkates so I saw those old ones yeah is films each place in the fifties and since you're Indian you're not getting new skate so we had to shoot in case from the thirties so we had these periods gates that we're even old for the time period that we're shooting in that we're basically leather flip flops with knives on the bottom allow and\nWe had to be able to learn how to skate like re learn how to skate and the worst case of manageable where\nIf you like hit an edgy probably break an ankle so we were playing in those and um everybody went for everybody was like no like even if it's a close up shot I'll take the I'll tape the periods skates and um there were moments where we're shooting on ice\nThat they had just ... down the night before because they knew would freeze and I'm\nThere would be like just huge chunks of ice sitting around and there's this one particular shot in the film that even in the trailer if you look it up where the camera um\nUm and that might or like starts when I just slide into a stop at my feet and then it pans up quickly to my face and we're running out of light and we're trying to get this perfect shot\nAnd every time I get it right the camera and mess up and every time I Would just trip and fall the camera will be perfect so he took about like Fifteen to twenty tapes trying to get the shot right and at one moment before we finally got it I actually just like scared stopped hit an edge that was like because of the\nIce was on ... and I fell into the director and the camera man like ... like the director is somebody who like he shot three billboards outside ebbing Missouri like it's just crazy talented guy\nAnd the cinematography first shot little big eyes and like Dallas Buyers club I too heavy hitters and I just fell right into them and I felt horrible but um it was good we got the shot\n[laughter] well we're talking with forests gridlock today and he is on native in the spotlight and if you have a question for him maybe you want to know um how he feels about being an\nActor or maybe you have questions I'm about his life he's met some pretty famous people give us a call the number is one eight hundred nine nine six to eight for eight that some ... hundred nine nine need as and so eh that's a question you can get quite a bit about like you know\nHobnobbing with famous people how do you feel about it\nUm I mean I don't know I think\nWhen I was on the set of revenue beliefs like most people tell me they would just be so freaked out to work with people like Tom party or people like Leonardo DiCaprio\nAnd for me I was like shaking around the ... the cinematographer sees the center of [laughter] now that I said it again and said that since August ... director um I was like so nervous around them because\nFor me like I'm you know a novice director and I think\nBeing around the people who facilitate and create the peace\nOr the true masters to me and I'm being around people like all Hondros in ... I was like so nervous around them and\nConstantly trying to just watch what they were doing and see why they're films are on a completely different plane than everybody else and for me like they were the SARS the film and you know Leo and Tom I think\nI mean at the end of the day everybody is just like an old\nPerson I think the the nicest thing to learn about people that they are so flawed same menu and that they're not doing too much differently um\nIn terms of creating and just to like sharing the are the only difference is that there is so I think\nNot scared to show who they are and I think that's really beautiful who's your favorite filmmaker um I'd have to say this is my completely unbiased a unswayed opinion probably a hundred and yeah I Do too that's alive today but um\nIn terms of all time probably Stanley Kubrick why I guess because his films are so his films are so intelligent and I\nThink she was ... I don't know if he's like the best director in by any means like so many people have just channeled\nCompletely different ways of looking as cinema like um you know city of God or films like ... enter films that just pushed didn't like even you wouldn't have really here by Lynne Ramsay like our films that pushed the medium and really interesting ways but for me\nStanley Kubrick is someone who I look up to because the amount of thought and the amount of meticulous process he uses to\nCome up with his art in a very ethical and moral way I think there's no other way to go about filmmaking and art and acting in general like\nWithout really deeply looking at the reasons why you're making your art and the reason why you're doing something and\nHe's someone who would take seven years to build a project about the Holocaust and then completely throw it away because it's just too harsh or the subject I think for any one person to graft and I think that takes\nA huge amount of courage to admit to yourself that there's even stuff in this world that you can look at it as much as he can and that you can never make sense of and um for me like someone who's so\nDedicated to ethics and morality and intellectually intellectually looking at our um I look up to that ...\nToday we're talking with Frank good lucky and I needed in the spotlight he's got some coming up I'm it's out in select cities right now\nIt's called the ... camera in post um but it'll be out later this month nationwide and I'm just going to find who's got Claudia in Albuquerque tuned in on key you and and have their Claudia\nHi Hi Hi how are you doing I'm calling I Know I had to I think he'll member hey yeah you tell me how to skate [laughter] right [laughter] well I wanted them [laughter] I'm Glad it yeah\nComing up I'm it's out in select cities right now it's called the myth education of camera in post um but it'll be out later this month nationwide and uh let's go to the front lines we've got Claudia in Albuquerque tuned in on key you and and have their Claudia\nHi Hi how are you doing\nI'm calling I Know I had to I think you'll remember oh hey yeah you taught me how to skate [laughter] right [laughter] well I wanted them [laughter] I'm so proud and great to hear you and I we can you tell them I like and the teacher\nUm\nAnd I'm curious to know what are your plans on how the U.S out and if he is now\nYeah thanks so much um Claudio taught me how to like she was the one who saw me going back and what do I mean like as a crazy person but um yeah um I don't know in the next few years I'm going to school I'm attending Stanford University and\nI'm just looking to get a broad of a education I think it's possible\nUm I think in terms of filmmaking enacting the best way to learn about\nFilmmaking and acting is to not learn about it and just learned about you know different things but history other cultures psychology philosophy and you know become this moral investigator and really create your foundation I'm\nFrom a widespread and array of education I think my parents taught me that is very young age and um I guess in the next few years I'm just trying to learn as much as possible and be the stupidest person in the room at Stanford so everybody else can\nYou know educate me and I'll just want to sit back and learn from very smart people so that's what I'm hoping to do\nGreat that's wonderful plan and I look forward to seeing you on a screen all your life [laughter]\nBut we're actually doing a Indian Horse screening on the sixteenth a red rash and film festival in Santa Fe so I think there's like it's available for that so you get to see what you if I if you taught me well or not [laughter]\nWrapped up in in stereotypes in in you know things in the past that you you just sort of a reject\nOut yeah one thing the funny thing is I'm an interesting thing is after the slate and a little kid got his head shaved she loves the short haired though like he loves the style it up and like he's like he'd be style and and he's like it's so funny like he's low balling now but um\nI don't know it's interesting to have short hair like I used to try to straighten my hair for role and um try to look the part and I think you know at a certain moment after working on the revenue and I kind of realize that I don't want to do that anymore and\nI'm only going to be a part of projects that are artistic and that have integrity and that hold respect I think for the character um\nFor me it's it's hard to accept the roles that try to pin you it's a stereotype or try to turn Indian is into something that's not and for me it's never been hard to turn down you know less than respect for western rolls or\nRolls that if you like have integrity but don't have a director or producers are writers that are able to handle I'm such a complex issues as Indian is so for me I've been so fortunate that\nYou know people like Gary Farmer west duty um and so many\nPeople and native actors before me Michael ... is a\nHave paved the way to allow me to\nDo the roles that I Do and\nThat wouldn't have been possible without you know native actors in the past putting on the low end cloth and um you know or being in films that they might not be proud of today and\nYou know there's something to be said about the importance of that I think a lot of young native artists or I've heard rejected that notion and saying that they won't they won't be a dancing monkey for the crowd\nBut I think you still have to pay respect to the fact that people went through that so you're able to make the argue cab today and\nYou know I'm so fortunate the fact that these people came before me to allow me to play a role like Adam right eagle or play residential school survivor because we've never seen that on screen I told him that way before like an Indian Wars or work on the ... the film where it's like\nThe late and we could be you know shaking in the other direction I think uh\nYou know I'm so fortunate to be the artist I Am today\n[noise] yeah we gotta talk about this it okay for this film is called bled content um and it's I find when you are with on the show\nAs many years ago talking about this element is taking a while to get it done okay so ... notes not too much sway layers like this on the apocalypse and something to do with blood quantum yeah you're on you so I'm moment of course like if it's as soon as you hear the or\nWhether this film was about you understand why it was so hard to get funding for it but uh basically\nIt's about a young\nMan named Joseph ... who I play um who has the Anglo girlfriend and we both are trying to I'm not have a child because we are experiencing having a child and it starts out of the film with us in our I'm kind of\nTeenage love and then we're living on the reservation together and is on the outbreak happens and uh the only catches that are native people can't get infected\nSo it goes on this crazy journey of what happens army in her going to stay together our is our kid going to be as zombie like it just is this crazy wacko violin and twisted reality but it's beautiful and it delves into\nI think the whole metaphor of what does it mean to be native and uh\nWhen is it convenient to call yourself a certain culture or race in one is not and um it goes into in the apocalypse ... afraid of the yeah it is going to be a lot of fun and everybody's going to just enjoy this film so yeah I'm really looking\nForward to it and I I understand you were also in and they shot a pirate for a series scouts which is based on a a comic series um what role does he play in that\nYeah so in scouts I played joke of a kid named Joseph as well and\nUm that was a really beautiful show um it was\nA headed by a man named Doug Young who was a writer and producer and he just had a singular vision to try to\nCreate this reality for very talented Indian actress just to play and that's what we got to do I think it's unfortunate that showed and go through I think we finished the pilots and the show was good enough to go through it's just that the\nCompany that was going to turn it into his show um fell through\nAnd I'm so unfortunately didn't get made but I got to meet a actors like Louie Gladstone or you'll Birmingham a song McLaren\nOr William below like really amazing Indian working actors and you know that as an experience was a short one but it was something that I really hold close because those relationships I've I've held clothes and it wasn't really special project\nAnd some people criticized the project because\nThe comic series is not created by a native person I did you consider it when you consider Gino shootings Thailand or did you read through the comic series and and I should say we we've had folks on both sides native folks on both sides on the show talking about whether or not they like scalp I didn't like scalp\nYeah I think for me whenever I Choose a role it's very much in line with like if my character and the principles that I'm going to bring to the table I agree with and\nFor me Joseph as a young man he was growing up on the rez and feels this urge to find a different life by leaving the reservation but also finding the importance of staying there\nI mean this split into our city is something that a lot of young native people feel um regardless of whether they're living urban Lee or they're living on the reservation there's this magnetic tug in either direction of your identity and I wanted to portray that because of some good I feel and\nI agreed with that and so and like that as well as um the casting director of the projects Renee hands like has she's never steered me wrong on a project so I definitely like took her word for it and took the um project what it was because I think it's so cool to see\nYou know for one I think Indians on the screen as powerful and any respect but also showing us is\nCompletely like not at the mercy of other sort of polls of of society and having a world that created where we are self sustaining and wear dark and we are awful to each other sometimes but we're also\nReally amazing to each other sometimes and showing that whole reality versus trying to just\nPinpoint one aspect of um\nThe native life native reality that I think it would be a really important show because it would\nThat there is no word on on if maybe another network like pick it up or I'm a I'm not sure at this point but that would be amazing [laughter] and what else do you have on the horizon other than standing Sanford I'm right now\nIt's dating and weird dark and we are awful to each other sometimes but we're also really amazing to each other sometimes\nAnd showing that whole reality versus trying to just\nPinpoint one aspect of um the native life native reality that I think it would be a really important show because that would show that [noise] so there's no word on on if maybe another network might pick it up or I'm I'm not sure at this point but that would be amazing [laughter]\nAnd what else do you have on the horizon other than standing Stanford\nUm right now we're going to be finishing shooting blood quantum we have a few more shoe days and uh\nFrom what I've heard you know Jeff barn it'd be like he has his whole singular vision for a film so the film up until now I was like all put together he

talk about that so how many it it was a short amount of time that folks came together to collect the the words how how long was it\n[noise] you know our lead a came about the technology or the approach of the rapid word collection from an initiative that is global uh from the language development partners\nAnd the language conservancy and it's a method that brings together twenty five to forty elders and fluent speakers of the language and the the elders and put into\nSmall groups of four or five individuals and they're assigned different topics altogether the most initial or foundational topics like Eighteen hundred topics\nSo we assembled forty five a crow speakers and two locations and put them into groups mans groups and women's groups\nAnd then we gave them assignments and our goal was ten thousand words in ten days\nAnd the groups a function for ten days and then at the end of the tenth day we came upon our total which was fourteen thousand eight hundred and fifty where it so we more than exceeded our goal or so\nSo excited to see that we have that that sort of depth of knowledge of our language in in a must start elder speakers and is actually\nFrom younger speaker so we were we were just a amazing excited when we realize that we have lots to put into a really important dictionary for our people\nWe are talking about a\nIndigenous language dictionaries today if your tribe has a dictionary um call us and tell us about it how much do you use it and would you like to see a revamped um\nI Know some tribes um created dictionaries back in the eighties how have things changed since then give us a call we love to hear from you the number one eight hundred nine nine six\nTo eight for eight and I'm Janine you mentioned that\nUm there were men's groups and women's groups you know whenever you feel comfortable sharing can you explain a little bit about why you broke them down into gender\n[noise] well the ... language is is very specific to the male and female language um how they address members of the family a up if and how words are pronounced and so\nWe were very anxious to be able to have that represented in our dictionary and our men and women's groups are agreed with that in fact um that was something that they preferred\nFrom the very beginning so we we followed that preference and it's difficult to indigenous languages around the world and the people that were conducting\nHelped us conduct the rapid were collection certainly agreed that they wanted to know and they wanted to have that as a part of the dictionary or we want our crow speakers to learn that a as their utilizing the dictionary so we're anxious to see that that continues\nSo rather than have a dictionary that is what some sort of some people have said is sort of generic or without gender or in its uh in in the way it comes about the way it's written in the way it said\nUm we're we're following the the way that the\nLanguage is actually in practice and we see and we know well it's been our language is well documented we understand that this is not the first\nDictionary that we've worked on um we're starting with a written dictionary that was\nPut together by a number of linguistics in particular\nUm Randolph cries it was a Catholic father here on our cross evasion is just a put together and published A N riding a U.S

Jason\nHas its own and the ... she's the coordinator of the tribal language programs at the Mississippi band of talked to Indians and she is in ... role member of the tribe as well\nEither to Laura how they do All right thanks so much for all of you joining us today I'm On the on the road start with you I'm tell us about the dictionary that that's a\nYou have for the Mississippi ban of truck to\nA low right now what we have is the teaching dictionary that we um put out in two thousand fourteen it's considered a child version\nAnd it has sixteen hundred words the reason that we wanted to publish a dictionary was because\nWe um we're gonna be teaching the talk of language in the schools for thirty minutes every single day and for people who haven't had a you know a lot of conversations in Choctaw with little kids\nAnd it was like a daunting task and so we gave them a dictionary that will hopefully help them you know I'm a lady's simplify the language a little bit for the little kids because our kids are growing up not\nSpeaking Choctaw and um it's not natural for a um speaker to ah you know be patient and um\nCome up with the word does it'd be you know to simplify\nFor a little bitty kid or non speakers\n[laughter] that's great and do what did you hear from the teachers about using this this tool\nWell I think it was helpful because I'm\nThe dictionary that they have access to is the buying tend to one and um it's really um it's really thick dictionary and it's got a lot of obviously words and I'm the entries are really long\nSo I feel like the simplicity of the teaching a dictionary has been really helpful to them and we also gave them access to it um the PBS documentary so\nThey have it on their phones and they can search for things like you know if they want us a butterfly um especially with the spelling so if they know how to say hush hush the bullshit but they don't know how to spell it they can look in on their phones are in the I'm teaching dictionary book\n[noise] Jason I understand you guys went recently to a conference and learn a little bit more about putting together dictionaries tell us about that\n[noise] Oh yes ma'am we had been collaborating with some linguists over the years that have helped us document the Mississippi charcoal and language and I'm just turned out very I'm Wondering where's the doctor and Broadwell\nWho has completed a grammar on the Choctaw language or he recently moved through University of Florida I'm as professor over there and was hosting the code Lang conference which is an opportunity for linguists and indigenous language\nAll activists and scholars and and people like us to get together and to work on different projects and they created a special oh many practical where we were able to bring our project and get some support from student when we're seeing other professors\nFor two weeks and it was really helpful a program that was back in June of this year\nHow is um a Mississippi Choctaw different from Oklahoma Choctaw\n[laughter] well ah as you stated I Am in Oklahoma Choctaw although I didn't grow up in Oklahoma\nI'm working from I didn't have access to the language because it wasn't passed on to my father and so when I decided I wanted to learn Choctaw I knew that the mystery we talked a language was a little more alive and so I decided to move to Mississippi\nFor him it was really helpful a program that was back in June of this year\nHow is um a Mississippi Chuck Todd different from Oklahoma Choctaw\n[laughter] well ah as you stated I Am in Oklahoma Choctaw although I didn't grow up in Oklahoma\nI'm working from I didn't have access to the language because it wasn't passed on to my father and so when I decided I wanted to learn Choctaw I knew that the Mississippi\nChoctaw language was a little more alive and so I decided to move to Mississippi and what I learned is definitely it's more or less for those over six thousand speakers\nIn Mississippi [noise] um who speak the language and it's just amazing to be surrounded by that every day I'm actually be able to hear an indigenous language every day so I'm what I've learned since I've been here is that\nI'm Choctaw literacy really left Mississippi with the removal of the truck dollars in the Eighteen hundreds\nAnd when I'm the missionary using other folks who had been documenting the Choctaw language in the Eighteen hundreds went to the Indian Territory which were eventually became Oklahoma [noise] um [noise]\nThe folks that stayed behind in Mississippi really did not keep hold of a for documents they weren't participating in the creation of um new things and so\nI'm a brand image from the buying in dictionary the missionary who created a dictionary in the Eighteen hundreds which every talked to a person who cares about the language has somewhere in their house probably very that was created in Oklahoma\nAnd um the language in Mississippi was passed on for probably a hundred and fifty years from the Eighteen thirties told the Nineteen seventies\nAs primarily an oral language and I'm the only reference that we have right now is\nThat buying in dictionary which was a hundred and fifty years old now so\nUm there's a big difference in like the local language and the the formal and informal language the Mississippi Choctaw speed compared to Oklahoma to talk to us and we really need to have a reference that is a better representation of from the Mississippi chocolate language\nThinks about Jason we're talking dictionaries today if you want to get in on the conversation give us a call the number is one eight hundred nine nine six to eight four H um does your tribe use the dictionary that was created by missionaries and have you worked on creating\nUm we're revamping or upgrading the dictionary that you use in your language programs\nGive us a call we'd love to hear from you ... hundred nine nine ... ...\nUm ... you also went to this um this conference what was a a significant piece that you took away about creating dictionaries\n[noise] oh I one of those um a elder older uh speakers\nAnd a somewhat and I was a um [noise] oh is it amazed at um I guess the passion that I'm graduate students or young people had and working on a linguistics [noise]\nUh and learning more about um how um what or how grammar is you know\nAnd how to be able to ah understand more about our how our [noise]\nSentences or sayings are put together for um you know I'm I guess linguistics in ... and uh\nAnd that um [noise]\nSo you found it didn't use holiday\nEspecially technology being used uh to help uh put all of this all of our ah language projects you know together\nWas when we had started way um ages ago you know technology wasn't um that great then and worked with you know I'm ... we started updating or you know our our um you know language\nAnd and then and then now the way that technology is I'm being used to I'm just I was just amazed at that\nYeah yeah I Am too I'm the the ability to you know I remember when I was trying to learn language is going to the bookstore and buying a book and having to carry it around me able to to think of and quickly look up something and now it could just be in our pockets on\nOur phones around the um what kind of technology are you hoping to use when you updates the two thousand fourteen dictionary\nWell our big thing has been um getting audio out so we originally you tried to put an audio into a Pdf file and that we could distribute it\nAnd people can just press the word and it says it and then press the example is in that says it but um I think that was really ... and so uh what we're thinking right now is possibly a website I Believe it's the Lakota who have been talking dictionary and I'm just amazed by it\nUm you know are the people that we want to have this dictionary as like learners and people who may have you know ... forgotten certain words or you know just want to hear it so audio has to be a big part and I'm I'm not sure I'm a fan\nOf apps anymore I'm just because a lot of people they might not have access to\nYou know cell phones to have enough faith here a lot about all my phone doesn't have a face I can download the app because I really tried getting people to download the ... um and that was the thing that I heard a lot\nAnd so I Believe it's I'm On the Google doodles what you do is you just click on it and it starts again you don't even installing apps I've\nThere's reasons for those differences and they talk about that in the sessions you heard the verbal the discussions that went on and and uh they got really quite lively [laughter] um and sometimes very hilarious and sometimes actually emotional and the sense that there were things they hadn't remembered and the reference to the people\nFrom there you know back generations\nOf stories that had been told of even warrior experiences\nAnd battles and all of that came through and so we're um it's it's the whole gamut I guess you might say of reactions but just because one person says it this way and another says it this way doesn't mean that they've eclipse one another no\nAnd um but they need to agree also on how it's spelled\nThan listen to it and how is it spelled and they each each of the groups\nHad to appoint among there among the five of them someone that was actually writing down the words a with the proper accents and all of that so these folks are all literate in the language is well we really have a wealth of speakers you know we've got twenty five hundred very fluent crow speakers\nAt least that count actually maybe somewhat slow a low because that comes from the census and you know do people identify themselves or when the census taker comes around but\nWe have a wealth of information and knowledge and we're at a perfect uh really moment of like you might say it's a pivotal moment for us to be able to collect our language in this way\nAnd the dictionary then becomes a major learning tool in wherever these learners are and we're hoping they're everywhere but we of course are very interested in our youngest learners\nHow do you feel about um non native or non crows using in the dictionary using the work that you raised in a to learn the language themselves\nYou know from the beginning we are just very interested in having every learner anywhere who wants to learn the language we're a small group of speakers\nWere small tribes there's Thirteen thousand members of our tribe and probably another five thousand descendants [noise] this is the location of the ... this is\nEd or our audience isn't something that's going to go worldwide um that there are people here in there who are interested in the crow language and all of our apps are free um our books are online can be purchased by anyone and when we have our summer Institute for\nLanguage learning we have an intense a cruel language learning for beginners anyone can rural were very anxious to have anyone who's interested in and\nI'm not the market isn't huge [laughter] but we're not interested in being restrictive at all\n... ... interesting I mean I Know what about you how do you feel about um outsiders who the Mississippi Choctaw\n[noise] um well I don't think there's as much interest as some people might think like you know there's not going to be a ... million people coming in and taking the dictionary and you know learning the chocolate language but\nI'm ... ... ... we saw the legs so much interest from the linguistic community and um I think it's good that they have interest in hospital because\nLike me personally I don't understand like every grammar rules and someone else can explain it to me who looked at the dictionary like I'm all for 'em you know whatever helps our language at this point because we don't want to\nYou know my generation the twenty to thirty year olds to die in Seventy years and take the language with us and all we leave is you know the written word and um I'd rather be able to\nHave it explained to me and then I can explain to someone else can we create speakers yeah and that's going to take a lot of effort that takes you know people who are members of the Mississippi talk to 'em that's great and whatever like I said whatever helps\nSeason about how many uh fluent speakers are there\n[noise] um I Believe there's somewhere between six and seven thousand foods because here in Mississippi [noise] um when fortunately there's a lot of young people who are growing up without the language and so for numbers of people who don't understand it is increasing\n... and Janine um you know when when you\nWhen you community got together to do this rapid word collection um how what did that you mentioned a little bit before about The Elders um but what did they share with you about the value of the experience for them\n[noise] they didn't want 'em\nAll the majority of them didn't want to quit when we were done they were ready to go the next day and I I it their all asking when are we going to do this again and we do have a another couple rounds to go this year but I did just the enthusiasm built\nYou know in a way you'd think oh well after ten days aren't you just a really wary of this process it seemed to engender more energy as we went along and when we looked at our accounts we took a daily count every morning we came in to look at ... work had been done to date previous\nBut he's big wall charts where each group listed how many topics they went through and how many ... total words they did and then we'd come to a total for all of the the nine groups we had a groups\nDoesn't build you know in a way you'd think oh well after ten days aren't you just a really wary of this process it seemed to engender more energy as we went along and when we looked at our accounts we took a daily count every morning we came in to look at ... work had been on the day previous\nBut he's big wall charts where each group listed how many topics they went through and how many ... total words they did\nAnd then we'd come to a total for all of the the nine groups we had a groups here in ... up at ... at a\nPrior which is eighty five miles away um but the enthusiasm for that morning assembly was just incredible and applause for the the totals and so on\nYou know the optimism that we have for a language is a whole new world than from but right before we started this initiative these elders\nI'm sure have gone home to their families talked about it and the communities and they're coming back into visit and say when are we going to do this again and\nUh what what's going to be the result of our work and\nSo on so we really didn't know how it would be there'd been described to us and we'd like this\nApproach but until we actually did it we didn't know now that we've done it we want to do it again [laughter] and we're anxious actually to achieve a dictionary that has probably thirty thousand words wow we're in a position where our language is strong enough right at this time where we probably can get there\nThat's amazing that's so exciting a lot of other digital indigenous groups worldwide aren't in that position where you know if you have like thirty or forty speakers it's pretty rough and you eat most of those speakers are very um perhaps elderly and they can do eight hours in a sit\nDown session this is quite a demanding session\nBut we did have some flexibility where some people just\nFelt for ours was good they needed to step out others would step in and their place so it's a flexible approach but I have to let you know to is that it's only been done twelve times around this entire globe indigenous groups in South America\nAsia Africa mainly is only two groups in the United states that were aware of that have done the rapid word collection ... and ... people here are crow\nUm and it is of course it's the group that does it is um the language of development partnership um there are a worldwide global group and um there but it's just a brand new you might say technology for dictionaries\nAnd they work almost exclusively while exclusively with indigenous groups and you know they they recently made a video of the work they had done in Africa and that's what we looked at we said oh we want that\nSo we we got funding to do it and of course you know we provide an honorarium for all of our our elders in our our pro speakers that come in\nAnd getting to the actual production of the dictionary all of that has it costs\nSo it's it but it's way ah it's way more efficient I mean looking at what we were able to pull in and those ten days\nShe we'd been for six years working with our crew language teachers in a dictionary project where they said and go through lists of words are and we were recording them well that is a glacier glacial pace compared to the right word\n[laughter] this is the by far the preferred approach that of course we'll save since we've experienced it and I highly recommend it\nBut it's it's quite an adventure you know and I don't know how their groups will\nApproach it I mean we thought what if we hit a wall and five days right you know and we don't have any ... any indigenous group you you would think well this person is a fluent speaker that person as a fuel fluent speaker and we put out word on Facebook\nSo from the young generation that uses Facebook we recruited ... speakers and the people that came in and that's where we went with we didn't go out and say okay we want you you know when you [noise]\nAnd there were people who came in and actually and found out they their knowledge of cruel was pretty shallow\nAnd that was quite a stark realization maybe aside one for them individually but on the other hand we found many who were very fluent who had a ... a depth and breadth of language that was just rich just totally\nA rich in all topics but we also found\nPeople knew more some topics more than others\nWe also found that in the process\nOne of the way along do much to be you know we only know maybe ... movies I'm On a long much LA is you know this is how come\nYou might you
