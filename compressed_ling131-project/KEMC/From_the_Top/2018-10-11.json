because you're so when was this absolutely world class orchestra what else is going\nOn well what happened to be the case that both my parents are in the orchestra playing with me so that's a little

the ...\nAnd my dad or they're both violinist listen to you both\nAndrea what's it like being in the orchestra while your son is the solo as\nWell to be honest I think I'd rather be sitting out in the audience it's difficult because um when you're in the audience you know you have parental janitors and nerves on but when you're on stage and you're actually functioning and trying to play or violent you're trying to concentrate on what drew is doing but at the same time not dropping my bell jar\nYeah exactly drew growing up with such amazing musical parents I'm guessing there must have been a tiny bit of pressure to achieve\nYeah that's a question that a lot of people ask me I'm actually it wasn't as bad as you you would think they obviously [laughter]\nWhen I was really little they obviously like hammered in practice practice practice and I was like you know right [laughter] and it was it was hard at first and slowly slowly year after year I came to do it myself and have the drive myself but what really I think\n\n\nThey should leave\n\nNation would have been to leading and witty performance thank you so heavy on the edge of my seat and I was just trying not to crack up all those beautiful sort of moments that you that you gave us just now you're such a talented musician but you don't come from a musical family tell us about your folks\nUm my dad's a doctor of computer science\nAnd so he's very oriented towards math and science and my mom stays at home than me and my brother and honestly I think she has one of the hardest jobs in the world and it's even harder or because she has to travel with me wherever I perform because I'm a minor\nSo she's she's ... she's got her full time job just keeping up with you and you've got really quite a quite a career going I don't know what is your brother do I know he played for a while but now he's in a rather competitive endeavor\nHe's very smart guy ... amazing that academics and everything and as a hobby he speed skates and he's quite good at it [noise]\nExcellent so your brother's a speed skater but you yourself I I hear what you tell me you're not very athletic tell everybody has to read about what happened on the first day of pie in seventh grade\nSo I Walk into the gym or starting off by doing some warm up exercises specifically this one was a tiny running exercise and I somehow manage to smash me\nKeep in mind this was one week before a huge competition that it was taking part in that he can and I think as you can imagine I ... I was terrified\nAnd at\nHome I ice made them and I practiced away from the piano by looking at the music and studying it\nIt's kind of like looking at a textbook memorizing the information and I think it was a great learning experience because I was able to develop a new way of practicing and the competition turned out great so\nMalls or will ... will I mean gosh take care of those is my man I Love them tested we wish you all the best of luck thank you thank you so much\n[noise] big\n[noise]\nOur audience today is made up of junior high and high school students from all around the buffalo area one of the schools were welcoming is from east Aurora and it just so happens that our next teenage performer is from that town please welcome Seventeen year old violinist Christoph ...
