going to visit one of the great competitions were teenage classical musicians in the U.S the stole bird international string competition\nYou've heard plenty of ... medalists on from the top over the years because as we search the country for talented young string players were drawn to this competition and the incredibly gifted batch violinist violist cellist and bassist who show up every year in Kalamazoo the home of the stole Burke\nI sat down for a brief conversation was Margaret Hamilton the executive director of the competition after the semi final round to help set the scene Margaret telling me briefly\nViolinist and teacher yes\nYou are so right it's an author of Julius stole Burke who was a long time resident of Kalamazoo\nMusic faculty member here at western Michigan University School of music directed the Kalamazoo junior since any for decades and died unexpectedly or too soon in Nineteen Seventy four\nAnd it was his family and friends and community members who literally gathered around Esther Spellberg kitchen table saying how do we commemorate the life of this man [noise] so they came up with the notion of a competition and\nThey hoped at that point in time that it might last for five years but Julius had extraordinary ties to the greater string community at of course his work with strings students he was the violin professor at was legendary here so we're just so lucky that that legend lived on much beyond five years\nIt's just an amazing thing so described the process to me ... you know how many kids apply every year\nThis year we had an all time record broken we received over two hundred applications so each year it's been growing and I believe that there are a number of reasons word of mouth happy contestants happy parents extraordinary performances that come out of this\nPlus the support of audiences here and the Kalamazoo community\nA young person will apply anywhere between the middle of October to our February first deadline and then those applications go through two rounds of screening here in Kalamazoo it's an anonymous process\nSo if we take this year's numbers as an example those two hundred applicants were whittled down to the twelve semi finalists that we heard today how is\nThat even possible I mean you know just you know the proof is in the ... of course the ... that I heard today we're more artist than competitors I think uh so what does that process like or do you have a a hair splitting moments you know getting them down from two hundred or is it really obvious I mean the the level must be astronomical at\nThis I think the level is astronomical and I'm always grateful that I Am not the person making those decisions are screeners who do remain anonymous they are well versed in the literature and the profession or in what the field is like\nA there are multiple screeners at each level they listen very carefully they proceed with great integrity that is you can imagine there are some really tough calls said at the end\nAnd what is a ... when a kid's apply until how old can they be uh our rules\nSo the kids you work with are very much eligible to appear on from the time as a matter of fact this year there's a large overlap yes\nThere is a huge overlap and I think that's what brought us together and we've noticed that overlap over the years that alumni out from the top also ended up being alumni of the stall bird it's a wonderful connection and of course the missions are so similar\nTo what we've had a wonderful or you've had a wonderful legacy on from the top with all the kids we always send to shut up to the store bird for for your support and the knowledge of this great great talent so thanks for talking with me and best of luck with this year's
