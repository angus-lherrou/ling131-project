{"month": "10", "state": "MT", "station": "KEMC", "content": "How scientists interpret that percentage or how the layperson interprets that um you know it it is\nIn the case of whether it's sort of the great example where we interact with probability the fifty percent chance of rain this you know yeah does that me and um I think that in general the education in in particular in this country\nYou know the the way that we're taught it doesn't bring us to a place where we feel comfortable with uncertainty we understand maybe how a game of chance work yeah that's about it you know it's it's really it's very and it's it's it's actually it's really hard to think about clearly\nThat is an interesting point I was just thinking as you mentioned probability\nAnd versus certainty\nAnd I'm thinking you're sitting at a at a poker table or blackjack table in Las Vegas and you can accept the idea of profitability and not certainly because it's right in front of you and there's no denying it and you play the game\nBut in the area of let's say getting cancer from smoking the probability of getting lung cancer from smoking his ex likely more probable but I guess the nonsmoking\nWe get into an area where my layman sense would be human skepticism steps in and we\nOften will deny the reality of probabilities is that the system with your experience\nI I think what you're you're what you're getting at is is how difficult it is to reconcile the fact that when we when we try and integrate probability into our own life and her own decision making all sorts of psychological processes that we don't understand\nAre contributing to the way we think about it\nIt's much easier maybe to um if you're in the situation where you're talking about dice serve\nPoker to see those numbers um without emotion but when you're talking about addictive behaviors\nYou know whether or not they're going to hurt you have your health in the long run you know that's a much harder a psychological barrier to go over when you're trying to clearly think about probabilities\nInteresting to me because just pursuing the tobacco issue smoking I remember this in my younger years the science of seemed clear the tobacco industry this is a matter of record now intentionally\nLied to make money and people who had the either the proclivity or addiction from tobacco\nHad serious emotional reasons to deny what was the opposition increasingly obvious true in summary I Would say that would be an example of the probability of science the ambiguity that it creates being manipulated by commercial interest to the detriment of people's lives would you disagree with any of that and then also\nI I absolutely agree with you and I think that we're we are a lot easier to manipulate than we realize and and people you know I think\nWith respect to that particular issue it continues to be the case that you know advertising money can be used to over on you know what what is known in public health for example about um what effect for example sugar is having on the obesity epidemic in the country\nYou know when you combine all of those um corporate interests and great marketing techniques and were you know you know cereal aisles as a parent of young kids walking through you know the grocery store and it's right at their their I hide and there's just there's there are a lot of forces that are contributing to make a good decision making difficult\nYou're listening to homegrown unarmed Brian ... we're talking with Chris Dan fourth professor of mathematics at the University of Vermont so what did you do after graduate school\nIn graduate school I was working on weather prediction or where we're looking to try and improve our estimates of the next few days would be like\nAnd you know I I think it's often difficult for people to understand you know if we can't forecast the weather for more than a couple of weeks I'm at any point in our future how could we say something about what the climate would be like a hundred years from now good question\nI think that what we're looking to do in modeling earth's climate is um it's really a different scale question we're looking to understand what effect changes we make\nTo the chemical composition of the atmosphere have on the long term average is associated with temperature and rain and humidity and these quantities that you might want to know about for tomorrow if you were thinking about a weather forecast\nSo with climate change and climate modeling really what we're doing is um it's not possible to do experiments like you would in a laboratory where you see a million different copies of the earth and and and run an experiment and see what happens if we do burn fossil fuels or redo planned a bunch of trees or what\nOkay and so the the computer really is our our laboratory for understanding how the climate is changing\nI'm so some of the best scientists I Know have worked diligently on that problem for their career and basically the the outcome of the most important experiments we've done\nA reveals that by adding a bunch of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere we have increase the likelihood that the atmosphere is going to warm up over the next hundred years\nAnd it's likely to happen in ways that are going to change how water is distributed or where food can be grown and and the uncertainties associated with those forecasts\nAre quite large because of the fact that we don't know how humans are going to interact humans are the biggest piece of that equation how are we going to change our behavior over the next hundred years in response to the climate\nAnd when you say change behavior you're talking about carbon inputs or some some other type of behavior\nI'm Talking about you know what decisions are made about whether you know investments that are made in in renewable energy you know if we decide as the country for example to to put more of our money into\nA solar power and wind energy I'm you know we don't know what what's going to happen over the next twenty Thirty years and in terms of those investments\nBut then again those investments are relevant not because of the names but because of effective if I'm understanding you correctly the effect on carbon input that's right\nHaving said that those are the sort of the fundamentals of climate change is I understand them doing some research for previous programs by recollection is over thirty national academies of science has said the probability is quote extremely high and I think that translates into Ninety five percent something to that effect\nThat these effects will happen in a certain range of variable but a significant impact now is that basically correct in terms of the scientific quote consensus end quote on probability\nAnd I I Believe what you're referring to is is whether or not the determination of whether or not humans are likely responsible for yes degree and a half increase globally that we've observed over the last hundred years in temperature\nUm in that experiment that you know the experiment that resulted in that determination is is basically you know you take the last you take the best climate models we have\nAnd you pretend the humans aren't here on the earth and we don't have an industrial revolution\nThose climate models can reproduce the cooling of attempt to the degree that happens every big volcanic eruption and\nYears let's say but there is no trend awkward in the temperature globally averaged when you remove human activity\nSo with that background talking about skepticism or perhaps it's not too strong a word mistrust of science and the potential for for commercial interests all tobacco to manipulate or encourage that just trust\nWe get into the world of idea sciences interface with sociology human behavior at influencing political decisions\nNow that I I don't know if that's potentially in the realm of science that had a question\nBut it certainly would seem to me to pose a fundamental challenge to the assumption that science\nAs explaining interpreted by the economic and political decision making structure has a certain outcome in other words tobacco invitation was delayed back regulation and limitations\nIn your world do your work experiences that issue enter into your professional work at all these other words the human ambiguity injected into science by emotion\nYes absolutely I think that you know we're we're really coming into\nAs was the case for atmospheric science when satellites were launched really coming into an age where we can observe how people a share information you know with their what they are right on the Internet the links that they click on their social media activity\nUm we're able to observe how they respond to campaigns advertising campaigns political campaigns um how information is shared between friends and the different communities\nUm and these you know these sorts of technologies that are available now to allow people to communicate and broadcast and published their thoughts\nAround the world in real time we don't yet understand what effect that having on issues like climate change and how\nHow they decide that they're informed how how they decide whether you know what their opinion is going to be about something like climate change an issue like that it's an exciting time to be able to understand how human behavior you know how it's manipulated by interests and how we exchange information with each other", "show_name": "Home Ground w Brian Kahn", "year": "2018", "city":
