R. G.\n[noise] from NPR News this is all things considered ... Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone and that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida or Easter industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two towns look like today\nWell you know these are serious somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe so we drove into day might bruise your Becky Sullivan I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen\nHigh wins you know the there I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees withstood it here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main ... along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble um\nSomeone already taken a hit economically but uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also saw some people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it's it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's affectionate runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns\nAnd it's been damaged in several places and it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckle under washed them and that happened out yeah yeah I watched the\nThere's also in that area there's a causeway the links Appalachian coal in East Point together that was damaged now open to single lane but that said there is now a pathway through apple electrical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in ... no power no very limited cell service and no outside help you\nOut and and I mentioned these two towns are the hardest oyster industry they've got fishing going on there are a lot of fishing and ... they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them right I mean\n... along the mainstay there but they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf\nBut also you know shrimping and fishing or big hear many people moved their boats upriver to a secluded area Heidi hold they call it keep it out of harm's way and so most votes escaped major damage that's good but some of the seafood restaurants and and wholesalers worked with a lot of damage and working to rebuild and be back in business as soon as they can\nAs NPR's Greg Allen reporting for us from Florida

ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made it pastor Brunson case a priority men Brunson is expected to be in Washington by tomorrow President Trump told reporters this afternoon that parents will visit the White House likely tomorrow as well NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul had Eric\nHi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly he been convicted up\nWell his pastor around a small church and is mayor in western turkey for years and years but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and Brunson was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to the Gulen turkey blamed for the coup attempt\nThe U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who would testified against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that and since a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[noise] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why really ... him and why release him now well\nIn some ways Brunson was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of this cleric for to the Glenn who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you yours or this summer Trump spoke with air to one and reportedly Trump's thought he had an agreement to get Brunson released instead he was simply moved to house arrest\nThen the U.S got tougher they levied sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously in the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release of pastor Brunson or good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement to the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor\nAmerican side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation\nThey now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but will for instance a Washington continue delivering a thirty five fighter just to turkey will lay re raised this issue of extra dieting the clerics are to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing stumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment the ...\nCase that we've been tracking all of us this week\nThe democracy Yogi case right and I think turkey will be at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from Istanbul\nWe can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine\nIt was about to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co hosts of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley was at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freaked does\nAnd I noticed that the bag or Fritos had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to the new prize of a buck and a half and I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos is owned by Pepsi Pepsi owns ... which makes ... in fact the vending machines got you did in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know\nA luckily there was a second clue a note left\nAt the scene of the crime to our\nValued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nTo offset increases we've received in product costs for manufacturers so presumably the wholesale cost of the free does have gone up and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time\nThough there's there's corn\nAnd soul whoa how naive to think that's all that ... is\nCarolyn Dimitri isn't applied economist at NYU who specializes in food studies\nShe says the price of a process food like Fritos has almost nothing to do as well food prices\nCounts as a much bigger part of the cost of the food like free does is and things like labor and rent and transportation\nBecause trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers to keep up with all the shipping needs that they have which means the trucking is getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine might suddenly cost a lot more\nWe just shipping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma ... capital markets andme it analyzes food companies including Pepsi and he has another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about the soft drink companies a low minimum um because of the parent has gone up as well\nBecause of like the aluminum cans yeah\nIf the U.S has not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer has to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nAbove the company's Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs see maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks to offset this more expensive can but they can't really do that right now stale up so to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking growing category unlike many of the other categories that allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there it is trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks as a best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat was NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley speaking with Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the podcast\nWhy [noise] a service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore at transfer wise dot com or from their app\nThis is all Fritos considered from NPR News\nFrom the white PR studios in billings I'm K.

there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation\nOf Washington's archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl world has been under tremendous pressure to resign since a report this summer detail the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nWorld was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse let the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that scathing horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nBirds state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecutions he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds resignation what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation isn't necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse I actually\nMissing here though isn't acknowledgement by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now I'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think\nThat the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up\nShould face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seems to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on his managerial mistakes not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nWith his back to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the case becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you as a lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when the number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred\nFrom bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who are abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turn fifty two fifty two and yet\nThe law here in Pennsylvania says that we couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone\nTo come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nCatholic Church but there are so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers does revising the statute of limitations get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at these institutions\nWere you hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution in the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of\nThe people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to hold powerful institutions accountable\nAnd I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement and the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is\nIs you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique in critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania and\nJoshua Shapiro is Pennsylvania's state attorney general thank you very much for joining us thank you\n[noise] some of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed\nA federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the impeachment effort aimed at president Richard Nixon and scholars say they are relevant today as another special counsel investigating the current administration NPR national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson reports\nA few years after the resignation of Richard Nixon the special prosecutor who investigated him recalled the critical moment in that probe\n... said it which was first in history to get the courts to let the grand jury report to go to the house Judiciary Committee because the committee would have had real difficulty and doing its workers ...

house I they ... they said no\nBates tried again years later but the answer was the same no last month he and others petition the court to release the Watergate roadmap their lawyer is Larry Schwartz stole\nIt's relevant to historians it's relevant to the intrinsic ongoing interest in Watergate that alone would be sufficient to justify releasing this material but there's real urgency in this instance to getting the road map on to the public record\nUrgency because another special counsel is on the job now investigating the Trump campaign and one of the big questions about the end of Robert Mueller's investigation is whether he'll try to send to report to Congress or the public John sale worked on Watergate as a young lawyer\nFrom twenty first century variation of the Silk Road is
