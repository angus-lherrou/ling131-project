Kathleen Williams has an F um endorsed by the n._r._a. and the Montana Shooting Sports association I also think we need to keep her school safe that's why Congress this year pay off half the STOCK Act\nTo uh provide training for school officers to make sure we do that but we cannot or restrict law abiding citizens um to prevent criminal acts I'll always stand on the second amendment I think he's going to spend Eleanor Swanson your rebuttal\nYes I just want to say that you know a\n... being a hunter does not mean that you support gun rights you know I Know this William voted against constitutional carry that people should um\nNot carry concealed affair otherwise legally able to she voted against flooding schools decide whether and when uh people on campus is should the arms and to me that is absolutely against the second amendment there is a human right to self defense in defense of others and was reflecting uphold that\nMs Williams you have a thirty second spot\nYou I Will yes I did vote against a deregulating\nCollege campuses and prohibiting them from having any\nKind of related storage policies when I was in the legislature I got calls from panicked parents saying they never would have sent their their children here to college\nIf they thought there was going to be no opportunity for colleges to to say how guns should be stored it's it's very reasonable also I have the support is in my town is forcing says yes or alliance which I'm very proud of\nThank you our next question goes from empty and uh some of his old and it goes to congressman Jim ...\nThanks so much for being here representative I'm just yesterday you voted against the spending bill that would keep the government open say it was irresponsible but you also wrote yesterday to make more tax cuts permanent why do you support those cuts if they can greatly increased the federal debt\nSo I think people at home do this as I've traveled the state we're spending problem in the Washington\nRight our next question comes from Mike Dennison and it's for congressman June fourth it\nRepresented or do you agree with the president the Marshall media's dishonest an enemy of the people and you think it's okay for him if he didn't buildings or this month to make light of groups all over reporter Lois do\nWell I I Can't speak for the president I Know that I've had a chance to work closely with him I've met with him in the oval office I've been on air force one twice here recently fly out for rallies in Montana or and or I Am proud of the work that he's doing\nTo um uh get our economy going again and ah um\nOpportunities for Americans and make a the American dream more attainable or I think that the relationship with the I Know I enjoy a good working relationship to the state level with our media here I have made myself very available\nWhat you like him but what was it was driven versions of media that image brutal um\nYou don't I Can't speak for the president specific I Can't speak for the president specifically on a individual comments I Do know a bit in my personal interactions with him he's been straight for a and I know he loves his country and his heart is in it and I stand with the president\nAnd the owners want some your response\nMedia does tend to focus on what drives news so uh there's a focus on the negative and people tend to think that's what's happening and these these did at at the Trayvon Martin videos and make\nThings look worse that there has been some cases of media acting abetting a seriously I Love the diverse whole liberation of media options we have we have social media we have all this media\nUm and I want you know First Amendment jurists couldn't be upheld in that arena we've established that is a great person an infection I Hope it continues to thrive\nAnd Kathleen Williams or with bottle\nYeah I mean I can say without a doubt that I appreciate the media and in fact every time I being interviewed and I'm asked is there anything you want to add I always think that journalists that are working so hard to to bring US News and uncover facts\nI Will say to that the body slam a reporter was one aspect of it congressman but lying about it was I think something we also have to remember we need to ensure that we have honorable honest\nCase men like people in Congress and we need to replace the one we have\nCongressman gene for say well I'll be the first one to say I'm not perfect uh and I have regrets for what happened last year um I took full responsibility and the infamous been fully cover and since then\nOr the work on my tail off of the state and enjoying it traveling back to every single Kelly will be sixty days after getting elected and then continuing to come home to know I Know your voice so I can carry it back to Washington where we need to push back on federal overreach\nThank your next question is from some as the Herald sun and it goes to Illinois response\nFrom the slums then uh when Denny Rehberg held the same office he took pride in holding in person publicly accessible town hall meetings in all fifty six counties here in the state would you be willing to make that commitment Montanans tonight\nIf he were elected yes I Would definitely what\nNorth and then I guess you know I'll use [laughter]\nReally I'm committed to hope they are holding open meetings in fact a congressman gene force hey when he proposed his wilderness study area relief that that would ah eliminates protections for over seven hundred thousand acres of Montana's public lands refused to take any open public comment\nSo my team and I we held a public meeting and we've proved that Montanans can come together whether they're passionate on any side of an issue and have civil dialogue and learn from each other and we invited you congressman uh and and uh and I will take that forward to Congress\nEver since ... well people are entitled to their own opinions but not the real facts\nOff since I've been elected I've been to every corner of the states\nWe've had over two hundred thousand inquiries from Montana that we responded to individually I've done over a hundred live radio calls and many of those we take live\nA caller's without anything with any screening in addition done tele town halls every month I Would argue I've probably been more acceptable but anybody that's filled is she before and I will continue to operate them better\nThan the Illinois her fourth and you have the second World War\nI Believe in transparency I have personally responded to all the questions and the foreign language there off I just wanted every survey every phone call every email personally every question on Facebook in the form I was just a a I Will continue to do that so long as I'm able\nLike your next question is from Mike Dennison then it goes to ...\nBut this Williams ... board is where this alerts and she'll be the ... of the president seems very supportive of roses during the ... roses to draw those ... where where do you disagree that was\nI I'm looking forward to working with the president on any a common interests we can find a I appreciate his interest in trying to bring corporations home from overseas I'd love to help him with that\nI Do object somewhat to the tone that side is going on in Washington and I will chalk that up\nToo hyper partisanship and and tribalism\nAnd the focus that are all politicians teams will have out there as to which party is going to be in power and how to stop them from being in power I Am so looking forward to bringing some statesmanship some independence than roll up your sleeves Montana style to Congress and\nThat we need to send to public servants true representative it'll be responses transparent work with people of all political stripes to get things done for Montana and America\nWould hold ... recalls in North Las ...\nWell I'll tell ya um one thing that I've been talking about a lot in our agricultural sector is his approach to ah to terrorists and a congressman gene forte had an opportunity to sign a letter with a hundred and seven of his Republican colleagues in Congress\nOpposing broad Harris and didn't sign it and I think Montana has worked so hard to build\nOur export markets are we were fifth Montana where it's fifty years to build our wheat market and now the says market than under threat and so that is one area that I think uh the policy is dangerous\nPlace a congressman dream for so you're with a little while I Do stand with President Trump ought to gather a I've been at the table with him we have delivered results for a long time you see it in your column oh we have more jobs than we have people working for wages are going do\nUnemployment's down this is all good news this election truly is a question between results working with President Trump is all do war resistance and working with fancy palsy and going back to the failed policies that we Obama\nEra Illinois influencing your transferable I'm only one that won't be controlled by the speaker or a head of any political party I have my own person the role of law is to define and prohibit harm\nEconomic signals are valuable for us to find the most valuable way to serve one another and I believe in calling balls and strikes when I agree with people or when I don't that includes Trump on anyone else\nThank you Kathleen Williams ... thank you I I Want to\nBring to the attention of Montanans that our economy has been growing since two thousand eleven there's no way that we can at\nThat people who are just recently in office can take claim so that\nI'll also say that the congressman gene forte knows that in July I said that I wouldn't be voting for Nancy Pelosi that if public he took that clip and put it in a commercial that said the exact opposite we need honesty integrity and safe woman ship in Congress not more ally\nFrom public radio shack Yamanaka has our next question and it goes to ...\nEssentially says ms Williams savers open borders an amnesty for illegal aliens where does she ever said that and what is your preferred approach on immigration policy\nOkay thank you for the question I Want to address of this last point for just a second I'm a ... excuse me let me go to the immigration I'm\nTwice in the Montana Legislature Kathleen Williams has voted for sanctuary cities is harbors illegal criminal aliens that have come into this country uh this is not what we walked in our communities which makes our communities less safe\nI voted twice on the house floor for real immigration reform that would move us more to a merit based immigration system got rid of of the uh the chain watery", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Billings",
