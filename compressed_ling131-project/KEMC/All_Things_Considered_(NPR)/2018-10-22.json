N. F. or the intermediate range nuclear forces agreement\nThen President Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev signed the treaty in Nineteen eighty seven advance oh short and medium range nuclear and non nuclear missiles NPR Shannon ... has the latest the\nUs says Russia violate the treaty to developing a medium range missiles that is able to have NATO member countries at short notice\nDefense secretary James Mattis has described Russia's breach of the agreement as untenable Kingston reef the director for disarmament research at the arms control association an advocacy group says the Trump administration's withdraw from the treaty will allow Russia to continue the deployment of that type of missile and revive Cold War tensions\nAll constraints on the production of feeling that missile have gone away thereby increasing the threat to our allies particularly in Europe and range of those missiles\nCompetition with China was another reason for the U.S withdraw China was\nWithout constraints hunch Christensen is the director of the nuclear information project at the federation of American scientists which promotes international transparency and nuclear disarmament\nChina has taken a rod modernized version of its military forces and as part of the modernization has increased its own inventory of weapons to fall into the on air fringe\nReach says the end of ins may portend us withdraw from another agreement the new strategic arms reduction treaty or new start which limits nuclear warheads deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles for each country\nThe apparent breakdown of the agreement and the uncertain future of another bilateral U.S Russia arms control treaty the twenty ten new strategic arms reduction treaty or new start creates the most serious nuclear arms control crisis we've seen in some time\nChristians and says withdraw from both treaties with sperm military competition globally\nYou'd be the first time especially since the Nineteen seventies the would be no nuclear arms control agreements regulating the nuclear powers of the world and so the door would be wide open for potentially a new arms race between these countries\nThe last time the U.S withdrew from a major arms treaty was in two thousand two when President George W.

going to return to a difficult and for some people a traumatic subject that's been much in the news we're talking here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party and he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the ...\nFor the Washington Post and dump ... is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr ... thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christie bossy four testified about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that is what motivated me I watched her testimony and I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus ah the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I said well I'm going to just write something that but my experience which was very similar\nI did something bad I said in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote is hard to read and you know for some people it's going to be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to them you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nYeah let me start by saying this was an unusual\nEvent for me because I never went to parties never and so I don't even know why I went\nI I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kids came upstairs and said hey go outside and look through the basement window sill about ten of us went out there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a\nA girl just lying on a sofa she looked like she was passed out and so the kid went down and he looks up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and then he starts to take her genes off and then he he he took her paintings off\nAnd then he he pulled honest than\nAny one on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumps up right away\nAnd all of us at ... at that window was outside we all just started to run\nMhm you also write that you and other boys are the party started touching another young woman who\nWas also passed out on the on a bed but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes\nA she was laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was when the lights were out everybody was touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her\nBut uh it was enough\nYou know you wrote about why you think the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed and shame they would have been told it's your fault [noise]\nBut you never said anything either why do you think that is\nAh [noise] you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilt you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article ah you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece that I think struck a lot of us is that you said I wanted to tell this story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates this we've all seen things we've all heard other men talk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard\nPeople say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long\nI I don't know I I don't know why we've kept quiet I had a quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd uh I I Can't answer that I don't know I I really don't know why men have been silent\nOn this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward and uh talk about what we've seen what we've done\nI think that should be part of it [noise] how did your family take it when you told them [noise] [noise] well [laughter] let let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rate part that I witnessed I did not tell her my\nParticipation she didn't know that to this article came out ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to say let me tell you but everything's okay now everything's good and how did you explain that to your boys [noise] well\nJust I was truthful with him and uh they were very receptive on their dad you know dad's can you know we we kinda can't do too much from in the in the eyes of our kids\nAre they both told me that my two older boys they don't think it would happen now they said everybody at that window would have had their phones al videotaping it has to but that\nOn film you say well we film everything you know what they were kinda alluding to\nWell how do you feel now that you got it off your chest you know [laughter] and I have mixed\nFeelings I'll be honest there there are days when I regret\nIt and then there are days that\nI'm Glad I did\nYou know my kids showed me some comments on Twitter from people some women have said it's about time someone it it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit this\nA lot of women ah said ah they were glad I did it and they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a salted\nWho wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good you know\nYour piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could quote but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say\nThe only thing I can say is I'm Sorry I didn't help uh you know few women had called me a hero but no I wasn't I Would have been a hero if other help these women then but I didn't do it Don ... thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent years have been many disturbing stories involving male athletes and the women in their lives so it may be hard to remember just how shocking it was back in Nineteen Ninety nine when Carolina Panthers wide receiver rake Ruth was charged with orchestrating the murder of his pregnant girlfriend shriek Adam's\nApple [laughter]\nGr Ruth was acquitted of first degree murder and that supported the death penalty but he was convicted of planning the murder carried out by a hit man she was able to deliver the child named chancellor but she died weeks later\nCould Ruth was sentenced to more than two dozen years in prison but with time served he's scheduled to be released tomorrow from Sampson correctional institution and Clinton North Carolina\nScott Fowler has been covering the story for nearly two decades where the Charlotte Observer and he's just released a seven part report in a pod cast about Ruth the murder and the aftermath it's called careers and it's got Fowler is with us now from Charlotte Scott thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you so much for having me on the show really per se\nAuthorized his attorney to speak with you it's my understanding from your reporting that to this day he's still denies that he was planning a murder he says it was a drug deal gone wrong in essence he says that he was a coward not to kill her that he thought that van ... trying to kill him\nAnd he left the scene but that he didn't do anything about is that about right\nYes van Brett Watkins was the hit man that truth hired to commit the murder or you know drive by shootings sort of situation\nAnd truth yes I have spoken to him on the phone for about twenty minutes but off the record so it helped inform my reporting some but\nIt was ultimately his attorney who who I most recently spoke to for the the pod cast that's exactly what he says it was violent retribution van ...

Chang and I'm Audie Cornish\nTurkish president rated type or to one says he'll make a big reveal tomorrow he'll give a speech detailing what happened to ... and the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second now all along turkey has accused Saudi Arabia of killing the journalist the Saudis acknowledged it only Friday after denying it for weeks\nThey say the country's rulers knew nothing about the operation claim viewed with skepticism outside the kingdom\nNow to understand the into the Turkish government we're joined by Amanda slowed she's a senior foreign policy fellow at Brookings she just got back from his stand but welcome to the program thank you so to give us some contacts there was a rift between these two countries right that predates this incident what's going on there\nTurkish president then prime minister air to want assumed that like minded governments led by some of these Islamist parties would come to power this fell apart for him in twenty Thirteen in Egypt when the Muslim Brotherhood elected leader Morsi who was an ally of turkey was overthrown in a coup by cc who was seen as a foe by turkey and backed\nBy the Saudis so essentially a turkey has uh some enemies in the region now right including Saudi Arabia so uh what are they trying to gain in exerting basically pressure on the Saudi Government\nI think there certainly has always been a challenge in a struggle for a balance of power there in the region I think what we're seeing with air to one right now is particularly directed against Mohammed bin saw him on a known as as NBS\nAnd this is an friends right now\nAbsolutely absolutely of who king Solomon designated as the air and twenty Seventeen or the one I think never has really trusted him I think he thought that the west was buying into his reformist image while he was engaging and crackdowns\nUh he's thirty three which means he's likely to be in power for a number of decades and I think everyone always saw him as being particularly ah unfavorable to Turkish regional interests and so I think what we're likely to see from air to one in his speech tomorrow is continued efforts to try and impose maximum damage on M. B. S.\nMeaning he wants them replaced a new era gold\nIdeally I think you would like NBS removed or at least weekend in terms of removing his de facto powers on on the foreign policy side\nSo is this speech directed really add to President Trump the U.S is that the the nation that could bring this pressure to bear\nA air to one certainly recognizes that turkey doesn't have the potential to do this on its own and so it really is going to be as you say the United states that is going to have to do this\nOr to one has been quite quiet over the last week and a half and a lot of the information that we've seen coming out has been leaked from Turkish government sources and I think it's not an Turkey's interest to have a complete rift with the Saudis\nBut I think this weekend when there was a very weak admission from the Saudis about what happened in as you noted some\nQuestions about their their claims about what happened the effort has shifted from showing that it was a premeditated murder by a professional team who came to sample a to providing a possibly in are the ones who remarks tomorrow more evidence of direct link of these operations to NBS himself\nWhich then it would put further pressure on Trump in terms of his response\nUm ... as we said you just got back from turkey what are you\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from indeed used by over three million businesses

art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happens that begins to redefine what we consider art\nYou can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the euro and oh by Marcel Just shop where he literally took a men's urine on hung it on a wall right\nAnd this completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what are actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that it is I'm a once in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical context\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you price a painting that is not the product of a human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand it things like technique and the uniqueness of a piece of work those are the factors that drive the price and art so\nHow do you price art where those things don't really apply\nWell they still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability\nOf a painting let's add to it the hype that's created around a painting or any work of art really I tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they wanted to price it in comparison with where they wanted to sell it via Christi is\nAll are within the same wheel house in terms of number\nAnd does that or just ration deplete the integrity of the artistic process the rollout\nMy opinion is no because I don't think it is up to any person to define what art is or what art is valued at I feel that art is valued at what people are willing to pay for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the voters who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the artist has to be a little bit of all of those original artist ownership I Do believe is split between the programming the ... the collective\nAnd maybe even a little bit of a nod to Christie's for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garner the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think\nTime and a I generated art work hasn't gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off and so this is the first is the absolute first time
