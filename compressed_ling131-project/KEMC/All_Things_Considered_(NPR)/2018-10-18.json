In the long run that's the way his country was going to succeed\nAnd I think we're trying to contribute in that same vein\nHigh it he's the editorial page editor of the Washington Post\n[noise] for years there's been a debate about what to do with the aging headquarters of the FBI which happens to sit across the street from President Trump's Washington hotel\nA newly released batch of emails indicates the president influenced a federal decision to keep the FBI on the same site Trump's involvement in the fate of the property is being investigated by Democrats on the house oversight committee who are concerned about possible presidential conflicts of interest NPR's Peter Overby reports\nThis all has to do with the FBI and it's old dilapidated headquarters in D.C the building sits across Pennsylvania Avenue from President Trump's hotel\nThe general services administration the federal government real estate manager plan to move the FBI to bigger facilities in Washington suburbs Dorothy row buying uh GST official explained the financial angle to a house hearing in twenty Thirteen\nWe believe that Pennsylvania avenues site has consider her potential for higher and better use than as a headquarters of a federal agency we hope to unlock that hidden value and apply it to the creation of a new facility\nIn fact Donald Trump before he was president showed an interest in developing the old FBI site but by twenty sixteen he was about to cut the ribbon at the current hotel he bragged about it on the campaign trail here is in Fairfield, Connecticut\nWere very very complex super luxury hotels good old boy a lot of people it's almost finish as more\nAnd less winter Trump stopped the FBI is move it happened in the White House meeting with officials from the FBI and gee I say the new plan is to rebuild the old headquarters although it means moving thousands of workers elsewhere\nThis spring TSA administrator Emily Murphy told a house committee Trump had nothing to do with the decision to rebuild the the destruction that we got came from the FBI it was the FBI that direct and she has to watch requirements that big but the emails released today suggest something else\nOne G essay official referred to the project as quote a demolition new construction ... the president's instructions\nAnother referred to it as quote what ... directed everyone to do\nJury ... a democratic congressman from just across the Potomac in Virginia he said that redevelopment could land a competitor across the street from Trump's hotel\nA number of us thought the president had to have something to do with this personally\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders told the New York times that quote the president wanted to save the government money and also the ...\nIn St Louis her specialty is governmental ethics\nThis is a problem because Trump's intervention may well have been motivated by his personal financial concerns with his own hotel\nWhich he points out the president is exempt from federal ethics laws including the ban on conflict of interest\nAdjust a spokeswoman said the emails were taken out of context and referred to funding issues not to location congressmen Elijah Cummings is the ranking Democrat on the house oversight committee if Democrats take the house next month Cummings was in line to become chairman\nIn a phone call this afternoon coming said he'll wait for official responses from the White House and gee I'd say he said the White House often stone walls and said it's quite possible the oversight committee won't take up the issue again till January Peter Overby NPR News Washington [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nHistorically white Americans have distanced themselves from many non white ancestry they might have\nNow many are claiming some because they're proud on some because they're trying to tap into benefits designed for minorities so what exactly make someone a minority as Karen Grigsby Bates from our Code Switch team tells us it's complicated\nPresident Trump has been knocking Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren's assertion that she has Native American ancestry since twenty sixteen\nOh God that's so as Warren, Massachusetts is represented by Pocahontas right not just\nCame from Fox and CNN and there were lots more in a video released this week Warren collapse back\nI'm not I'm wrote in and try and only trying to determine tribal citizenship I understand and respect that sticks in my family history is my family history\nSo she had her DNA sequence which revealed Native American ancestry one says she took the test to prove their families tale of having native ancestors had some basis in truth\nBut not everybody test for personal validation\nHouse majority leader Kevin McCarthy was in the news recently because Los Angeles times investigation revealed that since two thousand his brother in law William wages was awarded more than seven million dollars and no big government and other federal contracts\nThat were designed to go to disadvantage minorities he declined to test but from family lower wages claims to be one aids Cherokee\nUp in Washington insurance broker Ralph\nFor a program designed to help minorities get transportation industry contracts Taylor according to the Seattle Times began describing himself as multi racial after taking a consumer ancestry test\nThe test indicated Taylor had four percent sub Saharan African ancestry and six percent indigenous American he says that's enough for him to qualify as minority so what is the minority then\nThe question really you're asking is does the DNA test tell him what his identity as a retail and yet that's what our identities are\nColumbia University sociologist Alondra Nelson is the author of the social life of DNA in a recent op ed in the New York times Nelson said DNA markers can't tell us who we truly are because we're comparing apples and oranges genetic data is technical identity is social\nAnd social science we think about the identity as being how human groups are are individuals are defined by themselves and how others perceive them\nNielsen says home DNA test or find something to indulge your curiosity but consumers shouldn't think the results or definitive the companies didn't design them for that\nYou know the sort of gold standard genetic science is not exactly what they're after entirely right under also um profit making entities\nAnd she hopes the courts will be able to tell the difference so programs designed to level the playing field for people who have historically been shut out of these opportunities can continue to do that\nI Would hope that uh the court is able to take serious way on the fact that these sorts of programs were meant to start as a counterpoint to discrimination\nBecause the lived experience of minorities can be learned by swapping a cheek for speeding into a cheap Karen Grigsby
