Trump insisted he can change that\nYou can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do just with an executive order\nThe full interview airs this weekend on Axios on HBO joining us now is NPR's Joel Rose Hi Joel hey our first just fact check for us can the president do this\nMost constitutional scholars would say he can't do it alone and they would argue actually the Congress couldn't do it alone either they say it would require a constitutional amendment because right now here is what the force\nSubject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United states it\nIs that seems pretty clear language so where does President Trump's argument come from that he could do this without a constitutional amendment\nThe president is relying basically on a small but very vocal group of conservative legal scholars who say that the entire country basically has been reading the fourteenth amendment wrong for over a century and that children who were born to non citizens should not be granted automatic citizenship\nThey argue that was a mistake and that it's led immigrants to abuse the current system\nI Know there's been a lot of reaction to this today both on Capitol Hill and among the legal community tell us what people are saying\nWell Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan was asked about the president's comments today and said flatly that you cannot and birthright citizenship with an executive order\nMost legal scholars say the Supreme Court settled this more than a century ago Margaret Stock is an immigration lawyer in Alaska who taught constitutional law at West point here is what she said\nI think it's kind of a lunatic fringe argument but it's been going on for a long time I mean I've been debating looks like it's more than a decade and now they got a president in office who apparently as fixated on this as well\nIf President Trump does follow through on this proposal there would certainly be legal challenges and it's important to note though that the White House has floated other executive orders that never saw the light of day so a lot of the White House his critics are saying that this is just politics\nAnd in terms of politics the timing seems significant that we're one week from the mid term elections or is this just President Trump trying to make immigration the central issue in these final days\nWhile the president has definitely been talking a lot about immigration at his campaign rallies or just yesterday the department of defense announced that its sending about five thousand troops to the southwest border to support immigration authorities\nThat is in response to the migrant caravan of people fleeing from violence in Central America that is slowly making its way across Mexico\nNo question that this president was elected on a promise to get tough on immigration and that this issue plays well with his base he wants to turn that base out to vote next week or in the mid term elections\nUm although you know judging by the outrage from Democrats and others over his proposal to end birthright citizenship I guess it's possible that this issue will motivate voters on the other side as well\nOne more statement from the president on this that I'd like you to fact check Trump says the U.S has out of step with the rest of the world and that it is the only country to allow birthright citizenship is that true\nNo that's not true the U.

in Washington DC included schoolteachers political\nOrganizers and healthcare analysts are sipping wine munching on tacos and commiserate about politics they actually did not know each other very well

twenty sixteen too little too late in ... opinion now in twenty Eighteen it's time for the midterms Kesha Willis believes that once again black women voters will be expected to turn out in numbers that will prop up democratic candidates\nI think our vote has been taken for granted\nUm and I think people are paying attention more now than they have in the past\nEspecially with um everything that happened with Doug Jones down in Alabama with its black women who delivered that W that day and I think a lot of people are now realizing what we've known all along is that we do have that power\nThis idea of being taken for granted as a voting bloc it's not new what's different this year is the ongoing debate and the Democratic party about whether it's focused on people of color in twenty sixteen came at the expense of the white working class vote and what it will take to bring back those white voters and twenty twenty\nTo Michelle nearly it's underscored by the new progressive activism she says hasn't always been there for black voters\nIs it ...\nWhat\nWhy why are\nWe\nIn that list of issues important black women voters isn't that long or unfamiliar several women including Libya Berkes brought up mass incarceration and criminal justice\nEvery election cycle no one wants to touch criminal justice because they don't want to I\nThink their chances of being real and black woman had a

Berkes resented the implication that it's a zero sum game that anyone has to lose out when it comes to a candidate reaching out and asking for a vote\nYou have to show up to the community every now and then and say hey I'm with you or something like if all your resources and all the your dollars are going to convince people who are not necessarily with you then you make the other group feel like they're not they're not even worth being heard\nThis is all part of a wider debate in the Democratic party about the idea of identity politics so I reached out to California congresswoman Barbara early right now she's making her own bed to be part of the leadership of the Democratic caucus in Congress I asked her what excuses she's heard over the years for the party taking black women voters for granted\nIt's interesting because they don't give an excuse because they don't even think about it and I think that's part of the problem\nThey take us for granted and over the years it's been up and down up and down but for the most part I don't believe that um until now at least there's been a recognition of the value of African American women not only to the Democratic party but to the country\nIs there something specific to this moment that you think is forcing the party to take this boat or block more seriously\nI think in this moment uh we saw major wins in Alabama and in Virginia\nOf those races and so black women have decided that\nYou know no longer are we going to be behind the scenes helping others in this instance this year we see brilliant black women running for Congress around the country and for a variety of state and local offices and that's a major breakthrough and I think we have just said enough is enough\n[noise] what are black women getting out of voting for Democrats we definitely have heard from you what Democrats are getting out of it\nWell black women I tell you voting for Democrats first of all look at the alternative in terms of what they're getting out of Republicans but when you look at the policies of the Democrats champion\nAnd right now especially as it relates to education and healthcare housing reducing the cost of prescription drugs it was Democrats who have fought to make sure that uh insurance companies don't deny coverage to anyone especially African American women as it relates to pre existing conditions\nWho has these pre existing conditions disproportionately it's African American men and women and so I think when you look at the agenda of the Democratic party while we haven't gotten there yet where we should in terms of equality and justice for all\nThat's our agenda and that's our platform when you look at the Republicans they're just the opposite and so I you know as a Democrat and as a progressive Democrat\nI'm trying to make our party more responsive more inclusive and more progressive and all that will help African American women achieve parity equity and justice in this country as a will for everyone\nCan you talk to the criticism that people feel like the Democratic establishment isn't always very good at backing black women candidates the most famous example this cycle was on a Presley in Boston who did not get the support of the Congressional Black caucus his own packed\nWith the CBC the island is a separate entity from the CBC pack\nSo when you look at the fire walls there are several organizations that are not a CBC feed 'em directed and so the political action committee of the CBC makes the the board makes decisions on who to back and who not to back\nBut I on a is a very smart brilliant\nBlack woman politician with a lot of experience and she showed that she could take on the establishment and when and that's what black women are doing all

asking for users and explicitly tied this then to\nThe white supremacists organizing and the no plot forming of white supremacists in the aftermath of the violence of the unite the Right rally this third moment where ...\nWas actively recruiting users had to do with Twitter purging white supremacists and removing the blue check mark from white supremacists on their platform and in each of these\nInstances tour bus was recruiting white people by saying that there's anti white racism that persists on other social platforms and that you wouldn't suffer\nThe same kind of moderation on his platform if you were to post pro white statements\nI Want to play a piece of tape for you a NPR reporter Jasmine\nI'm going and would you expect us to do with those like that you want to censor

make of his response that gap should just be this free for all yeah I disagree because ultimately the counterpoint that she would hope would be president on gab isn't there so what users tend to do when\nPlatforms get filled with troll cereal harasser as\nPeople generally opt out not many people go on line to\nDefend against these kinds of post that get served through gap and there is no

S. round drummer\nWhat if people they're told you\nYeah this is a really complicated time for people in the city um there has been a real debate here about whether the president has the right figure to be involved in this period of mourning\nI spoke earlier today with Angela feral who attended one of the funerals in a squirrel hill neighborhood uh and she said she thinks a male mayor ... should have met with the president\nI don't think is a good thing that the marathon here supporting the president I think that the massive shaking\nAnd I should say that after the president departed I went to one of the protests here and spoke with Nathan Siegel he was marching ah and and he says he grew up in the squirrel hill neighborhood attending the tree of life synagogue\nIt's my home and it's

him in my community\nSo you can hear Ari emotions are are really high I I Do want to say that protesters really made a show of thanking police and other first responders who helped after this attack so even as they were criticizing the president a lot of people here were calling for unity and healing\nAnd just briefly there were four funerals today seven more to come in the days ahead I Know you talk with some people attending those services what did you hear from\nYou know it's interesting there's a lot of sadness a lot of anger and horror at what happened here but people are talking about the need for action going forward people talking about voting obviously the midterm elections are coming up they're talking about a need for new civility in American politics hoping that some kind of

Shapiro and I melted Chang let's turn now to the latest news from the special counsel investigating connections between President Trump associates and Russia\nThe latest is a bizarre sequence of events that raises as many if not more questions than answers the office of special counsel Robert Mueller has asked the FBI to investigate in a legit scheme intended to make Muller look bad\nNPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas is here to walk us through all of this Hey Ryan either our first what has the special counsel's office at exactly\n... a spokesman for the office Peter car says that they first learned about this alleged scheme last week and it involves a woman who says she was offered money to make false claims about Robert Mueller cart does not specify the nature of those claims of the special special counsel's office was you know it's usually very tight lipped but it did decide to speak about this\nUh and it says it immediately refer the matter to the FBI for investigation the bureau for its part is not competent at this point okay\nBut do we know anything about this purported plots\n[noise] yes\nCount that purportedly belongs to a woman in Fort Myers reached out to several journalists and media outlets including NPR\nThis individual alleged that she had been offered tens of thousands of dollars\nIn exchange for that money she was supposed to make sexual misconduct allegations against Muller allegations that date back to a time that this individual allegedly allegedly worked with Mueller a at a law firm in Nineteen Seventy four\nThe individual sending these emails said she refused she refused the money and any part in this game do we know anything about this woman\nNPR asked her to speak on the phone to confirm her identity she refused uh there were a number of details in her emails that didn't stand up to up to scrutiny\nShe said she lives in Fort Myers reporters couldn't track down and individual with a name she provided in Fort Myers and perhaps most importantly the law firm where she says she worked with mother in Nineteen Seventy four told me that it has no record of this individual\nWorking from the okay so this is happening exactly one week before the midterm elections what do you make the interesting lining here\nThe timing is indeed curious ... midterms are around the corner as you said and certainly this could be part of an effort to muddy Muller head of the vote a but there's another curious twist your the individual sending emails set a man by the name of jak Berkman was behind a scheme to pay a woman to make these claims against smaller\nBerkman is a conservative lobbyist to host a talk show on Newsmax Newsmax TV ah which is owned by Trump confidant Chris Ruddy\nBerkman is probably best known as one of the people who helped fuel a conspiracy theory that you may remember a around the killing of a Democratic National committee staffer and twenty six in a a theory that has since been dumped some of the news organizations that covered it have actually were attracted their stories\nAre no Berkman tweeted this afternoon that later this week he was going to reveal what he alleges is the first of Miller's a sexual assault victims\nIt's unclear whether that news conference that he's talking about will still go ahead and write he's also accused the left of attacking him to deflect attention from Miller\nThe bottom line here in this whole rigor rigor and moral is this the special counsel's office says it has asked the FBI to look into this alleged scheme to pay a woman to make what they say are false allegations against smaller\nVery weird story NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas thank you thank you\nEbola has been spreading through an eastern region of the Democratic Republic of Congo for more than three months more than two hundred and forty people have been infected and recently the tally of new cases has risen from about tend to more than thirty per week NPR's ... eyes and men

red cross and coordinator of these safe burial teams they sent into the community when someone has died of Ebola at home\nOn this date the team had come to pick up the body of a child from district or a boy of seven I just as a crowd of about a hundred and fifty neighbors started gathering as soon as the team arrived\nAt first people were just watching as the team pulled on protective suits and walked into the house then just as the team was about to put the boy into a body bag\nThe budget for the boy's father rushed in and said he changed his mind he didn't want his son take him to ...\nThat's when the mood in the crowd shifted from curious to menacing in an instant the team immediately backed off started taking off their suits as quickly as they dared\nAll on campus from Vermont to be you're going to be now you're just fear the worst or you're trying not to look like you're rushing because showing fear will provoke the ground but you're also trying to get out before someone throws the first row because you know once that happens everyone will start throwing\nIdea and his team did manage to drive often time but the ... government reports that health workers are being threatened like this three or four times a week\nPartly it's because many people in the communities where Ebola is now spreading had never heard of it so they're resistant to giving up their loved ones to these strange people and scary plastic suits but there's another issue she's ... is a senior analyst with international crisis group\nThe local population is very distrustful of government\nEven to this part of the DR see has a lot of mineral wealth people are desperately poor may believe the ruling authorities only care about exploiting the wealth for themselves we haven't seen anything from this government perhaps most of all they are furious that for years now multiple armed rebel groups have room to the area\nAnd not of the central government nor the United nations' peacekeeping force that is thousands strong has offered much protection\nJust ten days ago one of these groups reportedly killed Fifteen civilians and kidnapped a dozen children\nAnd so says put on when an authority figure be it from the government or a foreign health worker shows up to warn about Ebola\nThere's a question of whether this outbreak is even ... you know whether they're true motives of the government has\nAlso after pretty much every attack by a rebel group people in the affected town or city had been staging street protests\nRacing anyone who has had contact with an infected person so the contact can be vaccinated and monitored we Arthur is one of the officials tracking people epidemic for the U.S Centers for Disease Control and prevention\nSo every time this happens you're teams don't go out they don't see the contacts\nAnd the disease spreads the world Health Organization has called for more security in the operate sound but production of international crisis group says the un is trying to wind down its presence NTR see\nSo it's very unlikely that peacekeepers and the outbreaks down right now the UN's main focus on the ... elections that are set for December making sure the government actually holds them and doesn't crack down on opposition groups\nIn fear of the un has to shift its pieces on the transport\nAway from the east where Ebola spreading to other parts of the country [noise] health workers have managed to vaccinate a record number of people more than twenty four thousand so far and the CDC's Arthur says that's why despite the violence this outbreak is not spiraling book\nThe longer this goes on we may get to the point where the dampening effect that we have using the vaccine is no longer keeping the level of transmission down\nAnd then Arthur says we could move into a more explosive outbreak ...
