Louise ... wrote killers this was quite the turn of phrase do we know if the president has thought deeply on those to come up with it on the fly with\nThe president is offering an alternative theory of the case although he didn't explain how a group of road killers could have gotten into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and killed someone but his instinct is to deflect blame from the Saudi royal family he said several times today that the Saudi king flatly firmly denied it\nThis is very similar to what he did with let them or ... and when he cited pollutants strong denials of any interference in the twenty sixteen election and back then he also offered an alternative theory of the case where he said someone weighing four hundred pounds sitting on his bed could have been the hacker of the Democratic party emails\nSo clearly the president's instinct is to defend dictators\nSo Rome killers is maybe the update on the four hundred pound guy say okay and I mentioned the president was on his way to Florida Today I it's very common of course for president to visit a disaster area but in Florida a few weeks before an election what are the politics of a presidential visit\nWell this was an official visit but it definitely had a political component because two of the most important races the cycle or in Florida the governor's race of course very important to Trump that a Republican remain governor there for twenty twenty for Trump's own reelection\nAnd also the current governor Rick Scott is the Republican nominee for Senate and if Democrats can keep the Senate seat in Florida they probably have no chance of taking over the majority there\nBut the president did meet with Governor Rick Scott he praised him normally natural disasters are a very positive political opportunity for incumbent governors because they have the resources and executive powers that non incumbent slack they can be a acting helping people really keeping in the spotlight\nAsk you about one of the big issues in the Florida Senate race this is the red algae bloom the spin following the state's be choose and which is tied to warmer waters that come with climate change and the warm waters which are of course also tied to the increasing intensity of hurricanes like hurricane Michael\nHow is the president talking about that has Rick Scott talking about that what what\nHe thought the climate was changing but he wouldn't say that people are human activity was behind that change she even said well the climate is changing it could change back\nAh and then when asked well Ninety nine percent of

spending a few days looking at a striking disparity in prisons across the United states women are disciplined more frequently and often more harshly than men that's the finding of an investigation by NPR and the ... school of journalism at Northwestern university\nNPR's Joseph Shapiro and reporter Jessica papa that found that women are punished disproportionately from minor infractions those violations can have major repercussions like the loss of good conduct credits or solitary confinement here's Joe\nWe collected data on prison discipline from Fifteen states it all but two women get this one of the higher rates than men what's most striking is that women get punished far more for minor violations of prison rules at rates we estimated often two to three times higher for what prisons classify as smaller fraction\nPetty stuff you can get written up for a not closing your doors and get written up for jumping on the phone without permission or if you just want to just picture room up nice in just takes until late in ... you get written up for that\nThat's the tortilla Williams and it made up the central California women's facility and show show a California\nYou get written up for going out of bounds in somebody else's room\nAre out of bounds in the hallway [noise] it's just basically everything you get written up\nFor our numbers showed that in California women compared to men get twice the disciplinary tickets for disobeying an order\nAnd more than twice as many for what's called disrespect in Vermont we found women are more than three times as likely to get in trouble for making what's called derogatory comments in Rhode Island they get more than three times the tickets were disobedience\nThose tickets have consequences women who's good conduct credits that kind of time at it to their stay in prison or lose phoning visitation privileges or go to solitary confinement in Rhode Island women were more than three times as likely as men to end up in solitary confinement\nFor disobedience [noise] prisons were built for men and the rules for discipline were set up to control those math DMV ... says those rules don't work very well with women you walk through a women's prison\nA women's prison in Illinois several years ago this was a top official in the Illinois department of corrections now she works with prisons as a consultant she helps them address that problem of why women in prison get disciplined more\nWomen are more communicative when you walk to a prison they are more emotional they want to talk to you they want to talk about their children there when I talk about their experiences\nTwo years ago they notice helped conduct an audit of that women's prison in Illinois and found that women prisoners were disciplined almost twice as often as men for all offenses big and small but almost five times more likely to get in trouble for a lesser offense called minor influence\nAnd they also really if they seen injustice with another woman in a prison or something that happened they want to fix it like they want to be the mom that's going to come in and mediate between people and fix the problem\n... told us she likes it that women prisoners are this way but she said many corrections officers and often even in a women's prison most of them are men say they hate it\nAnd the first thing that they'll tell you is these women are so difficult gosh they're a pain I Would rather work anywhere but here they always want to talk to you they won't take no for an answer\nCorrections officers are trained to keep control they expect women to be compliant if the women push back that's where those disciplinary tickets for influence come in\nTo women and we met in Illinois told us they'd been written up some years ago for an infraction code reckless I bowling\nWhile women get more tickets than men certain women get the most tickets of all women with mental illness those who are lesbian bisexual or transgender African American women especially for those lesser non violent offenses\n... ... a guard out because they passed on to me that I like or yeah stuff like that\nTitanic Williams was Nineteen when she went to
