Kelly in Washington and I noticed the change in Phoenix at member station kj Veasey President Trump is campaigning in Arizona tonight the trip is part of a western swing to rally Republican voters and in the mid term elections which are now just over two weeks away\nLast night in Montana he distilled the Republican closing argument heading into the midterm elections to this [noise]\nI Know a lot [noise] of job at all [noise]\nThe caravan law and order and common sense that's what it's going to be\nThe caravan he's talking about is a group of migrants trying to reach the U.S border it's now a big feature in his stump speech and joining us now to talk about all this is NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith hate him high so why I'm Talking about another\nUh he talked about a different caravan back in April a this is a new one um and it's getting a lot of attention on cable news ah and so he is talking about it again he suggested at that rally\nWithout offering any evidence um it made a claim that Democrats were somehow behind the caravan\nWhat they want is the ... and there are those the caravan didn't just shop and it doesn't just happen a lot of reasons Jarvis four thousand people but I just want to the Mexican government because they're so good hopefully before it ever [noise]\nWe should underscore that there's really no evidence to back up this conspiracy theory that that he's been able to offer but you know the reason that he is talking about this and talking about illegal immigration is that it's something that gets his supporters animated\nYou know they are still at these rallies chanting build the wall almost every ... every time he's out there so basically this is just an effort to rally the Republican base to get out and vote yeah and the evidence is that it's a winning issue a there are two new polls from Pew that are out\nA defined that illegal immigration is an incredibly salient issue among those who plan to vote Republican in the upcoming elections they asked about twenty different issues facing the country\nAnd those supporting Republicans intimate terms uh Seventy five percent of them say that they consider illegal immigration to be a very big issue Jocelyn Kiley is associate director of research at the Pew Research center you can see the\nUh there's energy among Republican voters around the issue of immigration and that energy is most pronounced within the set of Republican voters who are really focused on border security and law enforcement\nAnd so how do we know this is a base play illegal immigration in the way that President Trump talks about it is simply not a priority issue in the same way for Democrats or independent voters as it is for Republican voter voters and for Republican voters or she says it it can be a powerful motivator\nI Wonder if this election supposed to be about the Republican tax cut which was one of the president's biggest accomplishments why is he talking so much about immigration specifically now yeah and immigration is an area where he hasn't accomplished as much as he would want to border crossings are apparently up\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from

like you who donate to this NPR station\nNPR News this is all things considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly in Washington and I melted\nHis own a is a state where the G O P dominates politics right now\nBoth of US Senators the governor most state lawmakers they're all Republican but that could change because waves of Latinos will become eligible to vote in the coming years and they tend to vote democratic which means Arizona could flip\nFrom red to blue\nUnless the Republican Party can win over the growing number of Latino voters in this state and to get a sense of that challenge I traveled to a town just west of Phoenix called policy it's about eighty percent Latino\nI'm In a restaurant serving port those out got as and tacos and I bumped into a guy who gives the Republican somehow\nThe way we handle our homes especially in Hispanic community is the way Trump wants to run the U.S [noise]\nRamon bearing owns a small business repairing floors he's a registered Republican and he says he appreciates the values Trump stands\nFor security order you know you need certain order and in your home\nYou know the issues that came with the wall\nYou know building a wall it is a good idea because I just installed not even two weeks ago a security door on my door I already have a door but I Would have better door if you're a ... year old son he's fourteen years old and it's funny that he told me somehow that door makes me feel safer\nIt made me think you know that you know it does make sense more more metal their keeps\nThe worst people out\nBut step outside and within seconds you'll run into people who had mentally just agree with the parents like Abel Hernandez a truck driver who says immigration is the deal breaker the reason most Latinos will never vote Republican\nYou heard of the news or coming up with all these laws that make it more difficult for people for any country in the world to a ... status you seem to kiss been separated from the families of the water I think all that reflects pretty bad on the Republican Party you asked me\n... all that or you know Trump and his agenda\nThere is reason Hernandez view may not be worrying Republicans right now\nRepublicans are banking on two things\nJust ... Garcia hits the Latino public policy center at Arizona State university\nAre banking on that there's enough white voters to win the election today and their banking that there's going to be short memory\nLatinos will turn Arizona majority minority by twenty thirty and a whole lot of them are going to be us citizens\nTwenty eight team could be the last election that Republicans can win without also winning the Latino vote\nSo the question for Republicans is how will they persuade those Latino voters to join their teeth [noise]\nI'm not a baseball diamond in a small park in northern feeding and the district at state representative Tony Rivera\nHas any of your friends or or any other members of the Latino community giving you a hard time for becoming a Republican\nI'm people have given me a hard time like what what did they say they say\nRepublican and when the Republicans don't support\n'em Hispanics they don't support immigration reform\nAnd it's just wants to them is take a look at all of the other values of the Republican Party they mesh perfectly with Latinos safe the traditional family small business entrepreneurship\nIt's not easy to get away from the party's position on immigration and you can hear that when you walk around with their district as the knock on doors [noise]\nI'm only going to take some time I was there on the Republican running for realize I'm I'm here to answer any questions they may have topics including our budget education immigration is a hot topic\nOf the show that people focus too much on the people calling from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news it doesn't look good\nWhen you know I'm I'm a Republican was born and raised in short of parents are from Mexico\nAnd um this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I think this is a country of an opportunity but I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart and sensible immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration one that includes border security\nOne that legalize as the people who are here who want to work hard who are looking for opportunities and we need to increase the number of pieces of people who were coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThis sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration pushing I'm\nA I'm going to continue pushing my position\nYou're a lot from Arizona Republicans who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against a Latino candidate\nI'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of or soda I Can't be in control of what happens back east still\nI asked to see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters\nYou will hear me using the word Republican uh in in the ... election or Doug ... on the ballot and its Doug do she's agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it wouldn't be as you approach doozy for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent past\nThe governor does not support\nCertain language doesn't support certain policies that\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for the is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them we need to keep them out we need to build a wall not one says he said that no I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic\nIf Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations the deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nThis was going to see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you go to ... go to ... vote and they said that we were ready to go over\nIn other words Hernandez says\nThe Republican Party states may already be sealed for generations to come and as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republicans to separate themselves from the broader party governor juicy will be appearing on stage at a campaign rally in Phoenix tonight with

G and given a little tiny bit of detail on what happened do you still believe un investigation would be worthwhile would be necessary\n[noise] absolutely I mean I think we're in a position right now where we have\nAll of these competing narratives right we have a the drip drip drip of leaks from the Turkish a law enforcement authorities that have given some really brutal detail of\nA of a of ... killing and\nThose same really quite at odds with what a what the Saudis are announcing today the idea of a of a fist fight to em seems really um counter to what to do what the Turks have suggested so I think the only way right now to get to the bottom of this\nI have a credible investigation and that means something that would be authorized by by the un or the secretary general or some other international body\nWhat would that investigation looked like how big are we talking how long would it take\n[noise] I think we're talking about something small you know we're talking about as in past cases like this\nMaybe five individuals could be led by a high profile former prosecutor investigators who have experience with international crimes and criminal investigation and um you know at the very minimum it can involve analyzing what\nOr it could involve on site visits a interviews of of officials and so forth but but I think it's something that could be done fairly quickly four to six weeks well once it's authorized\nUm who has to call for this I mean what what would it take to put this in motion mhm\n[noise] yeah I mean there's really a bunch of different models that would be available for something like this the Security Council has authorized investigations\nFor for heinous crimes are and comprehensive systematic crimes like crimes against humanity and genocide or they did it in the context of dark for in Sudan several years ago and they've done it in many other places the human rights council could do it the human rights council benefit is that it's not subject\nTo ah to the veto of\nAny of the five permanent members gonna okay so if the U.S decided they didn't think this investigation was necessary that could block of Security Council investigation but not the human rights council\nAbsolutely ... and there's there's a third option to which uh several human rights organizations have been calling for and that's for the secretary general on his own to authorize a authorizes an investigation and set one up\n[noise] um what would happen once this investigation is complete it would it be binding in any way could the Saudis just decide we have our version of events we don't buy it\n[noise] yeah no this is a this would be something where it would be an investigation because of its credibility because it would be international eyes it would be something that from you know from that point states could take a look at it and make a decision as to how to proceed and there would be any number of options available to them whether its\nDiplomatic penalties penalties and international organizations or or other kinds of outcomes but but there's nothing binding I'm not talking about how beautiful but we're talking about a credible international

magazine and she has coverage Saudi Arabia for years hello to you both good to be with you either a and Robin let me start by offering my condolences I Know that ... was a friend\nHe was indeed and I mean we this is something that we have known and suspected now for sixteen days but the Saudi announcement lax total of credibility that they have claimed for two weeks that he walked out of the consulate and the idea that\nThat a committee led by Mohammad bin ... on the crown prince is going to investigate\nSomething that he has been implicated in is going to lead to a lot of questions I think around the world there is no Robert Mueller and the kingdom and it's going to be very hard for them to say anything that people are going to believe\nWhen we moved back to a couple of points you raise their show first jump in and let me let you just give any more detail that Saudi TV is providing what exactly was the statement tonight\nAs you said they they said that it was a a fight that I'm In which he died a which was a ... sounded rather odd I'm given the fact that that the Turks have been telling us that there were Fifteen people there are the Saudis have I don't even fight exactly or the Saudis have said that\nLeave from their duties and that includes um a royal court advisor who's close to crown prince Mohammed bin so much on so you know it it it's obviously getting close to him but uh it's not clear what if if he is ready at all to take any credit for it it sounds like\nThey're you know trying to blame lower level people ... and\nMichelle to to the point that Robin Wright just made how much confidence should we have in this version of events um given that it is a completely different version of events than the one that the Saudis have been sticking to before\nYeah you have to remember that they said that ... left the consulate\nI'm so they totally denied any knowledge of it um I was just there a with secretary of state Mike Pompeo we went to um uh both Saudi Arabia

and where today they broke through an immigration barrier and try to inter Mexico from Guatemala\nMexican security forces appealed for order and then fired tear gas to drive the migrants back\nPresident Trump has already weighed in he's think Mexico for its efforts to stop these so called caravan he has also said he will close the U.S border to these migrants well let's bring in reporter James Frederick who is there in Guatemala Hi James\nI'm Mary Louise so just yesterday you were describing to me a relatively calm scene at the border a lot of security but migrants who were masked a few minutes away from the border what what happened today\nOr this group of migrants that has now grown to thousands we don't know exactly how many uh but thousands of migrants now decided they were going to march to this bridge that connects Guatemala and Mexico and they said they were going to try to enter Mexico today\nIt was a very chaotic scene but uh you know for him just try to summarize it as quickly as possible [noise]\nAh they were at the fence blocking them from leaving Guatemala that got through that sends thousands of people started a walking across the bridge into Mexico Mexico has closed a big metal gate to them it had dozens of federal police officers in riot gear rating for the care of and\nThen I wasn't close enough to see what happened but then the Mexican gate open briefly we heard shots that turned out mostly to be here or gas or that they were using it in some migrants and then the gate shut again\nUm it was a really chaotic scene and let's hear from this father who was near the front of the caravan with his two young kids\nIs I don't see them up\nFor what we want to vote for [noise]\nSo what he said was that she went to the front with his children because they thought they were going to let families and children cross first then this chaos broke out she had to pour water in his children's eyes they got here ... it was just really chaotic or there were several children who have lost their families it was it was a really rough seen\nSpeaking of the really chaotic scene I can hear a lot of noise behind you James where exactly are you [noise]\nSo I'm back on the bottom all inside of the border but still right so you're a near the bridge and and several of the migrants a couple of hundred so far have drifted back into Guatemala I'm sitting right\nWe're really hydrated I mean there's a young boy laying on the caught marriage probably four years old and as a as a cold ... has had so Guatemalan authorities are trying to treat people who said suffered a lot of heat stroke a Andy hydration as well as some people who actually suffered broken bones in the classroom\nAnd just you talk to these people what did they say their next move is are they going to try again I mean it does not sound as though Mexico is inclined to let them cross the border and crossed this bridge [noise]\nA lot of people I talked to said we are going to leave this bridge what their request thing is for Mexico to let them and\nAs asylum seekers and so they many of them say we are not going to lead the Brits were going to block the bridge into Mexico\nLactose and given the clashes today Mexico has totally closed the border or you know I tried to get back into Mexico and was not able to get close to everyone a show it's it's really up in the air what they're going to do but everyone I talked to said no we're not turning around we're not going on\nIn the seconds we have left teams I mentioned that President Trump is threatening to close the U.S border if this caravan does manage to make it across Mexico and advance getting to the U.S is if the goal of these people are they aware of the president's position [noise]\nThey they're aware of that a Trump does not want to let them into the country for what they say over and over again as we know that his stance but we're asking we're pleading for help because you know whatever Trump puts in front of us [noise] what is back at home is worse than whatever trend and put in front of us [noise]\nAll right thank you James [noise]\nThank you that is James Frederick reporting from
