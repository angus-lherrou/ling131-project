I Would say over two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody until a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child in the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too

been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way\nBut all he said was was I cannot bring wild child back here it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to

Chang and I'm Audie Cornish\nPresident Trump is campaigning hard with just two weeks to go until the mid term elections and he's keeping the fact checkers busy we're going to take a look now at some of the president's latest claims with NPR's Scott Horsley hey there Scott I already first let's talk about the caravan of Central American migrants the president has been talking a fair bit about that\nThey're making their way to Mexico and hopes of reaching the U.S border and now President Trump has suggested that they're not just a family's looking for a better life what is he saying instead\nThe president tweeted this week without offering any evidence that quote criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in with this caravan\nHe was pressed on that in the oval office today and conceded there's no proof to that claim but he continues to insist the caravan an illegal immigration more generally pose a serious threat to the country certainly you have people\nComing up through the southern border from the middle east and other places that are not appropriate for our country and Tom not letting them in\nNow it's not unheard of for people from the middle east to try to cross the border illegally from Mexico but it is extremely rare already\nOut of more than three hundred thousand people who are apprehended along the southern border last year only about eighty four for ... war from countries in the middle east and reporters who've been traveling with the caravan say they have not seen any middle Easterners in that group\nAh there's no evidence then as Middle Eastern infiltration the president has not presented any why is he talking about it\nThe illegal immigration and the threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first launched his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data to support this that illegal immigration is an important issue for Republicans he has been very clear and his plans to harp on hot button issues like immigration and the Supreme Court in the home stretch of the midterm campaign\n[noise] [noise]\nIt on that Leslie was that tax cuts which I think a lot of mainstream Republicans thought would be the first thing that that tax cut they passed in twenty Seventeen but we haven't been hearing too much about what's going on\nThe ... is not warn terribly well right now is pulling at about forty percent approval uh a lot of people maybe don't feel like they've seen a big jump in their own take home pay there's also been some renewed attention paid to the federal deficit which has ballooned as corporate tax revenue shrank\nThe president believes he has a fix for this though and it's another tax cut I Want to play a piece of tape from his rally in Houston last night Audi but I have to warn you take this message with a big grain of salt\nIn it for tax cuts for middle income families [noise]\nOr whatever you might think about the merits of another tax cut Congress certainly is not going to take any action on that next week they're not even session until after the election\nAnd what's more nobody outside the White House seems to know what the president is talking about the head of the house ways and Means Committee belatedly put out a statement this afternoon saying he's willing to work with the president over the coming weeks\nBut this appears to be a bit of political vapor where that's just time for the election and a tacit admission to the actual tax cut the Republicans passed last year isn't selling very

communities\nShe's the head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights in elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bills being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to ...\nAll right so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states\nImposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to present specific kinds of id in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen is going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue of and reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the rolls um some of that is set forth through law but some of it is just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their business\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn the role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person hasn't voted and two and three cycles or look we're not sure if this person's still lives at the same address I mean is it described as a administrative\nEffort [noise] um we want\nElection and administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and so voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening\nIn states that used to be required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election
