R. T. V. great falls K ... Helena\nJacket Yamanaka senior political correspondent with Yellowstone public radio and Kevin Stanfield is news director in Ankara ... Bozeman K acts to laugh Butte I'm Jake on your moderator anchor and reporter occasionally ...\nWithout our first question tonight goes to Mr ...\nSo we really appreciate our first question then\nWhat would you say is you're proudest political moment\nProducts political moment I think was [noise] when we when we started the cash for mapping project I'm we're told I was told\nThat it could never happen you couldn't make it happen but we got five counties together\nAnd formed a coalition\nThat was to be mutually benefit for every citizen in the state of Montana\nConvincing the state and that was another problem because you had all the power to her that you had to have you had to\nDepartment of revenue they had their ideas department transportation but we got everybody on the same sheet of music and we got a an accomplishment that no other state has ever done\nAnd this system is probably\nThe best example of cooperation and when you put politics aside you and your cooperate for the mutual benefit of everybody that you can accomplish monumental things\nIt's pretty easy on\nGun rights are critically important to the vast majority of the people here in Montana\nI'm really really proud that I've been endorsed by the n._r._a.\nNRA stayed out of these elections the last several cycles and to receive a a rating from the n._r._a. to receive their endorsements against a two term sitting senator who can only muster up a ... grade from the n._r._a. I'm I'm very proud of that\nSenator tester you're proudest moment where you know Jay ah first of all I Want to thank him to you know one thing\nYou guys should put in the sun I appreciate very much I served on suck so conservation the school board to the state legislature and one thing Montana has\nThat I don't think any other state has and that's an open government and I've been proud to take that back in the first bill I dropped in in the U.S said was a bill to make the federal government of those as open as Montana's government I think it's critically important not only for\nThe press rebel to get access to the cities that are making made there that are going to affect our country but for the general population to\nMr Breckenridge and trying to find work\nUm [noise] I Would say that it's that um\nYou know libertarian said never\nSent your sons and daughters to war\nLibertarians have never ah invoked attacks upon you that was too onerous and libertarians a Sikh\nMutual cooperation for the benefit of all [noise] than to whatever\nAnd the libertarians haven't\nJak Yamanaka has our next question\nDirected to Mr Rosen do\nYou support short term insurance plan that aren't required to cover pre existing conditions so\nIf there are so great\nWell you pledge today that you will by I wanted to cover your family [noise]\nJacket that's a good question and I think it goes directly to the board of ... insurance uh questions that we've had here over the last eight years\nSince the passage of Obamacare which we cannot forget that Jon Tester was the deciding vote on that boat it to us and what we saw with Obamacare was the elimination of choice for the people in Montana we saw the increase of cost for health care for the people mind out had since I entered the all the result is my first step\nWas to start working on a plan to cover pre existing chronic conditions for the people across our state and that is critically important but the next thing that we have to do is make sure that we have options for everyone\nSo that they can accommodate their budgets their specific healthcare needs are personal choices so\nShort term plans are part of that\nDirect primary care plans are part of that health care sharing ministries are part of that and none of these things will accommodate everyone but they certainly fall into place get everyone an opportunity\nI don't think you answered my question Mr Rosen do\nYou say you support the short term insurance plan\nAnd if they are so great\nWould you buy one today to cover your family\nWhat I'm saying Jackie is that we need to have\nA full range of options of health care plans for everyone to to make a decision what is best for them it's not\nA federally run top down system for the ... just to make a decision about what is best for you and what does not best for you that's what I'm saying is up to the individual to make a decision about what type of plan that they want to use to accommodate their health care needs and that's what I've been supporting\nBy not focused on the issues rather than playground talks aren't these ads just insulting the intelligence of Montanans\nThey are and I really appreciate that question than because I'll tell you something when I entered this um\nA year ago folks asked me what it was going to be about and I said it's going to be about the truth\nAnd let's keep it focused on the issues I said to hell in law to reduce spending to reduce regulations to protect your property rights and your gun rights and the sanctity of life and I did all those things I Would do standing in the fall of ... says the operating costs\nOr reduced by twenty three percent the very first year I was in there I declined my pay raise\nHandled the only elected state official to do so and those are the kinds of things that people in Montana want to hear that we're actually doing and so when we ask about what this campaign is going to be that it's going to be about the truth the truth is John bras Obamacare\nThe truth is John doesn't support the president when he brought us tax cuts the truth is that John has supported sanctuary cities and open border policies with Chuck Schumer Nancy Pelosi\nYes Mr Rosendale or I Want to talk about one of those particular ads are aimed at you in particular is to criticize as you are backing a what's called a sub standard real estate development in great falls so what's\nYour response all I Do I really appreciate your bringing that up Jon Tester has raised so much money from lobbyists that he got caught taking a camera crew to Oklahoma to get somebody to process the lies about a subdivision that I opened up\nThe air subdivision\nThen sold out and went to Oklahoma Mr Rosen to finish\nThem Montana values I didn't think that we honor interrupted each other [laughter] went to Oklahoma and got caught\nIs getting someone to tell lies about a project and then the people who actually lived there called up and said take that now it's a bunch of ... false information and some more Washington Democrat smear now senator tester you\nCan well the facts of the facts in this another attempt to in his in his uh his his property development of Matt Rosendale or avoiding the truth and taking responsibility for the facts are clear the public record speaks for itself but let's talk about the issues Matt Rosendale understand your public lands he wants to ... people for existing conditions of health care\nHe wants to privatize republic schools make them into charters then vouchers he wants to make more dark money into our political system for these kind of lousy that you're talking about Tim factor matter as I have supported public lands\nI support public education I support people be able to buy health insurance at a reasonable rate because it's too costly and will continue to work to make sure our government is transparent\nThat's my record that's why you can't run positive ads he asked run negative\nSister Breckenridge pure find a word to anyone ever hear of a negative ad coming from a libertarian no these are idle article a accelerant that they use to activate their base\nAll right and so as the angry or they can get him some more fired up that they think that their base is going to come out and turn out to vote so these are just accelerant thrown on gas on the flames of things are a half years I mean mad has no\nNo responsibility for a contractor putting in a foundation argue that I'm a survey or how to ... I've done hundreds of developments and no one ever blame me for foundation so I I think John you want to where the line on that one\nJust arose no you have the final word thirty second again the facts to speak for themselves and John may not like the truth\nBut the truth is always the truth and he had to hire a camera crew to go to Paul Paul home to find someone to live at a subdivision that talk about public lands within that community\nTo go out there and play and then I put a playground out there for them as well south I'm very proud of the projects that I have opened up and the folks that are living they're the ones that are actually they're they're proud of it as well and that's why they called John up and ask you to take that commercial down\nOur next question from Kevin Stanfield goes to senator tester tests or talk about the second amendment to the constitution the right to keep and bear arms\nSure you're very familiar with it do you believe that Second Amendment rights is absolute\nWithout question [noise]\nAh first of all I just want to say one thing in regard to the last question because the record needs to be says tree commercial Rosendale had to sort of surveys he knew it had to be done to build those right he never told the contractor to do it right that's where the problem is\nThe second amendment look I'm a strong supporter of it\nUm I protect my farm with it I protect my family with with with with the second Amendment rights were given in fact what Matt Rosendale was building houses in Maryland I was butchering beef and pork literally made my living with a guy\nIt's critically important I Will tell you that I've done things to allow runs in parks to allow guns on trains to expand our Second Amendment rights I feel strongly and [noise] and nobody's going to take her guns away under my watch on the other side of the coin if you are criminal\nYou need to have a background check cars you forfeit is that right if you were quoted you to catered mentally ill you forfeit is that right\nAnd so those are terrorists you've forfeited that right so I think we need to have good on his background checks but when we pass a gun from father to son or a friend a friend there shouldn't be background checks require the liability is obvious there\nKevin ... yeah there's certain cities do have the uh the right to an actor own city ordinance\nRequiring background checks at gun shows so would you be in favor of that or not\n[noise] ah look I I think the second Amendment rights apply both in a rural areas and urban areas and I feel strongly about that and it's one of the reasons that I was one of the the lead supporters of of the uh the Heller document that that would have taken guns away from folks in urban America\nA lot guns or guns or a tool they're an instrument they need to be used properly in the hands of law abiding citizens I don't have any wars but she's not in the hands of criminals\nTo Breckenridge thirty seconds was the only person up here with a concealed carry permit a I think that uh the second amendment is very strong I don't know about the\nThe cows you've a shot out on your farm but I Know you have got a few fat hogs in Washington centered tester [laughter] but\nAnd a twenty twelve where it would have made me a felon to hand over a a rifle to my grand my grandson\nWithout doing a background check and filling out the paperwork that's a tradition that I have in my family's ... every time a grandchild was borne out by um a fireman I write a message to the future on that box\nMr a Rosendale you have thirty seconds [noise] it's very easy for John stand there and said he supports the second amendment\nBut it fall as very hollow when he's willing to confirm Supreme Court nominee\nSo to my or who came out and said that the right to own a gun is not a fundamental right\nSo he let somebody else do his bidding he can say that he's going to stand for the second amendment but when he confirms the Supreme Court justice that says that they're willing to take their Second Amendment rights away it is not acceptable may that's why I've got an a an endorsement from the and there are a and John has a day\nCenter test or you have the final word or well I Would\nJust like to say that that I Would pose bills require background checks from parents of the kids that's the record and that's a fact\nI Would also tell you that that ah [noise] ah going forward I support the second amendment\nI've been I was raised with a gun we shot burdens or the guns it's critically important to me is pretty report being Montana and raised here my entire life that I was introduced to guns early and I still use in the day as they've said I've got more guns in any but fewer than on\nOur next question from Tim McDonald to Mr Breckenridge Mr Breckenridge regarding immigration and what is your position on sanctuary cities\nSanctuary cities tomorrow or a\nProblem that ah the cities in the states have brought upon themselves\nConstitutionally ... those um security of of our border has been given or the federal government not to the state not to a city it's up to the federal government to ensure that we have an adequate immigration policy that meets the needs\nOf the American not only a culture but also the American workforce and the immigration policy that we have right now\nIs what fifty years old goes back to Nineteen sixty five we've had a few amendments to it but it's basically a fifty year old policy that no one seems to uh to want to enforce or seems to want to uh\nTo bring in people who will contribute to our society and to contribute to our culture I Would like to see a an immigration policy similar to Switzerland where the people in the town actually you know we have resident alien so we need to fast track\nBack door we need to change that just Rosendale\nSanctuary cities are major problem and this again goes directly to the heart of John's inability to support the president's agenda so secure our border\nAnd stop sanctuary cities and to also stop the the uh honesty\nHe continues to vote with Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi and it dries up the calls for government here across our nation when we started having this low the illegal drugs and human trafficking taking place and we had cities that are willing to open up their doors\nAnd allow these folks to to have a safe haven it's not acceptable that's not the rule of Law Center test or your response\nWell I've heard the commissioner of middle ground Chuck Schumer a couple of times on my ... my point two commissioners if you love Chuck Schumer you ought to move back to your home state drive up the road a few miles and run against him [noise]\n[noise]\nMy tail in Saudi Arabia education

Jew who has not been seen since he walked into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey two weeks ago turkey says the Saudis killed him\nAnd here's Michelle element is traveling with secretary of state which means she too is in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh Hi Michelle Hi Mary Louise\nSo I'm going to get to the substance of these talks today in a minute but start with the optics they are tricky I mentioned friendly handshakes and smiles meanwhile the agenda is to discuss an alleged murder murder plot by the Saudis yeah it was kind of\nGoing to see the king in his palace a brief stop at the foreign ministry um and a lot of time with the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman who's this young very powerful figure here we're told that the conversations have been directed candid you know dip below speak for quite tough\nBut you wouldn't know it by watching these men greeting each other in front of the cameras and talking about how important this relationship is\nEr at talk about the substance what did they say to each other and these direct and candid talks\nWell they've the U.S officials have said very little about that I mean they say that Trump sent Palmdale here to convey the message that it's really important for the Saudis to conduct a thorough transparent investigation into the disappearance of this Washington Post columnist\nUm U.S officials haven't weighed in about all of these reports\nIn the news at the Saudis are now portraying this is like an interrogation gone horribly wrong\nWe don't know exactly how the Saudis have been spending this with ... in private or if he believes them\nBut we do know that President Trump seems to at least according to his Twitter feed Trump says he spoke by phone to the crown prince who is with palm pilot the time and he says that the crown prince and this is the quote on Twitter totally denied any knowledge of what took place in the consulate\n[noise] it does seem as though Pompeo has been sent to walk this really fine line President Trump has threatened severe punishment has words to whoever's responsible for ... disappearance maybe murder but but there's also a lot more at stake here in the in the wider us Saudi relationship\nYeah and in this country Mary Louise is is really key to the Mideast strategy of the Trump Administration and there are big us arms deals\nAt stake these a U.S policy on Iran is is a vital here the sanctions are going back into force and the the us needs the Saudis\nTo keep the oil market stable um and then on the other hand the administration is facing a lot of pressure from Congress members of Congress are outraged over this apparent murder in the consulate in Istanbul and over the Saudi conduct in the war in Yemen so I think you're totally right there the administration is trying to walk this very fine line\nA secretary Pompeo was headed next uh which means you're headed next to the capital of turkey to anchor of what the agenda there\nWell he's going to be meeting

buildings area and she would be the first openly transgender person ever elected in Montana welcome Amelia Hi\nGina Ortiz Jones is a Democrat in Texas running for Congress in the twenty third district which has the largest stretch of U.S Mexico border she could be the first openly gay woman\nEver elected to Congress in Texas thank you for joining us thank you and Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of the New Hampshire state Senate\nThanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae be teaching people to run for office\nYou know I think what we're seeing is that as we hit broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone\nAmerican society is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run a million you know what do you think\nThis is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at that table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices aren't are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being as you'd be the woman being a first generation American being a veteran and\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name Amelia it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of this race\nWants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of government um we actually had a ballot initiative on our\nPrimary ballots that would've uh regulated where trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot you this\nRations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades in the way it relates to algae ... people do think that shapes your experience\nYeah this is Gina I mean most certainly\nUm I served in the air forces and intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got you know some wonderful fellows in and turns on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I said don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come and so in so little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I always like to thank folks that like you and Dan paved the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my age until you are [laughter]\nAnd I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable but as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm I was in college when\nHIV was really hitting it was the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long\nTerm process the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beat Duke he writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center calls that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it\nWas no I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans\nHe's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before and I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents and say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties folks who may be\nWe work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nTime I mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae B. T. Q. candidates fit into our national political conversation which feels so starkly divided along party lines\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting as you hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall establishment of both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community steps up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of the similar situations there\nUm were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we have all the overall national landscape for future algae BP keeps candidates as well Gina\nYet I mean I can tell you or you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how could do what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what it mealy disgust which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with so\nIt at the end of the day I think is less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nYou know one of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing one fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing\nBecause what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having on young people is more significant and deeper than we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and Amelia do as well\nTo those young people that are following behind us\nThree of you for joining us today Dan in is is running for reelection to the state Senate in New Hampshire Gina Ortiz Jones is running for Congress in Texas and Amelia Marquez is running for state legislature in Montana it was great talking with all of you pleasure pleasure to speak with all of us\n[noise]\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n\nWhy be artist supported by Blackfoot connecting Montana businesses to advance networking solutions like empty LS which uses label switching technology to help optimize network traffic and scale ability online at ... dot com slash M.

another case of quote guilty until proven innocent\nTrump says the Saudi crown prince totally denied any knowledge of what happened and promised a full investigation\nTrump separately has suggested rogue killers might be to blame\nTo understand how autocratic countries like Saudi Arabia interpret these remarks we called up tomorrow Kaufman with she served as State Department under President Obama and is now with Brookings she says Trump is following through on a position he took more than a year ago\nOn his first foreign trip when he went to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia he said explicitly we're not here to lecture we're not here to tell other people how to live what to do who to be or how to worship\nAnd that statement sets aside decades' worth of bipartisan American commitment as well as the commitment of a range of western democracies to international human rights law\nBeyond Saudi Arabia do you see a link between President Trump's America First transaction based approach to international affairs and the actions of dictators overseas\nI think if I were a dictator especially one with a decent relationship with Washington a cooperative partnership with Washington and I heard the American president say that he's not here to lecture me I Would certainly take that as an understanding that no matter what I might do at home I shouldn't expect\nAny direct consequences in my relationship with Washington\nIf you take for example Philippine president ... uh who has picked up President Trump's phrase allergy about fake news and it's also engaged in a raft of extrajudicial killings of political opponents as well as a drug dealer\nAnd is asked about a ... attempted murder of journalists and says well we kill people to that that's going to lead someone like president to ... to think that he can get away with doing the same thing\nThere were lots of instances during the Obama administration where the president condemned the actions of foreign leaders whether that was ... in Russia or Bashar will also in Syria and it didn't do much to deter them so is it really possible to say that this was happening more because President Trump is in office\nI think they're both direct and indirect ways in which President Trump's blondes a attitude about human rights and democracy it translates into behavior abroad\nThe first of course is if dictators feel like they have a green light from the American president and that's pretty rare but the United states doesn't always criticized directly or one on one sometimes it works together with other western governments\nAnd they all do a day marched together or the issue simultaneous statements so that no one government gets the backlash all by itself\nAnd when the Trump Administration takes the United states out of that coalition\nIt deters other western governments from speaking up as well\nOh so you're saying it's not just that the U.S is giving an implicit green light to these dictators but it's undermining the international alliances that used to speak with one strong voice against the actions of those leaders\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from logged me in makers of go to meeting a

lesser violations of prison rules\nNPR's investigative team has been digging into this disparity this week today NPR's Joseph Shapiro takes us to a state that is rewriting the rules for discipline and women's prisons here's this town we associate with prison [noise]\nHeavy steel doors shut\nThese are the doors at the entrance to the Iowa correctional institution for women but once visitors like us walk through these doors and get inside the prison that's it\nThere are no more heavy steel doors for the women that's not a family here\nBecause this prison is new and it's different\nInside the razor wire this place looks kind of like a college campus with red brick buildings there knew just a few years old connected by concrete pathways lots of open space and landscape gardens with flowers and picnic benches for the inmates\nSet out here from ... depending on what level there and that's the word and you show Tom\nAnd in our yard with an ... and I guess\nIt's still a prison the warrant is the first to point that out and prisons are still harsh places in some ways women's prisons are specially harsh\nBecause across the country women get discipline that higher rates than men for smaller violations of prison rolls they're often two to three times more likely to get in trouble for things like insolence disobedience talking back to a corrections officer\nMatch what NPR ... school of journalism at Northwestern university found when we collected data from women's in men's prisons in Fifteen states even small infraction can have big consequences\nWomen get time added to the President's Day go to solitary confinement or lose visitation or phone privileges that matters because more than half of women in prison or the mothers of children Eighteen or younger\nThis prison than I what is notable it's trying to make change but it's not easy partly because there are so many rules\nEven today they could get tickets about wearing their sweat shirt inside out and we're like why is that a security issue that's really not a security issue maybe she had a copy stain I have one\nThat's the word and show dom in two thousand sixteen our data found women at this prison compared to ... other Iowa prisons were three times more likely to get punished for the violation of being disruptive\nNow Don tells her corrections officers to give out fewer tickets like for breaking the rules that are prisoners can alter their uniform\nIt was written for men's prison were assured inside out or sleeves rolled up might signaling gang affiliation\nThat this isn't gang related it's just women want to have some control over how they look about how they present themselves\nNominate putting in place a practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison every corrections officers being trained that women take different past the prison they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent\nAnd that women do better when prison is less punitive so Thomas changing rules especially about clothing and tone corrections officers to listen to the women more and to demand compliance\nLast [noise] tell me that if that was like [noise]\n\nThe mental health toward the runway\nWonders an inmate she came to this prison twenty two years ago\nIt was really hard not to get in trouble back then you had to be careful of everything you did it felt like everything was [noise]\nIt's just meant to be punished\nOnce she was sick and statement or sell through breakfast another prisoner brought up and down up from the dining hall and put the fire pillow so I was asleep when this crime happened [laughter]\n... got punished for that banana\nPossession of stolen item [noise] yeah that was pretty rough that\nWouldn't be a violation today but back then ... says she lost good conduct credits those are days taking off her sentence for good behavior and she lost privileges she couldn't buy things from the commissary\nWonder is serving time per second degree murder now she says the changing the way women are treated here help to grow she works on the mental health ward as a mentor to the other women\nI'm trying to contribute as much as I guess it's institution so I'm not so shame [noise] you know and it has helped me with my own my own shame in my own regret\nThe psychiatric unit in the newly built prison was designed to be different women are free to walk about the large common room with ... therapy animals there are large TV's a carton and lots of natural light there are still solitary confinement cells although fewer women end up in them now\nDr Jerome Greenfield has come to help show us around\nToo so they're forced to live here and then\nHe runs health services for all of Iowa's presidents several years ago he quit his psychiatry practice to work at this prison\nThrough the years in my practice I thought I was a seasoned psychiatrist I thought I'd seen it all\nBut he wasn't prepared for the level of trauma and the women who come to prison\nI mean I saw patients that had been chain for months at a time in a basement\nSold his property\nVictims of satanic rituals\nBut it goes even beyond that\nBecause then in their homes many of them were beaten to the point of having traumatic brain injuries\nMen in prison that long histories of being victims of violence too but research in gender response of corrections finds that women before they get to prison for the victims of even more trauma Seventy find the Ninety percent were victims of sexual or physical violence\nSo one thing that's changed here the end of the usual strip search now women can take off one piece of clothing at a time and then put it back on\nDumb the warden lets say correctional officer and really it's a Human Services worker at a cost\nAre bigger problems here like not having enough corrections officers I talked to one staffer who didn't want to go on tape for fear of getting in trouble she complained about the warns new approach meant that in her words the inmates are running the prison the war has heard that before recently from a newly hired corrections officer\nAnd she brought for which some concerns and what she said is you know word and there are some people saying that the inmates are running the prison and I'm like well they do there is one of you to Ninety six women so let's talk about how that looks and how do we get the Ninety six to not cash problems\nDom wanted to show me one other place in the prison the old mental health ward is the one building from the old prison that wasn't torn down\nAnd it's the one other place in the prison with heavy metal doors the building is dark and deserted now closed four years ago there are four parts of cells a guard would watch separated from a station above when women with mental illness lived here they would often yellow into the night\nThis is what prison cells to do across the country you we will quite for women or men\nYou dehumanize people and we put people that\nLive and breathe like us into a room that\nStripped them of all\nTheir senses are dignity\nBack back to white giving up fewer disciplinary tickets matters because those tickets even for western fractions often lead to ending up in the cell block like this one Joseph Shapiro NPR News

there I was obviously and both both in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump to go to\nOh to ah Canada or Mexico first uh and Cushman he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech to celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so this was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nJared Kushner has a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to be the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\nIt it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of Christmas portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east and coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley was in the oval office recently and she talked about ... role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared Nevada there is such a hidden genius that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... and about Trump\nOr but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires a influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations and a different way they focus on personal chemistry and personality pretty much above all\nTo now with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it and for secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where do things stand today with Christian or on the crowd for us\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment a cushion there was one of the White House officials who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin so I'm On\nA after could show gee went ... went missing the White House said he and other officials oppressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince has denied any knowledge of this disappearance\nOr one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced diplomat is that because he lacks experience that it may be easy to manipulate him\nAs a director of global engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security chain\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the cushion her family Trump and the Saudis\nAnd a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that's not clear at some of these dealings are are not transparent\nBut we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars and apartments from him and there have been reports that Kushner a cushion or a backed or associate it a firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a
