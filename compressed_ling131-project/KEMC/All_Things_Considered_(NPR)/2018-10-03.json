considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I ... in the weeks since Christine Blasey Ford accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault President Trump's response has been relatively restraint\nThat changed completely last night when President Trump mocked Ford at a rally in Mississippi\nHow did you get home I don't remember how did you get started on remember where is the place I don't remember how many\nToday the White House briefing room press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello\nSo as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comments last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nHe seemed to be sort of hewing to the line that congressional Republicans seemed to be hearing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible but you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThen last night he got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really the verging from that line and he was playing it to last and cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape and so that has people really upset today\nSome how the response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nRight well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her votes now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote\nYou know one thing that has been swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh a Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nAnd one of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he had groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice he likewise said that to a crowd the crowd likewise laughter cheered\nAnd you know he was really he really seem to be saying she's an attractive and that wouldn't have happened there for so the important thing that we're trying to get out here though is that we have a pet or not only of how Trump reacts to sexual misconduct allegations\nBut how his supporters react and his supporters by and large seemed to have stuck with him through the allegations against him even if they find those allegations distasteful it remains to be seen exactly how people will respond in the long term to these cabinet allegations\n\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Amazon Prime video presenting the return of the man in the high castle where America's history is under siege but the

people in the U.S auto industry are breathing a sigh of relief next week the new trade deal between the U.S Mexico and Canada and months of uncertainty if it's approved by Congress\nOf the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies that make auto parts you're in the U.S thanks for joining us here on all things considered thank you Ari glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement ... holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well injured after we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs in the United states but it counts in all three countries being part of the agreement\nSo we are very pleased relieved that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms agreement will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum us so all of that will impact our members\nAnd in addition there's going to be some new administrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there is some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states address that before they finalized disagreement in the end of November\nSo on the one hand there won't be ... material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of concern to your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have the mind as they have been that particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their steel purchases rise almost fifty percent so this is a significant increase it's typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up their sleeves uses same energy they used to conclude this this new NAFTA and be able to come\nThe uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement just is it worse well\nI think from the United states perspective when the things in the United states said little pool through was the increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more steel moral woman that's from North America in our vehicles\nThe biggest concern our members are going to have is the administrators cost and we're going to have to work really hard with all three parties can minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge as we move forward

Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court could come as early as friday Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell wants it to happen this week though he hasn't scheduled and yet he\nAnd the rest of the Senate or waiting on the FBI to finish its investigation that sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh\nThree Republicans who could determine the judges fate say they need to see that FBI report first before they make up their minds with us now to talk about the latest as NPR's Scott Detrow who joins us from Capitol Hill Hey Scott also\nSo senators are saying the FBI could complete this report and send it to them as soon as today which would be early because the FBI was given a full week to do this does this speed to give us any clues about the scope of the report\nWhat we got one clue on the scope just just a while earlier today we know now that the FBI has not yet talked to one key witness and that's Christine Blasey Ford her lawyer say as of today she has not been contacted by the FBI\nA lot of top Republicans are fine with that I asked John Cornyn the number two Republican as he got into an elevator earlier today\nWe heard from members of course referring to last week public testimony Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley has said something similar\nDemocrats say this makes no sense of the whole point of following up was to confirm or dispel what Ford and Kavanaugh said so the FBI should follow up here's Democrat Richard Blumenthal who's a former attorney general leads are followed\nThe interviews creates additional questions\nSometimes they're re interviews that's very common and that's an investigation it's got to be more than just check the box okay we have their account\nOK so clearly there is a big split between Republicans and Democrats are talking about this that split was even more parent last night President Trump spoke at a rally and he mocked Christine Blasey Ford's testimony against Kavanaugh let's let's take a listen to a bit of that\nDid you get home I don't remember how did you get started on remember where is the place I don't remember how many years\nMission comes down to a few key Republicans in the Senate how are

taking\nEverything into account is is the key framing their Murkowski has made it clear she thinks a big part of this is treating women with respect listening tone to them when they come forward with allegations so she is certainly someone to watch if the president keeps attacking Ford head on\nAnd they have any of these key senators said anything about the scope of the FBI\nInvestigation and whether or not hearing from either cabinet or Ford again is a problem\nFlake said earlier that there should be about knowing what there is to know and trying to answer questions not checking a box as

in her inbox\nAnd her latest column has the headline deer dads your daughters told me about their assaults this is why they never told you how many people have been sharing the column on line and I spoke with Monica ... about it earlier today\nI like a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of survivors wanting to share their stories of sexual assault and what was notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I've never told as my dad I don't think he could handle this\nAnd what did they tell you about the reasons they never told their father\nSome women said I'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail\nSome women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him this would make him cry someone in did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy him he thinks it's his job to protect any and he's\n[noise] I did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of when and said I told my mother and learns that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world\nAs a young woman and so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might feel squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of ... exist because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lady pain explain what you mean\nBy that [noise] you know it just just think about tropes in sitcoms where\nThe dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery store that he can never make we do that with ... and we do that with breast feeding\nAll of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on the spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on this spectrum of gross or uncomfortable things that happen to women [noise]\nCan you tell us about some of the responses that you've had to call them since it was published this week\n[noise] yeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response ...\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing these stories I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions\nI shared your call in with my wife for forty years and asked her head this ever happened to her and she told me a story of herself at ten I just listened and inside I broiled I asked her should I ask my daughters and she

something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you\nSo if you were a father and you have a ... of how a victim
