justice on the Supreme Court\nBrett Kavanaugh will be on the bench tomorrow when the Supreme Court hold oral arguments he was confirmed over the weekend on a narrow party line vote and today the president told a group of law enforcement officers in Florida that Kavanaugh's rise to the high court gives Republicans a political boost\nAll over the country I'm really rallies and people are loving that man and loving that yours\nWill have more on how the political battle over canonize affecting the mid term elections in a bed but first let's go to NPR's Scott Horsley Hey Scott I also see a picture of how Kavanaugh's presence on the court will will shift the decisions will see over the next few decades potentially\nHe will certainly shift the courts are right remember he was chosen from a list of judicial candidates drawn up by the federal a society and the Heritage Foundation a list of reliable conservatives and that's something you couldn't\nOnly conservative but he occasionally did side with the liberal wing of the court most famously on a string of gay rights cases but also for example in reaffirming the right to abortion\nKavanaugh is expected to be much more conservative than Kennedy and that leaves chief justice John Roberts now as the pivot point on the court to that's right [laughter] it'll be up to robbers to decide how much judicial restraint to exercise and then that will determine whether this\nShift is a gradual series of rightward steps or one big leap\nGiving them very bitter confirmation fight we saw over the last several weeks has damaged the course reputation ... a political body\nIt it certainly has the possibility to do that now we're going to have five conservative justices all appointed by Republican presidents four liberal justices all appointed by Democrats and\nTo the extent their decisions divvy up along those partisan lines the court runs the risk of being seen as just another political branch of government snapped by partisans in robes rather than an impartial body that somehow above politics\nAnd it certainly doesn't help the Kavanaugh is confirmed by that extremely narrow vote with just one Republican one Democrat breaking ranks and the Senate\nAlso listen to how President Trump described the campaign against Kavanaugh today\nWas a disgraceful situation\nBrought about by people that are evils any tufted out we'll tufted out together and I have to think the\nRepublican senators that fought so hard for this because it was an easy so you have the president they're talking about this in very partisan terms his press secretary Sarah Sanders also tweeted over the weekend that\nInstead of six three liberal Supreme Court under Hillary Clinton we now have a five for conservative court under President Trump that's certainly true enough but it doesn't exactly sound like neutral referees just calling balls and strikes\nYou know was already quietly sworn in on Saturday shortly after the Senate confirmed and so what is the purpose of tonight's ceremony the way\nThis is a chance for the president to remind his supporters who is responsible for this choice and now in less than two years Trump is named too conservative justices to the Supreme Court\nAnd he's put dozens of conservatives are judges elsewhere on the federal bench so that more than anything has endeared Donald Trump to social conservatives

Swift is voting Democrat\nIn a lengthy social media posts on Sunday the pop superstar explained why she would be supporting Democrats filled bread is in for Senate and Jim Cooper for the house she also slammed Republican congresswoman Marsha Blackburn for her record on women's and el GB T rights\nAnd all this from an artist who has famously refused to talk politics in the past we reached Emily ... of the Washington Post who's been following all of this welcome Hi so how earth shattering is is to see Taylor Swift makes some political endorsement\nHonestly and an area where I don't know if anything can surprise me anymore really a surprise tell me why the shock yeah so I think it surprised me and a lot of people because after the last two years there has kind of been\nSteady drumbeat to get Taylor Swift to sort of say anything political anything about the current environment and she never has and then all of a sudden Sunday she drops his Instagram post that that really lengthy almost like scorched earth a post about how she really feels about the upcoming\nMid terms and I was just not expecting that what's the response been like from her fans [noise]\nI've seen a lot of support from people who were honestly just glad she said anything I mean she has a hundred and twelve million Instagram followers and a lot of people got to really look up to her so there's a lot of support there is also of course\nThere's kind of his movement that has always thought maybe she was secretly a conservative just because she never said anything though [laughter]\nThey kind of had to read into a lot of things she had never even said that there is some disappointment on that side today well you\nTell us what did start out as a country music star which is a world that leans conservative but she's more of a pop star now so does have a broader fan base kind of free her to take\nWhen she made the break from Nashville in kind of declared herself going to the pop world she didn't have to worry as much about you know country radio which still drives so much of the country music industry now are ... are being played on pop radio and\nShe'd have this broader audience I feel like it may have trapped her a little bit in the way that because she still has his country than she did still want to appeal to them\nBut I think she probably didn't feel more free overall to share opinions\nYou know she has a reputation for being extremely calculated when it comes to cure reading her image so what do you think why jumped into politics now what'd you think is going on with her\nAnd that's what I've been trying this is the mystery of the day and [laughter] I always had that I had her mind from Italy exactly Taylor Swift always seems to be like twenty steps ahead of everyone else no matter what she does everything kind of have like a double or triple meaning when you really look at it\nI think in this case the timing probably was pretty strategic she just wrapped up her stadium tour in the United states you know she's done with their concert she doesn't need to think about the backlash for any of that so she\nPosted her message after this\nShe kind of alluded in her statement to events that have happened to her in the last couple of years and that's why she was speaking out\nAnd she didn't say with those were um I think a big one that's impacted her the most was her sexual assault trial when a country music DJ sued her after he lost his job because she said he groped her and I meet and greet line\nWhen she counters sued him for assault and battery and she

element of this problem and not do it for the grandkids\nSo many of these affects you just mentioned around twenty forty also if you want to plan to be here around twenty I order in lido yeah so what

years are a real changes feasible within that timeframe\nLike this you hear some of those studies ... it makes you think\nGosh I just want to hide under the covers and\nWatched the Netflix series but if you think about it facing this kind of impossibility is really something to extend what humans were made for and the report lays out really well if we're willing to take on the kind of efforts that

though we keep seeing is\nFacial recognition technology that miss identifies people of color much more frequently than it miss identifies white people are there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people as guerrillas\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistakes like that happen\nYeah this is a really excellent point\nThe current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images of a particular person and an accurate label and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races so you're saying there just\nA lot more photos of white people in the databases these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color yes oh the answer\nTo the question technologically it's quite simple if you had equal representation\nThe Web on race bias that's a harder question\nSo even when facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could uses technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understands where this science is today how do you think about\nThis um is face recognition technology abused um that certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works and making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank you very much thank you [noise]\nWould for all tech considered comes from

for some reason the county road that's turban only she works with a nonpartisan voter registration group called the rural Utah project the roads are pretty rough around here and she's been driving

judge ordered the voting district boundaries and the county to be redrawn after ruling that they get too much control to white typically Republican voters\nBased on the new maps to democratic Navajos could be elected to the remember county commission it would be a first but ... says with the new boundaries some Navajo voters have been lifted in the wrong precinct\nThat means they would get the wrong ballot on election day which could skew the election results so she's out trying to make sure residents are registered in the right place and just generally trying to get out the vote\nAlternating between Navajo in English housing is is the cost of gas and driving bad roads has made it difficult to get the his PO box to vote by mail\nIs ... you know my vote with remember some ...\n\nSome people are just pick up their mail and not realize that their ballot from them down or they get home care\nIndian country largely feels left out of the voting process\nJames Tucker is an attorney who works with the Native American rights fund\nSome places it's just because of neglect in other places that's by design he says voters in Indian country faced multiple barriers lack of registration opportunities distance issues to get to registration sites distance issues to get\nTo their polling place um lack of access to mail in voting lack of early voting opportunities\nUm overt discrimination at the polls\nLike voter ID laws that target natives or polling locations he says discourage voters by placing them at a local sheriff's office Utah San Juan county is a complicated place\nPart of the region sits on the Navajo Nation the population is roughly half and half Navajos in whites Navajos tend to vote democratic and the white community is largely Republican\nSo you have a great political science study area here\nThat's Jesse trinity he's an attorney representing San Juan county he says only twenty five percent of the residents here have street addresses and that includes both Navajos in non Navajos so he says they're bound to be some issues with the new district map\nBecause of the rural Utah projects effort to to register never voters they're finding more of them there but with the same problem we exist elsewhere in the county with respect to non them Oh yes\nAnd he says complaints about voters being put in the wrong precinct with redrawn map had been blown out of proportion and the county clerks or quickly correcting any registration mistakes\nMeanwhile the Utah lieutenant governor's office did receive complaints from both Navajo and none Navajo residents after the twenty Eighteen primary\nSaying the polling locations were overcrowded mismanaged and that some voters were asked who they were voting for this year for the first time a poll watcher will be in place on election day to make sure things go smoothly turban only with rural Utah project is skeptical but she's hoping the efforts her group is making will help\nToday that means meeting people like Roger ... is deporting his ability to vote\nWhether that's giving information\nTough in this house she gets back in her car and drives onto the next place slowly creeping along
