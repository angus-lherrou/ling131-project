Erickson it's five forty four\nSenator Jon tester was among fifty senators voting for a resolution to reestablish requirements for health insurance plans to cover people with pre existing conditions yesterday the resolution failed on a fifty fifty thousand Eric Whitney reports\nEarlier this month the Trump Administration approved the expansion of short term health insurance plans that don't have to cover pre existing conditions those plans used to be limited to three months and can now be used for up to a year\nDemocrat tester spoke out against the plans on the Senate floor Wednesday he said they're marketed as far more affordable than regular health coverage but he said\nThey're total and complete chefs if you read the fine print and you'll discover that dialysis blood pressure pills X rays\nAre covered in fact most things are tough\nTest his Republican challenger Matt Rosendale who's Montana's insurance commissioner has praised expansion of short term plans because they offer a less expensive alternative to coverage required by the Affordable CARE Act\nThat's the same reason he gave for endorsing met his share in Montana met his share is a Christian health sharing ministry

damage vulnerable people\nAs Montana's insurance commissioner Matt Rosendale has the authority to allow health sharing ministries like Medicare to operate in the state but as he explained in twenty Seventeen because Medicare doesn't meet the legal definition of insurance Montana's insurance commissioner can't regulate its practices\nMy job is regulated you're worth\nAnd you're dealing with a contractual obligation with absolutely zero other moral obligation whatsoever and so you are bound by the terms of that contract exclusively\nAnd when you start utilizing this or that of course in sharing ministry these folks have a moral obligation to each other more more similar to a family members would have to each other\nRosendale has said that protecting the ability of Montanans with pre existing conditions to get health coverage is important to him and that he's working on policies to do that but he's not offered specifics\nSenator testers attacks on Rosendale on the issue of
