considered I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly and judge Brett Kavanaugh is now one step away from a seat on the Supreme Court looks like he has the votes he needs to be confirmed in a final vote tomorrow\nThis afternoon the last undecided Republican Susan Collins of Maine delivered a lengthy floor speech she talked about Kavanaugh's qualifications for the Supreme Court before she turned to the allegations of sexual assault against him and said this\nIs the presumption of innocence and fairness to bear on my thinking and I cannot abandon them\nThan for the next twenty minutes she walked through why she ultimately believe the charges against Kavanaugh\nI Will vote chicken for judge cabinet\nMinutes after that West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin said he would also support the nominee or we're gonna bring in NPR's Kelsey Snell she is on Capitol Hill she has been tracking all of this back and forth today ... either high so I Would ask and just a second a little bit more about what senator Collins said but first just the headline\nIs there any suspense at this point how this confirmation fight is likely to shake out\nWell now that mansion has said that he remains I guess this is essentially they have the fifty one votes the fifty on people who voted yes before our very likely now to vote yes tomorrow when the final confirmation vote comes up\nNow that's not to say that some crazy thing couldn't happen between now and that it happened you know we have to keep those catty outgoing but this means that the support that that we saw earlier today it seems to stand and it means that vice president Mike Pence does not appear to be needed to break any ties writes\nA role but he might have had to play how to how to not checking out quite this way today okay senator Collins she laid out her position and links for speech is already just said a did appear to have been undecided anytime that recently I'm and she was from start to finish it was pretty clear how she was wanting to vote\nYet she basically used her speeches it kind of closing argument did was as much of that a closing argument for Kavanaugh as anything else\nUm she basically was saying that he is not that extreme partisan that Democrats have been saying he is\nAnd she walks through all of the ways that he's more moderate than he's been portrayed and that she did that for more than forty minutes and she made it pretty tough case there she said that she didn't like that this had become what she called gutter level political campaign instead of a fallen confirmation process\nEarlier today she had lunch with Senator Mitch McConnell and I was in the room there well she was making that speech and he sat and just a few seats away from her and turned his seat so he could walk her well she spoke and it was it was a it was ... it was clear that he was prepared and ready and kind of knew\nWhat was coming to me a little bit more about how she said she wrestled with the allegations of sexual assault\nYet she said that she believes that something may have happened to forward and ah Christine Blasey Ford the woman who originally accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault but she says she doesn't think that the process that they went through and going through his record on earth any evidence that it was Kavanaugh's who did it\nAnd she's sticking to her belief in the presumption of innocence and she spoke about that quite a bit um and about the idea that this in the trial but that due process is still something she believes in\nTold me a little bit more is someone who was at the

to conduct an investigation and the police department\nFinding a pattern of excessive force WB easiest Shannon Heffernan has been reporting on the trial for months and joins us now Hi Shannon hello this guilty verdict is a huge deal for the city of Chicago what is the reaction\nLove act because I've been able to speak to so far has said that while they were hoping for a first degree murder charge they're satisfied with a second degree murder charge this is something we haven't seen happen in Chicago for decades so I think for those activists feeling like a moment of celebration\nWe've also heard from representative for police like the police union there of course I'm happy with this verdict and concern for what it will mean for policing going forward\nThe convicted police officer Jason Van Dyke actually took the stand this week in his defense during this trial what did he say\nWell he described comic Donald as somebody to be a feta he described his face as a frightening described his eyes as blank um he said that the that that was ... raised and life up to his shoulder\nUm which is not something you can see looking at the dashcam video of this and said that so the prosecutors really push too hard on why his version of events didn't match with video\nWhat kind of an impact you expect this for to to have on the relationship between the Chicago police department and the African American community\nWell I think that's hard to say that 'cause I think that the tensions here had been more about more than just look on McDonald's you'll have to remember that\nIn addition to this trial there is another trial of laid it to the shooting there are three officers charged with conspiracy for exaggerating the threat of a chronic Donald a preventive at night and their reports and\nI think that there's this feeling that the shooting was\nA a problem with the community feels but also fast feeling that officers covered it up so I think\nWe'll be watching closely what happens in that trial in how the sea reacts to that\nAs we've reported on so many police involved shootings and in so many cases the officers are acquitted this conviction is a rare exception what do you think made a different\nWell I think the number of shot six moon made a big difference in this case I also think that\nI'm Out and chose not to shoot I think that that would require a lot

but I think that his performance during the hearings cause me to change my mind\nJoe Malcolm so these are not he said she said questions that are being raised these are serious questions about his temperament what do you think\nSure well we don't have to guess about a judge Kavanaugh's a temperament we have twelve years of experience with him being on the DC circuit court of appeals to bar who\nKnow him well say the justice that they've known before was not the man on display last week well testifying\nWell that that is certainly true I think if there were some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught against him his reputation as family that he would have acted like and what Thomas hon I had\nBy the way he acted like in ...\nI think that response would have been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at the at the charges that he was facing so I think a price cap and put it into a position where he was damned if he did and damned if you did it the American bar association of course interview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has an outstanding judicial temperament and he will as the Supreme Court justices well\nPeople coming in and continuing to weigh in on both sides of this absolutely right let me let me ask you this why should we have confidence that a man who said under oath with no evidence that he was the victim of a revenge plot on behalf of the Clintons that he was the victim of a big left wing conspiracy\nThat this man will be able to serve as an impartial nonpartisan justice foreign\nSure one Brett Kavanaugh has a history of caring about the rule of law and not basically ... based on any political or personal beliefs\nAll the way on the Supreme Court I wouldn't know by the way that you know obviously with Peter ... had some harsh statements to say about Donald Trump before he went on the all you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific were marketing or he went on to say he was the victim of a calculated and orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question that he found the tactics\nOf some of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory cases Brett Kavanaugh has a history of respect in the constitution respecting separation of powers and he is not going to throw all of that way because she's mad that Cory Booker headed Spartacus moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal and he didn't really apologized you offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there are some things I shouldn't have said what things get what you do not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break you apologize to center ... ah for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's drinks and facilitating gang rape\nIf that will not get one righteously didn't that I don't know what will\nEnd very briefly we have a few seconds left on the on the politics should have said that\nYou know I think there is no question that the Democrats you know when you you'd be some of them engaged and the timing of this for maximum advantage and had a political tinge to it and I like not fault him for responding to that it will not affect what kind of a justice he will be not one iota\nJohn Malcolm thank you good to be with you at the Heritage Foundation John Malcolm an early backer and Brett Kavanaugh for the court

were reporting it and because of the times was doing bigger investigations of sexual harassment me knew that this was part of the system and it wasn't just about Harvey Weinstein we were reporting on Bill O'Reilly and we were reporting on Fort factory workers\nBut you never know what's gonna happen to an investigation what it's when it's published and you know one of our editors I'm Matt party\nLike to say as we were working on it he said Harvey Weinstein is not that famous and that is true aside from New York and LA and maybe D.C he really was not a household name 'em and and what we've seen happen is that not only did the me too movement which was founded years ago by trying to bark\nTakeoff globally but it just kept going and going\nAnd going there were so many times in the past year when I saw productions that this was going to burn out or you know the women were all then a simmered down or the news was finally going to stop and it never did and what's happening with judge Kavanaugh I think is representative of that there's a feeling that this reckoning only continues and grows bigger\nMe ask you this if Kavanaugh is confirmed a with a full Senate vote this weekend [noise] do you see that as a step back to the momentum of me too\nThink if he's confirmed there will be massive debate about what this means for the me too movement and I think there are two contradictory answers both of which probably have some validity I'll give you the ... the obvious one is that people will say this as a setback he was confirmed anyway uh these really serious allegations of sexual assault didn't\nThis is a replay of Anita Hill the other argument however is that\nWhat especially what Dr Christine Blasey Ford did was really important uh that she spoke up in front of the entire country\nShe put high school on the table right she made a case that these things that that happened in our collective you do have a bearing on the presence and we also some moments like with um the two protesters and the alligator with Jeff Flake where they were able to literally stop the national conversation for a second and say listen to these stories\nOne footnote to this conversation before I let you go ... we just heard there from our reporter Shariah so hurting also that today also marks the award of the Nobel Peace prize prize is often Xena sending a political message\nUm and the word went to people working to stop sexual violence as a weapon of war I Wonder if that's one more book and if you like to the global scope of this me to\nMoment the EU hopes and motion a year ago\nI look up to the same news and had the same side I think it's a reminder scale I think it's a reminder of the global reach that ... and also maybe a reminder perspective at a moment
