way through everyday arguments\nDivision of political issues with a little help from mathematician Eugene you're changing the first this week one of those rituals of science the early morning wake up call from Stockholm\nTo a handful of researchers whose work has changed their fields joining me now to talk about the prizes and others like Detroit subjects in science is Sarah Kaplan science reporter at the Washington Post welcome back\nThanks gets to be here fabulous let's walk through the Nobel we're planning a to speak with chemistry Nobel from a Nobel is Francis Arnold later this hour but briefly what did you win for\nShow a doctor or not and two other researchers George Smith and Gregory Winter were awarded the chemistry Nobel for their work on directed evolution so this is basically one person called it applying the principles of Darwin in a test to taking advantage of natural selection\nAnd using it to um kind of direct bacteria or viruses to produce molecules that can be used for all kinds of peaceful purposes whether it's making antibodies or biofuels or drugs\n... and the chemistry prize was split with two other researchers right Stuart Smith and Gregory Winter and what what did they win for\n'em so they both work on a this technique called phage display which harnesses bacteria phages there are viruses that infect bacteria\nAnd it's kind of us the similar principle where you're taking advantage of these living systems to produce useful molecules proteins and antibodies that have all kinds of biological and medical applications and what about physics\nSo in physics the prize was awarded to three researchers who work with lasers a pretty cool\nLasers but use lasers as tools so asking um develop this technique called optical tweezers where he basically figured out that when you point a laser this focused beam of light atmosphere ... object to the object is actually drawn towards the center of the beam and you can use that to manipulate\nThings as teeny as particles or as big as bacterial cells I've seen the ... yeah [laughter] it's a real life tractor beams and fortunately it doesn't work on that largest accumulate they're pretty focused but um it's fun to think\nAbout it after winning the dumbest trickle and explained what amazed her most about the research\nI think quite late generation is one of these remarkable thing one color water any clear and oh come on short and and it's just remarkable that there were all this color\nShades of Isaac Newton\nYeah and it was cool hearing that Strickland actually mentioned that she um uses white channel ... light generation when she teaches introductory physics courses so that's something that anyone can appreciate you don't need to be a Nobel laureate to see this really cool\nPhenomenon let's move on to physiology or medicine\nSo the award for medicine went to two researchers James Allison ... for their work on immunotherapy um this is basically a treatment that uses the body's own immune system to fight against cancer\nAnd both researchers discovered proteins that ... brakes on the immune system\nUm so when those proteins are engaged as they normally are they prevent the immune system from attacking things but um they actually their research led to the development of a class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors that can turn off the brakes and then\nUnleash the immune system and it's full force to fight against disease some of those there was a practical drugs used to write yeah actually Jimmy Carter's melanoma I'm President Jimmy Carter twenty Fifteen or under when I'm you know therapy as part of his cancer treatment\nSo we're we're blending together chemistry and engineering in evolution of new protein\nHow do you build that I was watching a to a Ted Talk you gave it was quite fascinating and you talked about being able to sit down at a keyboard and type out a recipe for some form of new genetic smell it out and and what a new gene comes back to you\n[laughter] yes it's really amazing has changed so much in the thirty years that I've been doing this\nSo that today you really can't type at a DNA sequence now whether it's a recipe is a different story we can talk about that but you can type out a DNA sequence email it off to your favorite supplier of DNA and they will send you back in the mail that DNA\nYou you say in that talk that I I Want to write new DNA what does that mean to you\nIt's easy to write and your DNA what's hard is composing it you think about DNA is the code of life it's the product of ... almost four billion years of evolution\nBut we don't know how to compose it how do you compose something codes of of a complex biological function that didn't exist before [noise]\nSo if you if you ... what is the problem in the composition why can't you compose [noise]\nBecause we don't understand how DNA encodes function\nRemember biology molecular biology is a brand new discipline it's been around the the structure of DNA was published in Nineteen fifty three so it's not been understood for but for a very short time\nAnd how DNA goes through all the complicated things of his cell and makes biological molecules and codes to ... the the the structure and function to these biological molecules\nIs a brand new field and we still don't understand those rules\nAre so what do you mean than what what do people mean ... whom when you say\nAre the directed evolution of something what is that process me\nWell it's just like breathing it's we've been breeding cats dogs racehorses lab rats corn for thousands of years without really manipulating the DNA directly but now that we can synthesize DNA and put it in a test tube\nI can go direct the DNA and\nCombined DNA from different sources different species I can dial in levels of random mutations that can direct negotiations so I have control over the underlying DNA diversity and then I decide who goes on to parent the next generation\nAnd then how do you get a useful product out of that what's the next step [noise]\nSo you put the DNA into a microbe and they start reading it as if it were their own\nAnd a day in day than take the DNA and create the proteins that the DNA encodes\nThan I as the breeder of molecules so to speak I have to decide who is better than what I started with which one of those microbes makes a bitter protein and that's called good old fashioned analytical chemistry so are you take the DNA out of that and feed it back and I do it all over again\nIt's sort of creating life and that sell as a new you're creating a new form of life are you are not [noise]\nWell I think that's probably exaggerating because life was there\nI'm making new proteins they're not alive but they do do some things inside of cells but\nYou do you need the sale to help you make the ... [noise]\nWell actually so [noise]\nYou don't have to have the cell there is now very powerful systems where you can do everything from DNA to protein inside of a test tube with no cells at all\n... and so uh where do you bring truly see this research going what is what is your ultimate goal here\nI run my ultimate goal is to allow human beings to use the power of biology the power of biology to do chemistry to make molecules to make materials to make\nTheir ... agents and and and pharmaceuticals and and basically all the things when we need in our daily lives from renewable resources without producing excess waste\nMy time you talked to said I have fun for swing molecules to have sex\nOh yes I Do I'm at [laughter] well if you think about sex you have to wonder why nature would devise such a a a strange process and have all these half the population that doesn't carry the next generation\nSo there has to be some benefit to re combining your DNA with somebody else's and that benefit is the innovation that comes around if you read combined DNA you get progeny\nRe combined DNA dining coach something novel\n... she would get a phone call or two before we have to go let's go to ... Adrian and Hamdan I imagine [noise]\nHi this is a non and hand on um [noise] I grew up in Southeast Asia where my parents my cousin's everyone around me were just starting out their math or engineering my son who is about two and a half years old\nWhat I'm trying to figure out how to identify his mind said whether it be towards chemistry sports um math so may not be completely irrelevant question but I Would love to hear your thoughts on this subject how to identify your kids\nOr younger generations um your skill sets that they can go towards chemistry or science or physics\n[noise] did you know did you know what an early age Dr Arnold that you want to I\nWas lucky my father was the nuclear physicist and he always thought the girls could do math just as well as boys\nAnd I like being the winner [laughter] so I had a father who encouraged my natural tendency never discouraged it and had plenty of people to compete with\nWell you know I hear this from so many scientists we've talked to over the years that they had a role model mentors somebody could even be their parents who kept them are good kept alive or encourage their interest in science same thing for you it seems\nIt seems so and I miss my father he passed away two years ago but he would have loved this news\nMhm I'm a ... and he's the right to add to to answer the listener's call is there any way to identify any young age was talented\nIn science I think all children are talented and if they love it they will ask questions they will do it I think the most important thing is not to discourage\nSomeone ... have a tweet from Sydney who says please ask what she knows about how instinct is encoded in DNA example dogs urge to bury thing [laughter] I\nWish I knew but it's clear that many important behaviors are at least partially genetically encoded loyalty and dogs are so many interesting behaviors\nThat can be bred but we don't really understand what the genetic details of that are as we sequence more things and under ... and measure their properties will be using important and powerful tools like machine learning to peace out and to try to pull out what is that genetic basis\nWhile you were you in his updated my and my last question and that is are there what tools would you like to see I mean I give you while you've got some money now from the Nobel right what kind of tools would you that don't exist would you like to have\nWell I Want to be able to measure important properties rapidly so that I can do this breeding faster I don't have\n... powerful enough tools to do that but I'm also interested in how do you use AI machine learning to interpret the results of evolution to make it even faster than it is now\nI noticed on your Ted Talk you said that one of your great ambitions is to be invited to give the Ig Nobel awards be [laughter] you know we broadcast the eggs every year the day after Thanksgiving [noise] now I Know mark Abrams pretty good so I think we can put any yeah you know might be able to put in a good word for you know\nWell I was actually hoping to win the Ig Nobel prize before [laughter] but\nHi thank you doctor for taking time to be with us today\nThank you Dr Francis Arnold recipient of the ... Nobel Prize in chemistry and she's a professor of chemical engineering bioengineering and chemistry at Cal Tech [noise]\nHaving arguments with someone you thought was being completely illogical maybe as about what's ahead for dinner or something simple like that or maybe a little more difficult about climate change or White House policy\nWhatever the topic you know it is frustrating right offering up your own side of the story you feel like you're getting nowhere and nothing's happening no nothing nothing rational\nMaybe they're even taking the same point you're making and using them to support their own side well my next guest says the hardest part is that we both may employee perfectly sound logic only to come to different conclusions\nBy previously identified myself as a an aspiring feminist\nUm and I had done so because my logic was that I really couldn't fully empathize with some of the issues that women face I'm at the mail um and I was met with that logic from a a coworker of mine who um had said you know\nOut as a black male you know you might be doing things that contribute to I'm white supremacist systems that you might do so knowingly or unknowingly but that doesn't necessarily make you no longer a an African American male in the same way\nUm women or being a man who contributes suicide you stick systems knowingly wasn't necessarily make me I'm unable to to identify as feminists um it would just mean that I have to do more to aspire to um to contribute to feminist system and so\nI'm being able to see the fact that you know I can still be a male male experiences while existing at him and that's\nI'm In identifying myself in such a way really changed my mind um and I thought about\nThat that's great thanks for calling us that is great that very heartening\nHe's ... he's you know as part of the problems that we don't see how we are there see us\nI think that is part of the problem but I think a big problem is\nThat we often spend two don't try to defend our own points of view instead of trying to understand somebody else's points of view and we often focus on trying to change someone else's mind instead of trying to see that point of view and see what it's believed as he is and one thing I found very interesting in that the coolest experience is that\nIt was a great example of using some abstract structure to tap into the person's own experiences\nSo in a way I think the logic we've used very cleverly using emotions as well to say let's find an analogous situation that this person will understand from their own experiences and then hope that they can translate that\nTo somebody else is an hour just experience\nI have a tweet from James who says to me logical discussions don't require man he requires empathy empathy use caring enough to respect them in their view and listen to it is that emotional I don't know\nI agree I think that logic does not require math that logic is in a way pilots is math and these things have porous boundaries I mean we've construct to the north of us official boundaries\nMy points of view because I Am so deeply steeped in the discipline of mathematics I find that the full discipline of mathematics helps me with logic in the real world I'm not saying that you have to be a mathematician in order to use logic and that's a good thing because I think everybody can use logic whether they're a mathematician or not\nWe'll talk about some from the current events or which turn out to the artist topic and current events and not as voters in Congress are divided over whether to believe\nAccusations of sexual assault ticket and showed judge Brett Kavanaugh and whether this should affect his confirmation to the Supreme Court and you write than in terms of how people respond to stories about sexual assault there are a number of different logical process is at play tell me what you mean by that says\nThat's a whole other our whole lot of different\nParts of this argument that we can analyze starting with what we mentioned before about Rome definitions because all of the people who claimed to the principle of the presumption of innocence\nAnd the thing about the presumption of innocence I think is that it's technically for court cases and criminal trials\nAnd it's something that gets bandied around as a general principle but it's really a very specific principal and similarly the idea of freedom of speech is often bandied around as a general principle when in fact that's just about whether you can be in prison for saying certain things\nSo going on from the presumption of innocence\nThere is a paradox because some people say well we have to ... ... someone innocent until that until that proved guilty and the thing is that if you have an accuser\nUndone accused personnel let's just say the accuser is a woman and the accused person is a man then what about the fact that we should also presumed a woman to be innocent until she has proved guilty of a false accusation and so then we have a paradox because we can't actually hold the man on the woman both innocent at the same time because that causes a contradiction\nAnd mathematics and civil Sufi have studied paradoxes for a long time and studied ways to resolve paradoxes\nBy shifting levels are finding that things are to a different level and the thing is I think that we we can start with the axiom of\nPresuming the accused person to be innocent and then we can look whoa whoa that creates for us and what mathematics does all the time it starts with some basic assumptions and builds a logical well around that and then we look at that well and good what do we think of this world\nAnd so we can look at the world that we've created by presuming accuse people to be innocent until proven guilty and I think what we should see is that we've created a world in which people know that they can get away with sexual assault because there is\nMaybe that that means that they will do it more and so we've ended up in a culture where sexual assault can it can happen and does happen on happens all over the place because people know that they can get away with it so then the question is do we care about that\nAnd that becomes a question of false positives and false negatives so do we care that so many people are getting away with sexual assault all we more afraid of what some people are worried about which is that that will be false accusations and innocent men will be have their lives destroyed by a false accusation so\nHaving a false accusation um would be when somebody is innocent but is thoughts is accused of being guilty and the other way is when somebody is guilty but ... isn't proved to be guilty and so it left off\nAnd that's really about whether you were prioritizing the plight of victims of sexual assault or the the potential innocence of men and we have to have a discussion about that and about the fact that we have some help prioritizing the the men who might be accused\nWere prioritizing them over the thousands and millions of women who are suffering sexual assault over time and so the question is are we going to do anything about that\nSo that ... is a a question of black and white thinking and this happens a lot wet people get into arguments in extremes and so many of our arguments at the moment ton divisive because we take extreme opposite positions instead of something more moderate in between\nI'm so there is a an argument's around saying something like um you are making everyone into a rapist or what one that professor lung but said on his book that that we are characterizing just spin the buffalo crimes as rape\nAnd that's taking a very black and white view of thinking that we're calling all forms of sexual assault and harassment rape which is not what is happening there is a scale and there are things that are as bad as rape and there are other things that are bad but perhaps not as bad as rape\nWhich comes takes us to the issue of false equivalence is and straw person arguments where you can take that false equivalence and then you can declare it while you're saying everyone has a rapist which is not what people are saying\nOr your ... some people say you're saying any woman should be able to destroy the life of any man just by accusing him of sexual assault which again is a very extreme position that I don't think that anyone really is taking\nI'm finally um that's the question of knowledge and ...\nAnd then say you say in the absence of further evidence I'm going to take this default position and I'm going to wait until I found enough evidence to change my mind and the thing is that in\nA court case to trial it's very important because we're going to punish somebody badly for something so before we do that we should be very show\nThat they deserve to be punished whereas in the case of a Supreme Court appointments than what we're doing is we're giving something something very good and important\nAnd so we should be very sure that they deserve that very good and important thing and in that case one might argue that that that situation could be negated by one bad thing happening whereas in the case of a trial\nBe we should nuke we should not punish somebody if there is some doubts about whether they should be punished which means if there is something something good to offset the are showing us about the fact that they are bad\nAnd those are two they sound the same but that's slightly different situations that have a different ... situation [noise]\nThey'd for for seven to four to five five lots of people are checking in on that let's go to a career in Washington state Hi welcome to science friday\nAnd Hi Ira thanks so much for taking my call and my question is well I'm Wondering how\nTo access my logical argument would I feel very emotional about the subject that Spain discuss especially if I feel that I have first hand experience or background knowledge that\nSupports my logic that sometimes I feel that my emotions getting away and I ended up\nLogical at all [noise]\nMost crude grocer thank you for that question and I think the first thing that's important to remember is that your emotions all was valid and I think that we have been led into a situation of a false dichotomy between emotions and logic\nAnd some people I'm afraid it's often men take the position that if you are emotional vent it somehow proves that you're not logical and that's not the case I Know I'm a very emotional puff and I'm also I'm a very logical person I Am a successful such mathematician and my hope profession depends on my use of logic", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Billings", "day": "05"}
