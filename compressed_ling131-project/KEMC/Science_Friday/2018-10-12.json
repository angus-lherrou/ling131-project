campus of California Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks California\nLater in the hour an update on where world nations stand on curbing carbon emissions and avoiding a climate catastrophe but first\nThursday morning two astronauts on route to the international space station had to abort their launch after a booster rocket malfunction\nMade an emergency dissent back to earth and they're happy to report both are doing well both landing safely Rachel Feltman science editor of popular science issue to bring us up to date on the launch and others so like Detroit subjects in Science Welcome back right Joe\nThanks for having me Ira anything more about what went wrong there\nYet so we know that about two minutes into the launch there was some kind of booster failure\nAnd they had to undergo what's known as a a ballistic landing a ballistic descent which is so called because usually they add make kind of in a shallow angle as they come down to create a little bit of left and take away some of the um\nThe the force on on the astronaut string landing and this is where the rocket is really coming down more like a projectile and this has happened before but only ever um during landings which of course appears a lot less dramatic because ah they were supposed to come back down to the ground in the first place\nSo this is the first time they've ever had to make a such an aborted landing during a launch and um the Russian space agencies that immediately they would begin investigating and uh so far that that's all we know\nOne of the good news about it is that it worked right [laughter] right ahead [laughter]\nIt's not something that happens a lot but certainly one of the procedures that they are expected to uh occasionally encounter so you know not something we want to have happened but something that is certainly on the roster of things they have learned how to handle\nWell we're we're we're we're showing this capsule bring the only way for humans to reach the international space station is ... you know a little bit of a problem is no other way to get up there\nRight so there are um I Believe three so use missions\nPlanned that are now kind of up in the air because the Russian space agency again is undertaking this investigation\nAnd so it's possible some of those will be put on hold and even if they're not uh you know those two crew members who were counted on who are now on the ground instead of on I assessed a minute there's there's probably going to be a gap in staffing you know we if three people on the space station right now\nBut they're scheduled to come back in December and now they could extend their stay a bit but the show you this capsule they have up there that's going to bring them home\nI Believe it's only a it can only stay up there through some time in January so\nUh that's the longest there'll be able to stay before coming back down and that means that the space station probably will be an crude for some amount of time which is something that we know should be possible there are procedures in place for it uh but I don't believe it's ever happened before\n... which is a little love love to check on whether there are experiments up there but yeah you know it on hold or whatever certainly\nYou know every astronaut who goes up has a fully packed schedule of scientific experiments so NASA and the essay and the Russian space agency are certainly going to have to at least ... work schedules and I know there are few space walks that are now I'm up in the air so to speak\nSo to speak and other ... the the problem where to\nBut again ah you know and not a totally a pessimistic a message from NASA on that so the Hubble is twenty eight years old and has done fantastic work and hopefully a still has a lot of years left in it but it certainly is not a new telescope and\n[noise] this is science friday I'm Ira Flatow\nThere is less than a month until the mid term elections on November sex and there's a lot of talk about hacking and voter security\nThe federal government has said hackers targeted the election systems of Twenty one states before the twenty sixteen presidential election but reportedly no information was changed or manipulated yet for the second year in a row the DEF CON underground hacking conference\nWell it showed how hackers could break into voting machines\nSo what are the real risks to our voting infrastructure how can we security systems\nHow does all of this affect voting behavior and our question for your listeners is what is your top concern about voting security heading into the mid term elections we want to hear from you give us a call our number eight for for seven to for eight to five five\nEight four four site talk you can also tweet us at ... ... what concerns you most about voting security heading into these midterms let me bring on my guests\nAnd New York University Welcome to science friday Thanks Ira You're welcome Charles Stuart the third is a professor of political science and the founding director of the election data and science lab at MIT welcome to science friday\nLife here and it's nice to have you um [noise] well I mentioned the Russians hacking during the last presidential election what areas where the Russians or whether hackers compromising and what were they they trying to do their [noise]\nI'm not sure that we know and tireless what they were trying to do first of all I think it's really important when we're talking about um [noise] there's a lot of\nConversation about Russian interference in the election and two thousand six team over there there are a couple of things that we're talking about when we mentioned that one is\nA tax on the election infrastructure um but there's also um [noise] that kind of political purchase of political ads social media propaganda and attack on campaigns and their emails those are those are two separate things ah if we're focusing on the election infrastructure itself\nA we saw them targeting a voter registration databases again not entirely clear what they were trying to do there um and and of course voter registration databases or the roles that had the names of people and says whether or not they're eligible to vote where they live where they can vote\n'em and um there were phishing attacks against um [noise] uh election officials we know that um it looks like at least one or election systems vendor which uh manufacturers e pull books was attacked but I think\nUm [noise] we don't we don't know exactly what was going on I'm unclear or just that there was certainly a lot of I'm looking around on their part\nWhat was that was that the vendor company that was putting PC Anywhere on the on the machines as maintenance but the softer wasn't taken off [noise] is that what you're talking about in that case there was something different\nYou know know what I'm Talking about is um uh there there is a company the our systems my actually I think they may still [laughter]\nThey may still a U.S not have confirmed whether or not there there certainly was an attempt to hack them I'm ... and again they manufacture IPO books and and deal with registration databases\nOr electronic pull books or what you can kind of what argues they're often or a tablet or art or or computers that are used to check people in 'em and uh uh as I said uh\nOne of the Muller indictments there was an indication that there was some dinner and it sounded like them that that was actually breached\nCharles Stuart than we were talking about these kind of acts but how else could a voting machine be compromised\nWell I'm a well that's actually quite a controversial question if you ... you mentioned\nUm well so let's start off by making distinctions and I am and Larry really helped um I'm making the distinctions among the Russians um what they were doing in various ways um you know perhaps to influence the elections ranging from\nUm affecting the campaigns to may be affecting the infrastructure is I think um\nIf we're asking about um what can be done to hack\nInto say machines\nAnd systems um in the first um distinction we would make is between you know the voter registration systems which um where he was just talking a bit about 'em you alluded to at the Twenty one states\nUm they got attacked those are voter registration systems um and then there are the voting machines themselves which can either be electronic voting machines that are used in several states um\nOr potentially the scanners that are used to scan\nScan paper ballots and if we're thinking about voting machines themselves either the electronic ones or the scanners um that's actually the answer to that question is actually quite um quite controversial you made a reference to that Khan um activities and\nSo what we do know is that if you have um access to I'm a voting machine and especially if you have access for a long long time and the vulnerabilities are well known that um you know a a decently competent computer science student can open up the machine\nAnd do things to it um the\nUm what election officials will say is that first of all I'm In general the machines that have been broken into and DEF CON I'm either had been retired or in the process of being a retired and then secondly\nUm that the types of attacks that have been demonstrated to be successful against these machines um require such a degree of direct access that in order to have I'm actually an effective attack on them\nUm and you would need some sort of inside job um that would require a lot of attention to particular machines and we'll be easily ...\nThe computer science community thing 'cause it's easier to actually affect this type of kind of brute force attack against on the the guts of the voting machines than the election officials to\n... hour they right um well I mean I tend to kind of um\nIf I have to go with one side of the other I tend to my take on it is I'm I've learned a lot from DEF CON about what the um what the vulnerabilities are I think that the election officials are aware of those vulnerabilities\nAnd are taking 'em um are taking steps to try to um try to deal with them I think that the important thing nonetheless is that um the election officials that that are using electronic machines especially the ones that don't\nHave any sort of paper record of the election when they're in a position where they have to say well you know given everything we do to try to protect the machine is physically we're confident that they're not being attacked and we're confident because of the logic and accuracy testing we are doing that um there were mistakes made\nBut a skeptic can I think rightfully so even if you think the election officials have done everything they could\nI think there is still room for a skeptic to say yeah but wouldn't it be great if one could independently verify that the machines weren't monkey with and there weren't mistakes and the programming so um so I I tend to you know I I tend to fall on the side of thinking that the machines right now for\nTwenty Eighteen are well taken care of\nAnd are highly unlikely to be subject to the sorts of attacks that we see at DEF CON but it would ... who it would be good for the states to move in directions\nTo make it easier to demonstrate to skeptics that that was\nI could just jump in real crush point um I I I I think there to to build on on what Charles just said ah I Do have a concern I I'm not sure but I really buy the argument because these machines are generally not connected to the Internet that we don't have to worry about\nUm uh problems with them and potentially somebody reaching them in various ways but but um [noise] more importantly there's there there's a lot of the election infrastructure of course that is connected to the Internet um and an example of that my an obvious example was election night reporting which comes out\nUm and that's how we get the unofficial results although we don't call them that on election night very quickly um that comes up on on websites and gets reported out and uh we we\nReporting attacks um and um if if you get the incorrect numbers there in in the environment that we have today the hyper partisan environment where there is\nUm a lot of false information put out on social media ... I was talking earlier about that level of interference from the Russians and the two thousand sixteen election casting doubt on election outcomes if you don't have as a as we don't in in in a Thirteen states at least in in some polling places and Thirteen states\nA paper back up that you can go back to afterwards and say yeah maybe there's been doubt cast on these elections but we can go back and we have something that's independent of the software to tell us the results [noise]\nUm I I think that's that's very dangerous and I am hopeful that the Thirteen states where we still have these um paperless systems or that will be replacing them before the twenty twenty election\nIn signing the Paris climate agreement nations agreed to keep the increase in global average temperature\nTo quote will below two degrees Celsius a critical point at which the planet gets locked into a future of catastrophic impacts such as rising sea levels more devastating floods and droughts widespread food and water shortages and more powerful storms\nAnd to ensure that we don't get too close to that to degree tipping point the agreement ask\nCountries to limit the temperature increase\nTo just one point five degrees Celsius but how much does happen to agree save us from the most devastating impacts of climate change a new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the I. P. C. C. this week has shed some light on that\nIt highlights a number of climate change impacts that could be avoided by limiting global warming to one point five degrees compared to two degrees or more [noise]\nThe conclusion every bit of warming even that full point five degrees matters here to break down the report and tell us how world nations have been doing trying to curb emissions over the last three years\nIs Dr Kelly the Vin she is senior associate with the world resources Institute Dr living welcome back to science friday\nThank you so much to be with you\nI Want to send out a shout out to our listeners but you know with this question as we barrel Tour de one and a half degree increase in global temperature are you worried are you worried about climate change impacting where you live give ... give us a call our number eight for for\nSeven to for eight to five five eight four four seven to four to five five\nYou can also tweet us at ... fry 'em so Dr living the the the goal is to prevent it to a degree increase in average global temperatures but this report tells us\nThat even a one point five degree increase is going to bring some pretty big changes\n[noise] yeah that's absolutely right said that and has the government actually has these two goals as he said to limit warming well below two degrees and pursue advice from one point five degrees Celsius of warming and now is because some of the most vulnerable countries you can think of that small island ... states\nAnd so what this report did was look at what are the differences between warming of one point five degrees Celsius and two degrees Celsius of warming and how much harder is it to get to one point five degrees Celsius as opposed to two degrees Celsius and they found that indeed we are definitely not on track\n'em and and the half a degree of warming actually can make a tremendous difference\nAnd for example [noise]\nSo for example on what they found is they looked across a number of different systems and they found\nA for example for extreme heat the percentage of the global population exposed to a severe heat wave which we've already started to experience with one degree of warming\nOn at least once every five years is two and a half times worse with two degrees of warming instead of one point five degrees Celsius of warming\nIf you think about on sea ice free Arctic in the summer on when you don't have any ice on top of the Arctic\nOr this could happen at least once every hundred years with one point five degrees Celsius of warming but at least once every decade under two degrees Celsius of warming and that can impact climate change even further because you have a dark service that opens up underneath the ice and it absorbs more warmth\nSea level rise is point oh six meters more with two degrees as opposed to one point five degrees and wild that doesn't sound like a lot that translates to millions more people being impacted a species losses um two times worse\nFor both plants invertebrates that lose at least half of their range under two degrees of warming as opposed to one point five degrees of warming three times worse for insects\nI'm almost forty percent worse uh under two degrees versus one point five degrees for the amount of permafrost that would have thought in the Arctic in the Arctic I said these are some really big numbers one of the most um devastating and surprising wants to me was for coral reefs\nWhere the report found that under one point five degrees Celsius of warming we would see Seventy to Ninety percent of a further decline and coral reefs with two degrees more than Ninety nine percent ah which is just tremendous\nKnow does it look like there's any way we're going to be able to stay on the river to point zero degrees\nSo what the report finds is that both um two degrees Celsius of warming and one point five degrees Celsius of warming is technically feasible on there have been a lot of modeling studies where analysts come together and see what would have to happen um to make\nFifty to get get tons of carbon dioxide equivalent\nThey're projected to increase even with the climate change commitments that we've made under the Paris Agreement by twenty thirty\nInstead we essentially need to have that amount and go down to twenty five to thirty gig tons of carbon dioxide per year by twenty thirty and then we actually need to phase out net admissions altogether by mid century\nSo this is a tremendous transformation and decriminalization rates that are truly unprecedented at the scale of what we're talking about on it also would require behavioral and technological shifts across the board\nSo for example by twenty fifty we're talking about renewables projected to supply Seventy to eighty five percent of electricity or to be able to me at one point five pathways we're talking about reducing energy demand increasing the efficiency of food production changing dietary choices\nUm a lot of different measures ah which were I'm just starting to do in certain locations but none of them do we need\nTo know the president said he wanted to know quote who drew the reports I won't go there with that can can you answer at least who commission do what they do they use [noise]\nSure so on the way that the IPC she works on is on in this particular case under the Paris Agreement there was an accompanying decision and that decision\nOn requested the PCC the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change to put this report together\nOn and what the scientists do they commissioned about a hundred different scientists um had had a very lengthy review process of several different drafts being um reviewed publicly reviewed\nAnd I was one of the reviewers for that on the scientist basically assess all of the recent literature and in this case on one point five degrees Celsius and see what the science says\nI'm up to a certain cut off point where the literature is published\nOn and then they put together a detailed technical analysis interestingly in this case there's an accompanying summary for policymakers which was agreed upon and Korea\nUm about a week ago and that all of the government's signed onto including the United states and that is actually something that I'm negotiators come make sure that they feel comfortable with the um the implications for policymakers so in this case I'm part of the answer is that the United states I'm did actually endorsed this report\nFrom a ... a lot of people want to talk about it but I'm going to go to the phones to\nSo I'm an agriculture and I think what ends up\nConfusing people when you talk about one and a half degrees people are real excited about it\nWhat really hurts us in our culture\nIs the high temperature is the record highs so for example in the mid West is corn gets over Ninety five degrees Fahrenheit at night it kills the pollen and greatly reduced to view or in the Central Valley of California when tomatoes when the pilot temperatures get very high over a hundred degrees that kills the pollen\nAnd so this is really critical of the er the highs not just the average temperatures and fixes by growing more plants that's what the little ice age was about\nThe north America for a screw back for a hundred and fifty years after Columbus and all these trees took so much the out to the atmosphere it's cool to play it at all so much we had all the little ice age\nI Wish more of the scientists will talk about that because we can we can substitute a lot of our renewables can be biofuel vial death of the things like that that will instill make us grow more plants\nAnd we can have them for food feed and feel I buy you are you a farmer [noise]\nNo I'm a researcher actually but I have a small farm and on the developer energy super which makes food for food feeding fuel all and the same maker and the uses little water and nitrogen\nYou know everybody thinks we're going to have some input Seattle to an atmosphere where all the plants will take it up if we switched to the renewables using plants\nBurnt let me get a comment thanks thanks for your call what about can we saw some of the CEO to reverse some of the\nThings on it to some really good points here I think first on as um as you mentioned the one point five degree goal is for global average temperature increase temperatures increase at any one location especially on any one particular moment in time\nAs well as its impacts are going to vary and that and it's an incredibly important point an interesting leader the report does talk extensively about carbon removal\nAnd on says that not only do we need to pull out all the stops on a mission reduction but we actually have to remove carbon from the atmosphere and on a scale that we need to ramp up significantly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Billings", "day": "12"}
