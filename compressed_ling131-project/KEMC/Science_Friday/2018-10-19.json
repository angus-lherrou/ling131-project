for seven to for eight to five five where you can tweet us at science\nFry phone eight for for seven to for eight to five five or tweet at scifri fry but first last week's report from the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change gave us a sobering look at what a world worn by\nTwo degrees Celsius might look like then on the heels of that report Exxon Mobil announced that it was throwing financial support\nBehind the U.S carbon tax it's a big step for one of the world's largest oil companies which last year was sued by its own employees for misleading statements about the environmental and financial impact of fossil fuels\nAnd has a history of denying the climate science settled\nHere with the story as well as other short subjects in science is ... or ... staff writer for vox mayor welcome back to science friday\nThanks for having me again so Exxon says it's going to back us carbon tax on a service that sounds like a good thing but what exactly are they proposing\nProposing to back a lobbying effort launched by conservative former secretaries of state George Schultz and James Baker this is a group called the climate leadership council and it proposes starting with a forty dollars per ton price on carbon dioxide emissions and that price would rise overtime\nThan they would use that money to go back to people like you and me essentially in the form of a dividend or rebate and the estimated ... ...\nJuan ... a roll back some other environmental regulations and one big catches that they want immunity from climate change related law suits that want damages for these companies\nIt's the same deal that the the gun producers have [noise]\nYeah pretty much it's kind of analogous to what they got and it's what I'm other industries have also tried to get\n... ah actually I have a complicated relationship with climate change it it's been a head of the industry in acknowledging it's a problem\nThey've had researchers who helped to author the PCC report and yet they are also being sued for misleading people about the impact of fossil fuels years ago and in two thousand they took out ads in newspapers saying that the science was not settled I mean should we be taking this seriously or is it just another\nYou know ... ... make us look good sort of thing\nThat's always the question isn't it I mean the thing to remember what Exxon is that they are an investor owned company so they do have to answer to their shareholders and they've been getting a lot of pressure in shareholder meetings to better address climate change also climate change poses a business risk for them um in terms of their facilities and\nIf they aren't out ahead on this they might get slapped with a carbon policy that they don't like that doesn't actually work in their favor and another way a carbon tax might actually benefit them is that it would target the dirtier fuels first things like coal which would clear some space for one of axons other products natural gas\nAnd of course the catches the things they want to exchange for getting other environmental regulations rolled back Andy immunity from lawsuits I mean those are all things that benefit the company so yeah this could be viewed as an act of self interest overall\nYeah we're gonna have to look deeper into this as in in the weeks to come let's move on to speaking of a warming planet there are a couple of new studies this week that Joe massive losses of wildlife that had scientists worry tell us about that\nThere are a couple of different studies that kind of have a grim outlook for white humanity is doing to nature one of them looked at Arthur ... in Puerto Rico which includes you know insects centipede and spiders creatures like that\n[noise]\n\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow for anyone having a baby the decision to have a C section he is not unusual but what is unusual is the number of seats Chechens happening all over the world listened to this to worldwide rate has nearly doubled from twelve to Twenty one percent\nIn the past Fifteen Years and in the United states one out of three per se east by C section now\nA series of studies in the journal the Lancet look at this trend to see what is behind is up to pick what are the effects on mothers in babies\nAnd what didn't you ... can be done to decrease that number and that's what we're going to be talking about C section rapes globally also what's happening here in the U.S and my question for your listeners is did you or your partner you get a C. section\nWhat factored into that decision what was your experience like you can phone it in or you can tweet\nAt shy fry let me introduce my guest Holly Kennedy's an author author on that lasted Siri she's also professor of midwife midwifery at the Yale School of nursing thank you for joining us for that alec enemy\nThank you uh tell us alliances series looked at a hundred and sixty nine countries in overall there is a rising C section rage can you give us some of the numbers of different regions of must have buried around the world [noise]\nWell it does and um what we found was that over sixty percent of countries over U C sections and twenty five percent under use the the procedure so there's a quite a disparity and there are multiple reasons I'm part of it has to do with um\nThe um sort of socio cultural acceptance of surgery as an normative um thing to do part of it has to do with um insurance and um access\nAnd a and a large part of it has to do with um women not being able to get a ... birth after they've had their first this area and so it it's it's it's complicated we've seen the rise I'm\nIn a particularly in North America Western Europe Latin America and the Caribbean for example in Latin America it's gone from thirty two percent to forty four percent\nAnd um it it there's a bit of a paradox when what we would call 'em\nToo much too soon and too little too late so in the countries that overuse says area and they are probably intervening too much in low risk women that really don't need the procedure and in countries such as in Africa that um\nDon't have enough to access probably are under using it for the world Health Organization suggests that Fifteen Percent is about right about right so when you you think about one in three women in the United states having 'em as his area and we're way\nOver was talking about over ... there's just to for example in Brazil Ninety percent of the women that go into a private hospital getting C sections are they are they requesting that before they go in what is the mechanism what happens there\nWell I Can't speak specifically to you know the the interaction but but you write women who are wealthier who have insurance are much more likely the majority of them will have a C. section and it's and it's and accepted normative part of the culture in in Brazil\nAre there are big differences within countries and\nAnd again that has to do with access\nAnd a wealth education um interestingly enough I'm women that are have greater education are more likely to have this as area and and um which is a bit of a paradox in itself because [noise] um and as soon as area and is not a low risk\nUm surgery it is it's a major surgery and and things are there are small but serious risk of both with the immediate surgery and then later in terms of the scar and\nStill birth and preterm birth leader and with um subsequent pregnancies and it's one small part of the piece of ... of the puzzle in the United states were increasing maternal mortality rate\nYou mentioned that in some places there's too much in some places not enough what are those not enough places like and why\nThey're not enough places are places that don't have access in particularly in Africa and and countries that have lower resources so they just don't have the facilities to to do is his area and sometimes when women really needs it and I think it's important to stay at at the outside there are women\nWho and babies that that it is a life saving procedure but it it's not one that should be done for the majority of women\nI Want to focus on a little bit about what's happening here in the U.S and why she sections are increasing your Tony Golan it'd be\nVice chair of quality in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center in Boston Welcome to science friday Dr ... thank you for having oh let's let's talk about this um [noise]\nBut there's also this idea of of planned C sections right the did you have to approach this do you have ... have you seen this in your experience\nIt's quite interesting I think there's a natural suspicion that this is a major contributor to the C section epidemic in the ... and the United states at this point and well it's true that a family's women can request to have the delivery of biases area and\nIt turns out that that's not really the most significant driver on in our experience at Beth Israel Deaconess for example which is a tertiary care institution academic hospital I'm In the middle of Boston I it really only contributes to about one percent of our deliveries per year\nSo while some of this could be attributed to ...\nThink that we as health care providers need to um realize that we are probably the major major contributors to the rise considering delivery right here in the U.S\nWhen you say health care providers you're talking about the doctors who actually are performing and\n[noise] yeah uh so certainly the doctors the obstetricians um they're the ones who make the recommendation versus area and I'm at the end of the day on that who's responsible\nUm it's a complex environment to practice obstetrics so there are other things that put pressure possibly on obstetricians um we had incomplete somewhat inaccurate data about health and fetuses during labor that might contribute to our decision making\n'em the progress string labor in terms of the cervical dial a nation I is subjective so that can contribute to some inaccuracy\nThere's other things that happened on our unit that might put pressure on us other emergencies that might be happening on a labor and delivery unit that might put some pressure on us to make quicker decisions to move toward delivery\nBut at but at the end it's really our decision on as obstetricians to make that recommendation and generally speaking when we make a recommendation like that on patients and families do say yes um and they ask questions but they generally do say yes\nA highly what's your reaction to\nOh I Would completely agree with her the the culture of the unit\nWhere a woman who's giving birth is very instrumental um there's a number of strategies we can do to promote of a first time mother having a badge and birth and but you have to have the staffing you have to have the commitment to do the kind of care that's going to help her\nAnd her physiology two two best achieved ... birth\nLet's go to the phones let's go to northern Kentucky Hi Lauren welcome to science friday\nIra thank you You're welcome good\nThough I actually had an emergency thirty why do we um [noise] and I think for that\nFor that but when I got pregnant that time I really wasn't given the option of that over after that I kind of had to do all that it um it said I said I I I look at\nWhat they I I look at what were the very end user pregnant [noise] and um it really was it was\nLike my provider\nBut I wasn't that get their risk and then it it will make it really it it that's it and so I think that I was able to\nActually win that Senate rain heat and then I changed my mind at thirty six and I but I really ... them with that and I was able to see that but I like a lot of them are nice and given to me by my provider I really had\nOkay in a lot of information what area motion and it was really hard to find the ...\nOr ... let me get let me get a real it's great great call him and get a quick reaction Tony ... you know I'm truth be told I must be should be [laughter] but I'm Wondering through you back to ... everybody had to have one C. section after another and learn was sort of thing you know I didn't know that maybe I didn't have to\n\nMm Martin hooker inviting you to join referral program dedicated to the\nDrawing what momma don't looking and much more on the next move on friday

day Whitney at ... galleries information and tickets at Whitney arts dot org\nThis is science friday I'm Ira Flatow we've been talking this hour about the increasing the number of C sections and what that means for women's health\nMy guests are Dr Holly Kennedy professor of mid with free of the Yale School of nursing the Tony goal and vice chair of quality in a department of of obstetrics and gynecology at the famous Beth Israel Deaconess Medical center\nIn Boston and though lots lots of folks on on the line and let's see we only uh gosh I Can't get to everybody let me ask you how are you you worked in research midwifery in the u._k. how does the approach there compared to what we do here in the U.S [noise]\nWell it it it differs in several ways and actually when the land this Lancet series on C. section came out that W World Health organization also issued new guidelines to help help us look at decreasing says ... and\nAnd one of the things that they have recommended is what the UK does which is to have a collaborative midwife obstetrician model of care where the midwife\nDoes most of the primary care and that's what happens in the u._k. all women have midwife and some women had an obstetrician too when it's when it's really needed\nIn the Lancet also published a series on midway free very extensive review of the evidence and they found that midwifery was associated with improved outcomes increase the including decreasing C sections and so one is what I'd like to just mention is in the United states\nThat study came out this earlier this year that mapped the integration of midwifery across each state to see how ... how friendly the state was in ...\nAnd so if you look at the at New Mexico which has the lowest sea section rate of of just about Eighteen percent twenty six percent of births are attended by mid was in that state\nConversely with New Jersey has the highest rate of thirty three percent and only seven percent of birds are attended by midwives\nAnd then they met that without comes and uh if you look at Alabama Alabama has some of the worst maternal and in and out comes in the country and only one percent of births are attended by midwives so that's not a causation it as an association type study\nBut it is paused for thought and that is what we saw in the u._k. is that um we do have a model of care when when women have access to continuity of care with their midwife midwifery ... than they feel respected um you have better outcomes\nA tornado when you work to drive down the rate down at your hospital dealing after a decade went from forty to twenty nine percent in a in a decade what did you do there\n[noise] well first we recognize that we had a problem and I think that's step one and trying to solve it and then we looked toward the evidence I'm not just our own evidence but the national evidence about what was contributing\nTo mostly and ... mostly in terms of the indications forces areas and focus very narrowly on primary says Erin I'm first looked at the interpretation of how we monitor fetuses um while women are in labor that kind of monitoring called fetal heartbeat monitoring is very tricky\nIt's quite an accurate and it predicts quite well for us when babies are well but does not do a good job of telling us when babies are on well\nAnd nonetheless obstetricians base decisions on this test um I often say that and no other area in medicine would we make surgical decisions based on such a on such a faulty test\nNonetheless it's ubiquitous and people use fetal heart rate monitoring so we focused on really trying to focus on describing the fetal heart rate chasing using\nScience and objective criteria rather than subjective words um we focused on our documentation our communication\nWe also really tried to make sure that people were using scientific modern definitions for progress in labor\nOr old definitions were assumed that women would move much faster and labor than newer more modern data really prove to us we wanted to make sure that people use modern definitions for what we thought was normal labor as I mentioned\nAnd then also some other operations issues for our unit to change the culture of our unit\nFor misspoke here at the Beth Israel and to do with your family is from so blown down here in Boston and so does this all mean to the to the hospital you go to determines moralistic you'll have a C section or not\nUnfortunately it does a and so uh one of the reasons why we know that we have room to improve on sit there and delivery rates is that if you look from one hospital to the next event separated by one or two miles from one another\nWho take care of patients who have similar medical problems are of similar demographics\nThere's is there and delivery rates may vary by as much as ten percent\nThis is unexplainable by any other reason other than the environment the unit that you work in the people that you work with and the general enthusiasm for ... birth\nOr we have a tweet ... that's relevant to this and services I have to wonder how much of the increase has to do with how much money insurance companies make on them versus a typical delivery did did you study that your your your report Holly\nWill ... a ... not specifically except that it is the recommendation is that the financial strategies women who are having more money or where wealthier\nWe'll have more C sections so which implies that\nUm they can get you know reimbursed for that and one of the recommendations that the series made was to not pay more for ... to really um level the playing field and an end in addition to liability reform\nUm many in studies that I've conducted obstetricians have said to me you know I won't get sued if I Do a C. section but all I can get sued if I don't do one in in time or perceived to be in time\n... you're you're ...\nIssue of reimbursement as is interesting here in the u._s. ah where by and large physicians are obstetricians do not get a a vastly different amount of money for ... delivery than necessary and delivery however the hospital does\nAnd that is something that I think isn't quite transparent for patients on and probably reimbursement itself\nDoesn't influence a lot of obstetrician decision making here in the U. S. Adrian person is greater but it really goes more toward the ...\nHi I'm I've had two C sections and um they were mandated by the doctor due to complications real Crohn's disease and so I I really appreciate this nuance discussion but I just wanted to get a perspective of how this is actually playing out I'm\nAmong laypeople and patience and um I think a lot of the talk about this has become very anti woman um when I told people that I was having a plan C section\nDue to my chronic illness complications I had male friends think things like well are you sure you don't want to just labor for a little bit maybe you could just ask if you could labor for a little bit and I really interpreted that\nKind of questioning you know can I be a woman if I don't you know push the baby out ... and and that was really upsetting to me because my two beautiful daughters wouldn't be here if the C sections were not available to me\nAnd I you know I think um I just think it's really important for those at the academic and and provider levels to understand that that people are hearing these discussions\nAnd I think taking them and sort of inappropriate um in different directions slides I'd love to hear the response\nOr I got about a minute to Tony are only\nWould I Would I Would completely agree with you that one of the most important things in this in this conversation is for the provider and the woman to talk through what is important to her and and so that she can make an informed decision about the best strategy for her so it it is\nI Would completely agree that it's important that\nYou have that conversation and and the risks and benefits of both ... since the Syrian or fully ... fully discuss\nI'm Antonia what about this and the charge of sexism their\nPoint well taken I think you know any extreme is going to be dangerous I think it is important to realize that regardless of how a baby is born\nI'm the person who gives birth to the baby becomes apparent uh after that happens on it's no less are no more regardless of what the motive delivery ... delivery I'm certainly makes you just as much as the mother on as having a vegetable delivery", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "19"}
