New York city clubs like the middle of the night just like begging to get five minutes of stage time\nAnd I didn't have time for audiences to be shy or uncomfortable with me so it's just part of who I Am as a comedian is that I get out there I get the fact I have a disability out of the way and then I Move on and I think because I'm move on and a strong\nFunny ... way people are able to move on with me\nBecause I think for most people like the idea of making fun of a disability is it's uncomfortable like we're not used to that do you think so because\nI mean disability has been mocked mercilessly throughout stand up comedy on characters on television a disability made fun of all the time I think what they're not used to sing and someone with a disability who's proud yeah I'm ashamed and I'm Talking about\nEven someone like me who managed to like get all the way through high school without ever being mocked her bully when I became a performer became pretty common place for people to do that to me [noise]\n\nA lot of people with the pie don't walk but my parents didn't believe any can't my\nFather's ... what you can do it yet you can get [laughter]\n\nAs my three older sisters ... I was not been as my three older sisters went to public school my parents went to the school system and guarantee that I went to and if we didn't get aids we all got my mother slipper [noise]\n\nMy father taught me how I Walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking another tactic that he used this he would dangle a dollar bill and\nTrying to have [laughter] my inner stripper was very strong and [laughter]\n\nBy the first day of kindergarten I was walking like a champion who had been punched one too many times [noise]\nSo when you were a kid I mean first of all you describe like up until the age of five you you weren't able to walk right I was able to walk out five I had to be able to walk in order to be mainstream did to public school\nAnd um my father worked day and night to teach me how to walk and I think what's so amazing about this is the fact\nThat he was told that I Would never walk and he decided that he was going to try\nWhat did you realize that you were funny [laughter]\nSo my dream in life was to be on General Hospital I didn't know that was funny I went to college for drama and then I came back to New York city started auditioning realize no one was hiring me and I had a conversation with an amazing acting coach\nAnd she said to me why don't you do a one woman show that way you can stand out\nAnd I started looking at things like that and who did I see I saw Whoopi Goldberg and when I saw what would we go over that and saw like how she used comedy I was like wait a minute when I look at my TV the people who look like me are all comedians Richard Pryor\nPossibly had disability you know had different races like Margaret Cho and I felt like comedy was how I could break through the fact that I was an other and still get on TV\nAnd so I signed up for comedy class and it worked out because I had no idea I was funny and it turned out I'm his therapy [laughter]\nYou know it's it's interesting because like all these comedians that that you mentioned I mean they dealt with their demons right or the challenges their humor right in\nAnd do you I mean do you see yourself doing that in your comedy the same way I mean do you do you see yourself as almost like kind of an advocate for for people with disabilities or for Arabs and Muslims as well\nI've never tried to be an activist or an advocate I was telling my own story and just by telling my own story I was controversial I was telling people things they didn't know and this started post nine eleven\nIn New York City my friend and I found that the New York our American comedy festival to counter the negative images of Arabs and media and we\nAlways made sure that the comedy came first so we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny we were a bunch of comedians who just happened to be of Arab heritage and you know sometimes I just wanted to talk about beyond say I'm I named my cat beyond and people are like\nTalking about guys are talking about several probably talked about you know and I'm like\nBut I really just want to talk about beyond say that [laughter] so it gets exhausting having to constantly battle but I feel like more than ever in my life it's important now that I Do battle because having grown up with you know one fight in Jersey and one foot in the middle east\nI'm really worried about where we are right now in this country\nAnd when I did that Ted Talk I didn't know how important it was to say a Muslim in front of every one I really thought it was the disability that was going to be the thing that I was championing not\nGrowing up there were only six Arabs in my town and they were all my family now there are twenty hours in town and they are still my family [noise] I don't think anyone even noticed we weren't Italian [laughter]\n[noise] this\n\nSupport for the Ted radio hour comes from the logic crack family owned makers of small batch Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey you logic correct bart's

us deal with the chaos of life\nSo we're just hearing from comedian again for sun and she and a group of Muslim comedians\nTraveled around the country doing what they call social justice comedy and they're trying to open up the conversation about Islamophobia which at times required a little patience [laughter]\nYeah I I think one of the hallmarks of social justice comedy um as I call it\nIs that you remain delightful and I you know I get I get angry you know behind the scenes but when I'm In the middle of a situation I got to keep a delightful because you're just you're going to you know this is a lawyer to attract more be without any I mean that's the cliche but it's true yeah\nAnd what we need to do is remember that being around people and laughing with them is a\nIs a joint um shared experience like a group mind that engaged in something kind of like fun and the negativity kind of get swept away\nSo that trip and again took was the other comedians they turned it into a movie\nCalled the Muslims are coming and not too long after he came up something happened back in New York police were and again the usually felt welcomed and accepted\nHate group spent three hundred thousand dollars on an anti Muslim poster campaign with the MTA that's the New York city subway system was yours truly offensive not to mention poorly design I mean if you're going to be negative you might as well use a better font but\nAh why not macho own poster campaign right that does nice things about Muslims so myself comedians you know be doll I decided to launch the fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign\nWe raised money work for over five months was approved and then we're supposed to go up\nA V. C. they decided to be the poster citing political content once\nThey got a couple of those posters here's one left not Muslim Muslims [noise] let's see what the true Muslims they have great for a recipe\nFor us are considered political by the NCAA or the mention of Muslims in a positive light what's considered political but it is it it's about justice so we have to change our fighting bigotry with delightful posters campaign fighting bigotry with a delightful lawsuit campaign [noise]\nAgency and the comedians one\n[noise]\nWith a very weird feeling I was like as\nA blonde girls oh let's\nWork is meant to be fun it's meant to generate a connection and laughter but yeah sometimes I get means we sent hate mail sometimes I get voice mail saying that if I continued telling my jokes or they'll kill me and they'll kill my family and those death threats are definitely not funny but\nJust changing all danger I still think that social justice comedy is one of our best weapons [noise]\n\nShe took a lot about using comedy as a tool and there's a great moment in the film or I think you're in Birmingham, Alabama and a and it will like it was pretty successful\nYeah so I mean you know one of our stops in Birmingham, Alabama where we like set up a table called me about religion we're going to read a quote and you're going to tell us if it was all tests\nDoes your guest right you got whatever like ridiculous prices like an outdated calendar salivating already and yes we are salt and pepper shakers are also like chocolate and stuff like that which holy book stipulate for the girl who does not lead on her wedding night should be stoned to death of the growth\nOf her own it is the\nMan\nPeople guessed wrong on because they just assumed everything that was a violent um came from the current Mary said\nLord how can I have a son when no man has touched me\nAnd so we just we're trying to make the point that all of these tax half greedy stopping them so why would we hold Islam to a separate standard\nAnd where people surprised when they like when they found out what the truth was\nYeah yeah people were really surprised and you could see them having that moment of like oh my God\nYou know a lot of difference between the three of them do you know [noise] some credible that means that you actually saw the wheels turning like people changing their mind even just slightly\nAbsolutely and I and that's one of the things that like I have performed um in in red states and blue states and one thing that I found all over the country is that American people are not built to hate you know what I mean\nOr for you and they want to be good neighbors um and the one thing I've always found that said this before and it's so dark but it's true is that if you\nApproach people with love you're going to get lodged in return and that's what I found as a Muslim doing very publicly Muslim thing was performing on stages throughout the country\nThat's what I found a way I like to look at it as you\nGet one person to laugh and a couple of people laugh and then over a lifetime he might get like a million people chuckling and does chuckles add up to some measure of of a popular um shifting perception [noise]\nAnd that is social change but it takes time and it takes like millions of these\n[noise] chuckle [noise]\nComedian against our side she's the author of how to make white people\nLaugh and she also hosts a podcast called the nation\nYou can find her full talk at ... dot com [noise]\nOn the show today painfully funny ideas about how humor can help us cope with things that on their face\nAre very funny as\nThis is Lisa [noise]\nThis is Kevin real as you guessed it a writer and they stand up comedian Louis and we have ...\n... as we as physicians [noise] she says she's ready for it though [noise]\nOut of it was marvelous [noise]\nSo obviously being funny is what Kevin does for a living but being funny\nIs also a way he deals with like humor I think is either kind of like an invitation or\nA shield but you can use humor to keep people on the outside of your life and that's what I did as a as a young person\nWhen I was really struggling I never wanted anyone to see what was going on and so my defense mechanism was humor\nBut I also think that humor can be this invitation into ideas thoughts and stories that\nMight otherwise be uncomfortable and heavy because there's no sort of redemptive narrative within them for cabin humor was a way to deal with his depression\nBut at least in the beginning it was more of a shield than an invitation\nWhen I was Thirteen Years old my best friend at the time in Jordan McGregor passed away\nMy life and when he died it just ripped everything out of me and she felt like I was shattered and just a million different pieces I mean it's like kind of grief that\nTo this day I kind of really struggled to put accurate words and language around it because it was just so overwhelming but that was my first experience with this really intense feeling of grief and loss and depression\nAnd then from Thirteen to Seventeen kind of fluctuate it in and out of these what I might call seasons of depression where it just felt like it would come in waves\nAnd you know for a month to three months I Would be really dark helpless place\n\nBut I was fighting that secretly been a long way I didn't want people to see that I didn't think it was okay to talk about it and so that became this extra weight of you know shame and embarrassment and killed\nKevin briel tells his story on the stage and
