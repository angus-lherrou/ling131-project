James Austin Smith\nWhen Dr acts are probably the most exciting thing to play as a wind player this big sound to all those two clarinet stupid students to more into its rockets lively but it can also be smooth and gorgeous\nAnd vocal like all wind instruments are this formation had an name from the Nineteen centuries called ... in German harmony music\nAnd composers really took to it as a way of kind of exploring this big wind sound in a very classical airway unlike say stir Vince ski in the twentieth century who discovered a whole different kind of when sound\nThere's an opening quick movement a minuet and then it incredibly beautiful slow I dodged Rio really Mozart on top form logically and harmonic Lee just gorgeous\nAnother minuet because why not and then ending with a really rock is finale it's one of the most fun pieces to play as a win player and a truly enjoyable to listen to his well\nThank you James and now from the chamber music society of Lincoln Center here are ...
