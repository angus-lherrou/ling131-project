Jessica Luther Hi Jessica high you are up first this week Jessica what do we need to know\nYeah so Christie honoring although the soccer superstar from Portugal who played for event is in Italy is the third highest paid athlete in the world and possibly the most famous he has now also under investigation by the Las Vegas police department in regard to a two thousand nine reported sexual assault\nA woman by the name of Catherine me or guys come forward and a long piece in the German magazine Der Spiegel she waited until now because back in two thousand ten when all those settled with her out of court and pay a three hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars but the stipulation that she never talk about the reported assault again\nBut she has a new lawyer who is trying to avoid the settlement on multiple legal grounds there is a police investigation because she filed a police report ended a rape kit back in two thousand nine the day after she says he raped her\nWhen although has denied these allegations but in their reporting Spiegel says there was an internal document between her and all of his lawyers and which are NATO and met she said no\nThere may not be a bigger athlete on the planet you all see this getting any traction\nWell I think that it should be getting some traction but given that the week that we've had and also not just the week but the year you're looking at Ohio State and just of course the work you've done and Baylor Ann Cavanaugh I mean you wonder how you're going to keep your enthusiasm level hide it we used to be paid closer attention\nI'm going to try to be optimistic and say that this is going to get the sort of traction but it made them it's going to it and that people are gonna pay attention to it I Wish I were more optimistic than I Am totally what do you think\nI I definitely don't have the optimism mostly because uh we live in a system here where the powerful or is always lifted where the powerless or not\nThis woman has every piece of evidence possible you have sponsors who are kind of backing away from her and all the way you have teams who are suspending him and giving him a break but it should go much further than that to the point that a woman's fewer must be respected and so she her pain\nYeah and you've got Nike that's got a billion dollar endorsement deal with him by the way that is one billion for one player and of course a ... a sports has also said that they are monitoring the situation very closely ... this is the area that you trafficking\nWhen you saw Addison Russell get forty games were major league baseball after his domestic violence situation is this needle moving at all in your opinion\nI mean it's moving it's a you know I always described us as like a giant cruise ship with a teeny tiny writer and turning this at all it's very difficult but you know for someone like me who studies college football and sexual violence and particular it wasn't\nTo get the kind of change that we're hoping for\nTyler Europe so when the last few weeks one of the major dissenters in this athletic moment of protests outside of Colin Kaepernick his former teammate era greed was originally signed by the Carolina Panthers read isn't all pro level almost all world level safety at this point and was one of the main people who kneeled next to Colin Kaepernick back in August twenty sixteen\nAfter Jerry Richardson's reign of massage any and also sexism and also racism and also everything bad in the world that could be around one owner him leaving the Panthers last shares opened up a new leadership where owner David temper has said that he sides with the protests that being said\nIt doesn't feel as if the Panthers have done anything monumental by hiring a dissenter hiring a protester who was ousted from the league has a collusion case with the NFL\nThey've been nothing but hire the right person for the job but at the same time it almost feels as if protesters during the cap on the air are finding their way back into the league for us and\nYeah I think that number one do you get a medal for doing the right thing to you\nIs that what we do here just because my question for you on this I'm thinking is this cynicism in met you finally got a player that you needed when you're the Panthers or is it the fact that now that you hire Eric read that collusion lawsuit that he's got currently against the NFL now goes away\n... is a good question I mean it doesn't matter that they hired him because he's a good football player [noise] I'm\nGoing back to the discussion we just had and Tyler brought this up um if we want to talk about the impact of need to on sports the fact that Richard since not there is because of Sports Illustrated reporting about his massage and races out of the threat that's tied into me to write so we can see a direct impact here\nAnd it's hard you don't want to give them cookies for doing the thing that they should do [laughter] I don't know it's so complicated I'm really happy that read his back\nI think we can mix a piece of actually being happy that somebody who deserves the job I got one\nAnd also having skepticism that it took this long for it to happen in the entire NFC outhouse needed so they never happened in the first place why why are we waiting until October for this exactly ... was not on a preseason roster every was on the train and kept roster it took multiple mental fall and the gridiron for ... to even get proposed that he should have a job\nOr the general manager Marty hardly ... strictly a football decision and that's when they start to feel duplicitous but we need to actually speak about it\nYeah and he's not being silent I always want to point out that at his press or would it be ... by the way you said yeah I mean his unpacking of us history and oppression in this country should be used in classrooms and he's being very clear in his messaging as he has always been\nA Eric and I talked about this at links that are in their twenties Seventeen season all year with the forty niners last year and I remember saying to him\nShaping your message on what this is all about stay on target if you don't stay on target and they're going to shape it for you and you're going to lose or what he did to me was fantastic\nI Am going to finish things off with football as well and people hate it when I say it but sports are filtered through the following lens white owners white coaches white season ticket buyers white media and black players\nThrough the lens players perform a service for the owners and the entertainment fan base they have no other rights or concerns they're paid a ton and they're expected to be grateful\nBut it'll Thomas the safety for the Seattle Seahawks he held out earlier this season for a better contract and everyone knows the dangers of football the injury risk the short window of opportunity and the fans called him selfish\nAnd he came back and what happened he broke his leg and well being cut it off the field he flipped the middle finger to his own sideline and some fans burned his Jersey my reaction wasn't a burned his Jersey it was to buy one Jessica\n[laughter] who got your Jersey money though [laughter] you know it's\nJust there's some way to support and also to make sure that the right people are being hurt by this\nYeah I think that's a great point and it made me think a lot about ah this story with JR Smith they came up recently in NBA and he put a tattoo on his leg and then all the passion about covering it up and and sort of this discussion of who owns a company that in quotes like who owns\nThe ... and when did they do a stress I guess sometimes refer to them as owners [laughter] right yeah you talk about them is owners the language of sports is very specific right\nI think the anger that comes to the hearing some some of these decisions of the fact that we don't really understand the metrics of how capitalism can work right [laughter] you belong to the people who pay your paycheck and that's wrong at the basis of it right\nSo the NBA says dearest but actually we do on your skin and he has one of two choices he says the fact that we know you don't I Want a brand do my leg\nOr he says the money is more important to my kids but she did say I'm just going to keep pushing and so I think it's powerful that people like all Thomas and GR Smith are standing up to these corporations that are telling them they're not worth that much when the reality is if there's no way beyond bill on the field as we've seen with the Steelers often\nOften doesn't go the team is bad losses recruit people get fired in that just because you wouldn't pay somebody their worst\nMy guess for this week's edition of three stories you should never

Thirteen ... weird season on Sunday they started the day with the best record in the national league forty eight hours later after two games at home they're finished\nYeah I mean we're well wait a home game though you know I mean you know when it's going to run exactly right\nAnd unfortunately one of those hit at the wrong time\nMobs of lately they scored one run or fewer forty times this year and still one Ninety five games so I guess they should get a medal for that\nYeah outside of the red Sox wanting a hundred and eight games with that Bolton that stat on the top just most inexplicable thing of the year\nIt's incredible the only team to score one runner fewer more times than the cubs was the Orioles and they lost a hundred and fifty in game winning and winning Ninety five with that sort of a ... is doing something there was news this week in a novel move tennis channel will begin showing wait for it tennis\nMore specifically the women's tennis tour which went out on its own and the disastrous venture it would be in sports for the last two years women's tennis outside of the grand slams has been virtually invisible meanwhile for the past five years many Los Angeles Dodgers fans haven't been able to watch the games and bear market because some cable networks won't carry sports Mitt LA\nWith the combination of court cutting in contempt you think people are realizing that life goes on or if you're just a die hard sports men do you just wait forever until these corporations figure it out\nYeah I think both are true I also think there is another phenomenon going on and that is the phenomenon of finding a way to be a fan\nWithout attending games that without necessarily watching on TV [laughter] I mean we all have to be a fan through better\nBut now you can be a fan through fantasy sports you can be a fan through memorabilia for all kinds of ways to do what you can be a fan through media nostalgia yep what this thing with the women's tennis thing reminds me most stuff is a phenomenally disastrous decision that the NHL made years ago to get off ESPN and not just for starting this\nRight or they went to ... but they got a spike TV for the playoffs remember\nThat I went to like you'd be surprised before that they went to sports channel you know they were ESPN's only professional league you have that sort of the time and he asked he ended up you know they did it among the SPN they did what he SPN does which is ... and the moon and then they moved on to sports you know that's what this reminds me also\nKnow they made a big mistake and I think the good news is at least if you're a fan of WTO tenants than I Am ... I watched the women as much as I watch them and I'm happy that their back and you can actually watch them for the season\nAnd you know finally Charlie you know no show would be complete without at least some discussion of the Cleveland Browns but here's a story about a different team a barn Iowa has a locked cooler full of Budweiser not Bud Light but Budweiser that it will open\nWhen the corn ... when it first football game of the season great idea right\nYeah I don't know I I don't know if someone bar and I was doing this but okay they're just making fun of the authors that cooler is likely going to stay close for at least a week but here's my question\nSome sort of Nebraska her brother and her father and grandfather all played football for Nebraska\nI mean I think they've been crippled I think by conference realignment and by the fact that the whole nature of college football changed the thing about Nebraska teams was outside people like Johnny Rogers and Tommy fresher they were big goons stay would beat you to death yep over the all up and down the field\nThe game changed it to a very big people who are really fast and I don't think the press has ever really caught up on that\nNow we've come a long way since Tom Rath men in Roger Craig huh there you go [laughter] you can find a sports writing of Charlie Pierce and Sports Illustrated from time to time and he joins us each week on only game I think he Charlie ducks are\n[noise]\nYou know the same game recognize game\nWhether it's Aaron Rodgers and Tom Brady LeBron James and Kevin Turan greatness knows it when it sees it it's like a spider sense the same goes for the only game pot ... who think your grades were pretty good too\nSo recognize our game by subscribing an apple pie casting or wherever you listen to pod cast and while you're there and leave us a review you're helping listeners find our show and helping us raise aren't getting [noise]\n\nJimmy Connors maybe America's greatest tennis player Arthur ash maybe it's most influential they couldn't stand each other ash really\nDisliked anyone who had a kind of brag a dose CEO anyone who trained himself in the way that Congress did\nThat's University of South Florida professor and historian Raymond arsenal\nHe just wasn't wanted to attack anyway always gave everybody in the benefit of the doubt but as a member of his family told me once the only person that he really didn't like on the tour was Jimmy Connors\nOne was brilliant but craving the other a quiet revolutionary with a powerful sense of patriotism here's only games Gary wallet on Arthur ashes clash with his greatest nemesis when that unfolded on and off the court\nThe quarrels between Jimmy Connors and Arthur Ashe probably began with the Davis Cup\nThe annual international team tennis event that dates back to Nineteen hundred according to Raymond arsenal their attitudes towards playing on the U.S team were diametrically opposed\nI think I actually met a tremendous amount to him because it affirmed his notion of self worth that he was a citizen a proud citizen and that he was respected enough to represent\nCompetition he had played on the U.S team in a different years by the time Jimmy Connors was dominating men's tennis in the mid seventies but Connors refused to join the team this irritated ashes\nYou could never understand why Connors didn't share any of that sentiment\nThat it didn't mean anything to him if he did make money out of it he didn't seem to want to do it\nIn June of Nineteen Seventy four Arthur Ashe was elected president of the association of tennis professionals a new governing body created to represent the interests of male tennis players\nWell there's never been anything remotely like a tennis players union and the national federations around the world and tennis promoters really making all of the decisions and the players felt that they were left out that they needed a voice\nConnors refused to join the ATP instead he kept playing as a member of world team tennis or W T T\n[noise] in Nineteen Seventy four double duty teeth filed a ten million dollar lawsuit against ATP executives and a major sponsor of the European grand slam events for barring W T T players just hours before ashes election as president of the ATP\nConnors in his agent joined that lawsuit ash was infuriated so he wrote a letter\nTo the members of the ATP and which he described Connors as brash arrogant and unpatriotic\nThe letter became public on June twenty first Nineteen Seventy five just two days before Wimbledon first round began Connors and his agents filed another lawsuit this time it was for libel and named ash and his letter specifically", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Only a Game", "city": "Billings", "day": "06"}
