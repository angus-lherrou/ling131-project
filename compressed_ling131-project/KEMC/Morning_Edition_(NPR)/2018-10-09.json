Democrats had a big advantage and Republicans got a little bit of a bomb to try to close that gap but there's still a significant advantage for Democrats\nAlthough one of our our polls that NPR showed that Republicans when a long way in closing that energy gap I mean it it sounds like Democrats might have some work to do to to sort of why men death again what what what is the plan\nWell first of all this is a bum so I think some of that\nIs temporary secondly the Republicans did a lot of damage to themselves there are a lot of women in important districts around the country who used to be voting Republican very regularly we saw a lot of them effect\nTo Democrats and twenty sixteen\nThey were continuing to defect but now even more of them have moved over to Democrats so there's a lot we've gotten out of this\nSo you know for Mitch McConnell this is good spin they want to make the best out of there but they've sustained some damage from this as well\n[noise] well um you know Republican strategist are basically framing what your party did as a character assassination on U.S Supreme Court nominee based on allegations that\nWere not corroborated and I want to be very careful and obviously take nothing away from the serious charges that were made about Kevin ... but do you see how some voters might have seen this as a character assassination and and what can the Democratic

France\nWas a man named among Hong way he's from China but in a stunning moved China's government detained mom put him under investigation and now he has resigned from Interpol I talk to NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz and ask them what do we know about a month or month\nHallway is sixty four years old he served as the vice minister of public security bureau which is China's national police are in twenty sixteen he\nBecame the first Chinese head of Interpol and there's an election was a big victory for China's government which under leader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate an extra day Chinese officials at it deems corrupt would a scape China\nBut as it turns out among himself is now under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption\nWhat exactly are they investigating him for\n[noise] we'll try this government hasn't released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how is the tension unfolded has come from his wife grace among on September twenty fifth\nThe day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by in a mood to even knife suggesting that she was in danger\nA week later she reported in missing to French police on Sunday she spoke to reporters and we own France were in trouble is headquartered in here's what she said\nIn and you know when I'm speaking on behalf of might have and when my children all the people in my mother for all the whys and children's husbands and fathers so they may no longer disappear\nAnd as you can hear in that tape now while she's crying during this part of the video with their back turned to the camera because she's received threats and is under protection by French police well when she\nTalking about the government anti corruption campaign was launched by Xi Jinping immediately after he took office in twenty Thirteen and its neared hundreds of thousands of officials both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed Malone way to vice minister of public security was Julia in Congo highest ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign Joe was a former member of the pull up your standing committee the group of seven men who rules China he was China's security czar before he was sent to prison for life and twenty Fifteen\nRob by removing them from the presidency of Interpol China loses a lot of sway within that organization that much is clear what does this mean for Interpol\nWell even before this happened China's use of Interpol under amongst presidents he was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China tempted to issue a red notice that it's an international alert for wanted person\nFor an exile weaker active is ... years are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China who China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with lung is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over into international organizations\nReally interesting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob banks do\n\nAcross the United states more criminal courts are turning to video proceedings this isn't an effort to save time and money that that happens some public defenders and others in the criminal justice system are questioning whether the rights of those accused are being affected by this technology\nFrom Illinois newsroom in Urbana league gains reports\nToday like most days thousands of defendants will show up in criminal court for their first appearance in

take a friend of mine put it in from the video camera the judge has access to the video camera conversation just like we are now but it's just over a video screen\nBut Charles Davis and says it's just not the same Davidson is sixty eight years old and a recovering heroin user who was in and out of jails and prisons in Illinois for over two decades he finds the video process both off putting and demeaning\nWhen I first went to the video record it just blew 'em up because it wasn't everybody get up and go in front of the screws it's an issue you sir no sir you know you couldn't Sunni to\nDavidson says when you're in the same room as the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nOh shortage glued to the judge what happened to me to record\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison\nWhere Rosalie joy says she hears stories like David since all the time she's with the national legal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court has some defense attorneys concerned that it alienates the accused from those deciding their fate\nEven before the proceedings began you already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process you are treated as\nThe least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction and as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my client unless my clients stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase spell amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for its cost savings and efficiency while acknowledging that some of those advocating for the accused say it's a trade off that's unfair to defendants\nFor NPR News I'm Lee gains in Urbana, Illinois [noise]\n\nThis is NPR News\n... year after Harvey Weinstein\nTraining that goes well
