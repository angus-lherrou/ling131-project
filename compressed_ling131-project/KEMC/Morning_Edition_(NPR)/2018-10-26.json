PR\n\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin in Del Rio Texas and I'm Noel King in Washington DC good morning a search is underway for the person or people who mailed homemade pipe bombs to critics of President Trump\nThis morning to more of these potentially threatening packages had been discovered one of them was addressed to New Jersey senator Cory Booker and the other two former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nNow they follow ten other packages that were sent a prominent figures including President Obama his former attorney general and his one time CIA director NPR's national justice correspondent Carrie Johnson has been following the story Hi Carey I Know so the story is still moving what is the focus now have this massive investigation\nAnd this morning there is some new activity at a male center in New York that's where a package addressed a former intelligence chief James Clapper has been located and there are similar activity surrounding senator Cory Booker the FBI says they've located another suspicious package that resembles the earlier ones addressed him\nRecovered it in South Florida the bulk of this investigation seems to be centered in two places though one is the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia which is analyzing these devices may look like homemade pipe bombs and the experts at the FBI will be looking for clues\nAbout how the bombs were constructed there'll be looking for DNA are fingerprints the bomber bombers may have been left behind and retired investigators are telling me this is very promising because so many of these devices are intact they didn't blow up\nIf history as a guide though the whole process could take a little while 'cause it's a long time to analyze that stuff or is this sense of being done in Quantico, Virginia as you said there's a second area as well\nYeah last night authorities were searching a package sorting facility in Florida in ... near Miami the operating theory has been some of the packages went through that facility and then through the u._s. mail\nA investigators are looking for more devices but also other clues and there's a tone of manpower our being deployed across the U.S the postal inspectors the FBI the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives\n... and local police to the bomb squad and canine unit in Miami Dade last night and of course in New York police department out in full force to none of these packages have exploded and so that's led to speculation that um that maybe they don't have the capacity to blow up\nWater investigative telling you well police and the FBI or decline to answer questions on the record about whether the bombs could have presented a lethal threat to anyone\nAnd race it's pretty much a toss up according to the Amish you empty and poll so the question was posed to empty and chief political analyst and MSU political scientist David Parker\nCould there be a coat tail effect and the scramble to win over undecided or independent voters Parker says looking deeper into this survey results shows independence aren't as enamored with Trump or the Trump tax cuts\nAnother factor he says sixty percent of independents say they approve of incumbent Senator Jon Tester's job performance although the Democrats overall jobs\nGather you're getting a picture here of essentially\nMatt Rosendale thinks the way he can win as rally all Republicans to him the problem is if those independents show up that's a massive advantage for Jon Tester because they like him and on top of that that could help Kathleen Williams down ballot so it's a high risk strategy\nParker says two issues that are strongly resonating among those surveyed is concern about illegal immigration as well as support for public lands he says that's why there are so many political ads on these issues\nAs for the job approval rating for the rest of the top elected officials in Montana democratic governor Steve bullock was at the top of the package just over fifty four percent followed closely by Republican U.S senator Steve Dane's at just over fifty three percent\nAgain test or it nearly forty nine percent well congressman Greg gene forte rounded out the pack\nAnd just over forty eight percent of respondents giving him a favorable job approval rating Jackie I'm a knock on why PR news Bozeman\nYou're listening to MORNING EDITION right here on member supported Yellowstone public radio\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin\nAnd I'm Noel King good morning earlier this week NBC's Today show anchor Megan Kelly caused outrage with some on air remarks about Halloween costumes\nThere was a controversy on the real housewives of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and I felt like who doesn't want to and she wants to look like Diane around her one day I I don't know how like outrageous not hollow why\nNow NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting that the network has dropped Kelly from the today show lineup and that she appears likely to leave the network because of the fallout from those comments the morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that Megan Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she's in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News\nFor all your kids watch at home than it just is white and she says it was a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\nWell these aren't uh the only examples of of their number I remember back in twenty and the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claim that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny sheet group ... group called the new Black Panthers a one I Believe them ultimately a face criminal charges related to voter intimidation she spent over three and a half hours in a three week period\nYelled at a white liberal a strategist for about ten minutes who she felt was failing to take it a sufficiently seriously\nOr one more example among several uh she keeps kept inviting the a former LA up a homicide detective mark ... farm in on the air to talk about a ... a\nCriminal justice issues and to talk about the question of are African American relations with police officers he of course had to admit on the stand he had said racist things over the years during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited thing she welcomed among show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah what she felt was the acceptability a blackface\nNBC's nightly news with Lester Holt did a whole thing about this controversy on its OWN Network which seems to suggest something important making Kelly's colleague an attitude toward her\nWell for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor ah of any meat of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect the starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces and TV news\nWhich is really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\nWell it's hard not to look at this in light of you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet accuse her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing\nHer I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News she had to just play some popular colleagues\nAnd that her ratings themselves were mediocre and that even before all this happened uh she'd been discussing with a network another role there because she needed to get out of that show now the show's gone and she's a negotiating her eggs that as
