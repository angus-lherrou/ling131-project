in their country on the order of the crown prince of Saudi Arabia Mohammad bin some on which would prove very complicated for President Trump who has sought to develop closer ties with him\nDid President Trump in this interview outlined what the severe punishment might be as Saudi has proven to have been behind us\nShe did not uh and what he did do is outlined what it will not be and that is it will not be any sanctions that limit a arms sales or ban arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nA and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it it it wouldn't be a good idea to go that route some lawmakers have caught for that action but he said that that is not\nA what he plans to do although he did say that he was very upset by this story and that he he said he will take\nStrong action and he at least open the possibility he said that it could be Saudi Arabia's top leadership so we just don't know what the consequences of that would be\nYes so this was also in this interview the first time the president has really been pressed on climate change uh since he entered the White House what did he say he did it has his position changed

executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey as the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described your product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's greatest sources of the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lumps don't show them I'm social filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with whiskey how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six countries\nSo at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nIf if the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of of the bigger players um but uh in the past few years you're probably global sales have been out facing your domestic sales well\nAnd just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\nFrom the soldiers are still are but yes the I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with a free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the case\nFree trade agreements has become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and\nWell we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people did you converted from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and\nWe don't like any other state of the obvious this is a state that voted for President Trump has voted for Republicans a lot to death um\nWhen you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted ceilings\nAh [noise] I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nUh come up as an issue yet you made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us in the past few months he set up a meeting with a vice president Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means you can decades or he\nWill not for the non geographically minded right across right across the\nRiver yes uh and and he told us he understood exactly that this with the sushi could mean for us bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks to Nineteen sixty federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States unlike you know highly David sandwich announce it can move some production overseas we can't do that with bourbon you've got to make it here in America and if you want to sell it you better make in Kentucky\n[noise] beginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this hasn't been\nA I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they started looking and and from a price standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might loose\nOf a Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage from hurricane Michael which had Florida's panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable road than non functional phones and made life difficult for residents and rescue teams and for insurance adjuster\nWater just on the outskirts of forty miles across\n... works in the fried division of tower hill a Florida homeowner's insurance company over the weekend he caught a cell phone signal near Panama City there were still places it wasn't safe for his team to travel\nFor a situation like that we're relying on aerial that aside I got it\nAnd it wasn't just buildings that were devastated by the storm\nA lot of areas have lost a generation of timber poultry farms are hit pretty hard and caught industry is just devastated\nChris Chandler isn't adjuster with alpha insurance and Alabama he's been working in Houston county\nGOP was ready to be picked last week and a sixty Seventy a hundred miles per hour winds just blows it away last April source of income\nUs our livelihood early estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says the insurance companies will have substantial cost but Fitch also says the industry has quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so we had some good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now the communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler and Alabama says the damages upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your fingers and like everything\nBack to normal obviously that's not going to happen or you're you're you're talking to people that houses have destroyed all their belongings

win back the U.S house next month more than what's at stake for the Republicans in the midterms that story coming up around six thirty eight and a good morning to the times now six thirty on this Monday This is why PR\nI think there will be miserable and embolden there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be over because what if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts at opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump being base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know he's consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's at eighty or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we're dedicated to luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding gal\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern that means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly\nHave a narrow majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News

C. A.\nWhere insurers can no longer charge more or deny coverage because of a pre existing health condition remains popular\nAnd is problematic for Republicans who are against Obamacare\nAnd that road they'll keep saying look we're going to take care and protect you for existing conditions the problem is\nLike his office has basically put out short term policies that don't basically protect all pre existing conditions and have cash on them and your question was direct would you put your family and then he would not answer it he said we just need to have choice\nParker thought it was Rosendale weakest moment in the debate\nSo that was I think in a looming any moment in the entire debate demand Rosendale\nScrew up no but he didn't answer the question and I think it's because it's a challenging question for him to answer\nBy contrast Parker said it was tester strongest moment because it directly showed how he and his family were impacted by what turned out to be a poor choice to choose a short term policy and what happened when his fingers were cut off\nThe sponsors the Montana television network and Yellowstone public radio were the only ones to invite all three of the U.S Senate candidates for the state wide televised debate it will be rebroadcast at six tonight on why PR Jackie I'm an aka why PR news\nGood morning President Trump says there will be severe punishment if it turns out Saudi Arabia is responsible for the murder of a journalist\nThat punishment might be on MORNING EDITION from\nThe president told sixty minutes potential sanctions against the Saudis are complicated because he doesn't want to give up a weapons deal I'm Steve Inskeep\nUniversity He goes on trial today the school is facing charges that it discriminates against Asian American applicants\nHoles in the military exercises in Ukraine for the first time since Russia's power grab a country\nThat will share the story of a man he's turning his death experience at the\nRepublican campaign Monday on top of it\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm more of a cool when President Trump is scheduled to leave the White House this hour for a visit today to parts of Georgia and Florida hit by hurricane Michael\nAt least Seventeen people have died because of the storm in states from Florida to Virginia dozens of people are missing but authorities don't know if that's because people are unable to check in with their loved ones cell phone service is spotty in some areas especially in Florida's panhandle\nFEMA director Brock Long toward that region on Sunday\nNo doubt about it for the tremendous hit some of the worst damage I said in my career\nMeanwhile teams are going through rubble and some Florida coastal towns with heavy equipment and could ever dogs\nSaudi Arabia is vowing to retaliate if the U.S imposes sanctions over a prominent Saudi journalist who was missing and feared dead and beer is calling Dwyer reports there's growing diplomatic tension over ... ... feet\nPresident Trump has warned that Saudi Arabia will face consequences if it is behind from all showed the suspected murder this is Trump on CBS is sixty minutes we're going to have to say\nWe're going to get to the bottom of it and then we'll be severe punishment\nBut Saudi authorities didn't take long to answer with a warning of their own a government official pulled the kingdom state run news agency that they totally reject any diplomatic threats according to the official quote\nIf Saudi Arabia received any action will respond with greater action and the Saudis said the widespread allegations of murder are nothing more than ... ... they have yet to offer any official information about the whereabouts of the missing journalist college where NPR News\nIn Germany the political coalition partners of chancellor on ...

man was almost one of them now he's encouraging everyone to do something he had never done before Bram Sable Smith reports\nCurrently hinder lighter wasn't opposed to the flu shot he's not against vaccinations or anything like that\nI figured this is something that's dangerous to the elderly and the young not somebody who's healthy and in their thirties\nCharlie is thirty nine he's director of government affairs at the St Louis realtors association and like more than half of Americans he didn't get one he just didn't think he needed a flu shot as it turns out of his Raul\nWrong like fifty eight days in the hospital a week and a medically induced coma two surgeries three weeks in a nursing home that kind of wrong\nNine months after he first came down with the flu Charlie still getting medical checkups like with this nurse practitioner making Salinger\nFish are having grown up and running out and\nStill have a car but by and large sums of rooms don't she was actually the first person to realize something was really wrong back in January\nCharlie came in he already knew he had the flu actually his wife had two but Salinger was concerned he looked terrible she recommended Charlie go to the ER by the time he got there he had organ failure Charlie's flu Hitler to pneumonia and then to sepsis a life threatening complication that can cause Oregon's to fail\nCharlie was put in to medically induced coma for over a week\nHis father and brother flew in from out of town and we are told they may need to say good bye I knew when I woke up that I'd been near death his muscles had atrophied the doctors were worried about brain damage he needed a feeding tube to eat I basically was bed bound I had to have helped to move to a chair all of this from the flu\nIt's hard to say why hit Charlie so hard\nHis doctor Kevin king says sure there are things that can predispose people the complications from the flu a lack of immunity but Charlie was young and healthy it can affect anybody and it doesn't matter how healthy or going in and that's why king says the flu shot is important for everybody\nIt doesn't offer complete protection but if you get vaccinated and still get the

with him\nDid President Trump in this interview outline what the severe punishment might be a Saudi has proven to have been behind us\nShe did not uh and what he did do is outlined what it will not be and that is it will not be any sanctions that limit a arms sales or ban arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nA and he made clear that he felt like that would be a economically damaging to the U.S and therefore it wouldn't be a good idea to go that route some lawmakers have caught for that action but he said that that is not\nA what he plans to do although he did say that he was very upset by this story and

target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nSame reasons why we have the world's first horse was at the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky system lumps don't show them I'm show filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world was with how global business is this more and more so now\nThan it ever has been ah we export Kentucky bourbon to about a hundred twenty six centuries so at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export\nOf the bigger players um but uh in the past ... years you're you probably are global sales have been out pacing\nYour domestic sales while and just to just to be clear on that fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over\n... from the ... but yes they I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global markets really increase ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements that well a ... agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under threat will\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know ... are starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nUh we don't like the options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it\nSo you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people that you've converting from scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profits back a which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so the lot of different ways out of this and\nWe don't like any other state of the obvious this is a state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot that ask 'em\nWhen you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings\nOr [noise] I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why we know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to\nWith you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nAh it come up as an issue yet you made an issue like an election yeah it has come up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us\nIn the past few months he set up a meeting with a vice president Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows ... decades or he will not for the non geographically minded right across right across the river yes uh\nAnd and he told us he understood exactly that this would this district mean for us bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else\nYou can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called Burman thinks that that's a federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous\nWhat were you got to make it here in American if he wants to sell you better make the beginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been\nA I think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers or do we prefer to do voice for years sadly if they started looking in my standpoint if\nThe bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose for generations Barrett\nGregory of Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage from hurricane Michael which had Florida's panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable rode the non functional phones have made life difficult for residents and rescue teams and for insurance adjuster ...\nJust on the outskirts of forty miles across\n... works in the fraud division of tower

winds just blows it a lot less sleep all social drinker so lovely to the\nEarly estimate suggests this hurricane caused billions of dollars of damage Fitch Ratings says that insurance companies will have substantial costs but it's also says the industry is quote well positioned to absorb the losses\nAnd yeah that's what insurance companies are supposed to do but in Florida in particular every big storm raises worries that the industry will just fail\nAfter Hurricane Andrew in Nineteen Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas so it's good news the analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are still facing a long difficult recovery Chandler in Alabama says the damage is upsetting\nYou wish that you could just snap your fingers

number three\nMost ... and they have much time to Chicago and New York and I'm used to sending out\nResumes for New Yorkers through Monday nights at nine o'clock [noise]\nI think there will be miserable and emboldened there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be emboldened because if the Democrats taken by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts that opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says Doug high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party former\nHouse Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know these consistently at forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause he's eighty or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nAnd that becomes the over it and go and if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern that means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security\nAccomplishments that eluded them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News\nRight here on yellow stone public radio good morning it's eight forty two were about nine minutes away from the

care was just one of the topics where Montana's US Senate candidates disagreed during Saturday's televised debate Yellowstone Public Radio's Jackie Yamanaka has more\nState insurance commissioner Matt Rosendale was asked about the Republican short term insurance plan these plans were originally intended to be temporary with coverage of up to three months the intent was for people in between jobs are for those who briefly needed inexpensive insurance\nLast August the Trump Administration issued new rules to allow Americans to buy these plant for up to twelve months at a time and the ability to renew them and they circumvented the Affordable care act's coverage requirements\nRosendale was among those who praised the move as widening choice so he was asked to read the debate if these plans are so great when he pledged to buy one to cover his own family Rosendale said these plans give Montanans choice but didn't answer the question so he was asked it again\nWhat I say Jackie is that we need to have a full range of options of health care plans for everyone to to make a decision what is best for that is not a federally run down system for the latest to make a decision about what is best for you and what does\nLevel of coverage based on their ability to pay open enrollment this year is from November first through December fifteenth Senator Jon tester said junk insurance plans are

to have it when we needed more news it wasn't there if you buy junk insurance for the commissioners promoting\nYou'll have nothing when you get sick because it doesn't cover pre existing conditions\nThat said the only thing is these plans are cheap libertarian Rick Breckenridge said the constitution doesn't say anything about the role of the federal government when it comes to insurance\nOur business is to um among the federal government not to make sure when I was health care\nBreckenridge said as a veteran his health insurance comes from the Veterans Administration\nAnd
