thing you'd find that a big Himalayan magnet school they say you know [noise]\nWhat do you say take take my oxygen but not too far\nBut the the other guy Garland what in fact is yep some\nWell yes and is when you answer\nA question with a question\nLike what time is it and you say where [laughter]\n\nFollowed by another question in my view on a punch in the mouth [laughter]\nYou know the last we mourn the passing of the great Yogi Berra who was once asked Yogi what time is that he says you mean now [laughter]\nYeah ... is either answering a question where the question or it's a ah it's somebody learning to be a short book or something else what is it very well for a minute I\nThought that the ups and um\nIs it just depends on that makes you agree to everything [laughter]\n[laughter] but then I read the card um\nAnd you know it's interesting because you remember Carolyn had a ... a word called charity that she said was this a secret compartment I says one of those words that should exist you know and like when you cut your hands to like drink water and the amount that you have in your hands that's that's the ups and\nSo it's a sort of primitive unit of measure\nWhat'd you can what you're going to hold in your cup tan or really cheap bar\nAnd it gave me a full poor [laughter]\nSo it's either a handful of baloney [noise]\nAnswering a question whether question or in a ... which of those definitions is the real one Carolyn pretend\nOh I Am so surprise nobody went to anything Scandinavian\n[laughter] [noise]\nReally don't know what to think I mean I I kept listening for something that would make sense [laughter]\nAll along and they they I Know I Know I I Hope springs eternal but I'm\nCarolyn we ... we will support\nYour decision I Will tell you something when I play this game at home I always just wrong\nNow that you're sitting up here what do you think [laughter]\nI kind of any of them are on my gut feeling is answering a question the question I have no logical explanation [noise] so if\nI'm not I'm not blaming hope you decided to gas will say do we looked like we\nDo [laughter] [noise]\nIs badger final answer [laughter]\nDoes it have to be [laughter]\nFor enjoyment said we will go with Garland\nOkay girls' team Garland which you the answer they say is answering a question with the question is that in fact\nThe real definition of ups now why would you go and do that [laughter]\nFun of 'em [laughter] like that law it's\nWrong ten boys regardless team [noise]\nBlah [noise]\nSmoke you're saying the the real answer is is it a a an apprentice sherpa\nJumped [noise]\nOr is it a real handful\n\nI've seen pretty close to being a tie Tony is that you\nKnow but I Would like to thank the scorekeeper for testing at you\n[laughter] [noise]\nSo so unfair we were not allowed to utilize our score\nHe didn't have to be right\nI think if you have places\nSo it really is the water amounts in a in a cup and Marine Corps and the amount one can hold in

to\nGive her one point so far no the come on guys think of this was a\nRumor how how much further afar they or do we advance the cause of\nActually you're on the right track I I guess but and um as far we'll continue our geographical and further is not her\nInnocence yes I'm going to land a lot about time and are there is a place\nIs exactly right and I will [noise]\nFarther than I thought no\nMeans we're just in in space in\nJupiter is Marta there from earth and Mars further refers to the extension of to an extension of time or degree as in upon further reflection oh\nTony help us clarify the difference between that time I was just an entomologist well uh\nLet's see and etymology ... is one who studies the derivation of words and an entomologist is one is that he ends in other
