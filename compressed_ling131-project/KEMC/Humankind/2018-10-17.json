Louis foundation\n\nWe can have an injury to our dignity can be trampled upon it can be wounded [noise]\nBut it can't be taken away from us it can't be stripped out of us it's the entire world that's the substance of our inner world\nThe important in a conflict of honoring your opponents dignity kind of maintaining your own you're listening to humankind I'm David Freud\nWe've all seen how adversaries whether a military battlefield or in any election campaign or even in a family dispute sometimes try to degrade each other it's an all too common tactic and it trivializes a fundamental truth\nThat all people have an essential value are entitled to be treated with common decency and Donna Hicks a conflict mediator sometimes brought in to stimulate dialogue in world hotspots has noticed the deep wounds people carry when their human dignity is not respected\nBecause I'm a psychologist\nI tend to listen for what isn't being spoken at the table when we were doing um dialogues between parties in it honestly it didn't matter where it was whether it was Israel Palestine or\nA dialogue in Sri Lanka or a dialogue in in Colombia I observed the same thing and that is that\nThe parties were talking about all of the objective issues all the political issues that needed to be resolved and that needed to have some kind of a compromise in order to get past and to have a settlement or such as\nI'll be talking about the refugees and what's gonna happen to all the people who were displaced in Nineteen forty eight what are we going to do about them where we're going to put the capital of the country and I I call those the objective political issues but at the same time I would also\nSee something that was happening that what I call is it is a is it was a conversation that took place under the table\nKind of the unspoken ... unspoken conversation and and it was this undercurrent that went and again I think of it as as under the table because it was the they were these emotional reactions that we're so powerful that they could hijack a really good\nSet of ideas to settle some of these what I call political issues and yet the minute one of these what I now called dignity violations took place and this emotional reaction would take over\nThe you know the conversation it ... everything would stop\nDonors Hicks is the author of dignity she's an associate at the weather heads the center for international affairs at Harvard and also teachers at Columbia University\nShe says when someone tries to assault your sense of dignity the experiences so primal which can trigger a series of automatic reactions as if your body feels that is under threat of physical violence\nThis can happen Hicks is even for people with those six skin\nIt's not that you don't feel it right it's not that you don't if you're one ... one of these people who can just brush it off and say well you know at his problem the fact that you still have a reaction in your body the body still reacts but\nThe difference is in the way you interpret what that event means for you personally\nSo and and this is this is a lot of the work that I Do with people when I Do dignity coaching is to get them to realize that when somebody violates your dignity you're going to have a reaction you're going to feel it about the meaning that you make of it\nYou know what you do with that\nIs really dependent on how how secure you are in your own sense of worthiness this is a big this is a lot of the work that folks that I focus on right here is getting people to agree interpret pick us the research is really clear\nThat if you can interpret the sorts of events in a way that re frames that away from thinking oh if that person violated me that I must be unworthy that's the major flaw in the thinking that we want to\nGet around or the therefore I must retaliate\nConflicts or so deeply entrenched because the work is hard but the alternative to doing the work is constant pain and crisis so poor that life offers those those choices [noise]\n\nYou've worked with Archbishop Desmond tutu who served as the Anglican bishop of South Africa and was winter in Nineteen eighty four of the Nobel Peace prize\nI Wonder what you may have observed in his men are and how he has interacted with people that gave him the evident qualities he has a a peacemaker\nWell I I Would say that first and foremost he has a very clear sense of his worthiness he doesn't have doubts about\nHis sense of value and worth he's a very religious man obviously and he's\nHe is you know his connection to his two to his creator is um it's it's as um it's as strong as a a bond that I mean I've ever seen in any religious person so he's really clear about his his own divinity and its own sense of worthiness and his own\nAnd yet at the ... so that makes him very solid I it ... it seems but then there's another half of that equation that's half of it but the other part that I think is equally is moving to me is that he understands that he has a sense of humility\nPrevents him from being narcissistic you know because a lot of people have it think that they're worthy and grandiose and they're wonderful and their kings and queens and all of that a lot of people can have that characteristic but they don't have the humility that balances that sense of value in that sense of worth\nSo he it's it's it's in that balance between knowing that he's no better than any of the rest of us and yet recognizing that he is a you know a child of\nGod can you give us an example of of\nEither of those house\nSo we're feeling these um um encounters between victims or perpetrators in the conflict in Northern Ireland is just a few years ago and what we did was we had let's just say for example\nWho the Iranian nearly killed and we were we were facilitating this discussion between these two men and in the hope that we'll we could achieve some kind of healing and recognition and and a sense of reconciliation between um between\nThese two men but as they represent the two communities in Northern Ireland and so at the end of oh gosh it must have been eight hours of taping of these conversations between these two men\nAt the end they ended they had a beautiful reconciliation and it was really quite extraordinary we're all moved and so the archbishop closed the session this day long session and he said\nWe are humbled by you we are we are so grateful to you that you you know major cell phone or pull in this way and that you were able to you know be here together in this most respectful way and he said\nWe you know you are we have you too thank you were you were magnificent here\nAnd you made us all a bigger people by watching what you what you've done and how you've managed to reconnect\nI'd like to ask a little bit if you're comfortable [noise]\nAbout your own story whether [noise] conflict has been a part of your personal life and if that's the reason you're drawn into\nThis war without a doubt the truth is I was a I had a difficult ah upbringing I experienced a lot of now what I call a witnessing of ways in which my parents were really quite um disrespectful toward each other they fought all the time they were\nYou know they were ... from ... different classes my mother was um\nA polish immigrant and my father was from a you know upper class\nCommunity here in the northeast and it was um it was just stunning for me as a child to witness and to experience the\nThe uh the horror of seeing one's parents who knew you know as a child I loved them both but yet to see how brutally they were treating one another and you know oftentimes we'd get my sisters and I would get caught and that cross fire as well and one of ...\nAnd when you tell a story that way\nBy sort of reliving it and telling it out loud in front of an audience\nYou can't help but be affected in the audience by hearing the story [noise]\nJust ... to ... book dignity Archbishop Desmond tutu described to me is that in ... God given right of all human\nOr equal indignity and two two points out that if a person who's lost their sense of dignity is always possible through humility to regain [noise]\nWe've been talking about honoring the dignity of others I Want to take this step\nDeeper what does it mean to honor one's own dignity in other words to act in a dignified manner what are the challenges for us of acting with personal dignity\nWell I think our first task before anything else is really becoming comfortable with the fact that we are valuable and that we are worthy no matter what\nJust being comfortable with that and I have to tell you a story\nThe story that may help me understand this and a deep way and that was when Nelson Mandela got out of Robben Island after twenty seven years of being imprisoned under the apartheid regime he came out number one he didn't harbor any anger or hostility toward any of his white fellow South Africans\nBut he also told this story about when he first got there um and when he first was imprisoned and he felt that he had to observe\nThe behavior of the guards because he knew in order to survive he had to know what the guards were up to and the first day he recognized that what the cards tried to do was stripped the dignity of the political prisoners they tried to really make them feel worthless\nAnd\nMandela said I was so relieved to figure that out and thought to myself relieved how could you be relieved and he said because what I realized was that\nNobody has charge my dignity my dignity is in my hands alone and I might be somebody might assault my dignity it I might have been injured\nBut at the end of the day I Am the captain of my soul and this is what the movie Invictus was about if you if you saw that meant to him yeah the movie that Matt Damon play because they did the poem Invictus\nReally helped him because the last couple of lines where I Am the captain of my soul and the master of my faith or something like that\nAnd so he really believed that and I and I say to people self care and self dignity is really the first step because if you don't know your own sense of worth and really have that in a in a secure place within your inner inner world then you're going to take steps\nDr strong point do you see dignity as something inherent to a person that cannot actually be taken away by the actions of others or Ken someone's behavior harm the dignity of another\nWell our dignity can definitely be harmed just like our physical bodies can be harmed right we can ... we're vulnerable to having it bones broken into being cut being you know wounded in many all different ways and are in fact you know you think about it all our legal system all our laws are based on not violating the physical\nSpace the physical bodies of of of you know people write but\nLet's go back to the principal or to you later by Nelson Mandela that he realized nobody can be the captain of my soul to attempt to buy a guard at Robben Island in South Africa under a partied cannot Rob me of my dignity so which is\nSo All right to ... to ... I'm really glad you made this distinction because number one our dignity can be assaulted we can have an injury to our dignity can be trampled upon it can be wounded\nBut it can't be taken away from us it can't be stripped out of us and and this is what Nelson Mandela has taught us that there is a distinction about needing to\nCare for the wounds to our dignity we can definitely be haven't wounded but it is never taken away because it's it's part of who it's in our DNA it's our inner it's the inner world that's the substance of our inner world\nYou know we were all born with dignity but we weren't all born knowing how to act like it\nI weren't born knowing how to act like it\nSo what are the challenges to a person\nWho does not want to betray his own dignity\nWell you know you go in my book I I have ten things called the ten temptations number one you don't take the bait when somebody comes that you\nDon't take the bait but that's but you're fighting a historical an evolutionary legacy that legacy to want to to protect yourself under all circumstances\nSo don't let the bad behavior of others govern your own behavior don't let the exactly\nYes and another one is look if you do something wrong don't try to save face don't lie don't cover up don't deceive yourself because you know at the end and this is almost always happens especially with public figures in the end\nThey they they get exposed the truth gets exposed anyway eventually the truth gets ...\nYou if we if we had in charge of our dignity we would try to control that impulse to cover up to to deceive ourselves to deceive the public\nSo after doing this work facilitating dialogues and thinking a lot about this in researching and writing about it do you feel that you have grown more sensitive to the dignity of others and that it's harder now to violate that\nOh yeah I ... without a doubt um\nI I think what I've what what's grown than most to me is my um capacity and my ability to um to see other\nPeople when they're in those I'm feeling victimized by others you know to just recognize I can I can pick it up in instant in a nanosecond when somebody's feeling their dignity violated\nWill I can only hope that I you know way if I if I [laughter] your dignity during this wonderful conversation\nWe've been talking with Donna Hicks she is facilitate dialogue seeing conflict regions from the middle east to Northern Ireland she's also an associate at the weather hid Center for international affairs at Harvard doctor Hicks is the author of dignity\nYou're listening to humankind I'm David Freud\nStudio recording Tony ... rose and tore assistance from Thomas royal and Kathy Graham webmaster Brian Jones special thanks to [noise]\nEr program is produced by human media association with W GBH Boston in ...

executive producer is David fried Berg this it's human kind [noise]\nComing up in a minute on the second half of human kind a conversation with Bradley University professor Robert foolish you studied a large sector of Americans who regard themselves as spiritually inclined but who do not affiliated with organized religion\nHow do spiritual but not religious people explore the great questions life death and meaning when humankind continues animal [noise]\n\n\n\nIn some way or the you know gosh I I probably going to answer yes for that to be on it to be truthful I I feel a little bit I'm\nTroubled by answering that because it seems a little but I I have since that I have since this real spark of\nI mean a as a professor and teacher of course I prefer people who were asking questions and don't feel they have all fixed dancer so in that sense of answering yes to that question I Do sense that spark that alive as a freshness because it is fresh and new and you know of a possible criticism of this um there is a sense that\nThese individuals change their beliefs more often I I used to laugh and call them convertibles they they easily convert from one you know you you you run into them on the street one week and I'm into ... high and and as you run into them six months later well now I'm really into yoga in six months so there there's a convertible as a constant changing\nAnd and and and the risk of being ...\n... you know we can say is is religion about a destination or journey and and the spiritual but not religious it's definitely a journey and it's a Catholic and it's what I said about the ... just wanting to experiment and to try on and to see how this works in my life\nAnd for others the persons who are more comfortable in a religious congregation religion has become a home something is they found works or at least they they sense that this works\nIt could seem that someone who chooses to embark on a spiritual odyssey outside of traditional religion is direction was\nWhen in fact for many people whom I've met and talked with who describe themselves that way they feel a fervent sense of direction it's just not certain kinds of direction right\nAnd they but I still think there's this what we I like to use the word ... meaning I'm open to still discovering more truth and that's very different than\nAre necessary and it's a closed book and I think that is a is a huge difference you'd actually scares\nMe when I meet people who feel like they've reached the end of a journey um and that everything is now static and frozen because that's sort of\nDeadly to well it can be too because it ... the ... the quest for more knowledge is also the quest to be inclusive and to recognize the validity of others points of view and\nI think we're all aware when does the moment calm that religion goes from what is best about the human spirit and most about what is our open and loving and approach to reality to embrace it in a ferment and want to nourish and strengthen it to be coming where it comes to read\nUm stiffen her back to fight and to become um intolerant Mm\nWe're talking with Robert Mueller Radley university religion professor and author of spiritual but not religious\nYou're listening to humankind I'm David Freud\nWas asked what what sets people wanting to explore spirituality and to to go\nLooking for the road less traveled it's really comes down to two factors and one is um an inability to intellectually except\nJust the tradition that you were exposed to early in life as the one that that has a monopoly on religious truth and the second is I think a desire for something that speaks more deeply to you experiential\nCan I sense God can I feel God I didn't mean not not just the the pages of a him book yes absolutely do I have\nJust as though in my friendships with people\nI I had moments where I feel this connection with other people that makes my relationship with her or him meaningful do I have that sense of relationship with God\nAnd if you have a sense that in your institution upbringing you you're in for it and this sets you so there's both an experiential you're earning and an intellectual you're earning and it would be stronger in one person than another but those two are really\nThe main things that put people on a quest or a surge if not in the context of traditional organized religion\nPeople in this spiritual but not religious group express their spirituality\nYeah it it's many ways and not necessarily in\nActivities that you can point to is it oh that is an absolutely religious or spiritual or spiritual practice spirituality can be something that informs our activities in any walk of life and in volunteerism and let me point this out [noise]\nIf I Want to stick with some nice easy generalizations I Would say religions comfortable with an idea of God as a Supreme Being who rules reality from above conventionally conceived of as a male a king of kings a judge but a father who art in heaven\nOr a male Supreme Being who rules reality from above\nSpirituality tends to see God in less personal more impersonal terms at Holy Spirit and an a spirited nutritious reality from within\nNow in the first model the religion model sin and immoral behavior is breaking the commandments that got so that if we believe that a Bible contains the gods said this this this and you break that you're in sent the other models are more spiritual model looks it\nGod as an imminent spiritual force trying to nurse reality from within and what is sinful is any behavior that porch the full expression of life what is a spiritual practice is anything that nurses the full expression of life it's a very spiritual activity might be\nWorking with young children might be an helping profession it might be doing counseling it might be just being a good friend to listen and to help a a an individual through a of a moment of crisis in their lives it might be concerned with ecological issues it might be social justice issues\nSo things like gender oppression racial oppression class oppression are actually anti God if God is viewed as a a an imminent spiritual force nourishing reality from within\nSo many spiritual practices are about just enriching life\nAnd allowing life to grow and develop so it's a little bit hard to point and say oh because in religion we can say well one hour a week in this building that's a religious practice and under the more spiritual practice um commitment to the reference sacredness of life and and what isn't that will protect that life and then again protected nourish it\nUm it can be all throughout all of our activities what about the people who attend\nA church or worship service once a week on a Sunday or\nWe're faith tradition may be and who nevertheless aspire to and sometimes do carry that feeling with them through the rest of the week people for whom their religious devotion is not confined to an hour or so in a house of worship well\nAbsolutely and I'm sometimes we don't see this aspect of American religious organizations enough there has certainly been in the last ten years or so a a greater vocal expression may have been there all along certainly ... members of all of our religious congregation apple stewards of God's creation\nAnd felt that it was incumbent upon them to witness to their faith by being good stewards of nature stewards of society and we go back to the great\nUm he grew profits um I'd say a Jeremiah um et cetera telling us that religion isn't just a one hour a week practice in a in a temple that it it's how we treat the poor that's how we treat the oppressed and its its witnessing to God's creation\n\nThe polarity between formal at hearings to religion and informal personal spirituality\nHas existed since the founding of America in fact historians point out that contrary to what we might think most people living in the early United States we're not even churchgoers perhaps no one in bodies these American cross currents more than Thomas Jefferson\nAuthor of the declaration of independence he was actually most proud of his role in drafting the Virginia act for establishing religious freedom\nThomas ... percent it's so interesting because he had the rational list this worldly thinking impulses that we think of as non belief\nBut he was very inspired by we ... we live in a universe it's not just to avoid it it's not a vacuum there is a creation here and the grandeur of it certainly suggests an uh an intelligent architect\nAnd uh so that there was a reference for life and for the life source even if he couldn't fill in all the details my reading\nOf Thomas Jefferson is that he did believe in the existence of God he just wasn't too thrilled by the strictures and most structures of organized religion ... exactly", "show_name": "Humankind", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "17"}
