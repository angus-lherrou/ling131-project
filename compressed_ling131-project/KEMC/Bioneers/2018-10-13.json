hearing moment in reconciliation\nAnd the purpose of the story is to say speaking truth to our experience and getting some kind of acknowledge and accountability\nHas profound effect and brings us into a place of moving through it into a higher level and being able to come into forgiveness often as Elaine did\n\nTruth and reconciliation by speaking truth to our experience and by seeking recognition and accountability\nWhere better to raise gender truth and reconciliation than in South Africa where it is estimated that a woman or girl is raped every twenty six seconds\nBricks and keeping learned what was often expected for boys and girls growing up in a township in South Africa as a boy your mother would fear you become a gangster as a girl your mother would fear you'd be raped at a very young age\nWilliam keeping recalls the story of one young man changed by hearing a woman in a workshop she had been raped and was working through her own trauma preparing to confront her attacker in court\nShe told her story and graphic detail which was very rare and none of the minute ever heard such a story\nAnd it took all they could do to stay in the room and one of the men who is one of our trainees and it pretty astute young men mid twenties was quite shaken as everyone was in a certain way and he said I\nI don't know how to be a man anymore he said I feel traumatized\nHis very identity as a man was being transformed\nAnd she was that his heart had been broken open and he was now carrying\nPart of the pain that this woman was carrying on her own and that women sense as a group carry all on their own in terms of that level of fear that women live in from the day they're born\nThat men don't live in in the same way and now he was carrying that with her and that was transforming is very identity as a man in South African culture there\nMen are socialized into that way of being with women and not even realizing that there's another way to be so there's a whole confusion of that sort of aggressive sexuality with being a man\nAnd that's why it's so transformative for them to actually hear the effects of that kind of sexuality but there's no foreign for that to happen so this work is radically transformative just by creating a forum where men can truly here women's pain and vice versa\nThan bricks and keeping found their forum suddenly getting much bigger\nWe were invited by the deputy minister of health who later became the deputy speaker of parliament in her vision was to have this work introduced to all members of parliament and so we worked with a group of about thirty many of them were workers in the parliament and then we had a few employees who were actually members of parliament\nIronically the week that it started the chief whip of the a and see was charged with sexual inappropriate behavior towards one of his interest and there was a huge crisis in parliament itself and several of the people who are supposed to be in a workshop drop out to fight the battle that was the emerging in parliament around the sexual violation for which he was eventually can\nWell I mean than men while the workshop what's going on the woman who had charged him with texting people in our\nWorkshop about what was going on and she was in hiding so it was quite a dramatic whole drama that was unfolding right as we were doing this work so it's kind of highlighted the importance of the word\nBut that was a watershed event for us because at the end of the ritual where the men ceremonies that women ended with an unbelievably beautiful declaration so this is the declaration\nOf the men to the women\nThe bonds of humanity have been broken we acknowledge that we have shared in the unfair and unjust advantage\nThat is upset the creators intended balance of human relationships for love companionship and cooperation we further acknowledged that we have been complicit in breaking the intended dream of equality\nSo now we come forward to say to you we're sorry we have from that we want to start a new and we asked will you accept our offer to take responsibility as we committed ourselves to live out\nAnd challenging support all men everywhere to live and work for gender equality and thereby seek reconciliation\nI mean the women were weeping they were stunned\nVery beautiful moment and coming at such a high level of political engagement these men were leaders in the country and a beautiful\nWilliam keeping and Cynthia bricks said with the greatest male privilege is not any of the social advantages afforded to men and patriarchal society but rather for men to participate in dismantling the patriarchal system itself\nThis was symbolized in this case by toppling a stack of chairs men proactively deconstructing male privilege and partnering with women to build a\nBeloved community across nations races and cultures [noise]\nWhen we return we explore ways people from western and indigenous cultural perspectives are restoring the balance of the masculine feminine and creating an outcome of the heart\nThis is the marriage of the sun and moon the truth and reconciliation of gender [noise]\nI mean Harvey you're listening to the pioneers revolution from the heart of nature\nTo explore all available by a news radio shows and video programming please visit buying a New Year's data orgy\nAttitudes towards gender or changing radically from the majority acceptance of gay marriage and the U.S to the emerging eh LGBT rights movement growing numbers of people are seeing gender identity is more fluid and inclusive of differences\nIt's a new wants to continue on each of us has both feminine and masculine qualities\nWhen I think of gender I think of all aspects of who I Am as a human being what does my mind to say about gender what is my body say about gender what does my spirit have to say about gender and what is my emotions say about gender and they're not all one in the same\nLA Rouge leads gender reconciliation business\nPassed on to her and her husband in a formal apprenticeship she's a contributing editor to community building renewing spirit and learning in business her journey has been deeply personal and began unexpectedly on the cliffs of Big Sur California probably ...\nI was born into a\nFifth generation farm family in Iowa the second daughter into a family that desperately wanted a male\nAnd when I was about twenty seven years old I found myself sitting in a\nHot tub at ESL and doing an exercise about what I feel guilty about and I found myself saying I feel guilty for being female [noise]\nI was so grateful for that moment because for the first time in my life I Begin to understand something about who I was and something about the forces that I had been wrestling with it I couldn't make sense of because I never seemed to fit\nIt's probably been somewhere in my twenties I discovered that the two questions of my life in terms of what I came here to learn this lifetime the first one is what is it to be a woman in this time\nBecause I felt they knew much more about being male than I did about being female drawing up the way that I did I was a tomboy I was my father son in many many ways\nThat world made sense to me the world of the feminine the world of women was a mystery that I had some very painful and powerful initiation into overtime\nIn the face of mystery probably Rouge asked herself a question\nHow do I feel\nThe hatred of the feminine that is within myself\nHow do I feel\nThe immigration of the feminine how do I even see it\nHow does it even
