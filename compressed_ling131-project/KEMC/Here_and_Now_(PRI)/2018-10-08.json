book betraying big brother the feminist awakening in China she says she hasn't seen as social movement this powerful since the Tiananmen Square protests of Nineteen eighty nine ...\nLately assessed thanks so much for having me here nice\nTo talk to you tell me first the focus of the book is the feminist five these are five young women in China who are at the core of your story um the theme that you present is the political is the personal give us examples of how among these five women\nAre the personal became the foundation of their activism and also who they are what they did\nRight so um these five women became known as the feminist five after they were jailed in twenty Fifteen for planning to celebrate International Women's day\nUm and it wasn't just those five women there were a lot of women in different cities across China who were planning to handouts stickers about sexual harassment on subways and buses but before they even carried out their plan the police in in all of these Chinese cities just carried out a sweeping around ever rats\nAnd focused on the five women the feminist five brought them to Beijing and detained them for thirty seven days before there was a huge global outcry that resulted in their beliefs are being detained for what is the ... well I'm well this is this is what was so outrageous about it because\nI'm the authorities were kind of feeling around for something to charge them with and and and the end it was something I can too disturbing the social order\nUm that the the reason why the arrest and jailing of these women just galvanize so many so many people and the feminist community inside China and globally is that it was just so outrageous because of all they wanted to do was to handout stickers raising awareness about sexual harassment\nSo okay so I Want to find out why that was such a threat to the government to uh just doing something like you had to go stickers or making T shirts and handing them out against sexual harassment but first what gave what was the impetus for these particular women the film is fine\nUm well I mean among the feminist five quite a few of them um had suffered abuse and their personal lives well growing up um for example the\nBut at the hands of her father I'm from a very early age and her uncle\nUm some of the other activists had also encountered sexual abuse and and it wasn't just these five women are a lot of the women who um who are have been involved in the women's rights movement\nHas personally been um victims of sexual assault or a very severe domestic violence and that has given these women and ten cents a personal commitment to fight back\nOne of the of some of his five a month for instance had to have a master's degree to teach high school whereas men and joined only need a bachelor's degree you know there'll be some people who remember mostly don't use a famous adage women hold up half the sky or in his pronouncement decades ago the men and women in China\nOr equal without ever the case and if so what happened to that\n[noise] yes well I mean in the early communist era and there were a lot of changes brought about for women because I mean even even though women still had to assume the double burden of working in the workforce and and and then taking care of children and cooking and the and\nThe fact is that the Communist Party mobilized women and said that they assigned them jobs either in the cities or said that they had to go work in the fields and so that brought women out of the con find moments of of the household\nUm instead of female labor force participation was really on the highest in the world and in the early communist era and that and and the propaganda the rhetoric at the time was very much that women can do whatever men can do um and so even today you see the legacy of that early communist hero because\nChina's seemed female labor force participation is still relatively high compared to a lot of other countries although it's it's really falling a dramatically with the onset of a market reforms\nUm but but now in the last couple of decades you've seen a huge resurgence of gender inequality as I'm with the dismantling of the planned economy so many women who have been laid off relative to men and the gender gap is is rising exponentially in so many ways and that's\nA big part of why this feminist movement has grown is because of that dissatisfaction with with this huge gender gap that women you know have to put themselves behind men and so many young women today feel that that's really profoundly unfair\nFascinating because on the face of it I mean what these women are doing is actually in line with\nThe Chinese government's expressed belief and gender equality um that if you look at the bigger situation of China now the economic growth economic miracle of the past few decades is basically over so they're slowing economic growth\nThe workforce is shrinking and birth rates are falling and the population is aging drastically so the government has decided that it really needs to try to boost birth rates and it's very aggressively pushing\nA particularly educated young women into getting married and having more babies\nUm but the the message of feminism is completely opposite to what the Chinese government is trying to do\nBecause these young feminists are telling other women no you don't have to get married you don't have to have babies if you don't want to but I'm In many ways I Believe that that that sexism and massage any and the subjugation of women pushing women to return to these traditional roles of beautiful wife and mother\nUm all of that is at the core of what I called China's patriarchal authoritarianism how was the Japanese government pushing the well I mean it's doing a lot of different things first of all there is a very aggressive propaganda\nUm that that is telling women that they have to hurry up and get married and have babies before they turn thirty otherwise if they wait too long\nThen their babies will have birth defects um and so I've seen for example people's daily articles which is a official Chinese state media that women in college shouldn't wait to get pregnant\nUm they should seize on their so called best childbearing years and they can have a baby or even to while they're still in college so propaganda is a big part of it but then there's also policies um says that the um [noise] much publicized so called one child policy recently ended\nSo China officially now has a to child policy it's being encouraging are trying to push\n'em particularly Han Chinese couples to have two children but in spite of this really dramatic policy change on on population the birth rate still fell last year and this poses a huge crisis for the Chinese government\nAs it looks to the future um and so there's\nVery traditional gender norm I'm pushing women into the into the home to become baby breeders on the one hand but then you have this enormous I'll swelling of I'm particularly educated young women who are pushing back\nIn every way um and so what is unfolding right now isn't just an extraordinary moment in China's history\nAnd the Internet played a big role as well more and more women went on line and we're sharing their stories but how does that work with all the censorship going on in China will well this is what is so fascinating because in spite of the intense Internet censorship would just become incredibly sophisticated\nThat these women are ... they're so imaginative that they find ways of circulating their message and getting around the censorship censorship\nI mean just to give one example there was one activist who I'm Wendy hash tag made too as being very heavily censored this one young woman came up with the idea of using him oh jeez for rice and Bonnie which which is me tool in Chinese which sounds like me too\nAnd so that was one way or that they were able to gain a get around the censorship for a while um another all the government called him right right but then they're continually playing this game of cat and mouse and coming up with new ways to get around the censorship could they have done this without the Internet [noise]\nFunding\nFor here and now comes from the listeners have W.

Shaun he's of Middle Eastern descent and his sudden stardom on the basketball court\nHas some ugly consequences Sarah affairs on as a child of parents who came to us from Iran I asked her what she and that student be John have in common\nWe went to a similar high schools um he doesn't go to my high school it's fiction but we do go to a predominantly\nWhite an affluent a private school as you did I did which I was very lucky and privileged and so we have that experience I play basketball until it was clear I wasn't going to get much taller so should um\nGive it up we both love comic books\nAnd we both like women but have difficulty talking to them I've gotten a little better but he um he needs a little help he is of mixed heritage his dad is Jordanian um his mother is a Persian but grew up here so you place to be John directly on the basketball\nAnd kind of rises in in social status very quickly but then things change what happens in a school someone doesn't like all the newfound attention he's getting and I'm One of his colleagues since right\nRight and heat you don't know who sent the email 'em but has created a photo shop image of him to look like a\nTerrorist holding an AK forty seven was the best chance face right All right yeah so shocked on yeah and uh has sent it anonymously to the student body so the school is trying to figure out who has sent to his mother and other parents are are very upset and I'm wanting to figure out how to fix the culture of the school and make sure he's OK\nOther students are that are behind him an allies sort of inadvertently want to make him a poster child for something and he just wants to\nBe a kid and so he's basically saying you know look I don't really want to be um the poster boy for international politics right [laughter]\nAnd people have all sorts of rumors and gossip about him you know some people saying like well where is he really from and what do we know about his family and\nAll these kinds of questions all at once that he's never had to deal with and shouldn't have to I Know kids should really have to do do you have to deal with it I sort of did this thing where when nine eleven happened and everyone was very scared\nI didn't like what I was hearing about sort of all this rage like hate crimes on the radio and\nSo I sort of made it a point to say please don't get caught up in racial profiling and the sort of thing and then when I wrote an opinion piece for the school paper they called me Arab American which I'm not not that there's anything wrong with that and you're Muslim I grew up pretty secular but yeah technically but then I had to write a follow up to that opinion piece\nSaying that's really great but I'm actually Persian Americans and this is the same as equating a Japanese person to a Korean person where so it was just kind of I think people just didn't know what to do and then started asking not invasive questions but sort of like they'd never really thought of\nIt before you called us polite racism and this is something that the John faces as well with what's the difference between polite and ... where he says I think most people get the impression that you know racism terrible anyway and there's no really fully polite racism\nBut there's a difference between painting something on your house or throwing a rock and a window\nVersus a micro aggression or saying something\nHottest version in the book realize that to understand\nI think he's he's had to deal with sort of ... and for that he's sort of had to deal with stuff before it's just never been as viral as he does in the book and he for the most part is pretty cool and calm and collect\n'em and stands up for other people and his sphere and himself but there are other times when his internal monologue you can tell that he is really hurting\nAnd I think that's important too especially for boys where they might say like you know set up er yeah how's school fine you know but inside there's a lot of other stuff going on so I tried to to have them have a pretty rich in her life\nSo he puts up with a polite racism and then you know you get into the idea of cyber bullying and then things become exacerbated and get even more painful\nWhen you were writing this how did you decide whether to make some of the characters that Caucasian character specifically in the book deplorable or not deplorable I mean what what in your own experience made you decide well maybe this person is uninformed and this person is racist\nFor me personally it was really difficult to write this book because I Do want to get away from books that are sort of like where the character has to deal with Islamophobia like the character to just have an adventure or you know be the hero and you know get to do stuff that other main characters get\nTo do twenty or just like you don't want it just like the character doesn't right like he chose her first and you don't want to be the\n... well no but for all kids like I just want them to be able to be like I Am the basketball hero and this is you know write what I've achieved but I did want to sort of address this thing that really\nHas bothered me for quite some time and it's not that I think that there are certain people who can't combat racism or or get over it maybe after the book finishes\nBut for that time and space I Want to talk about things that I think young people are dealing with and maybe don't get a lot of media time [noise]\nWhat do you what's the pay for you is it just getting the book out there and do you want to hear from people who recognize themselves on one side or the other in the book for better or worse\nI Am concerned with people who maybe feel that the book doesn't represent them fully but it's just one story and one perspective I Do hope that he is a main character that maybe people were not expecting\nHim I didn't like making hurt a lot of times but I Know that if maybe people read about him hurting they'll hurt real people last\nIf you were you know I mean this is a young adult book if you were kind of work up a lesson plan for this and you wanted to conversation to be started among students what would be the theme of that conversation\nHuh I Would say what does it take to find one voice in prejudiced times\nHow can you stand up for yourself and others when that's really difficult which is a great hope but we'll see how that pans out\nSarah ... thank you thank you so much appreciate it Sarah ... book is called here to stay to read an excerpt go to hearing now dot org\n\n[noise]\nToday the twenty

Baxley coalition led by Saudi Arabia it's trying to oust rebels known as who these who these are backed by Iran\nDavid Miliband has seen all of this up close he's president and CEO of the international Rescue Committee David Miliband you were just in Yemen two weeks ago what did you see there\nI mean Yemen is the world's largest humanitarian crisis this is a country of twenty eight million people\nEight million people are being fed by the un world food program every day it's a country with three and a half million people are on the brink of famine and what eighty three percent of the population are in extreme poverty and the temptation is to describe this is a tragedy\nIn science is an indictment because this is not a natural catastrophe it's a man made a trauma that is the result of a war that has been waged over the last ran off your neither side winning\nI Want to ask you about that war because there are lots of people who want to pay attention to what's happening in Yemen it feels very remote it feels is very complicated as well um could you describe in your own words what this is all about yeah I mean yes\nGovernment of Yemen was toppled in two thousand and fourteen by a who seek to the who sees are a group from the north of the country socio economically deprived\nOr they rolled over the then government and capture Seventy percent of the country I'm what's happened since then is it a Saudi led coalition with us support and so you kind of the European support so it's not that far from home because the U.S is very strongly implicated in as\nA Saudi led coalition has been trying to pull the Yemen the control of the capital Sana'a enough Seventy percent of the country the truth is the Eighteen thousand bombing raids being led by the Saudi led coalition has shifted the front lines Seventy to eighty percent of the humanitarian and commercial traffic\nGoes through the port of data which is currently choked really ah by the fighting only a trickle of eight and commercial traffic is getting through\nI'm what's happening in Yemen is that that conflict between the who the and the Saudi led coalition has brought in the Iranians who supporting the who the Z\nBut hey either it's and the other side from the Saudis the less in the u._k. exactly so I immediately you have a theological splits Sunni Shia you also have a split of trout regional power struggle but in the chaos of the groups are emerging separatist groups in the south\nI'll ... drove the Arabian Peninsula in the east ISIS growing as well in my case the case that I saw with my own eyes is that this is a humanitarian catastrophe\nOr the levels of malnutrition are absolutely shocking in that country that have children literally starving to death but at the same time there was a political emergency too\nBecause the only sign that he's gaining from the current stalemate all the extremists of all ... and I says\nAnd it's a country now which is on the verge of melt down not just humanitarian meltdown but political melt down I'm going to say what does that mean it means that the humans are a meltdown is the three and a half million people on the verge of famine forty thousand children are waiting for hospital places in Yemen\nOr there isn't the fuel to support the hospitals there isn't the fuel for the cause you can see half a mile cues at gas stations on the\nRoad you've got teachers and doctors and nurses are not being paid because public sector salaries and not being paid as a country which can't sustain itself at the moment is being ravaged by war\nThat is not to the benefit of any of the sides were waging it was in fact being exploited by extremists and I think that the onus on the permanent members of the Security Council including the U.S in the u._k. is to recognize\nAddress both the humanitarian and political emergency is a cease fire a winning a whole stop digging and that's the message that needs to go to the Saudi led coalition\nSettled on right there for a second what is it that the Saudis the u._k. the U. S. and the others\nWant what's their goal that goal is festival to roll back the influence which they see as being allied to the Iranians\nSecondly to reestablish what they call the legitimate government that was in place before the two thousand and fourteen or two and a third Leon importantly for Saudi Arabia they want to be secure or from missiles being sent from Yemen into Saudi Arabia and there's no\nQuestion about who sees have launched missiles into Saudi Arabia so there are legitimate security concerns\nBut what I saw was the price being paid by the Yemeni people far outweigh the costs that were being imposed on the other side\nWe should say that the U.S secretary of state Mike Pompeo since the coalition is taking steps to minimize civilian casualties\nNot obviously sticks in the ... because I I met a Yemen these who ... told me about missiles had landed on a hospital next to a health care center that we were delivering\nAnd they all know about the fact that the Saudis bombed a coach of schoolchildren mobile forty of them killed in ... the U.S interest that Mike Pompeo has indeed\nA certified as he is required to buy congressional legislation that everything is being done to protect civilians why we I Know that seven and a half thousand civilians being directly killed them Monday indirect effects on far larger numbers\nAnd why would the U.S not want to protect civilians why would they in the u._k. and even Saudi Arabia I mean why would that not be a priority I\nI'm not costing any ad hominem judgment what I'm saying is that the fact is that siblings are not being protected them to come up to the war has breached the basically the most basic norms and international humanitarian law both on the Saudi led coalition side and on the side independent un inquiries\nHave produced extensive documentation of terrible breaches of international humanitarian law in other words the targeting of civilians by both sides\nAnd this is a a crisis that now I came away saying that the world needs to wake up to what's going on in Yemen and the tragedy is at the U.N General assembly there was no all night session of the U.N Security Council on Yemen the u._k. holds the pen\nOn the Yemen filed but the pen needs to be picked up because there is no current debate to replace\nRather than the cop lunch for\nIf we take the issue of um a refugees which obviously the higher the focus is on to the U. S. indirectly to Washington\nUm you have said that regarding help from the western world they moved to a relatively benign climate to a relatively hostile and we know the Trump Administration has cut by Seventy five percent the number of refugees it admits into this country every year\nHow does that affect your work\nWe'll just for the benefit of your listeners are about twenty eight million refugees and asylum seekers around the world today\nMost of them are in poor countries not rich countries countries like Jordan and Lebanon countries like Kenya Ethiopia Uganda countries like Bangladesh\nHistorically for the most vulnerable refugees widows victims of torture or from children the U.S has stepped up and being a leader in what's called refugee resettlement which means bringing a ... on average about Ninety thousand refugees the or the U.S actually on the Reagan Administration that was over two hundred thousand\nAnd those people go on to become productive members of American society the Trump Administration has festival changed the security vetting arrangements they wanted to update them that's legitimate for any government to do but they've also reduce spy Seventy five percent the cap on the number of\nRefugees are allowed into the U.S and that obviously means that individual lives are affected that are off fifty thousand Iraqis who supported\nThe work of the U.S military and government in Iraq translators and things that are being allowed into the country either so there are individual stories of people who fear for their own lines who called now starts a new life to work in the\nUs which is part of the reason they're in trouble because I ended up\nBeing targeted because of ... for the U.S then not being allowed in either so you've got this clamp down on a refugees fleeing for their lives clamp down on people who would claim refugee status because of the work for the U.S\nGovernment and the great danger is that a bipartisan program of proven success remember refugees contribute more to the American economy than they take out in\nA welfare payments a proven program is being strangled and this year um we are having to deal with the fact that there was a historic low in the number of refugees allowed in only Twenty one thousand in the fiscal year that ended on September\nThe ... the Trump administrators us into the U.S at the drop in his rations such a feeling of thirty thousand for this fiscal year which started on October\n... the first and so what we see is not just the effect on individual\nHave that back let me give you an example Jordan the second closest ally of the United states in the middle east is dealing with six hundred and fifty thousand registered refugees from Syria\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

one of the finest small art in his hands in the country\nOfficials say the museums elaborate surveillance system made no difference\nMuseum officials today said it was the largest art heist in history\nDespite the confidence of museum officials that the prejudice artworks will be recovered experts say they could disappear for years perhaps forever [noise] read what was the before\nI Witness news\nThe thieves who pulled off the greatest art heist in history had a pretty simple plant they dressed up and cop uniforms and rang the bell it was one twenty four in the morning and the thieves approached the palace road entrance of the Gardner Museum\nThere'd been a keg party nearby a few revelers were still on the streets and when the cops told the museum guard on duty that they were responding to a disturbance it seemed plausible maybe some drunk kid had gotten up to some mischief after all earlier in the evening the guards around had been interrupted by\nWhy the cops had come and so we ... them into the museum\nThat guard was ...\nThey came in and they turned so she's like I say that they had had goes bad as it looked like up so it was the rest of the way\nSteve cooked in any way Cabot talked about that night at an Indian restaurant in two thousand Thirteen\nThe first question was is that anybody who I said my partner okay\nThis is the first time that former guard the one who was on duty that night with habits has ever spoken publicly about his experience\nWondering if they might just come up behind my head with a gun or the silence or and just\nYou know do a real quickly\nIt was a terrifying night and all these years later he still rather we not use his full name his first name now is Randy\nIn Nineteen Ninety Randy had a passion for symphonic music the moody blues and the trombone he's still place makes a living at it mostly in house bands on cruise ships but back then Randy had recently earned a master's in performance from the New England conservatory of music he was trying to land gigs and make ends meet\nBut I always had to have some kind of a day job kind of thing\nTo supplement the income make sure the bills get paid and so forth\nRandy knew a couple of people who worked at the gardener and that's how we landed his security job there\nIt wasn't something that required you to have any kind of special skills you knows I remember being trained to if any people were getting real close to a painting and we were told to get them to stand back a little bit um don't get so close\nA few months into his job Randy began filling in on the overnight shift the pay was better eleven dollars an hour versus seven or eight bucks for the daytime shift\nAt nighttime when there are no visitors when you're not doing around you can bring stuff to read and I could bring my horn and practice I was always happy to say yes to filling I'm\nRandy doesn't recall any special training or specific instructions for the night shift\nBeyond the requirement that he register his presence in each of the galleries on all the floors during his round he did that by swiping a magnetic strap he wasn't originally on the scheduled to work the overnight after St Patrick's Day Randy was filling in for another guard who had reported they called in sick\nEdited told him about the carriage has alarm but he hadn't thought much of it until he saw the two police officers talking to us at the watch desk\nIt never occurred to me that they might be anything but Boston police I immediately made that can\nHe recognized and asked to see his id\nHe said yeah I Do know you\nThere's a warrant out for your arrest\nAnd he told Rick to stand against the wall\nAnd put his arms up he does the pat down he puts the cops on\nAnd on just standing there with my job open\nGoing wow you know what what's going on what the written due to see really into some kind of trouble and\nIt's still never occurred to me that they were anything but policemen\nBy stepping out and away from the desk and that's also stepped away from the spill means signaling travel to the outside world to museums panic button\nNo sooner with Abbott against the wall and handcuffed than Randy was too I kept asking\nHim over and over why are we being arrested why are we being arrested and he wouldn't answer\nSo Cofer on\nMy hands are behind my back and then duct tape starts going\nOn around my eyes so about the time that he begins putting the duct tape and he says this is a robbery and so then everything was finally crystal clear what was going on you know it was just really strange [noise] none of it made any sense and then suddenly it made a lot of sense\nI mean it's scary enough to think you're being arrested and not know why the war was going to your mind when suddenly duct tape is going around your head\nIt's very scary and I'm worried for my life [noise] um but they were immediately saying I can remember both of them\nSaying you know follow instructions and you will knock it hurt so that gave me some relief and I just felt like okay don't try anything stupid don't trying stupid go along with whatever they\nThere's nothing here in this museum that is worth my life\nTo the mound
