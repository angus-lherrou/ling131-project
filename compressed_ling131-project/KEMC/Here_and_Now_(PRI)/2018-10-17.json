four seven auto\nThis year and now with less than three weeks until the mid term elections many are wondering if the polls are correct and Democrats will make big gains in the house or if like in twenty sixteen there's a lot more Republican enthusiasm than it's being reported\nFrom Boston Globe reporter and editor Ben Bradlee junior just spent some time in a key county in Pennsylvania which President Trump won he profiles twelve Trump voters in his new book just out the forgotten how the people of one Pennsylvania county elected Donald Trump and changed America\nAnd Bradley junior welcome to hear now that you will first tell us about this county in Pennsylvania [noise] this is a\nCounty ... county in northeast Pennsylvania [noise]\nThe edges and has been hurting for a long time\nAnd combing through a vote in the three critical swing states Pennsylvania Michigan or Wisconsin I discovered loser and county which is a traditionally democratic county hadn't voted Republican since Nineteen eighty eight for Bush senior\nPresident Obama want it to time President Obama\nWon it twice but its surged in the other direction for Trump and he wanted by twenty points building up such a margin in this one county that it was sixty percent of his victory margin for the state of Pennsylvania so without this one county or he wouldn't have wanted to state or perhaps the presidency\nAnd you profiled twelve people in this book how did you find them well I went down\nInitially poking around and you do what the journalists do you go to community leaders and a newspaper editors talk show host and learn who the Trump voters were and start talking to them and one person a region to another\nAnd ended up interviewing a over the months a about a hundred in depth but settled on twelve a who stories I decided to tell and I think that this is a window or a deep dive if you will into the Trump vote and that\nAt least more than half the country remains shocked at a candidate as unusual as Trump got elected and there's a hunger to know more about how it happened\nAnd you talk to a number of people who all kind of had different reasons for supporting Trump you you you dipped into many different views of him one of the people that you spoke with Tiffany cloud\nTold you that Trump's simple ... speak like huge big league or big league may have turned out voters in other parts of the country but it helped him connect with people in Lewes earned county but I think people base\nMost of their vote for president on the extent to which they can relate to them on a human level a how likeable they are I think that that is in the end more important than where they stand on a variety of issues and\nI think the people that I settle on a generally like Trump on most issues but really liked his style they just like she's a is moxie his feisty and that's how we get up every morning and I'm ... has uh\nHe was being condescending toward them that he was talking down to them\nNo on the contrary they felt heard and listen to and felt that Hillary was talking down to them especially with her now infamous remark calling them the deplorable [noise]\nOne of the things that we were talking about during the campaign is that what Trump was saying\nWas not what he actually met or not what many people were hearing from him um and and you talk to people here in loser and county who you know they hear him say I'm going to build a wall and what they would here is like not actually going to build the wall but he's gonna he's going to beef up the wall\nYeah the interesting they talked about the importance of deep coding Trump saying that the press was unfair to them to him and would treat him or to literally by merely covering or what he said we would get into lively discussions about this and I said well that's the press his job candidate\nSays something and the press is supposed to report it and they said no no you really making too much of a hall of blew out of you know the Access Hollywood tape and we know what he meant that kind of thing and so it was a way of apologizing for him and trying to make his rhetoric a understandable [noise]\nWhat about religion this is a place that is very Catholic um and it's also a place that used to be big in the coal industry that that's gone away but how much does religion play into how people view president\nTrump it's still predominantly Catholic not majority so that's a rising are evangelical population Trump's um evangelical vote was off the charts he carried a eighty percent of the evangelical vote\nSo I I talked to I'm a woman for whom Trump was literally sent by God\nShe believed that Trump was sent to cure America's political dysfunction ...\nAnd does she feel like he's delivered she does he's appointed evangelicals to his cabinet vice president Pence is evangelical they're willing to um excuse the Stormy Daniels business as essentially much ado about nothing\nThat he's been married three times they don't care for them the the most important issues are abortion\nAnd his delivering too conservative Supreme Court justices what about you\nTeen this is a place where there's not a lot of opportunity there also a lot of drug overdoses going on I mean this is you could go there and just do a book about the opioid crisis in this area\nThe opioid crisis is really bad they're really bad and it's affecting the entire county even if you\nDon't have someone in your family who is a an addict I'm the ripple effect is a widespread and or the county coroner\nDown there and he is uh just overworked and a thinks that it's an enormous problem and just trying to raise public awareness\nAbout it but it's pretty bleak in Missouri and county\nAnd young people are leaving is a brain brain is not a lot of opportunity beyond\nMaintenance and I'm working in warehouses minimum wage jobs\nAnd do they think that things have gotten any better under Trump\nMaybe at the margins the unemployment rate has gone down in the county as it has a nationally and perhaps it's a little bit better there but a lot you know a lot of the economic promises that Trump made during the campaign he hasn't really followed through on you know he said he would repeal and replace Obamacare\nOr the individual mandate has been repealed but he's been really a sabotaging Obamacare and there is no neither Trump for the Republican Party have come up with an alternative plan\nHe said that he would reduce the deficit by in his first or eight years\nGoing up the budget he filed in February or a shows a seven trillion dollar increase so no Republican Party doesn't seem to care\n... ... what about these voters do they care about those things they don't hasn't been able to do they don't seem to really care in the final analysis because they just like Trump I think it's it's personality over or anything else do you think that the Democrats are\nConnecting now with the people of Lucerne county I remember speaking to the liberal filmmaker Michael Moore who said you know they they didn't even try to win a place like Michigan or in the last election they didn't come here the way that Trump did\nUm there's been a lot of criticism that Democrats are ignoring these people that you've been talking to in in places like was there and county well they certainly\nOh to listen more to Democrats what other people that I talked to were Democrats but felt that the party had left them rather than they leaving the party\nAny thoughts on what might happen in the midterms well if\nI had to guess I Would think the uh this so called blue wave I don't know how big it will be but I think probably big enough for the Democrats to retake the house but not the Senate\nThen by the junior one of the things I really liked about this book is that you gave us a glimpse in to the minds of many people who voted for Trump but\nDid so with respect for their views and I feel like a lot of the um reporting even on people in the middle of the country that's coming from reporters and and and others on the coasts tests to look down on on them you didn't do that here\n[noise] [noise] [noise]

schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school in Manhattan which began to group the few minority students in the same home room so they'd have a place where they felt less like the other here's director Philippe Casson\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms and for part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of their academic experience but the parents\nOf some of the minority students headed smelled of segregation and they worry that gave their kids the feeling of being left out so the school end of the policy our question is it the right thing to a group African American or Hispanic students together when they are the minority in school\nWe turn to Dr Beverly Tatum she's the author of the best seller why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria she's also former president of Spelman College in historically black college for women\nThat container and the director the little red schoolhouse said they're revisiting this maybe it should have been more structured but then it was very well intentioned your thoughts [noise] um I think it\nWas well intentioned and certainly there's a lot of\nEvidence to suggest that there is value to give\nBlack kids time together sometimes that time together is called affinity grouping not necessarily in class time but time in a school time to talk to each other about the issues that adolescents are concerned about that can be very helpful talk about what is happening\nFor these teenagers because as you write in your book and the chapter called why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria [noise] it seems like\nIn high school was happening one of the things that's happening is the changing adolescent brain meaning that as kids move into puberty they start to think in a more sophisticated way they start to recognize the ways in which race plays itself out and you know there's lots of literature to suggest\nThat a black boys in school in particular I'm more likely to be disciplined for similar behaviors and also girls\nExperiencing questions about what does it mean to be a young black girls and having space to talk about that is not a bad thing it can be actually a very helpful thing\nThe stereotypes that we see of black women are imposed on them and so they might develop some oppositional behavior explain that sure well if I\nAm a young African American students and I'm trying to understand what it means to be a black person in a white dominated society\nOne of the things that I might be thinking about is\nI don't want to be perceived as quote acting white some social scientists have said you know the black kids think doing well in school is acting white but that's not universally true if you are in a largely black school and a lot of black kids are in schools that are segregated\nBecause their neighborhoods are segregated they're going to the local school\nAnd if you are in a school like that\nThe honor students are black but if you are in a predominantly white school the honors group is largely white and most of the black and brown kids are in the lower tracks if that's what your school looks like than you are likely to think doing well in school being in that on his track is so called acting why\nIt's such a vicious cycle because very often the kids are in those lower ... maybe because they come from low income families but very often there's bias on the part of the teacher that puts a child in that track when in fact they should be in a higher tractors a lower expectation\nBut what ends up happening is in a sense that they don't belong anywhere else so they start to bond further with the group that they're in\nIn fact tracking often does result in re segregation with in racially integrated schools for the reason we were just talking about the kids of color are being put in the lower ability groupings\nPerhaps because they are less well prepared and maybe that's related to family income and previous preparation but sometimes it isn't about that because there's also data that's the ...\nLess likely to be placed in those upper tracks you know the the the little red school so they looked at research it was probably yours in your book but\nTo read that was pretty amazing that have the same test scores that deal not be placed so what do we do\nAbout how to address this notion that perhaps there should be some support without making it look like segregating them or again reinforcing the low expectations this brings us\nTo the Boston medical program the greater Boston metropolitan counseling for education opportunity program Nineteen Ninety four the notion of bussing kids from the inner city from troubled spots in the inner city out to the suburbs very good schools but all white schools\nIt was kind of a failure at first talk a little bit about that and then what sure so most of the children who are traveling from Boston and to the suburban schools are black or Latino\nAnd often there's a sense of not really belonging they are not part of the local community and so when superintendents of these programs look at the performance of the black kids in particular\nThey often find that the kids are not doing as well as they would like them to be doing this also may not um echo but you had another anecdote about a young girl who was in a school a majority white and the teacher\nWas saying are you going to the dance kid doesn't want to say how we're going to get to the dance you know I I get busted school my parents don't have cars we lived in the city but she doesn't say that and to teach you get so frustrated that she won't say she's going to the dance\nThat she then ends up saying something racial she says oh come on you people love to dance which adds to the racialized moment that the young girl was feeling exactly\nThat teacher who made that comment was well intentioned but nonetheless projected a stereotype and it made the students feel even more like she didn't really belong in that school yeah but there was a program back in the nineties I was very involved\nAnd uh one of the districts I was involved with decided to start a program in the middle school\nFor medical students and they set aside one period a day for the kids to meet together to talk about issues related to academic performance academic achievement as well as some of the social concerns they had\nA minute this is a little little red schoolhouse his whole room it sounds like there isn't it but what the difference between this experience and the little red schoolhouse is that they did it\nThat experience improved academically and also they became more engaged socially why what are the kids say happened\nI'm at the kids said they felt more supported\nThey had the opportunity to talk without invoking stereotypes about some of the things that were challenging them\nSo if you've been riding on a bus from Boston for an hour and maybe there's been conflict on the bus you could go to that meeting and talk about it get it off your mind and then the more focused in class or if something happened in class let's say here's an example that one of the kids provided in this study\nUm they were watching a film eyes on the prize which is about the civil rights era and some of the white kids were laughing at something that happened in the film something that the black kids found upsetting\nAnd so the fact that their white peers were laughing as though it were funny and the black kids were feeling like this is horrible\nI'm was upsetting to them rather than a walking around agitated they were able to talk about it the brief it's so to so to speak in that um [noise] time together in ways that they found helpful by the way the title of your book again why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria\nNobody ever asks why the white kids in the cafeteria\nTheir bonding in in many ways\nAbsolutely and it's also important to say as you just did\nWe don't ask why all the white kids sitting together in the cafeteria but in fact at the college level it is actually the white students who are more likely to be racially isolated it is possible for white kids still to not engage with the diversity to stick to people who look like themselves\nJust such an odd thing in any high school or just about every college the entire culture is black whether it's the music comedians that they're following or the sports figures it must be very odd for young blacks to see that\nIt's true I mean certainly the cultural references that you talked about so you know those black artist to his music becomes mainstream you know those athletes who are admired by white teens as well as kids of color um those are physical symbols\nFunding for here and now comes from backwards greeters of that law that stimulates software accelerating the pace

the dancer and I\nThink it will be fabulous well so how does this all start you are familiar with the ballet world had certainly observed it um had written about it and then you started writing this book for Yale University presses Jewish lives series for the hundreds centennial a journal Robin ... birth\nCertainly knew about his works as we all would know about west side story and and the king and I\nAnd then you're bowled over by something you didn't know about I didn't either until you wrote about it the journal Robbins Nineteen Seventy one ballet Goldberg Variations for the New York city ballet set to of course music from Bach let's just listen to them\n\n[noise]\nOkay so you will have all of the of videos that we talk about here in here now dot org but what ... what are we seeing in this valley what did you see that\nThat really got you [noise] the thing is that I went to that program not ever having heard of a Goldberg Variations by Jerome Robbins I didn't know he did a dance to it [noise]\nAnd I went to see the west Side Story fleet which was on the same program and to my enormous surprise Goldberg Variations turned out to be an incredible masterpiece Eighteen minutes long with a live\nIn a stove or on the side every kind of movement you could imagine standard ballet folks dial\nFriendly formal it was just an amazing range of dance it use thirty dancers and all and it had\nFeeling of the music I Can't say anything better about a piece of dance than to say that had the feeling of box cobra variation and I loved it so much I went back the following week and then I thought something's going on here that I don't know about I think of him as\nThe west Side Story man that Peter Pan manned fiddler on the roof man but really if he can do a ballet like this how many others could have done\nAnd you even spoke to a friend who said oh yeah I saw that back when it first came out and I remember really loving it and then feeling a little bad about that\nThat's right that was the impression I got and I couldn't figure out exactly why that would be although I knew that Robbins had a reputation as being ...\nGuy he couldn't really do ballet although Balanchine never thought that\nBut then I read Amanda veils and\nDeborah Xiao it's excellent biographies two of them and they both mentioned in relation to Goldberg Variations that are encroaching had panned and that she was the most powerful a dance critic and absolutely the most powerful ballet critic of her generation\nAnd you said you sat there stunned at the beauty of this piece for however many many minutes\nUh she called it Ninety minutes of hard labor and also called germ Robbins affects all angry man that was later but you became as you write like a court appointed lawyer you were going up Robbins words as a ballet choreographer\nAnd so let's take a listen to some of it again the pieces and we will have as much visual as we can hear now dot org\nAfternoon of a fun Nineteen fifty three to the music of DC I'm willing to the Nineteen fifty five Canadian TV taping of it with the original ballerina ten ... penny Robbins news and dear friend [noise] and this is a year before she was paralyzed by polio [noise]\n\nHow is this a reimagining of the afternoon of a fun [noise]\nWell I I just love the stats and it's only about ten minute twelve minutes long you can watch over and over and it just feels wonderful every time it's not just a reimagining of the music better reimagining ... version that he did in the very beginning of the twentieth century the\nFun is the main character and he has a\nPriest is is dancing around them and stuff but he's practically a\nSolar whereas Robbins imagined this as a ... [noise] wonderful to where I think we're at simultaneously about the ballet world we're looking at two dancers in a studio partly and then it's also\nAbout a fond and his dream girl who\nComes and visit him and with those two dancers tend to kill the clip and Jack Kemp was it was a knockout\nAnd what are they they're like they're watching themselves in a practice mirrors\nThat is what it feels like and we are the mayor there looking toward us out in the audience but they seem to be looking at him near as\nSometimes doing a studio said that\nThe superior attitude toward things that had a plot he was Balanchine loved dances at a gathering which Robbins made and down and she said it was so great you should make more make more it's like popcorn and he said like you could eat at the whole thing endlessly popcorn\nAnd that's probably drove others you know off the cliff but let me ask you a little dances at a\nGathering this is a the dance Robin said to Chopin music in Nineteen sixty nine [noise] he had been away from the New York city ballet doing choreography for Broadway but this stance is at a gathering was an instant had to do\n\n\nAnd what do we see in this day dancing the gathering starts with a young man alone on stage and sort of ends up with him [noise] touching the stage after\nMany many minutes I you know it's quite a long ballet all the answers coming in and joining him and they all get to strut their stuff and they combine in many different ways but the idea is they are dancers hanging out together and so\nOne of the things Jerome Robbins did this happen stand up beside watching each other as others are dancing it's again like afternoon on a combination of\nA work that's meant for us and that it's meant to have\nA real worldly reality and the work that talks about itself being on the stage\n[noise] uh you talk about his childhood which was difficult fraught relationship with his mother\nUm and he became difficult there's a famous and encircle story about him backing up on stage during rehearsal you know he has his back to the audience that companies in front of him he's backing up back up and no one tells him that he's coming at the edge and he falls in the orchestra pit and no one comes to help him\nUm he you know can be cruel\nIn ... and a lot of people talk about his cruelty and there are many many stories about how difficult he was and not just to the dancers to Leonard Bernstein for instance when they were rehearsing west side story in Washington in a theater and Leonard Bernstein was sitting there near the front of the theater listening to the play his music\nFunding for here and now comes from WVU are Boston and your NPR station from college fine where consultants work with high school students to identifying

morning what happened while you were sleeping and the news interviews and analysis for the day I had national international and local news tomorrow on MORNING edition\nTo secure now every president since Jimmy Carter has voluntarily released his tax returns to the public but Donald Trump has not here's Trump on it\nThough like right now I'm under routine hundred nobody cares deal and cares is you know you and a few people that is in question\nObviously the public didn't care because they won\nThe election very easily\nSome Democrats have been pushing to get Trump's tax returns released Here's Democratic congressman Bill Pascrell speaking in Congress in April\nI call on the German and ways and means just stopped delay and yet Mr Trump's tax returns now\nThe Democrats efforts have been sidelined by Republicans being in control but if the Democrats win a majority in the house in November it means they could get Trump's tax returns joining us to explain is George ... who's a professor of law and taxation at the University of Virginia school of law\nAnd former chief of staff of the congressional joint committee on taxation welcome to hear now high Germany so what is this law who is allowed to ask for the president's tax returns\nUm the law authorizes the chair of any one of three tax committees in Congress\nTo request the tax return information of any person or any business and directs the secretary the treasury to furnish the information that's requested a upon receipt the committee must examine the information in a confidential manner\nUm but it can important agents such as a staffer ... outside experts\nAre the law doesn't specify but I think given the significance of the possible action by the house in the house committee\nOr it would probably be very wise for the house the full house first to pass a resolution authorizing the committee share to make this request and to be very clear on what the legislator purpose of this is\n... and it would just require the Democrats taking the house to do this they wouldn't have to take both the house and Senate\nThat's exactly right so either committee or any of the committees connect unilaterally and so if the Democrats simply took the house it's not the Senate the house committee could proceed on its own a symbol le descended could proceed on its own if if the opposite situation\nIf the house ways and Means Committee or to get those tax returns does that mean the public is going to be able to see them\nWell I'm there is a further provision in the law that allows the committee after completing its investigation to submit any of the information that it's a pain to the full house or the full Senate and presumably would be by some kind of\nWhy but I think sound practice would say that there should be some reason why the committee feels it needs to share this more broadly beyond simply the committee and its staff what kind of ... could you think of\nWell you know there are any number of reasons it really depends a little bit on what the initial investigation to start out with his this is a tax committee and so it certainly\nCould be a legitimate reason to examine because the committee has oversight over the tax function or the long history going back forty years in this country has been that every president has voluntarily turned over his tax returns\nAnd you know there is a good public purpose if you will for that and so the committee could be carrying that out beyond that obviously there have been stories of the New York times had a story about some of the tax filing\nPrior tax filing by um by Mr Trump's a father\nAnd there have been obviously a issues about potential conflicts of interest the New York times also raises the possibility of fraud in that story\nYes well I mean again I I Would think that you know it's it's up to the committee to in the house to decide what exactly it's doing and why it searching it but I I think I could come up with some very legitimate arguments purposes for the committee to take this action\nWhat is the history of this law goes back to Nineteen twenty four the law that allows the house to do this to to get somebody's tax returns\nYeah so it is a almost a hundred year old law\nAnd the circumstances when it came about and we're actually fairly close to our current circumstances of the law prior to this law allowed only the president to make a decision of who's tax information could be disclosed\nAt that time when the law was that law was in effect it frustrated Congress and the early Nineteen twenties\nUh there were a variety of reasons to principle one where they were carrying out a number of investigations of the executive branch\nIncluding the scandal that became known as the teapot dome scandal involving some high level executive branch officials are the committees that were investigating wanted to examine their tax returns and because\nEven though they were investigating you know I'm executives under the president and so obviously Congress realized she we're not really a co equal branch of government if we have to go through this kind of procedure\nAh there was a similar concern or about treasury secretary Andrew Mellon who um was an extremely wealthy and successful business person prior to going into government and like the president or did not surrender or\nPlace in a blind trust his business interests but simply a retain them while he was in office and that obviously been raised all sorts of questions in Congress is mind\nUh the the the Coolidge in ... that time was pushing through various tax legislation just like the existing in Venice ration pushed through at the end of last year\nAnd there were issues of well how would this legislation affect you personally how would it affect your businesses\nYou know so there was all of that going on in Congress ultimately decided to be a co equal branch of government it needed to have the authority to get this information directly just as the executive branch already had\n[noise] do you think that if President Trump's tax returns are released in some way if if the Democrats take the house and they're able to get them that people who want to see them will be satisfied with what they see because what are we really going to learn from them well that's a tough\nQuestion because obviously it depends on what people want to see and I can't really say that people will be set aside without knowing exactly what people want to see\nUm I Would think of some policy matter you'd want to see you know somebody who for example is very honest in their tax filing because that goes to the character of a person let's make sure that you first did file returns did pay taxes and paid more or less the right amount of tax\nBut if President Trump for example took a big loss on real estate in one year and didn't pay taxes for ten years after that that would be as he's been saying legal it may not look good to some but it also might not prove anything that people don't already know about him\nRight so I agree with that I mean what I've been thinking about more is in terms of character simply complying with the law but I think another area that would be fairly obvious\nLot of authority to undertake various ah relationships on behalf of the country and the question is\nWhat are the these decisions and is there some personal or business\nInterest on the part of some of the decision making going on I Would think that would be a very legitimate inquiry on the part of a number of people in the public and if they wanted to know that well that would be something that might come out from an examination returns\nAnd I would add one more thing which is whether he actually made as much money as he said he he did what we would find that out in terms of his yearly income yeah\nAlthough I think that you know you need to be a little cautious about that because of tax return typically doesn't really show the amount of income the way you and I might or the member but the public might think of that is you know how rich you are and and how much and so forth\nBecause a lot of that income of that sort doesn't actually translate into taxable income\nAnd so uh the return may not really show I mean there may show a relatively modest amount a taxable income and in fact as you say may show little or no taxes
