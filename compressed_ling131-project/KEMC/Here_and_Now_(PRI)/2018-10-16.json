shade at President Trump in fact that's the title of his book shade a tale of two presidents Pete Souza joins us\nHow did you have any idea that you would become more part of the public conversation\nNot at all it's\nIt's just something that ... as the days and weeks and months went by and twenty Seventeen\nIt became apparent that I had a voice where uh I and I needed to use it in a way just to demonstrate what is happening is not normal and I thought I was able to do that on Instagram using my photographs and commentary\nAnd how did it start it started\nSomewhat accidental I had seen a picture of the new Oval Office like on January twenty first there twenty second and it was ... you know golden ornate and I thought it looked like a Saudi palace more than\nThe oval office so I posted a picture of a President Obama with the the red curtains behind him and I wrote a caption that just said something like\nKind of like the old curtains better [laughter]\nAnd I guess it was a double meaning in my mind but I didn't know how people would react whether they would get it and in that very first post someone a said that I was throwing shade on the new\nA new president you didn't even know what that term it I didn't even know what that term that after you know I started a post them more and then I heard that the term shade again and I and I figured I better look it up\nYou also posted when when President Trump made a lot of news talking about how his inauguration crowd was the biggest in history and a lot of people showed photographs to prove that that was not the case you posted on January twenty first twenty Seventeen\nThe biggest crowd in history was really an January twenty two thousand nine huge in all caps with a picture of the national mall with a lot of people on it I mean I kind of picture says it All right right in that case maybe more than any other that that that the picture was what prove what was true\nYes I Do you get any negative feedback on your Instagram feed\nA a little bit very very few though I mean if you go through the commentary there's very rarely is there\nA negative feedback in and what's interesting to me is if I'm if there is uh my uh it's kind of followers are have my back and they they ended up coming back to the sea and they often point out to me\nUh people that that they feel or just bought ... maybe\nIn my Instagram feed just\nIn saying what they want to say\nAh in this book I you've got a often either Trump tweets alongside your Instagram post or a news story alongside your Instagram post there's one\nI'm looking at right here a President Trump said on may six twenty Seventeen the reason I'm staying in Bedminster New Jersey a beautiful community is that staying in New York City is much more expensive and disruptive meetings exclamation point you wrote\nStuck in meetings at sunny lands in rancho mirage California twenty sixteen and it's a picture of President Obama golfing\nRight I mean let's just let's I well I don't understand why the the ... the United states can't be honest\nI mean just say you're staying in bed Bedminster because you want to play golf and but ... just lie about golf I mean it makes no sense to me so that was sort of just a you know tell me and she spoke poke I guess\nWhat's the one that you're most proud of that you like I Can't believe I thought of that\n[noise] uh the the [laughter] I have to correct myself up sometimes when I when I come up with just the right picture in the right comment I guess\nYou know a Trump is always saying you know it's a witch hunt and it's a witch hunt I don't know how many times he's he's written that an exclamation points in all caps are in regards to the\nFBI and investigation um [laughter] and I and I found a a picture of a a a a young girl dressed as a which had a at a Halloween party and I just I think I wrote I'm a you know another kind of which\nI I have to admit that I correct myself up [laughter]\nThere's another one uh where you've got a picture of President Obama giving the state of the union on the same theme of a President Trump saying that the more people it is an aggression and he said forty five point six million people watched the state of the union his state of the union the highest number in history Fox News ... every other network and you Instagram\nForty eight million people watched the twenty tends to the union address on television just saying\nYeah and that was one where I ... it didn't sound right when I saw his tweet and so I had the kind of look it up [laughter] uh and and and and verified it with two or three sources that in fact President Obama as it was a two thousand ten state of the union was the largest and in history\nSeems like there's another theme in here which is that\nShow a photo of President Obama very happy with these other world leaders having a nice conversation with them\nA yeah I mean that's been pretty easy to [laughter]\n... you know you mentioned uh another one that I really liked that I correct myself up over was when he started I'm tweeting about Kim Jong ... and ... and calling him little rocket man and rocket man and\nYou know my button is bigger than your button all this kind of stuff [laughter]\nAnd I posted a picture of President Obama with a Elton John right and I said there's only one rocket man\n[laughter] ... what is President Obama think of what you're doing\nUm you know he didn't know I was doing a book because I didn't want people to think that I you know I was doing this in\nA coup boots with him or that he was going to have any input I just saw him a week or so ago and now the the book is actually printed um I told them that I was doing this book and you just you know he he didn't say that much about it\nOr at least that you can repeat to me on the air\nOr no he he really didn't say that much about it I think he knows what I'm up to\nDo you have ownership of all the photos that you took when you were in the White House or do you have to clear these by somebody else before you post amongst around\nNo these are all a pictures that were previously made public offering the administration so there are considered public domain so anybody can use them there was another guy that has a\nHas a book out of all Obama pictures and they're all mine and but he's allowed to do that so\nSo what do you want to do next who do you want to photograph next or do you want to have a job like you had when you were taking pictures every day of President Obama or do you or do you want to do something else [noise]\nNo I Want to do something else that's sort of the theme of maybe my next project is trying to figure that out a search for\nWhat kind of photography do I want to do but I definitely want to do new photography and I want to move away from 'em at least us politics for sure how come [noise]\nUm because I don't think that I'll ever have the kind of situation that I had with President Obama where I had a dynamic a a\nPerson to a photograph every day\nUm someone that I had you know admired someone who gave me incredible\nTicks when I Know that I couldn't get that kind of access to someone else at least I don't think I could and and and I've never you know I sort of ended up as a political photographer it was never something that I had aspired to do it just things just sort of happened\nUm because I took a right turn and instead of a left turn 'em and so I Want to sort of explore some other aspects of photography that I that I just don't get to do that much now\nTeaches at one more question for you um you know everybody now takes pictures with their phone\nYou can tell when you look at a Pete Souza photograph that it's really great photograph compared to what most of us are able to do although some people are great amateur photographers what is your one piece of advice that you give to people about how to take a better picture\nOh boy um [noise]\nOne piece of advice I can I give to yeah sure [laughter]\nUm but you know for uh the the lighting lighting is so important to people forget about that so if you're going to do [noise] pictures when you're traveling around the country or the world usually they're already early morning or late in the day the last two hours of light is the best time [noise]\n\nFunding for here know comes from the listeners have W.

experiment a grouping all seventh and eighth grade students of color together in home room\nAfter the parents are the minority students objected captain is director of the little red schoolhouse to look for what was your thinking and trying this\nUh we know that there are ways in which being a student of color in a predominantly white school is a challenge and if there are ways where we could create a larger group of students of color within a classroom where there were white students and students of color that that would be supportive of them and that ultimately it might help their academic achievement ... well\nYou said that are part of this was based on you know research this wasn't the intent to isolate the minority students in his attempt to give them what some feeling of almost ...\n[noise] I don't know about special illness but um our white students are comfortable in their classrooms looking around and seeing themselves in the schools teachers\nOur students of color some of them not all of them um feel somewhat other it in their classrooms in it for a part of their day they could feel a part of a larger group in the hour predominantly white school or that felt supportive of this\nPoints to the academic an emotional benefits to being in a classroom with others who share racial ethnic linguistic and or cultural identity oh what's that research\nThere there's research and this is a working with um some of my colleagues at the school that shows that\nUm those students who feel that there is some sort of stereotype threat I'm so there are some assumptions being made about them based on their identity and then as they are getting older and their their sense of self their racial identity is developing\nThat being part of a larger group having colleagues as supportive of the development of their academic success\nThat's hard to argue but why not do it in the way many colleges do and have an African American club or an African American society or something like\nThat that they could go so we have affinity groups um for students and for parents to things about that one you have um students who have to choose between going to an affinity group that matches their identity or\nSome other activity with a broader group of friends and it puts them in a tough spot and that's really hard for middle school aged kids\nAnd I think that we shouldn't minimize the impact and the energy that it takes\nFor a let's say an African American students who is one of the few African American students in his or her class to feel fully a part of that group and they're devoting a lot of energy to being fully there as opposed to just focusing on the academic or intellectual experience there having\nLook research also suggests that when teachers and students have different cultural exchange and let's say the teachers away and the students are black\nThen they have different schooling experience isn't that affects the minority students negatively it at home all the place where it's it's much uh you know this much lighter exchange between the teacher and the student is not a place for each to learn from each other\n[noise] so it is and some ways what you're talking about is the real tension for us right there are benefits to a diverse conversation and they're also benefits to these affinity experiences and our job as an institution is to find ways to me both of those in even though there I'm sort of at a conflict with each other from time to time\nAnd this is an unheard of in twenty love in a public school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is a high school had its junior classified itself for several minutes everyday along racial gender or language lines probably the same reasoning that you\nAny time there's a grouping of minorities in particular it just feels like segregation literally a segregated home that you had you know do you read about the wisdom that\nWe do and I I Would say two things about that one if you're you know those people learn about our school or know about our school the idea that we would you know I'm actively group people in a way that we're taking away their civil or human rights as ridiculous given the school's history as a\nA a place where people came so that we could fight for justice that's what we've done for nearly a hundred years [noise]\nI also think it's important to know that um you know these were students of color and some of their white classmate in a classroom with both white teachers and teachers of color\nHaving a parallel experience to the other home room and the the suggestion that this was like a segregated school from\nYou know way back when is is ludicrous\nYou know we should say the little red schoolhouse founded in Nineteen Twenty one always seen as a progressive school [noise] so what happens now a huge drop the homeroom experiment so how do you move forward\nWe will be doing what we have done and quite frankly what ... what a lot of independent schools do which is to have race be one of the components of the students identity that we think about when we're putting class placement together and we've entered into a community conversation with faculty and parents and students alumni\nTo continue to look for the best way to meet the needs of all of our students students of color included so that we can have all of our students have the full REI experience I'm going forward\n[noise] by the way el R. E. I. that stands for the little red schoolhouse and Elizabeth Irwin high school there in Manhattan uh where\nYou had to end is this idea of grouping minorities together in a home room when the kids say\n[noise] um some kids remain somewhat confused by the need um other kids feel super supported so lots of conversations with students coming forward\nAnd it's still casts and director of the little red schoolhouse in Manhattan filled thanks so much it's been a pleasure\nAnd tomorrow we'll speak with an African American educator who says there are times to group kids of color together you just have to get it right [noise]\nOkay wanna smile go now here now dot org and see the final is in the annual comedy wildlife photography awards tiger Freetown sell them as a judge he joined us by Skype from the Netherlands Tom these are just the finalists how will you choose [noise]\nAnd I didn't have to think about why I just that's how I Do my original technique\nWell let's take a look at them and by the way we're radio so you can go to hear now dot org and follow along we'll try to describe this must be camel off of last year's winters up because those were hilarious\nBut this year it with a picture of a school [laughter] hands are held out his mouth is wide open as if he saying [laughter] it's called caught in the act or from photographer Mary ... a gallon I mean that's laugh out loud\nIs allowed and is definitely one of my favorites I think it's very simple so just to see the animal and then not think of ... that I'm thinking something goes through your mind very quickly I have this vision of showing off his new name her showing how do you go to Brandon [laughter]\nIt's just a few different ... you said UC schools things do you know people's different things which is why I Love this poem petition because that street and he is on different levels where everyone\nYou see well yeah I got gel nails this time we [laughter] then we have that to a komodo dragons this is a photo by Saturday savvy it's called Martian [laughter] and their tails are whipping behind them in there and an embrace and they do a little like a little Martian like\nThey do to motion like and I'm actually they shouldn't be cold komodo dragons that their relatives of the ... but they ah I I think Bangor monitors but when you see them in that sort of embrace dumb thing they don't see no balancing on bracing the comedy fighting but\nIt kind of states that temperament that they are being friendly and sweet\nWell and they're probably you know they just got stuck together or something and they were signing tons to them that they are not thinking but that's a part of it if it's not anthropomorphizing some would say um there's the exasperated grizzly Danielle ... he just looks like a guy behind you know what what next\nNo it it's an amazing thing these animals because the basis of the competition is to raise awareness of animals and the fact that when we just wouldn't be around and twenties or does he is and I think people are getting a bit tired of seeing sort of gruesome\nImagery associated with animal comes to ... so we just feel that if we can build a positive emotion than we may take the discussion slightly different direction\nRoute to tell you uh you'll have the winner of the competition in November to me this is more important than the world series\n\nFunding for here and now comes from Massmart creators of that law that simulates software accelerating the pace of engineering and science you learn more ... dot\nCom from NPR and W.

rent a you and other reporters picked up quite a few of the threads that Daphne Carolina ... was pulling on tell us more\nWhere we were thanks to the world cup for forty five reporters for the past six months we were able to reveal some um information regarding the high level of corruption inside the minorities I learned and we were reading some consulting Fox about some potential links between the economy minister\nAnd some of the people who have been arrested because they were triggering the boom there were new to really pushing the button pushing the button yeah they were using a cell phone that was connected to the bone under the calls for the good at Jones Day\nOr she is she had been killed at least they're suspected of doing that and they were arrested\nAnd so drink that's investigation with the world cup that I'm collaborative team we were able to meet some people told us that they have seen the economy minister with\nThose two suspects before the murder\nAnd to the ... the ... project was not only about to identify who might be the key those but it's up to complete the stories of ...\nTo complete a very critical work because her stories was about sensitive issues like corruption organized crime so that's why we decided to complete the ... the name of that political to death in the project\nAgain you know the Maltese government she was doing an investigation into possible corruption having to do with matters of the economy and here you have\nLook I I just want to back up and and talk about how this started because it's in a compelling story you worked in a news agency across the hall from the Charlie Hebdo office tell us tell us about your experience there\nWell I'm investigative reporter for the past Twenty years and um I used to travel a lot to do some reporting in some countries where there was no freedom of press but to another think convinced me will personally a personal events in my in my life convinced me to stop for begins to reason this up and\nActually twenty Fifteen when to terrorists of al Qaida in Yemen arrive in the streets where the offices of the company where I was walking full worlds in that race\nAnd they into the ... and they killed the Saudi up to a newsroom were sharing the same flaw that were the right to the door right next to her and these day address to arrive to date two minutes after the terrorist escape the building\nAnd I ... into the newsroom and then I I was uh the first to discover my friends and colleagues of ... just dying or just totally dead\nAnd we'd all best to help the people who were survivors and so this really truly changed my life because\nThis was happening in Paris this was not happening on ... and he was such an Iraq was in the middle of pirates twice in my personal environment\nIt was about ... new and we're doing exactly the same root as me the same job there were ... they were killed forced to read they were able to publish and so\nIt was really traumatic experience I took a lot of time to recover of calls for that\nAnd trying to forget some very difficult futures but on that day I decided\nWhat I can do as a journalist to continue the work of murder to report to us to keep stories alive and usually when a ... he's dying for wants to raise that probably means that the story is very relevant to the ... opinion it's very important to continue and to keep these stories of life\nAnd he said something so compelling there he usually when journalists get killed there on to something and so for you it's about\nFiguring out what that was it as you say sending a message out to the murder or you can kill the messenger but you won't kill the message the story look at this has been going on for a while a when Arizona reporter John ...\nThat is to get reporters and editors and they set out to finish his work but there have been over sixty journalists killed this year many of their debts connected to their work we also here in the United states in Annapolis a newspaper or was attacked in so many killed\nThreats were made against the Boston Globe by California man he threatened to kill all of them do you use do you just there I mean it doesn't feel as if you know the message is getting out\nYeah well um we are really facing a lot of threats not totally\nIn South America and not only in Mexico in Europe too in a an old continents and I think that the the only response which is very efficient it's a global an collaborative response collaboration brings protection if you are working to get the\nIf the Cuba will see that there was a group of journalists ready to complete investigation and to expose the crimes event that will probably think twice the next time they would think about killing one report or\nYou were talking about the origins project that's great and very inspiring project and I do think that we have to react this way\nWe have to send this pool full signal to the enemies of the press to kill the messenger you would never kill the message because we are here to make sure people to get access to these very important stories so\nYes there was a lot of work we need some support there were a lot of children have to have been killed there are a lot of many forbidden stories beyond that we need to publish\nIt's quite children to do that and a journalist who is dying is just it is not just to a number we took ... important stories important information got some people want to to hide some people wanted to silence\nWell and there are other groups I met I mentioned investigative reporters and editors\nThere's
