in Brazil\nWell for a lot of people will say that democracy is at stake and the reason they will say that\nParticularly opponents of the man who is leading the presidential campaign according to the opinion polls that they said because he ... he's a Paul writes congressmen who is sort of sprung from\n... ah he's as threats to the Democratic norms\nAre in Brazil and this is just says he is remember from when there was a middle treat dictatorship here so will vote democracy is vi brings in this country\nThat people don't take it for granted equally supporters of Mr ... and already said that they are the ones who are going to rescue Brazil from the clutches\nThe people who have been responsible for a surge in crime a surgeon corruption and the worst recession that the country has ever experience so they say that you know Brazil is on the mortal threat\nThe less catchy and hence Europe's the rights to about ... but also the language people use about what is at stake in this election could not be morph rules\nAnd we should also remember that two of the last few presidents or one of them is in jail right now the other was forced out of office\nYeah and that is what I'm depends a lot of the opposition to the main challenges should this fall right presidential candidate because the work is policy the PTA you to give it it's a\nPush gays accident they would impact two thousand and two ... two thousand and sixteen and I only watch\nThe largest corruption scandal that Brazil is ever seen and and in fact these ... much of Latin America\nAt two groups and Lula president Luiz ... Lula da Silva who was a two term president of Brazil or the ... she had been hoping to see him as the candidate in this election\nBut he was sentenced to twelve years in jail for corruption of you to see a and so they put up to this other man and onto a dodgy who compared to ... more ... less charismatic\nThe difficult to punch through against the the brush populism of ...\nOr people excited about this election or some people not even gonna bother to vote because of all this\nOther thing is I like to be honest I think people are only tens of hooks about this election and I think a lot of people\n... ... she's a state so having the rise of the choices facing them but they really have to choose it's apathy isn't isn't an option and I think one of the things that you have to remember here is that\nAlthough an awful lot of people do feel visual ... is ... racist homophobic a man in the past has to warmly about dictatorship or even about those who tortured and killed for the state's loss of people\nFeel very strongly that the workers policy has headaches shops in Brazil and on their watch corruption crime and the recession has been result so even though there will be plenty of people who feel that Mr personality doesn't speak fool them they may\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

... and others you know the the leader survivors are and they come back tomorrow but I can tell you the crowds were not as big as the word yesterday\nIt was just trying to figure out what but these are some of the most perfect and some orders a of the\nSenators who are trying to convince to ... against the cabinet nominations are there people they're supporting Kevin [noise]\nThere are some I Would say a handful of covering all on one hand and none of us saw that were in support of Kavanaugh if one\nWho actually describe yourself as an independent I talked to him in front of the Supreme Court he said he was there too\nNomination of of cat and he's saying that the Democrats have brought it on themselves and that they they made a spectacle out of the nomination process there was another gentleman I met a says he was a member of the n._r._a. and was really there\nTo show support for in our area but he said that he went to West Virginia and a couple of weeks wanted mentioned to do the right thing which is in this case was to go to a vote a yes vote for a cabinet\nAnd we still don't know what you mentioned is going to do tomorrow in that final vote how far have people traveled to get to Washington\nSo we've met people from uh from Illinois we vet people from Denver ah we've met people from often Michigan we've done the furthest I think we've heard for those that someone has traveled or group of people that have trouble is from Alaska from Anchorage we've met a some folks that\nWere part of a hundred women that that traveled from Anchorage to try to get in front of a Senator Lisa Murkowski\nOr to try to influence her vote they said uh there was a group of a number of them met with her yesterday and ah they were trying to make sure that she was a no vote which she ended up doing in this cloture vote again in ... bc which is going to do tomorrow well just\nBriefly for act in a lot of protesters have made their way into the capital to try to have their voices heard by senators is getting into elevators et cetera what kind of access or protesters getting inside the Capitol just briefly\nYes they're they're still getting in I have not been inside the Capitol today but they are not being impeded by by Capitol police to get in on this process is going to continue throughout the day and and we could probably see that happen tomorrow as well\nRight That's NPR's Brakkton Booker outside the capital backed and thank you\nContinue to follow everything with Brett Kavanaugh at the U.S Capitol today a number of Senate races are in the balance with four weeks or so to go until election day let's get to our Senate tracker series\nThis week we're looking at the race in Nevada where Republican senator Dean Heller is facing a challenge from democratic congresswoman Jacky Rosen joining us now from Las Vegas is Joe Shannon host and senior producer at Nevada public radio Hi Joe\nHi how're you doing doing well and let's start with the Democratic challenger Jacky Rosen a relative newcomer to politics compared to tell her she was president of her synagogue before Democrats are back in twenty sixteen tapped her to run for Congress where she is serving her first term what else should we know about her oh just\nJust she lives in Henderson which is a city adjacent to Vegas and she moved here from the Midwest after her parents moved here this was back in college\nShe was a waitress at Caesar's Palace she had a degree from a community college became a computer programmer and then she got on to the national scene really by surprise\nWhen former Senate majority leader Harry Reid asked her to run for the house which she wanted twenty sixteen beating Danny Tarkanian in a really close race\nAnd we remember that Harry Reid represented the state of Nevada lets us into one of the ads from Jacky Rosen that's airing on TV just kind of going on the offensive here it opens up with a shot of one of those inflatable Gombe type things you see outside of the car dealership blowing in the wind and then she equate that to Dean Heller\nThey call them senators buying less because Dean Heller beds with the political when first promising to vote against the plan to repeal Obamacare because it would hurt in Nevada Dean Heller from Nevada is a no\nYou're right now I cannot support addiction but we should ... Americans but\nThen Dean Heller got pressure from his party leaders\nThat threat from President Trump loud and clear this was the one we were worried about you where they're going to be held her book\nThis promise and voted for repeal deciding\nHow big of an issue is that flip by Dean Heller\nIt's a pretty big issue in those ads have\nSeemed to be making I'm quite a mark here you know this this was the vote about a year ago maybe a little bit more\nHeller initially at the start of the summer said no he was for keeping Obamacare or the Affordable CARE Act\nAnd then he changed his tune and it was such a huge change the Nevada house representative mark ... who is also a Republican was quoted as saying hey it's pretty clear you change your mind you probably ought to tell people why\nOr just for the record neither ... nor his campaign has ever agreed to come on our program to talk about that or any other issue\nOr what about Dean Heller um here's one of his ads\nIn my life I don't have time for politicians talk but don't deliver stop telling\nMe what you're going to you and just doing\nDean Heller and get things done forty pieces of legislation to help our veterans party to pass\nDelivered to victims of sexual assault Dean Heller is our way\nThe all the people speaking in that had are women\nYeah that really really does stand out look I I don't trust falls but by the late a CNN poll of less than a week ago he's losing big with women women preferred Jacky Rosen by fourteen points over hell or fifty two to thirty eight percent that's a huge drop from the summer when how it was at about fifty percent with women\n[noise] what else do we know about ... other than the fact that he sort of straddling between supporting his party and you know voting against his party occasionally\nYeah no that's really the kind of become a central issue although he ... until this race he was a modest not quite a centrist but just sort of you know he would always vote on reliable issues against Yucca Mountain for instance um\nThis is the nuclear waste site in Nevada\nYeah about Ninety miles north of here there's a mountain where they want to store the nuclear waste or for the country\nOr the health care issue he seemed you know reliably sort of in the middle it's sort of when I'm Sheldon Adelson the billionaire a got involved he's been called a peacemaker by the New York times he he called ... and and said you know uh don't opposed Trump on this\nUm that's why the hell are seem to change his vote and um the adolescence in turn have given to his campaign war chest\nIs adults in a huge player still in Nevada politics huge huge player he's worth tens of billions of dollars maybe the most maybe the richest men in the world um oh yeah he's front and center you need him on your side in order to hold office there\n[noise] you know this will be the ... election to see if that is this is this case\nUh any sense of how the cabinet or a nomination fight is playing with voters in Nevada\n... said that sexual assault allegation against Brett Kavanaugh was a hiccup it did explode across the social media landscape here um\nAnd and of course that CNN poll I just talked about showed a huge drop with women supporters for Heller but I haven't seen a poll asking direct question of how women feel about Heller in the aftermath of the Kavanaugh hearings what\nWould you say is the biggest issue for voters in Nevada this November\nThis election is I think it's about the heart and soul of Nevada I Do think President Trump will be on the minds of voters Democrats or Republicans everything when they go to the polls because through his words his tweets his actions he has made politics about values\nAnd I think when people go to the polls they're going to think\n\n[noise] from NPR and W. B. U. R. I'm Jeremy ... I'd rather than young it's here and now another tense day this morning that Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court was voted to to a final floor vote tomorrow that could happen\nAs soon as strongly but senators can change their vote tomorrow so the drama has been will date a key swing Senator Jeff flake voted yes in today's procedural votes had he will vote yes to the nomination tomorrow and that's something big chain\nBut ... is a good man but not the right man for the court at this\nTime and right now we're waiting for another key swing senator Maine Republican Susan Collins to make a statement she voted yes to end debate today but may soon say how she actually plans to vote\nTomorrow Collins is going to be speaking on the Senate for momentarily and we will bring that speech to live when it happens but as we wait we're joined in the studio by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg and NPR congressional correspondent Scott Detrow a welcome to both of you ... what are you expecting and the next few minutes [laughter]\nIf I if I had a crystal ball believe me I would've said what I was expecting before I this is the one of those very dramatic moments because if Susan Collins says that she's going to vote no with Lisa Murkowski then everything\nIs on senator Manchin of West Virginia who's a Democrat in a very red state West Virginia and\nI have no idea whether these three people have been consulting each other the way they did actually up ... up until let's say ... a day or two ago but at the time when we were that all the stuff was going on about was they're going to be\nAny sort of an FBI investigation um mansion Collins Murkowski 'em and flake all were in constant touch with each other\nNow the question is Scott Detrow what do you think's going to happen\nBut I think there are a couple indications that that that ... is going to vote for Kavanaugh the fact that she she viewed the FBI investigation is very thorough a unlike Democrats who said that it was woefully short\nAnd the fact that she just had lunch with Mitch McConnell and McConnell apparently emerged from the lunch saying he felt very confident about how the votes going to go he did not look like a leader suddenly scrambling to get the nomination across the finish line\nLike you know one of you either demeanor Scott just remind us what's the mass here tomorrow I mean what what ... you know what happened to this a tie ... changes as we said right now it's fifty one forty nine to move it forward to ... what do\nWe look you've got your guy and man it man okay\nAh the the Senate is divided fifty one forty nine Republicans that that's fifty one seats Democrats of forty nine seats are today's a cloture vote was a party line vote with two exceptions Murkowski hop to the Democrats to vote no mansion hop to the Republicans to vote yes\nSo if there's one more no votes and there was today and it's fifty fifty than vice president Mike Pence comes and breaks the tie which would certainly be unprecedented for a Supreme Court confirmation vote\nThe outside that their own futures are in their minds more than anything else perhaps that they're thinking about whether this is whether it's Joe mansion or whether it's Susan Collins or or others that they're thinking about what it means for them politically coming up in the midterms\nAbsolutely Joe mansion that's the case more than anyone else Joe mansion is a Democrat running for reelection in West Virginia where President Trump is wildly popular\nHe somebody who supported a Trump last nominee Neil Gorsuch and uh before before the Ford allegations arose look very likely to vote for judge Kavanaugh\nMentions in a tough spot and I really don't think he wants to be viewed as the decisive vote but that's where he is because if he if he votes for cabinet if he helps get Kevin on the on the court as the lone Democrat and a decisive vote\nDemocrats will will blast him and and and maybe abandoned him over the next few weeks but if you know then uh then he might lose a lot of support and and they work in President Trump's wary of artillery\nYou guys are looking at pictures outside Susan Collins office\nRight now uh it's packed you know tons of people there and of course that you you will know they've been people in the corridors of the capital you know for the last couple of weeks but a huge crowd there now\nAnd then you just you're thought because everybody's in same sort of new territory and what happens if the vice president has to break a tie what what's your thinking about having a\nVet Kavanaugh heading towards the Supreme Court potentially it sounds like you know most likely\nA tie vote the armor the designer at that time yeah I'm sure that he and Mitch McConnell\nWill think that that is better than losing\n'em and that he will go there and people will forget that it was a tie vote or that the vice president broke the tie on\nAnd I I don't actually think that that\nIt may be significant in some historical sense but given the number of rules that have been changed or broken in the last two years to get through first Neil Gorsuch when\nI'm Republican leader McConnell a lead the fight and it wasn't much of a site because they had the votes to get rid of the filibuster rules so that\nYou could confirm somebody with a simple majority instead of needing sixty votes so that was the first one then there were all the\nRules that were broken or or\nLong term a customs of consulting senators from states over a lower court judge chips and the Trump\nPeople who could be considered at one time that used to be one or two at most in a single hearing now is you know a half dozen\nSo when it comes to judge ships the Republicans\nWho have had locked down control of this process have changed a lot of rules just having the vice president cast the deciding vote I I think would not rank high among them\nWas actually going to ask someone who's seen as a partisan I you know that that a tie had to be broken but also that you have a retired chief justice Stevens come out and say he was against him or you have you know he's someone who I\nThink you tell me I'm like recent nominees actually worked in the political realm in the Bush White House ah was accused of handling other controversial nominations of judges William prior and Charles Pickering and saying he wasn't involved in an email showed he was involved\nI'm going to have to ask you to hold that thought because I think\nWe will says ma'am surging harmful suspend until this [noise] ... order and the gallery [noise]\n... [noise]\nObviously I think we're seeing Susan Collins about to announce a decision is on the floor but there were protesters on the floor [noise]\n\nAs [noise]\nAs a reminder to our gas and the galleries expressions of approval or disapproval are not permitted in the Senate galleries Center for main\nMr President\nMr President the five previous times that I've come to the floor to explain my vote on the nomination adjusted to the United States Supreme court\nI have the gun my floor remarks explaining my decision what the recognition of the solemn nature\nAnd the importance of the occasion\nBut today we have come to the conclusion of the confirmation process\nThat has become so dysfunctional it looks more like a caricature up I got her level political campaign\nThan a solemn occasion\nWithin moments of that announcement special interest groups raised to be the first to oppose and including one organization that didn't even bother to fail and the judges name on its ... press release\nThey simply road\nThat they opposed Donald Trump's nomination out X.\nTo the Supreme Court\nThe United states a number of senators joined the race to announce their opposition but they were beaten to the punch by one of our colleagues who actually announced opposition\nBefore the nominees identity was see even know\nSince that time we have seen special interest groups with their followers into a frenzy\nBy spreading misrepresentation and outright falsehoods about judge Kavanaugh's judicial record over the top rhetoric\nAnd distortions up his record and testimony at its first hearing produced short lived headlines which all those ... hours later and continue to live on and be spread\nThe ... decision which legalize same gender marriages as an important landmark\nHe also cited Justice Kennedy's recent masterpiece cage cakes shop opinion for the court's majority stating that\nQuote the days of treating gay and lesbian Americans are gay and lesbian couples as second class citizens who are in theory or in dignity and words are over in the Supreme Court and\nOthers have suggested that the judge holds the extreme views some birth control in one case judge cabinet encourage that does favor or both sides of the political spectrum for seeking to ensure the availability of contraceptive services for women\nWhile minimizing the involvement of the employers with religious objections\nAlthough his critics frequently over and look at this point judge Kavanaugh's dissent\nRejected arguments that the government did not have a compelling interest in facilitating access to contraception in fact he wrote that the Supreme Court precedent strongly suggested that there was\nA compelling interest in ... access to birth control\nThere is also been considerable focus on the future of abortion rights based on that\nProtecting biz raid is important to me to my knowledge judge Kavanaugh\nIs the first Supreme Court nominee\nTo expressed the view that precedent is not merely a practice and tradition\nBut rooted in article three of our constitution itself he believes set precedent and not just the judicial policy it's constitutionally dictated to pay attention and pay the two roles of\nIn other words precedent is into a goal or an aspiration it is a constitutional tenet that has to be followed except in the most extraordinary circumstances\nThe judge further explain that precedence provide stability predictability reliance and fairness there are of course rare and extraordinary times where the Supreme Court which writes the overturn a precedent\nThe most
