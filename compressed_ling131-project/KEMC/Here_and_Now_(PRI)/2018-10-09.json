I'm Peter O'Dowd this this year and now big news today at the White House Nikki Haley and now she is resigning as ambassador to the United nations at the end of the year she and President Trump made the announcement in the oval office thinking\nTo the United nations has been very special to me she's done an incredible job [noise] she's a fantastic person very important play but she also is somebody that get\nNPR's Scott Horsley joins us now he's got this felt like something of a surprise to quite a few people what did Hayley say about why she was ...\nI think it surprised a lot of people both uh here in the U. S. and in the international community she didn't really offer an explanation for the timing except to say she she needs a break after six years of South Carolina governor and the last nearly two as ...\nA a ... and a ... that\nGiven that the timing on this Tuesday Morning is a is a little little interesting\nI'm thinking back to the twenty sixteen election campaign Haley was a very vocal critic of the president's they've also disagree that time since she's joined his can over the past two years but if you read their body language today in the oval office listen to what they were saying um they were very cordial how that relationship of all over the past couple\nOf years she has been a loyal soldier and the Trump Administration and in this case loyalty might sometimes mean telling the president things he doesn't want to hear areas where she disagrees with him\nWhen that anonymous op ed came out in the New York times the number of weeks ago from a administrative insider Haley was critical of that approach and said when she has\nA criticism she takes it directly to the president she doesn't necessarily air it out in public\nAnd that idea of keeping dirty laundry in the background extends to their their photo op and the oval office today\nLet's here's more from this morning Haley talking about some of the Trump administration's accomplishments\nWhat has happened in the United states on foreign policy now be nice\nIf we were going to do something we fall when the weather was whether we sang country ... Scott\nWhat is Nikki Haley's record as UN ambassador and how much credit does she get ... for what we just heard\nWell actually we should say the international uh surveys by the Pew Research center suggested a attitudes in most countries towards the United states and the president have fallen rather sharply since Trump took office\nAlthough it is certainly true that the president has demonstrated if he says he's gonna blow something up he does whether it's a airstrip in Syria or the Iran nuclear deal\nOr you have definitely seen the U.S uh\nUh pushing forward with the president's America First agenda and Haley has been a an effective and the president today said glamorous advocate that agenda uh you can see it in the way the U.S\nA has\nA a more aggressive posture towards Israel I'm moving the U.S embassy there for example to Jerusalem\nAnd Nikki Haley famously criticize those who criticize that move saying the U.S would would take names most notably of course the U.S has pulled out of the Paris climate accord we we saw the report this week from the un climate agency\nTo testify today a panel of judges are reviewing that request NPR national correspondent ... long is following this story he joins us now I ... I Would say you have I Know rents thousands of government documents about this what did you learn from them about how the citizenship question came up out in the first place [noise] all\nThese documents were part release in part as part of the lawsuits over the citizenship question and it really key document is an internal memo written by commerce secretary Wilbur Ross who asked our secretary oversees the Census Bureau and the twenty twenty cents is\nAnd it it he says that he initially thought about adding a citizenship question to twenty twenty cents is as soon as shortly after he became ... the Senate confirmed him as the commerce secretary so this would be late February of twenty Seventeen and then a over those months he\nWorked with his staff at the commerce secretary to find a way to get this question a citizenship question on to the census and this is a question that asks is this person a citizen of the United states\nIt's a topic that the Census Bureau has not asked all us households since the Nineteen fifty cents is although there have been a there's been a citizenship question on a smaller Census Bureau survey that's now known as the American Community Survey\nWhat reasons then does the administration gave her why it doesn't want secretary Ross to testify about it at least once a thing about its reasons\n[noise] well the Justice Department or which is representing a commerce secretary Wilbur Ross and the Trump Administration these lawsuits their attorneys are saying that the judges should\nDecide these lawsuits based on the documents these internal documents that they're released as part of the lawsuits\nAnd not on depositions questioning of Wilbur Ross ah and trying to get into his intend to his mindset but that's exactly what the plaintiffs in these lawsuits and you know dozens of states cities and other groups that want this question removed\nThey say they really want to a better understand exactly why commerce secretary Wilbur Ross went to add this question because the Trump Administration has said\nThey wanted to add to because of the voting rights act and he wanted responses from a citizenship question to better enforced section to the voting rights act which has protections\nAgainst discrimination of racial and language minorities are essentially to make sure that those groups have the right to vote 'em that the law the federal government has relied on other\nAnother kind of citizenship data from the American Community Survey of um\nAnd it needs it on the descending on the twenty twenty cents as\nPlaintiffs are very skeptical of that and they're concerned that there are other other motives here involved a one of the internal memos or one of the emails released as part of the lawsuits include a communication between a Kris Kobach the current Republican gubernatorial candidates\nAs well as a former vice chair of President Trump's now defunct\nCommission on voter fraud he wrote to Wilbur Ross are trying to lobby Wilbur Ross to addict citizenship question and his concern\nWas that undocumented unauthorized immigrants are counted\nIn census numbers used to divide up\nThe congressional seats are among the states after the census\nOr all of this comes at a really pivotal time for the Census Bureau itself on the Senate has not yet confirmed President Trump's new appointee to lead the agency\nOr the Twenty one twenty cents as it's going to be the first to be conducted in part on line so with all of that going on how prepared is the Census Bureau for what is a massive undertaking well\nThey are the Census Bureau has really anxious to find out exactly will the citizenship question that Wilbur Ross edible at stay or will it go and we probably won't find out until a few months\nAnd that's really pushing up against a deadline that the Census Bureau spacing of what exactly prints on the forms are this will be the first online census but paper will play an important part for live households that may not be comfortable I don't have access to Internet and so they will be paper\nAnd so this is a really big question right now and that hopefully the lawsuits will resolve\nA from the Census Bureau perspective and other big questionable they the sense of being able to hire enough workers to collective uh information from households around the country\nOkay thank you NPR national correspondent ... long thanks a lot\nYou're welcome the anonymous British graffiti artist Banksy made headlines over the weekend by regain his own artwork to self destruct\nHis painting of a little girl letting go of a heart shaped balloon began to shred itself just after it was sold for nearly one point four million dollars it's southern ... in London this latest stunt has the art world buzzing and many more people wondering once again who is Banksy\nSylvia ... has been exploring that question for the sun in London I said\nHey and first your thoughts when you saw that painting slide down the picture frame in shreds at the auction\nOh my goodness I see a hot still paying maintenance and the question was why is it happening in and in fact with how how is it happening because obviously at its height\nThat was their first introduction to Banksy so tell us what we know about him because he's a a a man we think who is famous for being mysterious\nHe's absolutely famous being mysterious and he is known as the ... of the uh swelled and he's ... he's an enormous English artist he's a street and graffiti artists that he kind of gets known as a political artist as well I'm kind of showed up on the scene by the nineties um\nOn his black originally highlights the laws are corruption and inequality and society but he didn't have a humorous way nowadays it's humid it's slightly less and he takes them a series trained in his walk 'em as you say he's never been on moss that there are\nHundreds of theories as to who he could be um and we still they there's a big theory that he was in the ... when the painting was shredded\nWow so let's talk about some of the theories then what do you know 'cause there are people who who think they've seen him at work do we want have been installations on a wall somewhere or in what you know we don't know who he is so um what are some of the theories about about who this ... this mysterious or this might be\nThey have ranged from him being a painter and decorate to to another graffiti artist named king ... and people say he's Damian Hess people even say that\nYou know banks he may well be a woman and there's another theory that he's and not just one person he is a collection of artists it's just because he's such a a an icon of ministry the the theories range from what could potentially be the tree to something very outrageous and I think there was a\nBond that they said he was the ... mind if the bonds\nAnd because every time that bad and performed in this that and they ... the ... pop and the guy had to come out and say and it's definitely not me I have a creative bone in my ...\nWhat what do you think he was trying to say by ... painting\nIn my opinion and I think he's trying to say that his wife is not for sale it's not the fast time has what has gone up for sale and and it's something that has been done without his consent\nThis time I had to see I I this is just my past and opinion on the opinion that setting people I ... that the painting and the shutting if the painting was away at him saying my\n... for one pass and it's for everybody and because this painting it shut it off to the humble wet and it was a way of him saying they swap doesn't belong to anything\nTo one passed and he does it in public space that he does and in places where it would be very difficult to me than anybody to claim that that all black\nAnd I think that's what he did he wants his message and he wants his what to be for everybody rather than one passage take ownership cars at other theories I've had a he wants his wife to have a great ...\nOf the times I've had that he wants his what the priceless that could be it could be a number of things and and my personal opinion is that he just doesn't want anyone to in his message\nNow one of the questions people are asking is how do you hide a shredder inside a picture frame without anybody noticed the other news the auction house was in on this\n... and because he has ... Instagram Shea how he went about building the frame himself and installing a shredder inside and I think he was the passage in on that um\nIt could it could very well it's been someone inside the base in on it and maybe a friend who may be another another graffiti artist he may be lacking that but I ...

B. U. R. I'm ... I'm Peter O'Dowd this year and now\nPeople living along the Florida Panhandle are rushing to prepare today for hurricane Michael the storm is expected to make landfall tomorrow is a major hurricane with wind speeds of at least one hundred and ten miles per hour\nJeff Hoffman is director and chief meteorologist of the Florida public radio emergency network he's in Gainesville, Florida a hijab it's good to have you back again today\nOh good afternoon Peter I wish it was better circumstances that we are talking but good afternoon Jia and what are those circumstances and a lot has changed in the last twenty four hours and it has it has and let me get right to the point about something this you know when we talk about hurricanes and we've talked a lot about several in the last two or three years\nUh we always prepare for what could be the reasonable worst case scenario this one more than Florence I think a potentially it could be a worst case scenario or it could achieve that status for some locations in the panhandle of Florida I say that with the most\nStraightforward tone and my voice as possible uh this hurricane is continuing to strengthen it could have winds of one hundred twenty five miles per hour at landfall near Panama City or just to the east\nAnd we're talking about potentially a catastrophic storm surge event and some of the coastline that's the most vulnerable in Florida to a storm surge stretching all the way through Appalachia bay the big band and all the way over to the nature coast\nHow close to cedar key So Peter I Can't stress enough you know Harvey was an extreme event infringe terms of its rain Florence was also an extreme event in terms of its rain this one has the potential to also be an extreme event for wind as it comes to shore tomorrow\nLet's talk about that storm surge you mentioned at the geography of Florida and the Florida Panhandle they're locals call it the Big Bend area what is the geography have to do with how bad that storm surge could be\nWell two things are really working against a are working to enhance the surge in that area but get shallow shelf waters so think of a\nA bath tub being pretty deep it's pretty hard to to you know splash water out of a bath tub because it's so deep but didn't think of a you know something that's a little more shallow or the water can easily move out of it and the winds are going to push and drive that water\nOr miles inland in some areas and then also the ... of the coastline kind of access to funnel to funnel that water especially up near uh the Big Bend region or so when you take that even if the store and ... and it may be moved further to the west I spoke earlier just a few minutes ago actually at the national Hurricane Center specialist there\nAnd he confirmed with me that it doesn't really matter at this point how close the center comes to cities like Appalachia cola points they ...\nMatters and this is a significant in life threatening storm surge of for those areas and it's\nNot just Florida the entire state of Alabama is under an emergency declaration and it could this storm could eventually track over the Carolinas which of course we're still cleaning up after Hurricane Florence ... what are you watching for outside of the Florida Panhandle\nWhile we just a touch base with our partners in South Carolina 'cause we provide weather coverage for them as well and they're preparing for\nUh some flooding from this it's going to the storm's going to be moving in a fast enough pace but any water right now in eastern portions of South Carolina and southern portions in North Carolina is bad news it's it's going to take some time to assess how this will affect river levels over time but that's the big concern there\nAnd here doesn't become a what we call it a nor'easter almost it's going to become a very strong extra tropical low or post tropical low and really it'll have some wind and water impacts all the way up into the mid Atlantic states\nUm and we were so captivated and curious by why our generation in particular feels the need to kind of public we mourn and be a part of community by any means necessary and we wanted to explore that further\nWell but in this case evidence in a he's a kid that just\nGets it every day trying to have a better day in fact he's in therapy and part of his um assignment in therapy has been to write a letter to himself deer Evan Hansen you know kind of telling himself that how he's going to have a good day and what happens is that this young man Connor also a troubled classmate but he presented kind of a bully\nHe finds one of the letters takes it home after he killed himself his parents\nThink that it's a letter he's written to Evan Hansen your editor Hanson and so he's they think their best friends and for Evan Hansing kind of gets caught in this did that spirals out of control and also kind of changes him Steven Livingston\nThis idea that he suddenly finding respect from people and an entree into school life because there's this false idea about him that's very compelling\nYeah well I think he makes that decision ultimately to just kind of keep going with this story because everything he's always wanted comes true but it's also about the people around him are ... by the story as well I um he feels as though he's giving something to them\nYeah the young man's family they want to embrace this you know best friend of their son who of course is and I mean it's just heartbreaking and it's also heartbreaking to hear Evans mother a struggling single mom when she finds out Evans been taken in by Congress family because she can't give him a lot of things that they\nYou have to ... you were able to put those feelings into a song [noise] what's it like now there's a ... novel you don't have music to get across these characters\nKnow it's true um it's not that we talked about at the beginning of the process with vowels which was you know how do you take the would become a sort of temple moments when the musical how do you take that in translated into a book it is an interesting process of how do you get inside a character's head in the same way that a song does and that's why I think it does work so well as ...\nIn the way to the song does so I think it does translate well and uh and same token we also felt like we wanted this to be a different experience from the musical and so we weren't ... every time there's a huge song moments we have to have a big moment in the book and we have to capture that huge thing because we want this to be its own experience and to live on its own\nNow really any uh ... this is very special to people all these characters and especially ... really means something to young people then he's in your hands\nI'm Glad I didn't speak to you before beginning the novel yes lots of sweaty hands still sweaty hands in fact it was the sweaty hand line I'm In Evan first monologue in the show that I was like this is me I can write this\nBecause we should say and then also had sweaty hands\nThat's right he's trying to will his hands not to be sweaty by by even thinking about them being sweaty hair becoming more sweaty I've been through that rabbit hole before where I felt like I knew how to do this or emotion I knew how to do it at the same time I did think it was sort of an unfair challenge given the popularity\nAnd the intensity with with which people\nHad attached themselves to have and and the other characters\nWell talk more about this notion that you're writing about suicide you Erica I'm imagining be careful not to romanticize this\nFor sure um suicide is something um that I have experience with let's just say I know um was the other guys have stories of their own so I was definitely sensitive to that fact\nBut we all wanted to know more about Connor the guy's definitely that was a a um a goal of theirs and and the mission they gave me tell us more about Connor we have these ideas of him can you make these work\nOkay I can I think I can make some of this work really it started with just finding his voice at one point they said like we we want to give Congress some happiness in the show we're only seeing just this small glimpse of Connor and it's torture it's him taking his life\nI'm In the book we get to know more about life before that and part of his life\nHe did he\nDid he ever experienced joy I'm or was it all you know I'm darkness\nThey don't wanna give anything away but I have to say we actually find out ... and we find out this crushing thing that happened to him yeah some people may not want to know that you have this\nHow much do we want to know obviously you leave the show wanting to know more about Connor but do you really want to know more about counter or do you want to imagine\nMore about Connor and I think what we found in the book um especially with vowels treatment of it is that we learn many reasons why Connor goes the way he does and Evan goes the way he does\nAnd it was important to us that it not feel mano causal I'm like there's this one thing that ... that um you know is the reason Connor is the way he is or Connor does what he does\nYou know and I I think it's pretty successful in that\nIt also feels like a cautionary tale for times\nOf what it's like to suddenly get swept up in media ... and his friends become a you know since ... interviewed by everyone across the country it's a cautionary tale you know what can happen when suddenly or you don't even know what you're doing it and you're on a national stage there's that\nBut a bench pass it and I just didn't ... I understand that why you did they did like to do how much to do more in a book than you did in the musical your fans we're already doing it than fiction they were they were writing about Evan Connor and what might happen\nYeah this is Justin you know that that was something that was inspiring to us in terms of doing the novel adaptation was seeing that there were a fence around the country around the world who had never seen the show maybe they listen to the gas ... watched a clip on line or something and\nThey were beginning to create their own stories with these characters and interactions that might have been between evident Connor and and I'm a particular curiosity about Connor which is you know partially what inspired us people wanting to engage with these characters and that's what gave us the confidence to do this and the first place\nIt is a conversation starter for families you know moms can see elements of their kids that their kids won't talk about you know out loud and and and kids will see elements of their parents said that humanize them and ultimately it's really about how we relate to our family members how we hide ugly trees about ourselves\n\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

children mostly from Syria Iraq and Africa\nHave arrived in Spain Italy and Greece this year every day more than one hundred people arrive on the Greek island of Lesbos the first places they see are those of humanitarian aid workers to help them ...\nThe trauma up close nearly every day for months and that takes a toll they have high levels of depression exhaustion and even pi TST that can last for years\nNow the George Washington university global mental health program is drawn up a version of the Hippocratic Oath to address the problem the ancient originated increase it calls for new physicians to swear to abide by ethical standards Phillip ... is one of the doctors behind this new version\nIt's still the general principles of caring for patients first not doing mischief knowing one's limits keeping confidences that continue to this day\n... is professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at George Washington University School of medicine and health science he and his colleagues wrote the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian workers based on what Nineteen agencies told them\nThe way we turned to humanitarian ideals was by basing it on the resilience training but we were doing\nSo we were you that people take care of their team take care of themselves recognizing that there was a cascade of care\nThat has to occur if people are going to take care of refugees they have to take care of themselves first they have to take care of their teams they have to make sure that they stay with them there are areas of expertise\nOne of our colleagues at George Washington tells a story of when she was working in Africa\nAnd as a psychiatrist she was asked to do a Syrian section on a pregnant refugees so the the temptation to go beyond one's expertise is really difficult uh in in desperate\nSays you're saying that in this Hippocratic Oath you're able to give her permission to say I can't\nRight that's exactly right so defining the limits of one's expertise what one can do safely without the resources that one needs is one of the key principles of this work do you think\nThis is something that actually the humanitarian aid workers will really refer to or is it just kind of nice to have the guideline there\nIt's a it's a great point the our hope is that it can be kind of a unifying project for the folks that we work with uh we've had a translated into Greek already were making a gift of it to the groups that were going back to work with a next month so we're hoping it'll have some traction\nOne of the things that you and your colleagues have noted is the potential culture clash as Muslim refugees\nA pretty homogenous quite community how has that caused problems and how are you dealing with that we've\nBeen impressed that the people who work with the refugees have their own immigrant stories so there's a shared experience a shared humanity\nThat even those who are more western or European generate that they show when they're working with folks from North Africa I'm a Middle East\nSo we learned that many of them had grandparents great grandparents who were part of the genocidal exchange with populations in the Nineteen twenties [noise]\nIn the fall of ... they were refugees from Asia Minor\nEveryone seemed to have an immigrant story they had married someone from outside Greece these workers you talking about that's right that's right so there was a sense that we're all immigrants in one sense and therefore this kind of work takes on a shared a humanitarian motivation\nDid have one more question um I have no need for quite some time and I know you're as you said Greek American you go to Greece quite often because of the refugee crisis\nBut I Wonder what it was like for you to be in one of the cradle of modern medicine implementing a very different kind of hypocritical for a very different reason from what the original one was drawn up for me personally what is this like for you\nIt's an opportunity to take the expertise that I've learned here in the states and take it back to the origins of you know my family's migration in the Nineteen fifties so my family left Greece after er during the civil unrest there after World War two\nAnd to be able to go back and offer what I can we were just there in September\nTalking to folks in so long ago and asked them about the work that we do and a recruiting help from the Greek psychiatric community so being able to collaborate in this way has been both professionally I'm personally fulfilling\nPhilippine Dallas thank you thank you Lisa That's Dr Phil can deal is who is part of the George Washington global mental health program that's drawn up the Hippocratic Oath for humanitarian aid workers back to the U.S now in a story from the American west walk

window it's edible\nBut he says where people eating it because it was a delicacy or because they were starving with medicine or part of a special occasion Julie Coleman wonders if these trees might reveal patterns about how tribes like the you were moving across the landscape she's an archaeologist with the San Juan national forest [noise]\nA GPS unit get point pots and each tree and hopefully we'll see a pattern and you might show trails and all the ways\nMark Mitchell says they're running out of time\nBut we really feel the urgency of it no drought could kill these trees or in expanding beetle infestation could crippled them with the fungus called blue stain or wildfires could erase them\nSome of the big fires that we've had in Colorado in the last five or six years have taken some of these streets we know that\nThe time could also get them some of these trees could be five hundred years old like this one\nOh wow that is cool\nThat I was hoping we would find a lot of these\nFor
