is here and now hurricane Michael just made landfall as a category for storm near Mexico Beach Florida with winds of at least a hundred and fifty five\nMiles per hour meteorologist Jeff Hoffman with the Florida public radio emergency network is with us now ah from Gainesville, Florida Jeff a hundred and fifty five miles an hour that's the same wind speed that we saw from Hurricane Maria when it hit Puerto Rico or as a category ... storm\nAnd it's also the same Wednesday that was further now analyzed by Hurricane Andrew I'm that exact wind speed of course the scientist will go in and figure out to be a lot of forensics down on the storm Jeremy or we know now it's a historic storm never in our at least recorded history has been a storm this strong hitting the Florida Panhandle\nUh so yeah our hearts go out to those in the path of it right now in instilling the next twelve hours Jeremy we have a long way to go and many more residents further inland and portions of Florida and even Georgia that are going to\nRight at this moment well um we know that there's been ground truth already from the wind speeds we've had a lot of visuals of that and reports of that I'm I'm really concerned for our listeners who might be further inland and thought this was going to fall apart\nUm it it it's coming across the Florida Panhandle in a pretty low terrain area and it's moving fast enough that we're still probably have some hurricane force winds in the extreme southeastern part of Alabama and much of southwest Georgia officially a the storm is not expected to weaken to a tropical storm\nUntil it gets close to Macon Georgia a late tonight so there's still a large area of land that's going to be a cut up with trees coming down and possibly some structural damage\nOr most of this will be west of Tallahassee so there was some better news for Tallahassee still some some ways to go though some tropical storm force winds there but we cannot let our guard down further inland just because now it's come ashore uh in fact that the back into that ... Jeremy still lashing Panama City with one hundred plus ... wins\nWell what would you advise people who are further and then hopefully people who are on the coast of either sought shelter or are they have left the area but if they're further inland in places like let's say Tallahassee or even into Georgia and and the Carolinas what should people be doing\nWell but the next six to twelve hours just don't let your guard down just because you might think the worst is pastor maybe never reaches you\nOut the storm changes kind of shape and structure after it comes ashore and moves inland all of a sudden not all the hazards we're right near the center you got out or ban that still could spark up a tornado\nA wind gusts could still really be high and somebody's out or bans so for the next six to twelve hours day very vigilant and then that might warn word for everybody in the path of this storm after passing this is just patients\nUh there is going to be a lot of a response necessary for this\nUm and uh we have a lot of people out of populated areas in fact it's so just patience for the cruise to get their Germany there's been a really sobering statistic in the last five ten years\nAnd most of the deaths from hurricanes have been occurring after landfall post storm or we call them indirect deaths or almost all eighty of them are much more indirect deaths after the storm so everyone needs to really stay smart and the patient and not\nA you know practice a page um safety with the generators to watch out for the power lines down just stay in a safe location until you until you've been advised that it's okay to move about after the storm\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners off W.

[noise] now you have started taking classes in graphic design or you're fifty three right now yes and so I was doing a career change\n[noise] it's different it's something I really enjoy\nSo we'll see how it goes it may or may not lead to anything it may just be something that I that I Do on my own that I enjoy it may not be a real real career change I met you might just enjoy this retirement and\nUh spending time with my family and walking my dog and exploring Flagstaff northern Arizona area\nHow're you doing physically after all those surgeries\nI think I'm doing better now I'm and I'm having the opportunity to go bike riding now and do much more um activities mentally here it's much better because it's a whole new space it's a whole new start\nFrom our interview originally had interviewed a Gary ... who is a sergeant with the San Bernardino police\nAnd he got a hold of me and we've been doing law enforcement presentations with Gary throughout the United states and so that's actually been very healing to be able to talk and to talk to law enforcement about what happened and to get their perspective and they like to hear from that\nAnd the victims and survivors point of view and you met because of our story yes well he actually heard me on the on that um interview\nAnd reached out to get a hold of me and then we connected and um since we've been excellent you know really really good friends in fact he just came through Flagstaff a couple of weeks ago we had lunch\nGroup and what do you tell people when you go around and talk about shootings\nSo we tell them our experience they want to know what they can do better and there's a few things that they learned each of us had such a different perspective in that\nNine one one calls my supervisor who's doing this also he was our our chief of our department and he\nGives his perspective from a supervisor position watching the entire thing but also feeling responsible for everyone in the room so each person sort of has their own net chip\nAs what they experienced and what was running through their mind and\nHow law enforcement really how they can improve their responses for the victims side I Know quite a few of my co workers all they solve is law enforcement they're boots\nAnd in their mind they thought this was the bad guys coming to shoot them and so you know the law enforcement hadn't really thought about that but just the shoes someone sing issues alone would make people assumed they were bad\nI recently met a um teacher from Parkland high school in Florida who run into the building to help save people\nDuring the shooting and after I found that out about him I didn't know what to say to him for for several minutes I sat there and I I I just didn't even know do do I thank him doing a great job or or whatever when people meet you and find out what you've been through what are those interactions like\nUsually they're surprised that I'm outwardly not more injured that they can't tell from looking at me with my clothes on and just walking around that I was shot twice\nI think they expect to see someone ... much more crippled maybe even looking more emotionally crippled if that makes sense so typically they're more shock that I went through that and I'm standing there looking kind of to normal to them\nIs it difficult for you to talk to them about what happened\nIt's not now I think a thanks to these presentations and I've done it's actually been really healthy to repeat the story and just said the story it's become um\nMore\nMaybe I don't know natural or it's allowed me to remove myself a little bit from it I think it's actually it's been very healing for me\nThere have been so many other shootings since we last spoke ... have your views changed at all on or have you\nIt's so frustrating to me and\nIt just always seems that at the ease of obtaining weapons here but especially the the weapons like the air fifteens and these\nWeapons that are made to hunt human beings really that's what they're made for they're not made for going in sport shooting or hunting it's made for hunting humans\nAnd it's frustrating to me that there are so readily available in this country because it seems that all the shootings these mass shootings have involved that type of weapon\nAnd do you think that anything will be done about that\nI don't think anything's going to be done any time soon unfortunately now\nWhen we talk to you in twenty sixteen you showed us some of the things that people had given you to help you recover a star of hope at a medal given to you after the attack by one of your nurses [noise] do you still have\nThose things yes and actually I'm Dexter the nurse I presented him with the star of hope\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.

Scott\nIn Germany and with me in the studio ... BCC in Pasadena as Mary Plummer whose political correspondent for K. PCC Hi Mary Jane Eyre so let's start with the governor's race Jerry Brown is not able to run again because of term limits the race is between his lieutenant governor Gavin Newsom\nA Democrat and Republican businessman John Cox Scott you just moderated the first and possibly only debate this week on ... D let's listen to a little of what Gavin\nNewsom said first the California Dream is predicated on social mobility\nThe richest and the poor state we have to mind that gap we have to address the issue of cost of housing we have to address the issue of affordability broadly we have to address the issue of homelessness and we have to tackle the vaccine issue of health care and the issues related to health care that are devouring the state budget\nAnd here's Republican John Cox\nA vision of the state being affordable unlivable for people or I think we can do that if we get rid of the special interest influence in Sacramento uh the interest groups that have habits Sacramento a benefit from the status quo\nLive here and that's why they're leaving\nSounds like they both agreed that California is getting to be an affordable for a lot of people ah Scott knew some has a big lead in the polls is Cox have a chance\nWell it's tough the math is tough for him the last time a Republican won a statewide race in California two thousand six his name was Arnold Schwarzenegger\nAnd the Republicans have just seen their share of the electorate shrinking there now literally a third party in California Democrats are about forty four percent of the electorate\nA decline to state independent voters no party preference voters twenty seven percent in the GOP now down to about twenty five percent just a quarter of the electorate so in order for somebody like John Cox when you have to have a lot of appeal to independent voters in some conservative Democrats and so we just really haven't seen that yet in the polling I mean it's just a tough\nPlace California is for Republicans to win state wide\nIt's new some wins a merry will be basically like another term for Jerry Brown or different\nYou know Governor Brown has been very aggressive against many of President Trump's policies and new indicated he'd pick a similar approach especially on issues like immigration health care environmental issues a nuisance support sanctuary cities for example he backs California to coming at zero carbon emissions state\nAnd but there are a couple of areas where he's indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily than brown has\nAnd one of those areas as early childhood and during the recession the funding for programs like in St toddler care and pre school was severely cut and those have not been restored under governor Jerry Brown news and has indicated he'd be willing to invest more heavily there and we're seeing that issue reflected in TV ads that he's running as well\nAs you mentioned Jerry Brown has gone up against President Trump to the state has sued the Trump Administration more than a dozen times over everything from environmental issues to immigration President Trump slam California right back here he is earlier this year at an event touting his plan for a border wall\nI think the government is doing a terrible job running the state of California you know property to California I Will\nSay I don't think too much about my property anymore but I have great property taxes are way way out of whack\nBefore there was such a move pretty soon then if you don't have safety meeting if you don't have this kind of wall the drugs are pouring through in California that do it\nScott a there are several congressional races in California that are up for grabs this year how is President Trump's plan\nBlue states Jeremy a Donald Trump is not popular in California I mean Hillary Clinton got more than three million more votes than Donald Trump did and he's still way underwater last statewide poll showed him in about thirty percent approval rating maybe a little higher among likely voters\nSo uh I don't I'm not sure the Republicans who are running the incumbents running for reelection or the challengers or the newcomers running for open seats necessarily want Donald Trump out here\nUh their problem and these really close races is going to be appealing to independent voters and Donald Trump does not do well with them he was not going to be helpful to these Republican candidates in persuading them to vote for for the Republican and he's congressional races\nAnd Mary ... what are the issues that those independent voters are thinking about this is a state that at like the rest of the country right now has a pretty low unemployment rate if anything the problem is people can't find the workers that they need to fill the jobs it's not like that that's a major issue but obviously affordability is big well what else\nAffordability homelessness here in the LA area we're dealing with a massive a homeless crisis that's an issue that we've seen play out in the governor's race and also in that congressional races and you know there are just as she is an affordability that I think a lot of these new party preference and others\nAt which is what we call the unaffiliated voters here in California I care really deeply about\nUh let's talk about the Senate race in California that's going on long time Senator Dianne Feinstein is facing another Democrat because in California the top two vote getters face each other in the general election state senator Kevin daily own is the one facing Feinstein and Feinstein is weathering some criticism for her handling of the Kavanaugh\nHearings she's the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee here she is a during the hearings\nThis isn't a political battle for power as some that said this is a serious undertaking with serious allegations Scott ... ah\nMaybe [laughter] certainly she's been ahead and every poll she won every single county in California during in the June primary\nUh you know I think Kevin deli on just hasn't been her challenger the Democrat from LA just hasn't really gotten a lot of traction he doesn't have a lot of money the media aren't paying a lot of attention to this race Feinstein so far has refused to debate to give them sort of a platform to get some attention\nUh and and so it's it's really hard that said you know I haven't seen her above forty four forty six maybe forty seven percent of the polls\nSo uh and and and because there's two Democrats at the top of the ticket a lottery\nBecause of those are people who if they had to pick one of these two Democrats they would probably go with her she is more of a centrist than her opponent\nSo it's possible certainly a it's a it's not entirely clear how this Kavanaugh thing is playing for her I've heard women very strongly defending her that she was re spending Christine Ford and and you know so they're not critical but you know it's I haven't seen\nBroadwell but one thing one thing that we one thing that we have seen is that I'm In Saturday Night live has made fun of the fact that a lot of the people on both sides of the aisle during those Kavanaugh hearings were pretty old she's eighty five years old he's fifty one uh he's talked about that he's careful about it but he used to listen to him talking to us\nAbout the fact that he says he's going to have a new generation of leadership\nI think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated and no longer apply to a to California into the rest of the country\nMarry the age issue is that on voters' minds\nAnd you know I think it is first time especially for younger voters here in California\nAnd daily and arguments are certainly resonates most with the progressive side of the Democratic party here you know if we find a ... twenty sixteen Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign had a very active group of supporters in California\nMany of them are young people getting engaged in politics for the first time some of those folks are resonating more out and looking for a change in the Senate race\nBut as Scott mentioned at the polling indicates you know strong favorability refined sign a so we'd be watching this ahead she seems to have a pretty substantial question right now but we're still you know little little over a little less than a month away\nRight and Scott there's one thing we haven't talked about that has come up in our conversations here in Southern California which is that there is a measure on the ballot to repeal a gas tax that may actually play a role in getting people out to the polls\nWell that's what Republicans were hoping Jeremy they put prop six on the ballot in fact John Cox the Republican candidate for governor really funded that drive to collect the signatures put it on the ballot polling shows it's not as popular\nAs you might expect a because you know everyone pays the gas tax if you drive\nA no one's particularly happy about having to pay it it's about uh twelve cents per gallon tax but it generates five billion dollars a year for transportation roads bridges highways and so the no on sex campaigns don't I think a pretty good job of saying they're trying to take away money to keep our highways in our infrastructure in good shape\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the creators of that law that stimulates software accelerating the pace of engineering and science and

generally the elected person is the softer touch a but he's kind of frontal and I think it makes it a difficult to people understand\nI think in this district because we're not used to that kind of approach but I think the result she's gotten on the budget a tax reform has really help this district help the states\nWhere do you disagree with Trump [noise]\nWell I would've liked to have seen a\nLot of like to have seen a little bit more a provision for California in our tax reform an assault treatment but that really wasn't him that was the Congress\nI think that um [noise]\nI I think

allegations in the litigation from too\nThe ... and it was a civil litigation where you can throw anything against the wall and tried to make it and it went to a jury trial\nSo I really do believe that it's been misrepresented than politicians when they have no record to run on frequently liked to dig up old old filing this was a huge litigation but I was cleared in two thousand Thirteen do you think that that's hurting you know in this race\nWell if you can't defend yourself it does but I've got the ... actually you know are are asking about it now and I'm explaining it it's on my website I

opponent is the guy she was just talking about a lawyer and first time candidate Mike LeBron we met him at his campaign office in San Clemente and I asked him why he's running\nWell for the last two decades I've been involved in a variety of political campaigns are never felt compelled to run a before myself\nA after having been very involved in twenty sixteen election or to help Secretary Clinton\nOr in after seeing that result my wife and I both decided what good is our background or experience or education or relationships the values that we have the values that we want to share with our own children or if we don't stand up and try to do something for our country right now\nHow much of an uphill climb as it for you as a Democrat running in orange county and part of San Diego county\nWell the good news is that in the primary on June fifth fifty one and a half percent of the vote went to the Democratic candidates so the momentum is on our side a President Trump's approval rating in our district is right around forty percent of people are ready for new leadership do you want to see President Trump impeached\nI'm not running on an impeachment platform I Do\nBy Mr Mahler or that or is not politicized or what we have seen with Devin Nunes has as chair of the house intelligence committee is the withholding of relevant testimony and information\nYou know the other side you know they're they're making us to be a beep beep some angry mob or they're saying you know don't give matches due to an arsonist couldn't be further from the truth we care about our country we care about the rule of law there cannot be one set of rules for the president added states and one set of rules for everyone else that's not how\nOur founders so you know created this a

extraordinary number of volunteers more than we'd ever seen\nA and I don't know how much of that was related to a now justice Kevin ... or not but what I can tell you is that uh we're doing everything we can to take nothing for granted over the last month of this campaign we are going to just do an incredible amount of work and I won't predict anything other than that we will work the other side\nWe asked your opponent Diane Harkey about ah something that's been dragging her campaign which is that her husband had to pay a penalty for being involved in a Ponzi scheme she said that's a lie\nWhat do you think um I think the victims ah deserve to be heard and the facts are very simple\nAh her husband a endpoint center of financial was found by both the uh jury as well as a judge and then an appellate court to be a Ponzi scheme to be financial fraud\nAnd dozens of seniors were defrauded out of millions and millions of dollars and her husband her ex husband or they have not paid nearly enough to those victims\nShe also ah in her answer to our question about that tried to connect you to country wide which was responsible for a lot of foreclosures I've seen that on your website you say I was just a junior lawyer working for bank of America which own country wide and nothing to do with that\nAt all she's tried to create false equivalence between uh you know the serious

we are over twenty percent of the county and third largest Asian American population in the nation\nMarion food executive director of the Orange County Asian and Pacific Islander community alliance says the Asian Americans living here are people with roots in the Philippines China Korea Vietnam Japan and more that's been the case for decades the difference now is a greater number of those people were born in the United states\nI think it's probably about thirty to thirty five percent right now I'm Seventy percent of the community is foreign born ... cording to the sense that you see more and more diversity here in orange county and you'll see more of a rising second generation\nThat's important because the politics of the generations can be completely different Alex Kim is principal in CEO of three kings public affairs he's Korean American and a registered Republican who worked as a political consultant for Democrat James ... the former mayor of Los Angeles and Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger the former governor of California\nThe first generation tends to vote Republican\nAnd my second generation friends\nAre more on the Democratic side why is that\nMaybe it's because of\nA little bit of rebellion\nA bit of the same time it's similar to how Cuban Americans Vietnamese Americans come from a country that came from a lot of trauma war types of financial distress the first generation tend to say why would Republicans\nBecause they see the\nThe corruption of government the distrust in government and why the second generation\nI think because of the American values the\nLot of this Korean Americans I grew up in ... uh tend to grow up in urban areas and I think that's part of the processor and urban areas into focus more progressive thinking than more the conservative suburban ideals\nSays one of the first issues on the ...\nFamily separation and chain migration\nAnd the thought of eliminating about because a lot of my relatives came here to chain migration so the question the workforce and how a lot of the small businesses are immigrants come from about chain migration\nSo it seems like Korean Americans the first generation still are more

mean more democratic or\nLiberal Republicans are progressive Republican myself\nHave have definitely some qualms about the key issue\nMany of the first generation Asian immigrants here are small business owners running nail salons dry cleaners restaurants Kim says the Koreans often use Korean community banks because back in the day it was difficult for them to get loans from American banks\nThen there are Vietnamese American business owners like Tam and sunny new and we met them at a cafe sunny owns it in orange county neighborhood called little Saigon\nSunny told us the politics here are shifting [noise]\nDefinitely changing I I think you know you look at generation one which is our parents and and I we we're one point fight and we we grew up we were were not born here in the U.S so we were in Vietnam\nBut we were raised\nIn America so we understand what it means to be an American but we also understand our parents were they came from so we can relate to vote sites and because we can relate to both sides we can see the differences and it's a stark difference what do you mean by that\nI'm not just from a political standpoint but how we do business so speaking just for our business and how we do things our parents always said hey you know what they came from a country where you can't really trust the government so stay away from me so we came over here you see a lot of all this family's\nCash only pay you know what you you don't want to say what we have our own strategies and we don't want to\nShare a best practice because that becomes very competitive as well and that's why for generations that are known\nTo be very fragmented right and um you don't want to collaborate we grew up in America and you know I worked in corporate America and there's there's a lot of collaboration and that's how we actually grew and [noise]\nBeing an American or you know and having it in the city I think that's one of the reasons why we have grown that because we do collaborate and we're showing\n'em or first Jen how parents said look we've worked closely with the city we're sharing a best practice we actually share\nWhat's the what's together and that's one of the big differences from generation one and two\nOutside the cafe in little Saigon our political science attached to a fence at a busy intersection nearly every candidate's name is Vietnamese the only Asian American running for Congress this year in orange county is fifty five year old young Kim a Korean American Republican who worked for the lawmaker she's trying to replace ed Royce\nMy family came to this country we came legally and not because we wanted handout but because we wanted the opportunity America provided to see it on our own\nYoung fume praised by the sea register for
