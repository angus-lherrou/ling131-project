I was working in the place and I was told to go to new Scotland yard and get some testing done with don't just Davis because I was doing very well audience fun people from close circuit television and I didn't have a clue ... until that point\nReally silly and and how does it work for you if you just see a little bit of someone's face like the un ears sticking out from beneath the cap for instance or or an eyebrow is that enough\nIt leaves you'd be amazed last year and a lot of people from the back of the head from above who's but those are\nThe very strange ability but when it when it comes off you are very excited the thing is every single time I look a fight sucking up into the ... if someone is lobbying Iraq style and you also have on well it's a rock star Donald ... put me in a room full of people and pitches\nThat's amazing so you like that I actually love it and those who prepping all just a\nIt's not a burden so in other words I see thousands of faces everyday to I wouldn't want to remember each of the details that I pick up\nIt can be a burden speak Cornish because you could be walking down the street and someone would ... would you they might smile she's think oh I Know that person because you recognize the face but you don't actually know them ... and then like a a don't we know you if the problem is because if you will in the same area qualified and you'll see the fights you recognize that device\nHuh do you have to commit the face or the details of the face to memory or is it involuntary\nIs involuntary um you don't really have to try you can just be walking down the street you'll see that face so many times I recognize\nOh man it wasn't something that you recognize when you were a kid that oh my gosh I've got this strange talent\nNot necessarily correct or did not have a clue awful that everybody could do to yourself though it was a natural but let's see if everyone and so I didn't have a clue but the second ... found out what a super recognized off doing the test with the ... that's ... huh\nYou are as you say took these skills to your police work and let's talk about this case of the Russian spy poisoning I insult very of course you were not involved in this investigation but take us inside that department how would this have played out behind the scenes\nSo I ... I Know the are the guys dealing with it would've been very excited because the whole point is they're going to get lots of footage to view and foster very exciting thing because that gives us time to review the CCTV would never go look for certain people or if not with often taught people from the footage\nSo would you use many different techniques like links to attend discussion Web I keep going for the first each until we moved to ... ... scientists and appearing mostly because of the soup recognizes were recognized that person that we've got some memory and then if we see that person to get enough of it if it was stop building to pitch and then we can start seeing is that the person we're looking full\nNow London as you well know is one of the most surveilled cities in the world there's some estimates that there is something like a million CCTV cameras capturing hours and hours of footage every single day of the year how important is that trove of evidence for you is the detective in ... in that unit\nI think is absolutely brilliant it's estimated about one point five million cameras now in London and I think is absolutely marvelous because\nBeing on that sleep recognize you and I wish I was we used to get so much CCTV come fruits wasps\nAre pictures of suspects the oath I Would not always looking for the suspect sometimes ... victims were looking for missing persons and having all that say CCTV available to you really help solve ... fun people well what kind of cases did you crack a really good well most of his mouth who has a one of ... most wanted\nAnd he was believed to be out of the country of the time so I was in London and I've seen a ... I mean I'm actually not just a suspect I've never met them before about seeing a picture of them full solve going around in the police ... he's giving me folks details but strikes well we lost at the same\nAnd they'd been stopped several times on the police officers who had recognized him the ... most wanted but luckily ... I'm In ... when we took him back to fingerprinted it comes down to the same\nPeople probably shocked when you tell about how you found them\nDid get actual often as we even had one guy\nI'm Josh Davis let's bring you in again from the University of Greenwich what is the science say about how this works\nThe science says we think that she's sort of a night we think that super recognizes a less than one percent of the population very very few people have this ability\nWe found some very small differences in the way the brain function and I think that sort of direction that the research may be going in future\n[noise] is it a matter of having a very very good memory or is it a completely different function of the brain altogether\nWe think it's a different function is it's quite an interesting question that because\nPeople have done research on a world champion soup and memorize is who passed can count hundreds of ... something like this\nAnd when they tested that face recognition ability they found that they would not very good at all on the other hand super recognizes seemed to have average IQ they seem to be average at recognizing other types of objects recognizing so to streams of numbers in words and things like that\nSo it does seem as though it's a unique skill that he's a specific to faces\nWould there be an evolutionary reason why humans might develop a skill that is\nNot in fact almost the opposite because as you could imagine it in sort of pre history people lived in very very small communities\nNeeding to know a large number of faces wouldn't being very necessary so so that's the sort of strange situation as far as the sun is concerned it may be the what's happened is the policy the brain associated with\nOther aspects of object recognition has somehow change slightly too in the super recognizes to become very very good at face recognition but that's a hypothesis that's and that's not the sons definitely well look\nComputers can be trained to recognize faces is well how how does the human brain compare to what artificial intelligence can do\nLike I said we're very very good high quality images computer's operating at about the same level as an average human being super recognizes a still better than the best computers in the world\nBut we low quality images which most CCTV footage is a human beings still beat computers\nI think in the future well what the situation is going to be it's the best\nIdentity decisions what are the limitations that people like Kenny have\nAs a human being leads to sleep unlike a few uh we get taught fatigue there must be limits to how many images and how many people Kenny can say I'm big before before he does get fatigue so that's one limitation of humans\nWell is really I think ... impressive about Kenny scale is he's ability to rule out\nThe huge number of faces that he ... and they'll say ... to him because obviously when they're searching through CCTV footage for ... you know for a suspect Fritz ... most of the time they're actually looking at face these people then not interested in vaccines ... asleep recognize that can do\nIs Josh I Know you've worked with Scotland Yard in the past uh we know they're recruiting people like Kenny from within the force to be tested for this skill but but what about other places\nDo you see super recognizer is being used in this country and the FBI for example or are you noticing this getting some traction in smaller police departments around the world\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

now is Dr Peter pitchers who is president of empty Anderson Dr ... welcome and congrats to you and your colleague on winning a Nobel Prize this\nIs fantastic news of course for Jim for MBR sin but most importantly for cancer patients around the world\nWill tell us a little bit about James Allison's work in immune therapy to attack cancer\nWell Dr Alison is really dedicated his entire life and his research career to understanding how the immune system works and more specifically how it works or in cancer patients and in the biologic setting of cancer and\nHas a main insight was to understand how to block a protein on T cells that acts as a break on their activation in essence enabling those T cells to be freed up to attack cancer cells\nSo explain that in a way that everyday people could understand that 'cause that's you're still probably a doctor level [laughter] well\nIn our bodies we have a group of cells that we think of as the soldiers of the immune system the T cells and those T cells are really held in check to ensure that those cells do not attack normal\nAlso impairs the ability of those cells to attack cancer cells in Dr Allison really understood the underpinnings of how that break works and developed approaches to release that break so that the immune system could in essence target and attack the cancer\nAnd so what has that meant for cancer treatment and general\nWell this is really opened up an entirely new field in cancer treatment that we call him you know therapy and we see that really as a fourth pillar of cancer treatment joining surgery chemotherapy and radiation\nAnd creating entirely new way of approaching cancer treatment that can be combined with the other treatments or sometimes used in isolation alone\nDo you think we're going to get to a place because of this where people don't use chemotherapy and radiation to treat cancer\nAbsolutely I I Do believe that this will lead to insights and two opportunities to see this as a ... form of treatment and allow us to reduce the side effects associated with other treatments as we really look for new ways to treat cancer what\nKind of results have you seen in patients whose cancer treatment includes immunotherapy\nWell we've seen spectacular resolve including\nPatients who are surviving for decades as a result of these novel treatments when we look more specifically at the populations that have been treated by the drug that gems team has developed we can see the twenty percent of those live for at least three years with many patients living ten years and beyond\nThese are really unprecedented results for patients who really had no other options\nGenes Allison started his career at ... or send in Nineteen Seventy seven and then he returned in twenty twelve to work on\nA the empty Anderson moon shots program which we've talked about before basically allowing people to work on things that might pan out it might be game changers or maybe they won't ah ... how many examples like this have you had of the moon shots program really giving you a good results\nWell there's a mood shots program really has enabled us to move into what we think of his team based science and we're seeing tremendous successes as a result of this both scientific discovery as well as policy initiatives that we've moved forward in Washington in Austin and other state capitals\nAccording to the world Health Organization's international agency for research on cancer an estimated Eighteen point one million people will develop cancer and nine point six million will\nRight now right now we're in an unprecedented era of cancer treatment we have the combination of targeted therapy immunotherapy\nAnd the use of science as a way to drive discovery as opposed to the historical approaches of screening the environment for compounds that might have anti cancer a fact\nThis change in research strategy coupled with the types of innovations that are heralded in today's a Nobel Prize awards really open up avenues that create great opportunities for cancer patients in the future\nIs Dr Peter ... the president of the University of Texas Andy Anderson Cancer

Stephen virgin wrote about this he joined us on Skype from Barcelona welcome\nHigh and did they ban cars entirely in ...\nWell they they ban them from the initially from the historic part of the city the medieval city which is about three hundred thousand square majors and then they extended that to a slightly bigger\nA area which is sort of the the Eighteenth nineteenth century part of the city so the city center is calm free and then it's it's it's ringing to buy a areas where you can drive I'd also where there are a lot of places to park and how's that working out\nUm it's working out very well let's say you know like most of these things that was a lot of resistance or people you know associate having cause with their\nPersonal liberty um but I spoke to lots of people while I was there and I couldn't find anyone who criticized the even though you know this is a part of Spain where it tends to rank larger law\nThat's on the Atlantic side of spying on people tend to get into their cause whenever I was writing\nLots of people said to me that just change their habits are they\nWhat about emergency vehicles police fire ambulances\nWell you know all all of them can get who sit in there are also taxes you know the rule was is quite strict I mean the mayor said to me if you want to get married and the old city the bride and groom can come in a car but everyone else falls\nWhat about businesses are are they happy with this because\nRestaurant where they want to go well that was you know that was a business where it was opposed to it exactly on that basis although in these old cities is very very difficult to park so the reality is in fact businesses survive better than in some small towns\nOr were you know they still allow cause upon it because it's just simply nicer to walk around the other thing is that the the the city of thirties combines U.S policy or banning cars\nWere those also banning the building of big shopping centers on the outskirts of town which temp destroy small businesses within the town\nSo you spoke with the mayor of punted ... what did he say about why he wanted to do this\nWell you have you know he basically said that the old city was effectively a dumb said it was uh the people didn't like going now that it was full of abandoned cars that were a lot of drugs and ... and within the first month of come into office basically he cleaned it up and buying cars\nWhich is you know clearly something you know he said he'd been ... you know he's been researching into this for\nSome time before he took office and I think partly because he didn't swiftly was you know there was kind of a fait accompli\nWhat about the uh two missions or what happened to pollution as a result of this\nWill pollution or according to their statistics went down within the city center by about Seventy percent or accidents went down\nA ... to ... uh to almost zero and I think in the past four or five years\nIt's been zero of either either people injured or killed so you know these are significant gains obviously you know it's also you know general game for people's health and people walk or people cycle I'm you know this is what everyone is to some extent aiming for in cities\nNow putting their dress a small city many people probably haven't even heard of it but there is a larger city in Spain Madrid that's actually considering doing something similar what are they thinking about in Madrid um\nMany many cities in Europe are about ... eighty thousand a hundred thousand black on ... so you know what's been done there could easily be applies in the cities and the big city like Madrid obviously\nIt's a different story I think you know what they're aiming for is to ... by ... exclude traffic from the city

I'm Peter O'Dowd this is here and now at the White House this morning President Trump pushed back on claims that he's limiting the scope of the week long FBI investigation and the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nI Want it to be comprehensive I actually think it's a good thing for judge Kevin ... I think it's actually a good thing not a bad thing I think it's a good thing now with that being said I'd like it to go quickly\nKavanaugh's nomination is on hold until the FBI investigate allegations of sexual assault against him let's bring in Chad program who covers Congress for Fox News channel it's good to have you back thanks for having me shore so there have been questions about the scope of this investigation did the president tell us anything new about who's in control and what the terms are\nWell he indicated quote I Want to make the Senate happy and I've been told here in the past the hour hour and Fifteen minutes or so that by one senior Republican Senate stores that they think they could wrap this up could underscore that by tomorrow\nBut they can't be viewed as rushing this remember the terms of the agreement laid out by Jeff Flake the Republican senator from Arizona on friday was that this was supposed to take a week\nNow let me get a little bit into the weeds here and this is very important to understand the procedure\nMitch McConnell the Senate majority leader has a right to file what's called cloture that's an effort to end debate and whenever he does that consider that to be de won confirmation vote after you run through all the Senate traps would be on a bad day for maybe day fine Mitch McConnell really can't do that until Wednesday at the earliest\nThe question is if he goes ahead before the FBI investigation is complete\nIs he interrupting disagreement with Jeff Flake Susan Collins of Maine Lisa Murkowski of Alaska\nOr if they they're okay with that and they're like yes okay this is satisfied it hasn't been a week that's fine that's go ahead\nThen everybody a you know is is cool with it that's fine but if if the he's perceived as jumping the gun that's a problem that could be viewed as a violation of the agreement and he just got a lot of criticism from some conservatives over the weekend or who you\nTo confirm Brett Kavanaugh were not for Jeff Flake they're basically sitting right now about forty nine years and with this deal they could potentially get Collins potentially get Murkowski maybe Joe Manchin a Democrat from West Virginia\nMaybe Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat from North Dakota maybe get his highest fifty three days but otherwise they're stuck at forty nine so they can't move too quickly in the Senate they have to be here care if the\nPresident says he wants what Senate leadership wants to the question is what does Senate leadership want I mean who is on that list of people that will be interviewed by the FBI and that's the\nQuestion and you know what does columns want what does Murkowski ... that is a big unknown and that's why you know Senate timing around here is not exactly Swiss when they tell you that something is going to happen seven days from now or six days from now usually happens in about eight or nine maybe ten\nI'm the only thing I Do know is that once that clock starts to run ... once McConnell files cloture to end debate that will take that's a finite period about four to five days at the most\nSo we don't know and that's something that they have to have to consider and see where they are and ... did they find out any answers that raised other questions you know we're we're not privy to what they're finding out in this a background of is right and\nFunding for here and now

government the regional governments until they declare independence so that could be here for some\nTime well let's hear from one of the activists that you spoke with this is a man named Roger Espanol who was shot by police\nIn the ah he was actually he was blinded by a rubber bullet last October first and you asked him what has been achieved by the referendum\nThe first step was the first of all\nI'm sure we're going to make it yes\nShot at independence\nSome of them do one of the grassroots group called a CD or to the campaign for Democratic Republic of this morning cuts um some of the major ... routines of also having a stop to all the traffic like they have managed to break into the train stations to high speed train running from\nOne of the major cities to fulfill\nTheir activities in the new regional presidents ... has said today that ... activity is working keep pushing it so I think this will be seen as provocative certainly by the main government in Spain ... things than socialist government and the prime minister ... there is no chance of\nEver a referendum on independence it's against the constitution but they could have greater autonomy and last night I put that to the spokesperson for the ... here\nAnd join the PKK he said to me categorically no and they will continue he said working on accept disobedience like be illegal referendum if they don't get an independence choice now he said when and how he said not now I'm telling you will do something\nWell you know we should point out that their recent polls that say that people in the region are split on the issues so there are\nMany people that you've been speaking to still want independence and there are those\nDo not um how how divided in Catalonia [noise]\nWell I think that's a fascinating thing because it in the in the years since we had to really pivotal moment the polls haven't changed it's divided fifty fifty and I think that the the interesting thing when a loss of the analysts who look at the situation now they believe\nThe wrong thing this increased it is the bitterness between both sides and that is that you nailed it divided front gel sense it could very easily spark off again on the streets but\nThe BBC's Kevin ... speaking with us from the streets of downtown Barcelona Gavin thanks so much for your time we do appreciate it\n[noise]\n[noise]\nWell now that we're into fall and the weather's a little cooler here in our resident Jeff Kathy against is here to warm up with some fried chicken Hi Cathy\nHey Jeremy and fried chicken is one of those ... that we love to eat but we don't always loved to make a now and you know what I'm going to be really honest I spent a week after week in the studio telling you\nHow simple it is to make various ...\nWould start a fire you start a fire but you want to hear my first step yeah\nI use a walk a walk is the ideal shape for holding the oil knows flattering it's got the high sides\nYou want to always work with about an inch to two inches of oil and you want to keep a ... because you want to constantly be monitoring the temperature of the oil you put that their own or in the hot oil right so I had my walk\nI also use a cast iron skillet okay I had about an inch to two inches of I like to use a combination of an organic shortening some people use Chris go you can use safflower oil canola oil I like to do a mix and I bring it up to three twenty five\nAnd because my mom and her is right there I can constantly see why it's getting close to four hundred or oh it's down to two hundred and I am always adjusting\nTo keep it around through twenty five three twenty five the highest you want to get his three fifty otherwise you're going to have some burn chicken okay let's get to the results here you have some buttermilk that's fried chicken I Do this is my a nod to\nSouthern fried chicken American so I can listen to that crunch All right good but oh just pick it up for it gets up for it [laughter] um\nWhat I did was I took a whole chicken I cut it into eight pieces and I'm marinated it overnight in really good buttermilk salt pepper and the dash of cayenne and buttermilk tender I says chicken it at some of that acidic flavor but it also does tend to rise the chicken\nI take it out and then I dusted well in a combination of flour and corn meal and those little specks you see I used to very course of course middle ground corn meal so it's kind of great texture and then I fry it up and\nHere's another ... okay because if you're frying whole chicken you're going to do all the wings at first but then you're going to do the size then you're going to do the press pieces because each one of those cuts cooks for different amount of time and if you only have one type of part of the chicken in there\nYou're not an over or under cook it now you've got a little bit of money here and some lemon so you know so you would yeah that and I like it out a lot I like the way the lemon cuts the fatty and this of the fried chicken and I love the way the honey adds a sweetness to the buttermilk drenched fried chicken and you'll see that in the south\nThis would be the perfect kind of chicken for waffles and chicken fried chicken and went right to hunting isn't the honey is really brings out the sweet flavor that's there but it's subtle\nAgain you can fry more than one chicken and the oil so yesterday I tried to hold chickens in my oil and I did not keep it because I did answered the phone and the oil got a little hot at the end and was a little bit to brown but the idea behind having not greasy\nFood is that you're monitoring your oil and that you're using fresh oil after every one or two frying 's\nOkay there's another piece of fried chicken here but it has got something else on top of it some sesame seed exactly this\nIs my version and I will not claim it to be authentic of Korean fried chicken and what I did with this was I'm marinated the chicken in Korean chili paste I Hope I say this right go ... and\nSo I saw as ginger little ketchup sesame and Scalia and took it out of the marinate and dusted it in a combination of flour and corn starch\nAnd then you deep fry it oh I forgot to mention something really important this is double fried\nOh so you fry it you call it down and they might try it again for about two minutes on each side for that extra crispy and that's just for Christmas that is yeah it's not that you didn't cook it fully it's that you want that extra crispness\nThen I made a sauce out of the marinate similar it down again the chili paste the ginger\nAnd I spread that on the chicken and Dustin with sesame seeds and I don't know what do you think it's delicious and and find a way off that well and and\nI remember we talked to David Chang chef of ... about fried chicken he mentioned there's a lot of history involving fried chicken when it comes to African Americans I've also eaten at past schools in Atlanta which is where Martin Luther king used to go and I was fried chicken back in the day so there's a lot of history\nLots of history and David ... did a whole series for Netflix about right did a whole episode on fried chicken and what the big takeaway is that it's eaten all over the world but I did talk to\nMichael ... he is the author of the cooking gene which won some James Beard awards he said fried chicken goes back deep into the middle ages in Africa during the slave trade it's emblematic of the afro krill innovation that gets co-opted time and time again\nAnd he goes on to talk about how it's southern and the soul identities come right out of this collision\nOf all the influences that make up the fried chicken that we eat in this country that we saw a door okay there's one more thing in front of me Cathy and this is buffalo\n[noise]\nFunding for here and now comes from WVU are Boston and home advisor matching homeowners with home improvement professionals for a variety of home projects from minor repairs to major we models homeowners can read reviews of local pros and book appointments online at home advisor dot com\nAnd college vine were consultants work with high school students to identify and achieve their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship awards more at college fine dot com\nUrine now in Washington state the number of school age\nAreas the homeless student population had more than doubled between twenty twelve and twenty Seventeen and ... the number is up to thirty four percent in the past five years across the country about one point three million homeless students are enrolled in public schools\nBut why is this happening in a time when unemployment is below four percent in the economy is booming\nWell it turns out that may be part of the problem Carly ... is family resource coordinator for buffalo school district in ... county Washington and one of the district trying to figure all this out Carly welcome yeah thank you for having me those numbers are shocking ... what are you seeing there appears county\nWe definitely have seen a significant rise of our homeless families and the last few years\nTwo years ago we had about three hundred and fifty homeless students enrolled\nJust this last year we enrolled seven hundred and fifty nine homeless students um this year we don't have a total tally yet but I can tell you right now we're well ahead of the numbers that we had last year do you have any idea why [noise]\nYeah I go out in the field and I I speak with these families I see these families and it it's very difficult to meet with them you have to go out to see them to really understand\nThe layers of the onion that these families are going through there's multiple layers of it but I I truly believe back in two thousand fourteen when we had our economy boom\nWe never saw rental prices as high as fourteen hundred dollars you used to be able to get a small apartment or a rental unit for you know a thousand eleven hundred dollars twelve hundred dollars\nUm since then um rentals have gone up it is a lot more difficult to find section ... housing and affordable housing for these families especially if you are a working family and you work a minimum wage job at twelve dollars an hour forty hours a week\nYour income is going to be about Nineteen hundred dollars for the month and then fourteen hundred of that's going to be going towards the rent so that doesn't leave you a lot for crisis that happened um there's many different factors that are leaving these families just on the edge of becoming homeless and\nReally it's a matter of and when that happens then they're on the streets\nYou are just outside of Tacoma, Washington not far from Seattle one of the most expensive cities in the country are you seeing a an issue where people are getting\nYes absolutely we are known 'em for a bedroom community as what they're calling us a lot of families are coming out to our area to find the fourteen hundred dollar rentals or\nAs cheap as they can um and they will commute as far as two hours to work on a daily basis and like I said it just takes a loss of a job or that one crisis or they didn't have money saved up for an incident that happened before things start to crumble underneath\nThem and it's a symptom of the good economy which is the most fascinating thing about yes yeah [noise] so for an elementary school kid who is homeless in your district what is a typical day like\nIt's very challenging I'm first off\nThere are families that aren't even getting identified because they don't want to be identified they're afraid if they tell anyone that they're living in their car that their children will be taken away from them\nUm it could be their immigration status that they're afraid of being identified from\nSo really a lot of the homeless families that we have those children go without until we get them recognize\nWe recognize them through a variety of just being aware and paying attention to our students at school which students are getting lunch which students are sitting without lunch um which kids are on the chronic absentee list um who's coming late tardy to school every day\nAnd you notice that and then what do you do do you sit them down and ask them what's going on at home do you ...\nYeah it's you know I find my role becoming an investigator [laughter] because they won't come to you you have to go to them and you have to be very gentle with it I go out in my community and I do drive ... to go to the address if they have listed in our system just to see kind of what the house is like a lot of times I\nJust go out to the house and cold and knock on the door they totally don't even expect me but it's just you know they're not responding to me and I just want to\nAsk them in a gentle way you know hey I'm here for you how can I support you and a lot of times at that moment they will just pour in and just explain everything and then it's building a relationship from there to get them the services they need to address the barriers they're experiencing\nIt's not just your state of Washington it's a lot of other states especially across the west and seen reports out of Idaho they've got the highest number of homeless students they've seen in years um there's a report out recently about a jumping homeless school kids outside of Anchorage\nOne of these places or something different\n[noise] it's very hard to say I mean each family story is different each demographic is different\nEmployment rates are different but I Would say it has to be directly correlated with um just housing prices going up and we haven't really seen any new shelters or funds being set aside for section eight housing\nTo accommodate the massive boom in these homeless families it's like we're not keeping up with the need so what kind of help where you get it [noise] we um Bethel school district is not connected to a city title so it's very difficult to have\nThe resources and the funds that we need so we require solely on our own community to provide funding and donations I Believe a vessel we're a model for a lot of school districts serving our homeless families because we have system set up where we have a resource bus we drive\nWe'd go out to the community we do food drops we bring them clothing that they need some time to be these are ... medical supplies such as wheelchairs out to families that they need\nAnd we have a food program where we send food packs home with every homeless students on friday so they have food for the weekend until they get back to school on Monday we have multitudes of faith leaders that have pulled together to solve to help solve our problem out here\nAnd it's wonderful and we're well supported but it's it's like a band aid to every crisis it's happening\nAnd it sounds like you're saying it's private citizens step in and it's not it's not going to do it\nIt's private citizens it's our team baffle it's our hard work and community leaders that we have that have recognized the need and have wanted to help\nThe big picture of course is that this makes it very hard for kids to succeed in school and there's a lot of data out there that the back that up there's one study that says kids who experienced homelessness\nIn school or eighty seven percent more likely to drop out of high school and as you will know then becomes the cycle of poverty you see this every day in your job I mean how how does that look to you on the ground to see how these kids than struggle with the class work\nIt's just heartbreaking to work with the families and work with the students um their self worth and their self value and what they ...\nPotentially well and what they potentially could be I'll just give you an example I had one young man I was working with and he had no self value could care less about doing his school and I had asked him I said what do you want to do what do you want to be when you grow up and he's like I don't know\nHis probably just end up like my parents and be on the streets and I'm like no you can be you can be something different I said what do you enjoy\nSo after a couple meetings with him over the next week um I had discovered they love the animals so it was simple as hooking him up to a veterinarian it took took the young man under his wings and started showing them the ropes of\nWhat education you need to become a veterinarian doctor and here why don't you come after school and help on tearing clean the kennels for me and do this it gave that boy purpose to have a hope and a dream after high school and that's\nAll I can offer for these students is giving them the hope and the dream that it can be somebody after high school other than what they've experienced\nCarly ... a family resource coordinated with the ... school district in peers county Washington ah which has been dealing with a spike in a number of homeless kids are enrolled in their schools Carly thanks for the work that you do and thanks for speaking with us yeah thank you for having", "year": "2018",
