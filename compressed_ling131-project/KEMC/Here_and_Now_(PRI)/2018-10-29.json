loading it reflects an increase in hate crimes across the country\nRight about this route to community but has this been in the back of your mind you know what were you thinking when you heard about this attack\nBy first thought was this is a\nBrutal anti Semitic killing tack not only in the Jews but Americans and our values and the shock of it all was Jews have been living in America comfortable it's accepted in all communities around the country\nSee changed since the fifties and sixties and in the anti Semitism bigotry against Jews and many minorities\nAnd here we are again one more time\nOr the ugliness not only pop to the surface does periodically but it seems to grip a good number of people in America [laughter]\nWell uh ... let's talk about the climate in which it occurred do you make up about two percent of this country's population the FBI data says they account for about half the country is really just hate crimes\nAccording to the Anti Defamation league that's nearly two thousand incidents in twenty Seventeen five hundred more than the previous here have you been feeling that increase\nIn the last two three years we've seen more anti Semitic acts Nazi symbols of the loan Jewish cemeteries schools the SAT on Saturday there's quite a shock to the community and to America it seems\nAnd you know we only the so the gathering there in Pittsburgh thousands of people came out of out of your feeling that support from across the board and yet we heard the President's Day in his first remark it's hard to believe that this could happen in this day and age I mean you're saying somewhat the same thing\nExcept you're saying that you are also aware as a rising incidents\nDo you think that maybe possibly this horrific act on Saturday\nThat maybe at the very very least you know it's a small consolation but there there can be a a a moment of people understanding that there is anti Semitism in this country\nI'm fearful that unless we mobilize stop political leadership decides to change its ways they won't be any\nMajor changes taking place you know there's an opportunity next week when we vote in America maybe a [noise] those that have had been spewing out some of his viral language you know politicians closes who not spoken out against intolerance against minorities and\nMaybe that will send a message in shock the system you know the answer to this or a political leaders\nThat was the biggest microphone in the country and I think it starts with him changing the tone\nOf how he speaks about Americans and politicians from other parties but it also has to go down to you know our representatives in Washington are man governors and mayors or you know it's a local issue and if we can mobilize loud voice to make sure that\nThey understand that this is not the American way than Americans won't accept it they'll go to the polls if necessary to to change it and it becomes a priority that's where it has to begin as\nWell uh actually somewhat table hearing the opposite from the president had been\nFor a while we know that the gunman in Pittsburgh shattered the same racist rant that was heard by those marching white nationalist in Charlottesville in August is plenty Seventeen and we know that you know on line these white nationalists a supremacist Nazis\nAbsolutely believe and foment the thinking that games are pulling the strings somehow behind policies they don't like let's listen to these marches it's hard to hear that led to listen to these marches again in Charlottesville\n\nSounds on the documented it's put together that day I mean when you heard that that that's what he allegedly the shooter was allegedly shouting into synagogue that had to be tailing\nYes of course you know coming off of Charlottesville and Charleston and other attacks I think Americans are very conscious of the wrong song being set in America I Know everybody speaking about the president having\nA big responsibility in this because of his views and his political rhetoric we should all be hard to let him know that we don't accept that in America but it's not only him as the point I'm trying to make it was just happened to been watching Clinton sharpening show no\nTV yesterday how shocked and I know it'd be the\nDiscussion tend to surround Trump the bigotry and hatred that show's been showing you the wrong tone has been sending you said to myself what am I can\nUh you speaking of Louis ... leader of the nation of Islam\nYou know he just a few weeks ago said the Jews are Tom writes why aren't you speaking out against him is that because you're a Democrat and Trump's Republicans but our political leaders should also be speaking out against [noise]\nWell more responsible you know he still has the biggest microphone she's going to\nA live with the fact that he's the one they talk about the most but we shouldn't forget other parties all leaders don't just get a pass\nOr in the mail President Trump said that there were find people on both sides in Charlottesville and some permission half as much as\nI don't think that you you can talk about Nazis and the old right and Americans I just don't think the comparison makes any sense either penniless America's\nCheckers and president as American Jewish Congress thanks so much and again set aside for the loss in your community\nThank you for your kind of thoughts appreciate the

thought we'd offer novel about grief that also happens to be a finalist for the national Book Award for fiction\nBut secret Nunez is exquisite novel the friend is about suicide and also about the writing world which the author says is a sinking raft with too many people trying to get on\nAnd it's about a dog a highly clean great Dane named Apollo after the suicide of her friend the narrator is asked to take his massive pet in and they mourn together see goodness focus last march\nThere were these three strands that I I wanted to bring together into the same story and one was about uh the suicide of of people that are very close to you and another was um [noise] my experiences as a writer and a teacher of writing [noise]\nAnd ah I've always loved animals and I have always wanted to write about animals and I've always been interested in this human animal bond particularly the human canine bond so I saw a way that I could write a story leaving all those strands together\nAnd did you ever um and throwing in by the way along the way I'm suddenly there's Beckett and flattery O'Connor and Kafka and you're\nUs like gods and we respond by treating them like sings\nFat is a quote from ... from his novel disgrace\nAnd what are you trying to say about these not just overall noble creatures but in this case a character named Apollo who's one of the largest dogs you can imagine but when he first comes into the narratives apartment his tail is lowered like a beast of burden\nWhat do we know about whether dogs grieve\n[noise] we do know that they do grief because we can observe that and we do know that you know that we can't explain to them all the person died because he was in a car accident or something I can explain that to a dog but they definitely do more and\nAnd uh you know in this book she didn't think about this because it wasn't her idea to take in the dog but once she has him she realizes that he is going through a process of grieving it just like her own and that draws them very close together and they get through it together they help each other he'll now\nI remember I had to put a little dogs asleep once and the person who came to the house that it's better that the other dog see this oh so that they know where the dog is gone and I I thought what seems odd but\nI Am so glad to meet you can't you can't say for sure that that would happen well\nWhen the when the shots started the injection to you know put him to sleep the other dog ran from the room jumped into the bath tub and picked over the top as if to say is anyone noticed you're killing a dog here I mean you know fascinating they and then he did more afterwards or\nAs I Do think that although we don't really know what's going on inside dogs heads because we we can't and they don't have language we know that they're smart I think they might be many many times smarter than we actually have fought on to this point\nBut the book isn't I mean for those wondering we've seen books recently that concentrate on an animal and somebody's relationship with an animal\nYours goes off I mean there's ... chapters where we're not hearing anything about Apollo and every now and then you say it's only happened to the dog or is something going to happen to the dog\nBecause you presume it's like old yell or you presume okay embracing here if there's a book with a dog something's gonna happen but you go off with your narrator to other parts of her life when you thinking there\nShe has a life outside of the dog even though during this period of mourning she doesn't do much besides take care of the the ... I mean he's he's her whole emotional life during this period\nSomebody asked for the party argue the woman who's in love with the dog yeah\nA big part of your life is literature a big part of your life is reading and thinking about what you read and a\nTalking about what you read and so that also became a part of the book it's a book that you know where you do have a person who in trying to understand what she is going through turns to certain writers and certain books and certain words and that's why I quote people like\nFlattery O'Connor because she's reaching out to these things she's putting them into the narrative because she was trying to tell a story about ... and the and all of those writers do have a part in her life\nAs people she's read and who have influenced her and inspired her\nNow along the way I I kept thinking I should Google this I should go to this is it true that during the Nineteen eighties in California there were many Cambodian women who suddenly lost their sight yes and they all lead atrocities and what they were just psychosomatic ally they couldn't see any more because of what they'd seen\nYes they did have psychosomatic blindness I mean that was the only explanation that doctors had four it\nIs it true that research has shown that it helps I think it was damaged children or six children to read aloud to dogs\nYes that is something that uh has been going on in classrooms in libraries fairly recently I think um need a therapy dog say they know to be calm and to sit still and and listen\nAnd to the child is having reading difficulties the dog is listening but he's not judgmental and anyway it appears to work about what it does for the dogs I don't know but it does seem to help the children yes that's also true yes\nYou also talk about people we talked about the site but you also talk about people who were dying their throat because of something more powerful and traumatic that happens a couple of times to our narrator we're not gonna give away the ending except to say that we find out that the friend\nIs all along is the dog and maybe not the mentor who committed suicide [noise]\nBoy could be boats or maybe the friend is the narrator yeah and what\nAbout you said you know you've loved animals but you make your narrator a cat person who isn't sure how she feels about a dog\nMy my ... my married are really does Mitt this is something I definitely share with my married her she says she thinks of herself as a cat person it's not that I Love cats more than dogs I Love both species equally but she like a lot of other people have trouble\nThey kept you do dominate other animals horses dogs you know at some point she says uh they're almost two poignant and their relations with the person that and to our cat person for example she says I'm a cat person give me a pet but can live without me\nShe just much happier with the idea that her cats would easily survive [laughter] her dying suddenly whereas this dog is totally traumatized by the disappearance of his best friend\nNow dogs can be unbearably poignant and she said although I'm reminded of the great essay writer the public radio as a writer Alice furlough who wrote the definitive essay on a her cat dying\nAnd the only solace that she took from it every morning her cat would try to wake her up by not going to Penn on her head as they do you have her only solace is that\nShe is now waking up and the cat's not there it would have been more unbearable for her if the cat was still trying to you know with a pen wake her up when she had gone\nOh yes that's that's very moving\nWell and how was this book it's called the friend from secret newness and took it it'd have to ask you it is about writers in writing in the community and the teaching of it um can you give us one tip for those who uh wanna wrestle a story to the ground\nPiece of advice that I really like is the simple don't flinch I say it because I Do see a lot of very good work among students spoiled at least in a draft\nBecause they've done exactly that they have this really good story they have it is really good experience they have very strong feelings about it but when they get to writing it down they get scared and they flinch and they pull away from it and that you know makes it not as good a story as it could be\nWell I Would say if anybody wants to see how you can write a book about a dog that for the longest time in the book isn't really about a dog and then suddenly it was all about a dog in you know with such a punch pick up the friend\nUm and how much of this is you you've told interviewers this isn't my writing class [laughter] you know I'm not that frustrated with student writers but is the suicide maybe someone you didn't know because we read the germ of this was people who you knew who were contemplating suicide\nOne of the reasons why I did want to to write this book was because there were several friends that I had let me know that suicide was something that\n\nFunding for here and now comes from that weren't greeters of that law that simulates software accelerating the pace of engineering and science you learn more ... dot

of the ... the concrete things I mean talking about the fact that it's real and shouldn't be a stigma and it's as much a disease I guess as you know I'm diabetes that's great for awareness but then where does it go from there\nWhen we did get the legislation passed one thing we did not advocate for was a specific curriculum because what you teach in the Bronx might be a little different than what you're teaching in upstate New York\nSo we wanted to make sure that you know each district to determine what they perceive as their best sort of lesson plans are best curriculums\nYork very rural how might it be different\nWell I think that the understanding and and the socialization and things like that are are a little different in a rural area suburban area in the city\nNot that there's a greater understanding in one part of the state versus another part of the states but just a sort of an overall cultural peas and just a greater you know knowledge about mental health in general\nIt well and I'm thinking that Long Island very suburban Long Island may have more of an acceptance of\nThe idea of therapy and mental health being on the table then let's say a a a small town and I'm not going to pick out but a small town in upstate New York or it may not be as widely used\nCorrect yeah and there are cultural differences too there's depending on the culture there are cultures that are very accepting about talking about mental health more openly than other cultures are talking about a more openly so that also has to take in into place too and also\nSchool history some schools again have rolled out mental health court comes in the past and so we don't want to transpose our piece over what they are already teaching but what we did do in response is we were able to create a resource center at school mental health resource center where we were able to\nI have a a group of experts mental health and education experts meet through the\nState Department of education to develop what we regard as sort of a you know best practice lesson plans so people can go to our website and look in and see that there are lesson plans out there are dedicated to elementary school to middle school in the high schools\nYou got that teacher training there and other tools so willing people out here now doubt or the brain is an example like let's say you decided to implement this in grade school what like a specific part of a curriculum and then what might Wendy in eleventh grade\nSure well a lot of what you're talking about in elementary school\nEspecially early on kindergarten first grade second grade is just about things like feelings took about sadness and happiness and just general kind of sense of a basic knowledge you know obviously we don't want to bring in topics that are too heavy by any means especially the very early age\nAt this idea of talking about feelings get fellow thing an emotional awareness so that when ... comes has the teen years approach maybe somebody's got the tools to deal with it\nAnd it's exactly what we try to do is create a progression recognizing that okay where where buildings sort of like the the structure now\nWhen they are older and facing you know more challenges in terms of their mental health that they are better able to to deal with that so it's almost like really building in a progression\nThe national alliance on mental illness county\nHas all sorts of stats one of them is that one in five young people live with a mental health condition in the U.S that less than half get treatment so this might also funnel people to wield treatment as opposed to education and then she noticed opposition their teachers who don't feel comfortable with the subjects whiz kids\nTeachers who feel that it should be the parents who handle something like this or therapist\nI think what we say in response to look it's a very very legitimate issue and we are really emphasizing that this should be an inclusion of families in this discussion as much as possible\nAgain we don't want psychology when uh when we don't want teachers to go and talk about\nHere is a different diagnoses or anything like that we just want teachers to be able to go in and and give a basic knowledge about mental health and maybe again to your point when you were saying and talk about the things that we already know talk about stigma talk about things like the connection between physical and mental health issues\nAnd we hope that as more and more of these discussions going on and people are realizing T educators families that\nYou know this is just the normalization of a of a of a condition that hopefully people will be much more open about talking about it\nThat's when Lehman he's the CEOs and nonprofit mental health association of New York

that translate onto the surface\nMary courses been wrestling with that cannot grim since early twenties at one point she was experimenting with light as part of the work first using fluorescent lights and later the more subtle radiance of Oregon\nStill for all other experimentation she was pretty much kept out of the big boys club of Los Angeles art in the Nineteen sixties as the consensus of the time was the painting was dead concepts we're in the men were he men and women artist were pretty much ignored\nI was younger than everybody else so I was still really a girl I was in my twenties so
