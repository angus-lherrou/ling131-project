the Democratic candidate for governor Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum was given free tickets to the Broadway show Hamilton as a gift from an FBI agent posing as a developer something Gillum still fiercely denies he\nIs one of the breakout stars of this election season leading the Republican candidate former congressman and Iraq\nThe two had a contentious to our debate on CNN on Sunday and we invited both men to sit down with us this week only Gillum accepted he\nIs the first African American democratic gubernatorial candidate in Florida as history probably is most progressive he supports hiking the state's corporate tax rate to fund education raising the minimum wage and he is for a single parent health care system\nWill have more in a minute on the new reporting on alleged gives to Gail I'm against something he denies and what he told us about the accusations but first we started our conversation with him this week on his stand on Medicare for all\nI said I've endorsed a Medicare for all at the federal level and I encourage them to move diligently to get that done Florida could not go there alone we would need a federal solution here in at the very least we would need\nA conservative states coming together to negotiate a prescription drugs\nAnd others on behalf of its citizens and so what is within my power however is to expand Medicaid which is what we've committed to doing for over eight hundred thousand of the most medically needy people in my state\nRight now or a Republicans have refused to expand Medicaid for that group costing the state six billion dollars that we could bring down from the federal government that right now is being given away to other states\nWhile we've got one in five people in my state going to emergency rooms to access healthcare that's unacceptable I mean Mr dissent has said that a cancer patient when asked how she was supposed to get access to health care is that you could always go to an emergency room\nThat response in my opinion is disqualifying for any one running for governor of the state of Florida\nLet's talk about crime you are the mayor of Tallahassee which is the biggest city in Leon county that is right which has the highest crime rate in the state we were traveling in a young African American who is also coming to Tallahassee as we were flying here said to us you know I I I think this is a problem\nIn his Tallahassee is the eight largest city in the state of Florida and were twenty eighth in crime\nMy city is experiencing a five year low in our crime rate\nIt misses dissenters described a community is one where people are sheltering themselves in homes in avoiding the streets and he's he clearly has never spent any time in Tallahassee regular everyday working people in my state recognize that communities are going to have crime they know that\nThe question is what if communities do about it and what we've done about it in my city is Wi Fi or fifty new law enforcement officers\nCreated reentry program so that folks who are returning citizens to our community get\nThe opportunity to reenter society and have dignity around their work this categorization of a high law this uh you know this is Trump be in politics it is not based in reality\nI Want to ask you about President Trump you know in your debate with Ron Santo as you said he was just do it for the president you made no bones about how you felt about President Trump and his loosen is with ads of leadership well an absence of leadership as you as you put it\nPresident Trump's pulling numbers they have bumped up is it may be a mistake in a state like Florida to call your opponent to first of all that you know the kind of language that we expect from others\nWell I'll tell you I Will take my chances I Am sick to my stomach or at the national at the state at the local level people normalizing the behavior that comes out of Washington DC I refuse to do with\nA I'm teaching my kids what it means to the golden rule to treat people like you want to be treated our president goes around making fun of handicapped individuals\nReferring to women and all kinds of vile ways objectify women and I have a daughter uh and so uh I'm prepared to take my chances calling the president out for what I Believe\nIt's completely inappropriate behavior and Mr ... as he is sucking up to the president he does a consider himself and apprentice Donald Trump if we're ever going to restore decency and common sense to our body politic more people have to join me in decrying this kind of ...\nA racist Xena phobic and sexist language out I'm never going to make apologies but trying to create a kind of society in a kind of a community where my kids will be proud to grow up in Iran\nJust answered says if you're this strongly speaking out against the president as governor how do you work with the ministry and Alison money on many for the environmental plans that you have for the state\nUnfortunately for most of the center of this is not Russia or we don't bow down to the president we work with a check for instance under governor Rick Scott he disagreed vehemently with President Obama President Obama in spite of that vehicle disagreement\nTried to send the state of Florida two point eight billion dollars to build high speed rail governor Rick Scott said no thank you we don't believe in Obama's stimulus money as much as I disagree with the conduct and the qualifications of this president if he tries to send Flora two point eight billion dollars I'm gonna take that\nSays aside from the president he's going to find a willing partner in me who's willing to help him on infrastructure help on transportation Rick Scott and not who again don't agree on a lot politically during this last storm hurricane Michael we spoke every day on the phone\nTalk a little bit about the environment which has been hammering your region your opponent Santa's is now positioning himself as a Teddy Roosevelt conservationist he says he wants to build reservoirs to restore water flow and prevent those toxic algae blooms he supports a ban on fracking drilling off the coast\nCertainly different from your Republican sitting governors Scott\nMy opponent can say anything he wants to in an election year but I have to measure him by his six years in Congress someone who voted to undermine the environmental protection agency someone who voted against the clean Water Act thirty three times\nAs the mayor of photos capital city we broke ground on a one hundred and twenty acre solar farm tripling the amount of solar energy that we produce and the city of Tallahassee where we sit above the ah Florida an aquifer\nAnd where we noticed through our spray field operations that we were contributing to hire nitrate levels and what color springs we took the necessary steps to begin treating that water at the new church she every level almost portable level to reduce the number of nitrates going into our groundwater\nWhen we get elected governor we're going to have a governor who believes in science\nPut some teeth back into our department of environmental protection where we have deregulated across that agency allowing the biggest polluter to write their own rules\nIs they're going to come a point where people like you have to say to people we can't afford to have you wiped out time after time\nWell listen you go to a issue that is going to be hugely at the top of our agenda\nWe recognize that we are highly susceptible to the impacts of global warming and sea level rise\nAnd so we've got to start building are more resilient state and yes that in some cases will mean that there are parts of our state we're not going to be able to continue allow growth to take place already insurance an actuarial studies are showing some of these areas that are going to be under water\nThat's Andrew Gillum mayor of Tallahassee democratic gubernatorial candidate here in Florida now again thanks so much for speaking to us of course take care\nPart of our talk with Andrew Gillum this past Monday and as we said yesterday the Tampa Bay times reported that attacks from killing his old friend and lobbyist Adam Corey shows that a man they both\nSo Corey reach Mike Miller and the crew have tickets for us for Hamilton tonight Gillum replies awesome news about Hamilton Mike Miller turned out to be an FBI agent part of an undercover investigation into corruption not focusing on Gillum\nGuild says his brother had it in the ticket he assumed his brother pay for it here so they told us in our conversation tell us about the FBI investigation according\nTo New York times I'm just going to ... there was a lobbyist friend of yours that was actually a friend as many of your friends are from your student government days in in college this is Adam Corey who introduce you to men who identified themselves as out of town developers they want to invest in property\nThey turned out to be FBI agents working undercover to investigate community redevelopment agency possible correction you said\nThey told you that you are not their target but before you knew they were you may too personal trips with your old friend Adam Cory went to Costa Rica there's questions about whether or not you and your wife paid your share of a home there you say you did\n\nFunding for here

Hi Robyn I'm getting closer to you I mean you're staying up I'm Glad [laughter]\nAnd weather here in Tallahassee Ryan daily a reporter for WFSU Hi Ryan hey Robin ... well we want to start with you because we want to get to that\nAnd he took tickets Hamilton Hamilton makes it into this race and his share of a vacation at a couple of friends took\nA you know just one trip that he took these as gifts from developers that turned out to be an FBI agent and a and as an ethics commission investigation he is not the subject of that investigation now the Tampa Bay times yesterday broke the story the text\nIn which a Gilligan's friend a lobbyist told them about this Hamilton ticket or that this developer had for them Gillum respond awesome\nBut he is insisting even today he thought his brother paid for that ticket is it's just going to hurt us this sticking his far ahead of dissent is in some polling\nRight yeah I I think it's important to remember that this is part of that state ethics board investigation I talked with a Gillum lawyer Barry Richard back in September who said he he doesn't expect this investigation to be concluded by the time people have gone to the polls anyway\nSo I think what it's all going to hinge on when it's all going to come down to and you'll see this tonight in the gubernatorial debate here in Florida\nThat or it's going to come down to how Andrew Gillum answer these questions I mean almost undoubtedly\nThe dissenters camp is going to try to use this to point to uh dishonesty to inconsistencies in the story I think I think if you are I'm On the Gillum team you are hoping that he uh you know sticks with his story\nUm and again it's going to come down to how he answers a question\nAnd it's really an important race because uh you know they couldn't be more different he's a progressive um uh let's hear\nA dissenters on Fox News earlier this month\nYou know I have a positive relationship with the president said people in the administration Florida has a lot of names from our military footprint our transportation or water resources what's been a big problem here and we need to work constructively with the federal government\nAndrew Gillum is running on in teaching Donald Trump I don't know what for 'em but I don't think he got to be able to do anything productive way with the federal government and and I will be able to do that\nAnd Ryan so how is President Trump playing out in this race while I mean I think\nYou need to look no further than the Florida Republican primary um to to you know get a sense of how Trump affects races here in the state um you could say the same just got the Trump bump so to speak in fact there is a pretty good sound bite of Trump's saying uh\nYou know I'm slightly paraphrasing here but I sent a tweet and being being the sand is was up by you know however many points and and uh\nAlso the Republican primary was decided well before the Democratic primary there was coming down to the wire so I think any time you know we've seen that President Trump can be a wildcard stepping into races tweeting support for a candidate\nWell Enrique as if they don't let me bring you in here because the president also has pulled a wildcard in these couple of weeks leading up to November six elections\nAnd that's this as he calls it the caravan\nOf uh some say refugees some say undocumented immigrants making their way you know through Mexico to the U.S border they are going something like twenty five miles a day at this rate they will not even reached that border till December the number who reach it but the president has been positioning this as a you know almost an attack\nOn the border how's that resonating where you are in Miami\nThank he's been able to position this as an attack on Democrats blaming them for what's happening with the cabin and saying they're all for open borders I think this is one of those um ... it's certainly a politically charged caravan at a very convenient time for the president\nBush said the the issue of immigration front and center which already was to be honest uh in in this election along with health care and and the economy\nUm um I Do think it could be one of those X factors coming to the election Robin and I'm ... would really see the impact all the garbage and all the attention describing how fat in the last couple of days and that he will have a in the run up to your mid term election\nUh we'll see that on a ... or ... depending on the turnout both parties I think I read it is a a turnout election\nWell let's be clear this is a cat and that a reporter was organized by a church is that it happens quite often it's it's just that this one has come up on the radar and the last one that was of this size\nA group of people um you know organized again by churches to try to seek refugee status in the United states in the last ... made got so much attention that CNN is reporting that just three people\nOr were accepted into the country so there is that but I just just to underscore this Enrique we we you know people are Latino Hispanic voters do not all vote in a block\nUm you will have people who will be of you know coming from the same countries will resent people who are coming across the border and we've been talking to construction workers or builders who are desperate for some of those people are seeing on the screen to come work here\nAnd that's an excellent point and Florida's a great example Robin you see the Cuban American community a traditionally a very conservative a very broad Republican there they have been very\nWe're all ready for it up before money about all the security Maria over the Puerto Ricans have since ah coming to Florida and that are um some of them have read registered to to be part of this midterm election and and they will certainly play a role in the result\nUh for for the governor race and and and the Senate race so it's it's very interesting and yes the Latino community is not a monolithic community different interests and and different agendas\nI Want to turn out to the Senate race or the Democrat Bill Nelson the incumbent has held the seat since two thousand one but some polling shows that a sitting Governor Scott has a shot the two candidates had a debate earlier this month on Telemundo fifty one let's listen to a little of that first Governor Scott\nThey like high taxes um\nAndrew Cuomo said he wants to raise taxes forty percent [noise]\nThere and also voted for tax increases are higher taxes over three higher tax higher taxes over three hundred times\nAnd Here's Senator Nelson responding\nWealth the governor keeps coming out with one whopper after another\nUh apparently you never got your mouth washed out for soap after telling a lie because\nYou keep on going on on every part of my record\nHigh and daily from his you here in Tallahassee always colorful but who said the edge here and ... especially with\nThe hurricane that just hit I every time I turn the TV on icy Governor Scott in a little kept visiting you know some terrible you know disaster where a school's roof has been ripped off I mean he is seemingly everywhere so who's who's got the edge here yeah I I mean\nAre you know there was a the latest Quinnipiac poll released I think yesterday had Nelson's lead a at about seven points I mean a hurricane recovery obviously inherently political\nUm you know I think Rick Scott being the governor he he had the advantage invisibility and the response to hurricane Michael but Senator Bill Nelson the I think to his credit he visited emergency operations centers in Bay county here in Tallahassee\nVisited rural counties and raise concerns about their their abilities to recover um so yeah I don't I don't think that the hurricane response gave a Scott much of a discernible boost in his whole lead\nRight now but at that same line daily had given his you and make

wants to get his rights back but the process is intimidating and he knows it could take years\nAll of us deserve a chance to show that we can live decently we live alone so other people so I made a commitment um not to go back to prison but also want to make a commitment to be a productive member of society\nRichard Harris and the Tampa area lawyer says not all felons deserve that chance\nWe

Floridians for a sensible voting rights policy a group that is against amendment for he said there are a fair criticism is that the current process service during voting rights but given what he calls blanket clemency where the constitutional amendment would be wrong that potentially dangerous\nClemency is not an entitlement it is not a right it is an act of mercy by the state of Florida and it ought to be\nDecided on an individual case by case basis with due consideration for the seriousness of the crime the nature of any harm that was\nCaused a in a whole lot of other factors\nThat we

any other crime whatsoever\nMcNeil points to research from the states on parole condition that showed ... who's right to vote was automatically\nRight to vote only serves to diminish their sense of being a citizen\nWhen people feel like they're hopeless and there are shut out of the basic a fundamental rights as a citizen then they're more apt in my opinion to give up and turned to a lot of crime or 'cause there's no alternatives left to him\nThat's something James Sawyer says he's experienced personally so he went to prison for buying crack cocaine from an undercover police officer while on probation he says when he got out not having the right to vote made him feel powerless\nI used to have ideas about who I Want it in an office to relax certain things but I never got involved

retiring justices who helped make the decision about their seats\nGovernor Rick Scott said he should replace suggested just before his term ends but the Supreme Court ruled that is the incoming governors responsibilities to lead the Democrat Andrew Gillum\nOr the Republican Ron dissenters will shape the future course a hearing that decision the head of Florida State Republican Party said the stakes were November's election just got higher let's bring in WFSU news director and had her highland\nEven person I'm explain this decision you know what was behind the thinking\nWell it it comes down to a matter of timing the governor is usually sworn in by noon on that day and you know the justices also retire at the same day but technically they get the hang out a little bit longer till about five or midnight so really by the time their terms or up it's already and\nAlso some previous cases in unrelated issues that also tend to lend themselves to sort of an incoming person being able to make certain appointments so all of that came in to basically say governor Rick Scott you don't have this appointment power it's now in the hands of the incoming governor\nI it's very different but

find labor and in Florida it's even worse and that was before hurricane Michael flattened entire town [noise]\nThis week we had it out to a building site to meet up with members of the Tallahassee builders association Lynn Edwards is executive officer\nDoug Barton is the current president my Catholic the incoming president we started with Doug so when it comes to work is just give me the ... the problem that you're seeing and getting workers here\nIn two thousand seven recession we lost fifty percent of our industry and they have not return and they went and found other work so as things to fix back up we're still working with half our workforce\nA lot of people left the industry and then I'm Mark you're left with people who might have aged out of the industry retired\nAbsolutely as a matter of fact our average aged framing contractor is fifty seven years old\nSo can you give me the kinds of jobs you are missing right now\nEvery trade is who are missing from drywall are still plumbers to office staff in the construction industry if you talk to any company they are looking for help and they can't find it\nEnded up what's what some of the side effects what happened as a result of not having enough workers\nFor my general contractors perspective the homes that used to take us three to four months to build now they're taking six to eight months\nAnd I'm sure that you have to be higher than\nThey do have to read to recover that calls but she's still ... you don't cover the full cost materials have gone up the last three years probably thirty percent\nAre you worried about materials clean up even more about ...\nTariffs and hurricanes absolutely\nLeno send us emails several times a day of those looking from Mary in Panama City to all these places needing their homes to be rebuilt or repaired and I'm thinking to myself we we struggled day to day to keep up with what we have had prior to this storm\nWe I mean physically I mean there's new housing new has just struggling with balancing act balancing how do you possibly take not enough workers and take on more\nSo in order to bring you into the conversation what are you hearing from people who've been hurt by Michael the lack of finding anyone to help them the lack of a equipment a lack of rivers and a lot of an license activity\nWhat else do workers that there are I'm sure you have to really compete to keep them maybe raise salaries mark maybe increase benefits\nIf there's not enough farmers in town or not enough electricians in town to do the amount of ...\nCome in to take the work or if mark has his painter coming and I know he's coming to Mars job and I look at him and I said listen here you know how about a few extra hundred bucks to come by in the first you Patti mark in the back as you're saying that tell us the small community there is some of that trading that does go around\nThat's heating training is one thing but you're talking about stealing you conceding though we are ...\nYou talked about what happened because of the session a huge blow the thing you have this you know slow steady blow that has to do with immigration I mean we're reading that some of the cuts in both legal and illegal immigration are you're nodding markers are impacting the building industry\nThey are if you look at a lot of the trades they are immigrants I Believe the hurricane Michael the damage done over there if we did not have workers from other countries that were just would not get done so where do you do what we're\nDoing through education and bringing our younger kids and introducing them in the construction for decades we've taught them it's got to be college has got to because it's got to be college\nAnd you know there's a vast majority of aid don't make it through college or they're not college is not for them and we're trying to bring them together and say hey listen to the construction industry we we need you and it's lucrative I was talking to one of my contract isn't the way over here\nAnd then these guys are making up or twenty five thirty dollars an hour is on fifty sixty thousand dollars a year to repair and air conditioner\nAnd that's climbing so at some point there's going to be higher demand\nYou're right we I mean we push college and so many people the college is the right thing sounds like you need welders and you said plumbers and they need training\nAbsolutely yeah and and most of these curriculums or not you know they're not for your curriculums\nSo they can go through a future billed as America which is a high school program transition into a vocational school I'm so by the time they come out with some sort of experience in high school and they can be an apprentice and worked their way through vocational in a matter of Eighteen months or so\nAnd be in the field making fifty thousand dollars a year versus four year degree and they come out I read the average you know graduates making forty nine thousand dollars a year so they're not going to have the college debt that these guys have so it's you know it's lucrative\nI Want to touch on some of the other aspects of this but not to lead immigration just yet if you had the ear of the next governor you couldn't have a more red hot button divisive political issue right now than immigration and it's you're telling me it's necessary for your industry so what what would you want\nOftentimes the immigrants are the on the job before anybody else they're working hard to stay until sundown so they have a work ethic that we don't seem to have in the United states with our young kids now\nSo I Would ask whoever's coming in we need to have a way for these folks to come in and do the work that our industry and other industries need\nMy eye you saying you'd like to see more of the workers who might be fit for your industry allowed in\nI suppose that's what I'm saying yeah as I've traveled again after this hurricane that we just had there's\nA lot of cruise tree cruise roofing crews and one thing I notice in common of all of them is it's\nPrimarily a Hispanic workers\nThis area needs to be rebuilt\nAbsolutely we need more workers there I think those builders in that area are in a really bad place because their homes or go on their place of business might be gone the shop that he had just gone it's going to take a lot of builders from a large part of the country that's just the way it is what\nElse would change this equation\nWe see a movie recently for a vote tech or industrial arts coming back to the high schools we spent many years not exposing young people to that type work and telling him what Doug mentioned earlier go to college go to college\nThe guys right here standing here doing this work for us today are making between forty and sixty grand a year that's a good job\nOr does she think there'd be some sort of government involvement of ... kind of making it more enticing what how else to get their revert\nBack to you know capitalism I think you know the fifty sixty thousand dollars and that's you know you get into supervisory Rosen your\nYou know sixty to eighty thousand dollars you know owner owners of companies doubled tripled that one more thing I think the stigma that's what the big talk was the last Thirty years you got to have a college degree and kind of downplayed the actual getting out of your hands on and and doing work\nAnd I think changing that view is the big hardly you got to get over\nYou worry Florida's future is it maybe so uncertain because of the warming the and the storms that are increasingly violent you worry about twenty Thirty years down the road that Florida will not have a building well\nNo I don't I think the dog and I and other builders\nOther states should follow our suit and build strong homes in Panama City in Mexico beach the structures that survived we're not that much different than what we're building right here in Tallahassee they're just good quality oh\nLet's go back to your question no if it's global warming and I'm not sure what you're referring to with our state and what do I say if he is warming and and you know\nThis has been going on this weekend we went down to care about it and get to explore the shipwreck from Eighteen Ninety nine\nThat were revealed because of the storm\nBut from eight to nine nine there's category you know what are they didn't write him back then but the damage was very similar to this wiped out of the city of care bill so do I it's\nJust you don't believe the recent report from the government that you know we got even less time than we thought maybe ten years instead of twenty\nAbsolutely no nope I Believe it's cyclical you're a builder absolutely or twenty five years I\nI Do believe we do affects the environment with what we do and what we build an area full of asphalt is hotter than an area full of grass and trees and there's no doubt no doubt about that um but I also believe it's cyclical",
