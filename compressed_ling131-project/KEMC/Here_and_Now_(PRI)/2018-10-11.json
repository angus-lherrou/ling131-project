I'm Jeremy hops and it's here and now the devastation left by what was hurricane Michael\nHe's becoming more clear today the storm has killed at least two people a man in Florida and an eleven year old girl in Georgia and for some the danger is not over here the FEMA administrator Brock Long\nRight now the focus is truly on life safety uh and making sure that uh we're helping people who may be trapped and are pushing through and doing damage as much to make sure that we fully understand where we need to a court date our response efforts\nJoining us now is Jeff Hoffman chief meteorologist with the Florida public radio emergency network Jeff whereas Michael today\nA Jeremy Michael's moving into the uh North Carolina region it has quickly moved to south Caroline\nGreenville North Carolina the center of that storm passing near Charlotte still a tropical storm and likely will stay officially a tropical storm all the way to the coast there at the mid Atlantic states with wins in the forty to fifty mile per hour range and some heavy rain\nWell and as Michael passes over the Carolinas this is the area that was already hit by Hurricane Florence what are the concerns there\nWell the heaviest rain from that thankfully is a a little more located further inland into the mid state of upstate regions still very heavy rain flash flooding concern big time in the hill country\nBut it is moving quickly us so Jeremy that it's going to mitigate the flood rest they're still going to be some runoff rivers that were of course are at their ... a week or so ago from Florence\nHave come back down they may come back up a bed but we're avoiding an extreme event in the Carolinas because it's moving quickly\nAnd what about further up in the northeast\nWell we have to watch out for tornadoes there's a tornado watch in effect for eastern portions of North Carolina southeastern portions of Virginia 'til nine o'clock tonight I Believe\nAnd uh that risk will continue up into uh uh the Delmarva area this will become a nor'easter so there's going to be some coastal impact in New England or the center of this do should stay just offshore but I certainly this will be a far reaching storm all the way up into the coastal regions of New York in Massachusetts and up in the main even\nA Michael at its strongest point was a category for hurricane with a hundred and fifty five mile per hour winds very close to a category five this is the same a wind speed that we saw with Hurricane Maria when it hit Puerto Rico one of the most powerful storms ever to hit the U.S mainland how did that happen\nVery warm water on the Gulf of Mexico very light winds aloft a this has been a season where conditions in the central Atlantic have not been particularly favorable for tropical development but it's just a goes to show it doesn't really matter where a storm forms as long as the conditions near an over it at the time\nOr can allow it to develop a it will develop very quickly um and yeah it is the intensity and the pressure was lower than Andrew when it came ashore um and it's one of these circumstances that Jeremy that it was still kind of been a strengthening phase ended approach land and we've had several hurricanes in the last decade that have weekend as they approached land\nA just a reminder that that can happen but the other the opposite can happen as well they can be strengthening as they approach and that's what that's what Michael did\nHow well they didn't hold up in terms of the forecasts of of where it hit and the impact that it had\nJust like Florence the track forecast from the hurricane center was really spot on here and that is that's also a reminder that the track forecast have improved remarkably over the decades but the intensity\n[noise] [noise]\n\nFunding for here and now comes from W.

Edgar says the sanctuary state law goes too far\nWhen you look at this it's really the difference between the boundaries of separation of powers between local jurisdictions state jurisdiction in federal from our perspective we wanted to go and taken action to say hey look we have the right to do this and that's when the ACLU came in and said we don't think you do have the right so now we have an outside group that's actually going in challenging us on that issue\nHow do you respond to some of the opponents of this who say that by not having a sanctuary city or sanctuary state policy that immigrants are going to be less likely to work with law enforcement on major crimes reporting things et cetera because they're afraid of deportation\nYou know what I I don't see it that way I think that um if you talk to people within a especially around Ellis telling me to stay in the north Orange County area\nYou'll see a lot of the immigration population that may not be legal\nThankful for what we're doing because we feel that uh or they feel that basically by us not abiding by the sanctuary laws what happens is these people that are bad actors that are illegal that get put in jail and then are not released back to the federal government come back into their communities and continue to terrorize their community\nAnd so from their perspective they are very thankful I think a lot of this this is the politics and the soundbites versus the reality of what's going on on the ground\nEdgar met with President Trump earlier this year he's been in regular contact with the White House since the move by his city has been called racist and Xena phobic I asked him about that\nI don't think this has anything to do with racism um I I probably the best example and the ... for example I gave us my wife is from Iran she came when the shah was overthrown she is a Christian in Iran she basically had to get asylum in Paris for two years and wait interest\nWork and you know I don't have anything ah about love for immigrants and I've actually you know with my wife as an example I mean this has nothing to do with um it'd be an anti immigrant or racist\nMore than a dozen cities in California has sided with selling meet us in defined the state law marches Ito is assistant special agent in charge of ICE's homeland security investigations in the LA area or a chest I\nHe said the sanctuary state law is having the unintended consequences of complicating investigations into serious crimes like human trafficking\nI feel that this has become a political issue and it really should be it it should be a nonpartisan issue and so public safety issue it just ... is here to protect our national security and to protect our neighborhoods\nAnd if they took a minute to actually learn what we did I think they would be where we're very we help immigrants more than any other agency that I'm aware of\nA lot of these immigrants that come across illegally or abused I've met with a I've been on several interviews with women that were raped multiple times getting up here in our agents are the ones that help\nThese immigrants that are coming up here they tried to get the information from them and we go after the bad guys that are terrorizing these people when they're coming up here they take their life savings and they do very bad things to them or they were talking about criminal organizations that are doing this\nBut he says his division of ice has become collateral damage in a political battle over the country is broken immigration system but other cities in orange county see it differently go a few miles down the road from Los Alamos and you'll find Santa Ana which declared itself a sanctuary city long before the state passed its sanctuary law\nDivvied benefit ... is a city councilman there\nWe believe in the dignity of all people the city of ... or ... about eighty percent Latino about fifty percent of the residents of our city were born in other countries so\nAre the issues of immigration direct impact us directly and being a sanctuary city ensures that we send a message to all of our presidents that they're going to be treated respectfully a with dignity and at the city is here to serve them\nWell we we spoke earlier with the city manager from Los Alamos who said I'm not anti immigrant in fact I'm married to an immigrant and that's not about racism why um why I'm doing this [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't hold back my uh\nThe bond there was no need for the city of telling me to take the position that they did other than to send a political message or they're wanting them and other cities like them or wanting to send a message that California's is not a welcoming of immigrants and that's not the position that\nWe've come far beyond that I Would hope\nAnd we believe in the dignity of every person who answers our city and that's what it means to be a century city and when President Trump says that you're giving safe harbor the criminals you say what\nIs a liar and has no idea\nUh about the laws and and the law of the land he oftentimes talks about a violent criminals and\nI Do believe that any violent criminals should be held accountable the city's than than I Believe that any violent criminal should be ... held accountable they should be arrested they should serve their time however if you're only\nCrime quote unquote is leaving your country out of desperation looking to be able to uh survive being able to provide for your family that's not something that I see that uh the city should be looking to arrest somebody for\nSo what do people in law enforcement think well it depends on who you ask this is the chief of police in Santa Ana David Valentino\nI think some people misinterpret a sanctuary for being you know soft on crime or looking the other way that's that's not what it is certainly what we do here that's not what my mandate is tomorrow officers um we responded behaviors respond to criminal behavior irrespective of your status\nSo when representatives from ice state makes their job more difficult what do you say to them\nSo federal authorities um are you know that they have the mandate 'em to enforce federal law uh we do not and so a dislike lanes of traffic right um where our local I'm a police entity and we provide police services to the folks live here\nUm they have their mandate to enforce federal law and the and and they do that so\nUm the other pieces has to do with community trust and I know there's there's a large part of the dialogue there on what does that mean so the demographics of our city are such that we want people to feel comfortable to college for help\nIf they're not calling the police who are they common right so um the ideas to reinforce the messaging that we're not interested in in what the residency status we're going to respond and it's just\nThe under sheriff of Orange County\nWe were in one of the largest jail systems in the nation and we've always had a relationship with ice prior to this regardless what administration Bush Obama and now Trump\nWhen there's somebody in our custody roughly just about ten less than ten percent of our inmates in our custody for local crimes not for ice issues are here undocumented of that ten percent ice only really wants to about one percent of those individuals those are the ones they place it detain are on\nSo it isn't everybody in our custody it's just a small population of inmates who ice has said they want that we can no longer communicate if we can communicate we release them back in the community\nSo you'd think S. B. fifty four is making this community less safe\nI Know it is making the community last day first that a lot of the individuals who we do who are arrested or being returned to the communities in which they originally preyed upon so we know that to happen\nWe know of as of since January first we've had seven hundred and Seventy two through September this year individuals' criminals in our care who ice had placed entertainer on that we could not\nReturn dies they released back in the community one hundred and forty of those have already been re arrested for new crimes for for attempted murder\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

C. especially when you are the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee of the U.S Senate so that seniority has not been working for California I think that's what they want in today's day and age when we have a president who occupies the White House who is\nUm a a threat or like I said a few moments ago to our economic prosperity\nTo our values and more importantly to our people to eat I think she is fighting for California [noise] I think that uh she subscribes to country club rules are in a Washington that are ah grossly outdated\nAnd no longer apply or to uh to California into the rest of the country um I think that comedy um and there's bipartisanship I'm which I'm fine with bipartisanship I've always worked in a bipartisan manner is the leader of the president of the California state Senate\nBut this is very different ball game in Washington with this president who seeks to undermine a workers' rights women's rights are voting in civil rights as well as our environmental laws [noise]\nAh I think it takes a different type of representation in California wants a real fighter that will fight for their values and who they are and what they represent today not yesterday do you think the Democrats should try to impeach President Trump if the Democrats take back the house in\n... well I've always said from day one that I think there's enough evidence of for a an impeachment of uh the current president's um\nI have not uh been dissuaded or for the position of taken it is not a partisan position of chicken I don't think Democrats or Republicans should play around with the idea of parts of the ... for political purposes or this is based on a legalities\nAnd being the commander chief the chief executive officer of the most powerful position in the world I think there's sufficient evidence uh for the members of Congress are regardless of who controls are either chamber to move forward with impeachment now obviously\nIt's clear that the Republicans don't have the courage to move forward and do the right thing but if the uh the house has taken over by Democrats\n\n\nFunding for here and now comes from that for the greater the mat loud and they'd be like somewhere like reading a painting of engineering and science you learn more men were not income\nFrom NPR and W.

logo who is a reporter who's been covering homelessness for K. P. C. C. here in Pasadena Hi Joe Hi Jerry and when you listen there to Michael and Elizabeth uh you hear people who are educated you can't see it but there will dressed but they're homeless yeah\nTo me what their story really illustrates is you know what experts say is it it's so important to get people how quickly you know I'm demand talked about sort of thinking in to that hopelessness\nAnd when people go on how it's for a long time that just gets worse and worse than a lot of the things that people complain about street homelessness you know the associate things like alcoholism that comes from the trauma of being on the streets for a long time how bad is the problem in California right now\nLet me give you an example I you know up until a few months ago there were about two hundred people sleeping in tents in a plaza\nRight next to the main courthouse in orange county and next to city hall in Santa Ana I thought you know people saw this every day when they walked past it I'm Kevin has since been clear that you'd be hard pressed to find somebody who doesn't encounter people pretty much on a daily basis leading in parks are asking for money on sidewalks\nAnd is it getting worse and if so why\nThe single biggest reason is or the lack of housing I mean first of all yes it's getting worse\nAnd the lack of housing in Southern California and especially the lack of affordable housing you know a lot of people haven't yet recovered from the recession even though that was awhile ago now but rents have risen sharply and you know people more people keep moving into the area and there's just not enough housing for everyone let alone those salaries can't keep up with those market rate rent\nAnd and the second factor is that local governments haven't gotten really serious about addressing homelessness until pretty recently\nA there is historically been a lot of pushback against shelters and housing for homeless people and that continues today\nAnd there's a lawsuit in orange county uh currently before a federal judge in California tell us briefly about that\nIn this case came about when Orange County officials thought to clear out a very large homeless encampment I'm up to possibly Fifteen hundred people that had been growing for many years along a flood control channel kind of right smack in the middle of the county and advocates sued based on uh\nHe says if there's no realistic alternative for them\nOr you know if there's not enough shelter states basically at Orange County officials ended up giving thirty day motel vouchers to about seven hundred people\nAnd then from there and work to get them into shelter and more permanent housing we don't actually know how successful those efforts were because they haven't really kept track but the case really forced the county and cities in orange county to get serious about opening more sheltered there are several new ones expected to come in lined by the end of the year and and the judge is watching closely\n[noise] [noise]\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners of W.
