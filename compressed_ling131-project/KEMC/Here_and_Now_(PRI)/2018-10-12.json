can't sleep even knowing that and\nStudents topped the list as homework sports clubs bravado many get just a few hours a night well now some schools are taking action Dr Charles ... is chief of the division of sleep and circadian disorders at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston they have a sleep matters initiatives\nHe also teaches asleep class at Harvard University\nAnd because of the successor that class Harvard now has a mandatory online sleep class for incoming freshmen and it's going to be expanded to upper class and as well that ... is with us in the studio welcome\nThank you very much you can just telling us at Harvard was so pleased with what happened when the freshman students took this online course before coming in why what would they pleased about what what happened that they want to know extend this online course to all the students\nWere they were pleased by first of all the response more than Ninety percent of students that took the course students were actually lining up to fill out the questioner about their positive responses to the ... program\nWell what are you fighting against I mean anyone who's been in school knows that there is almost a you know leave to the last minute part of this where kids are working overnight but we understand that in some schools now including Harvard some of the group study groups meet at ten or midnight\nOr one o'clock in the morning yeah uh and this of course one of those popular courses or a computer science courts that that has actually hackers on where the students are scheduled to work all night as part of the course and then they have their other responsibilities I mean the\nThe football team has been getting up at four thirty in the morning to be lifting weights or just after five and then they may have another class that has a evening classes so the students are being pulled in many different directions many times problems shuts or do let's say they'd o'clock in the morning or nine o'clock in the morning\nAnd that just is shut up for the students staying up a\nLot of extended to all young people because not everyone goes to college and not everyone is staying up late in high school because they're finishing their science project they have phones and they have their social media that's keeping kids up\nAbsolutely in fact just the light the predominant wavelength that is driving that light that we're seeing on the screen is in the blue part of the spectrum which tells the brain but it's daytime it's like the blue sky\nAsleep and it does so it kind of an insidious manner because the internal clock since the strongest drive for waking just before what would be dusk a so during evolution ah we couldn't see during the nighttime\nAnd the brains send a powerful waking signal so we would get our act together\nAnd being a safe place when it got dark and we couldn't see anything well that worked great at that time but now we have through artificial light exposure shifted our circadian rhythms by four or five times zones westward just by the light that we get exposed to between dusk outside\nAnd when we decide to switch off so much\nWell this that we we talked about some of the health issues that arise disrupts sleeping enough re read Matthew Walker is terrific book why we sleep which is now in paperback we've seen the national geographic channel sleepless in America you're featured in there I mean not sleeping really can be fatal\nWill I mean you you talked about the motor vehicle crashes or nearly seven thousand people a year die in sleep related crashes on our nation's highways is responsible for one out of five car crash injuries and deaths\nWilling and Matthew walkers book you know he he lists the problems that can be causing including the car crashes but he also does a\nFun thing where he does a fake ads for a new miracle drug that will make you live longer enhance your memory make you more attractive because it keeps you slim protects you from cancer and dementia\nIn wars of cold and flu it lowers your risk of heart attacks and stroke not mentioned diabetes are you in just sip of course it's sleep absolutely get sleep keeps you then keep sleep keeps you going to\nDo as your appetite I mean if you're not getting enough sleep for example when you get the flu shot you only have half the antibody response if you're sleeping let's say less than five hours a night or you have a three hundred percent increased risk over five year period of Cal suffocation of the coronary arteries which leads to heart attacks and other adverse outcomes\nAnd lay down right now and just prepare for the grim reaper but how do you can say this to students and it's part of the culture to see who can stay up the latest\nWell part of the programs are we caught sleep one on one very interactive program in which\nFor example there's a dorm room and the students can click on a coffee cup in the dorm room and find out that caffeine has a six to nine hour half life many people are not aware of that um that they may take a cup of coffee after dinner and not realize that six hours later they still have have\nThey take up on sleep they can improve their reaction time if they're on a sports team the shorten the turn time and swimming they can get more all free throws in one of the things that students don't realize is that it's not just the amount of sleep that consistency in the\nTiming of sleep so students have irregular schedules\nThey don't do as well academically and one of the reasons we think that underlies that is if you have an irregular schedule usually\nThe internal clock shifts you later so when we've studied Harvard students we found\nThat those who have irregular schedules even if they got the same duration of sleep at inconsistent times they were shifted to California time even though they were studying here in Boston and that meant that if they have a eight or nine AM class that would be happening at five or six AM biological time on their internal clock so it's no wonder\nThat they don't do as well and those classes because when they take the test or when they're trying to pay attention it's the middle of the night\n[noise] wow so how do you change school life so that kids can sleep money maybe now the thing is not have a steady group but when am\nI right so when I had been teaching a freshman seminar every year at the end of the term the Fifteen students in the seminar have to make its head like talk in which they make a case for what they think could improve sleep healthy for example\nThat there should be an eleven our interval one student argued between the end of the last scheduled activity school sanctioned activity on the first\nA schedule activity in the morning or another student or suggested that assignments be do ten o'clock in the evening rather than at nine o'clock in the morning\nSo looking you're working with talking to you most specifically that students but you've got to sleep matters initiative from Brigham and Women's Hospital and you know there are specific groups of people who need help shift workers\nFirefighters he took his probably twenty four percent less likely to report an injury used have as many disability days and you can trace how life is just better from injuries to work out but because of sleep and we'll post some of the sit here now doubt or\nThe thing I was excited about that is that a lot of people have given up on firefighters and said well they work twenty four forty eight hour shift there's nothing you can do to help their sleep\nAnd we implemented a simple program of sleep health education and wellness for the firefighters took about an hour I mean one detail so we did a sleep disorders screening for example for ten minutes they fill out a few a validated questionnaires way identified if they are at high risk for sleep apnea or chronic insomnia rather\nHave sleep apnea and that means that even if they set aside the time for sleep is you can't breathe and sleep at the same time you're not going to get the rest of that you need\nAnd when we first came to present to them they made fun of the whole thing they brought pillows to the session a or kidding everybody say oh I got to have my sleep session and so on but then when we started showing them the information we feel that this is a it's a right for people to have this information to understand\nThat untreated sleep apnea for example after Eighteen years only fifty eight percent of them are still alive as opposed to Ninety four percent other without sleep apnea because it increases the risk of cardiovascular death by four hundred and twenty percent and we've had\nAmazing feedback from people say oh my God this this changed my whole life my depression was resolved I didn't stay on medications anymore my marriage I came back together it can really have a major impact and\nWe provide people as information and a screening\nBut what if you just you know you want to sleep more and you just you put your head down you can't\nSort of for people with chronic insomnia let's say one thing that they can do and and which is quite effective is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia can be done on line one program is called sleepy oh another is called shut eye\n\nSomething for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

deal to wait to establish a demilitarized zone around it lip and give rebel and radical groups deadlines to leave so what happened BBC Middle East editor Jeremy ... is in London but just back from a

militants leading\nWell so far they seem to be respecting the whole thing um it's the twelfth now in the final deadline is on the fifteenth submit a couple of days by the fifteenth\nThat meant to move both men and the heavy weapons out of the this new TMZ that they are being put together by the Turks and the and the Russians so you know we'll see but it's up to now according to the ... of course

all of that Fifteen to twenty thousand a ... you might call die Haji hobbies I think that this ... this DMZ does it basically postpones dealing with the issue\nWell meantime here you are in the front lines where did you see there including the troops that apparently didn't want to be seen\nUh with the troops that didn't want to be seeing were Russians somewhere okay we're talking but there were a tool good about being filmed all recorded in any way um the Russians very noticeable around the\nTerms of the physical state of the area you drive along and there is one wrecked vintage off to another

towns or had been killed\nI Wonder that retail muscle yet another empty tell us what what was happening to these guys and I had to conclude that probably most of them are over the border in Turkey the Turkish border isn't very far from a liberal and\nI think some will be dead and others will be inside the city itself up ... you know the way it was used by the regime in the last couple of years is that as they did a shoulder to deal with rebels in different enclaves um to give up and they offered them a way out where they would be bus stop to it lip\nAnd that's why they went and that's why there are so many guys up there yeah I Am in some cases that families as well um I think though that if you drive ... areas we did and we talked to a lot of people you to get an idea about the way that\nThat the war to in the hot out of the country it is done so much not just physical but in terms of what it does to people's minds and also [noise]\nIt looks like nothing ever happened but when you go out of Damascus do you go to places like the area rounded lipped than you can really see walked the war has done in terms of absolute devastation on disaster\nSomebody think happens now because it's not just the Syrian diehard rebels who are being funneled into this\nA demilitarized zone and the Islamist militias along with them that have you know taken advantage of the situation there you have the courage who've been fighting the Assad regime as well the U.S back Kurd and now we have Turkey's president airline threatening to expand his country's military efforts in parts of northern Syria\nTo take on these us that Kurdish fighters look people anticipate that the Syrian forces backed by Russia and Iran will take back it lived there will be the end of this sort of the civil war\nBut you've got a you know U.S interests Iranian interest Russian interests a Turkish interests what do you anticipate happens now\nA century the dangers of all the Vita is that some of these guys

of California's Adelanto immigration detention center officials found new suits made of bed sheets and a litany of other health concerns\nThe inspector general's office at the department of homeland security published a harsh report this week detailing problems inside the building a private company runs it for immigration and Customs Enforcement at houses up to two thousand people waiting for the immigration cases to be decided\nJoining us now is ... she's a reporter for the Los Angeles times and she's been covering the story pull him a welcome thank you this was a shocking report to read inspectors found new is made of bed sheets in Fifteen cells\nHow is that possible uh well that's a good\nQuestion you know I think that the reason that the office of inspector general issued this management alert\nSaying these sort of were issues that needed to be addressed immediately because you know a year ago\nA man killed himself at a detention center using bed sheets and there have been to other attempts also using a bed sheets so I think when the inspectors with the office of the inspector general walked through Adelanto on this a surprise inspection and found that\nThese nodded bed sheets were just hanging from from events and so many cells I think that was a sense of urgency is needed to be addressed\nShould we imply then that that many people inside the facility worse suicidal or could they have been for some other reason making those\nYeah I I don't think so um you know people are told\nThe inspectors that they use them for various reasons they said that they would unfurl the\nBut they were also told by one man that he had seen suicide attempts using these new says and that the guard sort of laughed them off and call them suicide failure is when a\nWhen the attempt weren't successful so uh so now I don't think it was the case and every person's case but it's clear that that this has happened before and that officials were aware of that\nAnd it wasn't the only problem inside the building by any means what else did you find [noise]\nRight so the other things that the office of the inspector general highlighted that they found during this unannounced inspection in May of this year was\nYou know one of the big things and this has been an issue in Adelanto for years since it opened back in two thousand eleven was a questions of untimely inadequate medical care\nUm and then the other problem that they highlighted was improper and overly restrictive a use of segregation and you know the thing about an immigration detention is it's supposed to be\nWhat they call civil detention it's not criminal detention it's not supposed to be punitive in nature and so there are national standards that sort of govern how that's supposed to uh happened and so when you're using disciplinary segregation in ways that are more punitive that becomes a problem\nWhere we also learned but doctors stamped their names on patient records without ever seen the detainees a dentist said that he didn't have time to do ... and the detainees could just use string from their socks to flush their teeth\nI'm is what is the law say about what kind of medical care they're supposed to be receiving immigration detention\nIs governed by ah what are called his performance based national detention standards and that governs everything about medical care that\nDetainees are supposed to receive and obviously this care is supposed to be timely you know it's supposed to be adequate for these detainees who\nAre have no choice but to rely on the care that they're given inside these facilities and in Adelanto in several a government inspection reports over the years again since it opened in two thousand eleven the facility has failed to meet the standards of this is not the first time that that this has been an issue\nWe should point out that I Belong to is owned by a private company the GEO Group and it's it's very very common for the federal government to contract these detention centers out to private companies you mentioned they have a history of problems um what is the companies saying I I mean is anybody being held to account\nHe did not respond when we did our our story about the office of inspector general's report but after that they did a send me a statement saying that they took the a report very seriously\n[noise]\nFor here know comes from the listeners have W.

video proof that he was killed and dismembered inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\n... you wrote columns critical of the Saudi Government for the post and he hasn't been seen since he entered the constantly more than a week ago his disappearance has raised questions about the close relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia\nThe BBC's market low and joins us now from Istanbul and mark you have your own reporting that's similar to the post what are you hearing\nThat'd be a source close to touch investigation of said turkey has got still convinced that evidence to support the claim off state sponsored murder of ... she went into the Saudi ... let in Istanbul ten days ago\nAnd this also said tells us that I'm On course official position is still that ... is missing about that a Texan Hutchins knows for sure that he was mud\nI'm not a backs up the American news reports and all that audio and video a video evidence the recordings showing that mistake a show she was a northern he\nKilled but also interrogation tortured before that and they're very gruesome details coming out including recordings allegedly of him being beaten\nI'm On some reports that his body was just men but\nI'm the Saudi or officials Saudi authorities are still slap each and knowing all the allegation\nHow reliable generally speaking is Turkish intelligence um I Would say that it is it's it's it's pretty reliable in terms of what they leak to Turkish pro government media on this is not strange communication strategy with his government hearing techie where they don't really speak directly to\nForeign media for example they and they actually have a ... communications department but they do leak through the state media so I think what's happening at the moving pictures that\nThe Turkish government is maintaining a study more cautious approach except for example ... welcomed in Saudi officials here to be part of a joint Saudi ... investigation\nOr that the Saudis have proposed\nThat is the tux playing nice in saying that we're going to we don't wanna blah diplomatic relationship at this stage but they all lead King I'm a incriminating evidence on a day to day basis and that was tightening the screws on the Saudis and trying\nInvestigation has to be how credible it can be if it includes the Saudi Government yeah and and I think it's sort of basically being compared to for example if Donald Trump what two sets up a joint suddenly the crimes inquiry with the Russians I mean I I really think that\nThey say is kind of um a a diplomatic nice city on the politics of the tux entertaining the Saudis on this but they are pretty clear that they have called the evidence to back up their explosive\nAllegations and there is some more irony here as well the turkey is pushing a case that a journalist was murdered on its soil while at the same time the country is one of the world's biggest jailer of journalists or are people noting that at all the\nBiggest jailer of journalists I mean yes it has been noted particularly by tequila ... such as a spot and\nYou know that said at techies not treating journalists in the same way as they ... a journalist is alleged of injuries you know that it's not murder in K which took him out or how ... locked up journalist which is obviously a also an attack on persuade them and completely unacceptable by in a ... attack on on on a liberal values but\nBut uh yeah there is some distance between the two cases I think\nHere in our country a mission that this case is threatening us Saudi relations which has been very very close over the years but from your perspective there and his stumble\nHow much is this case threatening the diplomatic order any across the region well I think that turkey is very aware that it that you know the relation with Saudi Arabia is important it doesn't want to destroy that relationship at this stage\nBought a I think that you know clearly tucked he's not going to sit back and simply accept what is in effect the flagrant violation of its\nSovereignty aid it won't support from the U.S and from other western governments in and taking a tough line towards the towards the Saudis and speaking of diplomacy there's one other breaking news story I Want to ask you about today a U.S pastor Andrew Brunson\nHeld in Turkey in prison in Turkey for two years has been released today by the Turkish government uh what are we learning about that\n[noise] yeah this is a country that produces more news and it can can see him or any American pasta Andrew Brunson he was detained in the ... the failed coup here in twenty sixteen accused of supporting terrorist groups\nAre he has family the American government is always have always had that's completely baseless and they put pressure on the tax to release him president Edwin has always maintained he could not to interfere with the independence of the ... which is seen as laughable bike by critics of of tacky\nAnd what's happened today is that he has finally being released a he was sentenced to ...\nHe spent in custody Andrew Brunson will finally be able to go back to the U.S and and uh it was the source of massive friction between the U.S and ... governments at sanctions tariffs and the plunging of attack US Currency that as well and I expected to east to some extent\nAnd it will be seen most likely as a diplomatic victory for the Trump Administration the BBC's mark ... thank you so much pressure\nNow back to the U. S. where a candidate in Georgia's hotly contested governor's race has been hit with a federal lawsuit Republican secretary of state Brian Kemp is running for governor\nAnd he was sued yesterday by groups that say his office is jeopardizing the votes of some minority residents ... campaign denies that it did anything wrong but his opponent Democrat Stacey Abrams is calling on him to resign as secretary of state\nJonathan breeder is counsel with the Brennan Center for justice is Democracy Program at the nonpartisan group\nThat advocates for voting rights Jonathan thanks for joining us thanks for having the reporting is that camps office stole the registrations for fifty three thousand mostly black and Hispanic voters based on a law known as exact match what can you tell us about that\nExact matches a policy by which if all the information on a voter registration form down to the digital hyphen doesn't match perfectly with the existing data and driver's license for Social Security information the voter registration form is put on hold and in some cases rejected entirely\nDo most people on that list no that they've been excluded\nThey're supposed to get a notice in the mail but often times people don't receive those or understand what they mean and so the burden is and placed on the voter to fix this problem which in other states without affect our eligibility or or voting at all\nOkay so in total comes off as a secretary of state has canceled nearly a million and a half voter registration since two thousand and twelve\nHis campaign is saying that he's making sure that only legal citizens cast a ballot and that it has never been easier to vote in Georgia um what what do you make of that are you aware of any voter fraud problem in Georgia on a significant level\nThere's no significant evidence of voter fraud in Georgia and although voter list maintenance is important there's no connection between aggressively purging the voter rolls the way Georgia has and making elections more secure at\nCamp is also a putting a fair amount of the blame here on Stacey Abrams his Democratic opponent she started a voter registration group in two thousand and Thirteen called ...\nThousands of people up through that project they did a sloppy job and that he was just pulling out those improper registrations I mean it does Stacey Abrams in her group deserve any blame for maybe doing this in in a poor fashion\nVoter registration drives our a vital lifeline to get certain communities who don't have as much access to government offices registered to vote if there is information missing or sometimes happens\nThe states should do everything they can to resolve those discrepancies what Georgia is doing is making it the voters burden to resolve that problem instead of trying to fix it themselves\n[noise] do you think a candidate who's running for governor can independently also be the secretary of state\nWhile it's happened before in other states I don't think this is a unique situation I think that one of the concerns is that\nAs secretary of state or Mr camp has made some controversial statements there was a statement he made several years ago expressing dismay about some voter registration drives and he's been accused of politically motivated investigations so that's certainly a concern in Georgia specifically\nAnd just to be fair I Want to add something else that campus said he says the Georgia has broken a record this year for voter registrations with nearly seven million new voters added to the rules I Want to also ask you to expand this beyond Georgia how common are exact match laws around the country\nThere's a couple of states that have some version for example Florida has a version of this but they will go back and look at the voter registration form and try to resolve the difference before they put it back on the voter and put them the voters are at risk and and give them their responsibility to fix the problem", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "city": "Billings", "day": "12"}
