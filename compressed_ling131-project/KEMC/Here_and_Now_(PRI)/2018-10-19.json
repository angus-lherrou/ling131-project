scheduled across the rest of the country a powerful local police chief was killed by gunmen in Kandahar general Scott Miller commander of us ...\nThe two thousand one us led invasion that the top American commander in Afghanistan has been involved in an incident like this joining us now is the b._b._c. chief international correspondent leads to such he's in Kabul, Afghanistan\nLeast there have been a number of recent Taliban attacks in the run up to this election but this one in Kandahar was especially brazen what did you say to you about the security situation there\nThis was the most devastating attack a by the Taliban against\nAh the senior leadership in Afghanistan taking place in Kandahar a critical critical province of the former heartland of the Taliban they still have a network of sympathizers still have the ability to carry out there is a kind of spectacular attack\nThe wife now to see new leadership including the powerful police chief general Abdul ...\nSome may some have raised questions about his his tactics send in trying to improve security in the province so there's no denying he was a lynchpin\nIn bringing a better security and stability to this area not just to kind of her\nBut to the entire south so it really has sent a shiver right across Afghanistan and happening so sue now before these critical parliamentary polls we're still waiting to hear all the details about how this was done but we understand was\nCommitted to buy a member of his security team of young bodyguard underlining again the ability of the Taliban to somehow persuade new bride\nOr encourage young Afghans to act for them right in the ... of the the ... the Afghan or authority administration\nAnd it does come just two days before the parliamentary elections in Afghanistan do you think that it's related to that\nThe total almost strike whenever they can they have vowed to attack these polls they verge of Afghan citizens like teachers and students not to vote to not to put themselves up in harm's way\nThey have said that they will try very hard not to\nOr not to injure to kill civilians but they've made it clear that they will they will attack security forces and they will attack this electoral machinery or they say this is very much and uh of intellectual exercise\nCarried out for the west and they want to Afghanistan to have no part of it so security forces across the ... are on high alert um it's hard to know when and how they will attack I remember I was here for the last ...\nBye Pakistan or by other forces not to attack the polls but they carried out and devastating attack after the polls closed we can say for certain what will happen this time\nAh I Know the efforts have been made to try to convince the Taliban not to not to damage at this crucial protests but of course no matter what the what the Taliban do or don't do there's still the forces of Islamic state and they will listen to no one and they have carried out some of the most brutal attacks including here in the heart of causal\nOr American troops going to be involved in election related security this weekend\nThis is very much an Afghan led protests and the Afghans are very proud of that the ring of steel as they call it\nAround ... is very much for Afghan police Afghan military African intelligence we're visiting\nThe control room of the Afghan police this week they showed us all their security cameras right across the city keeping an eye on all the major streets and the thoroughfares of course the NATO forces including the Americans are in the background\nAdvising providing intelligence they of course have have their aircraft when it comes to securing the vote and they said to be more than fifty thousand forces involved that is very much shop Afghans who will be a right at the front for protecting up Afghan people\nIt's been Seventeen years now since the U.S led war in Afghanistan the toppled the Taliban it doesn't sound like they are are giving up anytime soon that they still would like to retake control of the country well\nThat's a big question I think there have been studies which show that the Taliban\nOur eyes are controlling or have influence in a very large number of Afghan districts the estimates go anywhere from fifty to Seventy percent of of the districts\nBut it has always been said that they cannot take the capital Kabul which would be the most heavily secured a part of of Afghanistan and of course would involve a lot of bloodshed\nWhich is why there is great hope being invested now in the new signs that possibly peace talks could begin there's the new\nAmerican envoy and sell me highly decide who has was born in Afghanistan is now leading a American official he's former\nI'm a ... year to Afghanistan he's been visiting the telephone talking to Pakistan talking to the Afghans and hoping very march to start a protest which gets the Taliban and the Afghan government around the table to negotiate an end to this war and of course that would involve discussion\nLeave Afghanistan at least you said after all of your trips to Afghanistan over the years what strikes you about the country right now in twenty Eighteen\nWe're really strikes me about Afghanistan now is that there are the ... the new war is very much between the dark forces of the past including the Taliban including the powerful warlords including the drugs drug lords and the criminal networks\nAnd against a new educated generation of Afghans who are truly inspiring often the reports we hear our young Afghans leaving for Europe\nIt was saying they have no future here turning their back on their country but when you come to Afghanistan what you see is highly educated young Afghans determined to stay here knowing the risks and they are running in record numbers in this these parliamentary elections trying to take on\nThe old forces including the warlords and their sons and mostly sons who are running in these elections so it is very much an election pose between hope and fear\nAnd the greatest hope is that political space safe political face will be open to not\nTo let this new generation have a greater say in forging a new future for this a long embattled country\nThat's the b._b._c. chief international correspondent leads to set in Kabul, Afghanistan as Afghans prepare to vote in parliamentary

statistic\nBy twenty fifty to World Bank predicts that climate change could create as many as one hundred and forty three million climate migrants people moving to new places to escape conditions that are making it difficult to live\nTo put that into context that's double the number of refugees in the world today and well that migration would be unprecedented we have seen is smaller movements because of climate before many times within the United states\nIt airs in Nathan Connelly our historians and hosted the podcast back story\nWill come back I happier now I Know you're both us historians but I'm gonna ask you to stretch the limits of your scholarship here are way way back to long before we were ever a country um what was the first human migrations that we saw because of climate in North America well\nArchaeologist tell us that you have at least in the twelve or Thirteen century Native Americans who are migrating because of massive droughts in the west and southwest in the Americas of course are being populated by people who are migrating from Asia so we have no sense of all the ways in which climate was driving them in the first place but even in those migrations and the twelve\nAnd Thirteen century you have a very clear reliance on crops like Mays I'm ways in which people are not able to rely on that\nMoving to come into contact and so you have the Sunni and hoping and the monkey on who are moving through and trying to find villages in some cases moving along rivers and creating new moments of cultural contact but at great stress and you're talking about thousands of people who are forced to move and relocate oftentimes abandoning whole cities of civilization some of those places that we now see a tourist attractions in the southwest of these\nAnd empty villages in the hillside some of those are a product of these large massive migrations ... or the other side point of this of course when the Europeans arrived\nMany of them are migrants of a very related sword I mean they're fleeing certain kinds of hardship in Europe and many of them are talking about for instance the abundant timber in places like North America and trying to find ways in which they can get a slightly more regular life was given the deforestation that happened\nIn Europe and the Eighteenth nineteenth century and so there's going to be a constant relationship\nBetween mass migrations and concerns about the climate and sustainability\nAnd then once those Europeans got here and started establishing their own communities here what happened to me do we see similar things moving forward\nWhat we need to think about the relationship between climate change is an issue about people as well you could argue that the two of the worst things happen in American history are directly related to that process which is the forced migration of a million people a across the American south\nOr because the climate there enabled this new crop of pot and that um ... tied back to Europe the way that Nathan was talking before this new industries that are driving\nAnd you would have found that and you were to slavery I mean I'm Sorry I just uh just to be specific to your yeah slavery and talking about and you've seen that in many ways the worst slavery or in southern Louisiana sugar cane fields which go up to the very boundary where the climate will allow them to go and and the rice\nFields on on the planet coast so you see a very finely attuned to just a few degrees temperatures you were talking about before\nAbout how you can have this forced migration of millions of people in slavery\nSo I'm hearing a theme here that people tend to follow where the plants and the crops will go because of course that's how we sustain ourselves but also our economies um what about other reasons that people moved historically related to the climate well if you think about the ...\nConcern now around Atlantic storms there again there's a history of the ways in which hurricanes have forced all kinds of people to basically pull up stakes and relocate I mean this again has a kind of hemispheric\nImpact if you think for instance about some of the Atlantic storms that came through the Caribbean or even hit the southeast in the early part of the twentieth century many of these were quite cataclysmic with really substantial effect\nMittens is back in Nineteen fifties you have a massive storm hit Jamaica that helps to spawn migration to England in that decade and even in the United states is a huge hurricane\nIn Nineteen forty seven late September\nThat creates a huge problem of displacement in the south east of the United states because largely the infrastructure isn't there and this is a reminder to listen to us to think about on natural disasters right the hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans was about levees breaking for instance in in the south in the Nineteen forties\nYou at farmers who are being displaced folks were relocated because of racial segregation statues in the south had their whole homes relocate it and then subsequently ripped up by massive hurricanes you're talking about hundreds in some cases thousands\nOf migrants of Atlantic storms because of discrimination and a lack of infrastructure even within the United states in the Nineteen forties\nYou know we're talking about that even still today especially as these hurricanes come up the coast a lot of the conversation after those storms ripped through and destroy communities is should we rebuild right here on this coastline\nRight again and it's the absolutely what's interesting is how much of that building is a recent from Virginia to Florida from Nineteen eighty to ... century a quarter of all American population growth was alone that Atlantic Coast and another large parts courses and\nIn Texas where you have everything's enabled by air conditioning which is a post World war two innovation\nSo the migration voluntary involuntary is sort of creating so to speak a perfect storm where people are moving to where the greatest vulnerabilities lie we've got to talk about the dust bowl the Nineteen thirties hundreds of thousands of Americans displaced\nAt a very difficult time for the country during the depression and this was not just weather related it also had to do a lot with how Americans were interacting with the land\nSo there were severe drought during the Nineteen thirties and and window erosion that was accompanied I'm really came on the heels of really inefficient irrigation techniques and so angered soil you know basically came up and was turned to to dust and you had over a hundred million acres in Texas Oklahoma New Mexico Kansas and so forth basically ruined as a result of\nAgain decades long degradation the crop losses alone were twenty five million dollars per day that's a Nineteen thirty six dollars so you're talking almost four hundred and fifty million dollars of losses every single day\nDuring the dust bowl in the thirties you're nearly three million people who leave the plain states most of whom go to California and California itself\nBegins have been an act the series of lost it basically restrict\nTo bring in the gym persons into the state you have local attorneys trying to enforce it with verve and it's not until the ACLU really fight back against is that you get a Supreme Court case in Nineteen forty one that actually makes it okay makes it a law in America to not restrict interstate migration for poor people\nYou write I'm thinking back to the grapes of wrath and the images of the family moving from their homes to the west coast as they were\nDefinitely vilified people were vilified these migrants were not treated well and it gives us a hint at what might happen in the future doesn't it uh when this happens if it happens again\nWell we need to remember too that one reason we have the grapes of wrath is that it was about white people moving right about poor engine why people we don't really have representations of people other ethnic backgrounds who have been displaced and move so\nI think that it's interesting that we ... gives us something to think with but it doesn't really reflect the picture\nWell I'm from the southwest and my family first moved there in the Nineteen fifties because at that time the weather was good\nThe air was clean and now as I think about how the climate is changing in places like Arizona Southern California New Mexico Colorado there are wildfires there are droughts\nThat have literally lasted more than a decade and I'm I've been wondering you know when will people start to leave\nBut also when will people start staying put in other parts of the country and not coming to places in the sun belt I that that's got a really ... the the economies of a place\nAnd the identity of a lot of places well\nI grew up in South Florida and you know Miami and a lot of ways is considered to be ground zero of what will be you know sea level raises and other kinds of climate concerns I mean I've thought about whether or not I could go you know and make a snow bird migration like so many folks do in their old age to go back to Florida so I I Wish I could say it wasn't\nA consideration I mean some of the projections that we've now seen\nComing out of these latest reports are saying as early as twenty forty\nYou're going to start to see unsustainable crises are irreversible crises in places like\nSouth Florida again Louisiana the Gulf Coast these places are going to be drastically compromise in terms of what the next generation of a generation after will be able to do so I Hope that we're not talking in historical terms about the place that used to be Florida a place that used to be\nLouisiana but there's a very real possibility that you know the entire country and really the world is going to have to make a dramatic shift to prevent that history\n\nFunding for here and now

Eighteen into combat and she says she's really seen as a Democrats hope to kind of flip one Republican control district in the country in their favor\nYou know she's prided herself on really trying to get out into rural parts of the district kind of the assumption is that a Democrat is going to do well in Lexington the urban center of this district but you know historically has not done so well out in rural areas and so she's really been trying to push her campaign out into the rural parts\nIt's most evident last week she brought for vice president Joe Biden out to a rally in ... ville it's a town of ...\nVice president now the thing about Amy McGrath is she's raising a lot more money than Andy Barr she's raised about six and a half million dollars since the campaign started bars it about four and a half million how much of a factor will that be and it's a lot of outside money starting to trickle into this race\nThere are certainly a lot of outside money there's a lot of uh you know it may be nationwide interest in this race\nI mean at this point they're kind of ... or at least in terms of the amount of money that they have on hand they're pretty much neck and neck and so at this point forward we're just going to kind of expect to see a lot more TV ads and it's really like a voter turnout game at this point how how well are they going to be able to get their people to come out to the polls when it really matters on November sick\nAnd what do the poll say we're just a couple of weeks away now from election day\nEver there seems to be a new poll every week or two and they kind of they're all pretty much toss up so it goes back and forth a little bit there there's no way to really say that the one person has a an edge if either one does they have a very slight edge a and and really isn't something that could change depending on who ends up showing up on on election day\nSo Kentucky ... six congressional district will be one of those key places people are watching to see if Democrats can take a seat from Republicans and flip the house in the Democrats' favor that dryland Barton statehouse reporter for Kentucky public radio thank you thanks Peter\nThe TV show the counters premiered this Tuesday on ABC it's a new version of the famous sitcom Roseanne but without Roseanne Barr\nABC revived Roseanne last spring the show was hit it was cancelled though after it's dark tweeted racist remarks now the rest of the cast is back together for a second try and NPR TV critic Eric Deggans joins us to talk about it higher Rick\nHi so the first episode is a send off to the character Roseanne counter we learned that she her character died of a an opioid overdose or here's a clip of her sister on the show Jackie who's played by Laurie Metcalf talking to John Goodman character Dan which is Roseanne husband\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office the autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery and it was just I'd be pro [noise] it's got to be wrong\nSo Roseanne Barr are released a statement after that episode aired calling the decision to kill off her character this way grin and morbid what do you think\nI think she's right but I also think the storytelling worked so um they had for shadow\nAnd so if they're gonna kill off the character to do it in this way makes a lot of sense for the character and also hooks it into all of these issues\nAbout people being under insured and the working class folk struggling to deal with medication all of this stuff that the show wants to talk about I can now talk about because of the way that there was any kind of character past well\nAll important issues the question is who saw the show a and we're seeing that the ratings for the premier of the Connors word down to just ten point five million compared with Eighteen million people on average you tuned into Roseanne when they returned last march\nRight but um there's a few things going on there and I mean number one they there was an intense amount of publicity when Roseanne the revival was debuting and then you also had news that the rose encounter character was going to be a Trump supporter and I think that fueled a lot of talk about the show\nI think it kind of made sense that it would do this huge number now over the course of its run it did an average of about Eighteen million viewers so I don't think the Connors is going to get to that level but it's drawing about the same audience that rose in the revival was doing when it ended its run in may\nAnd then it's going to be their challenge the kind of building the audience\nAnd retain people who may have just watched the Connors out of curiosity to see what happened to Roseanne character\nBut they're avoiding more partisan politics and the ... than they did and Roseanne\nI seen two episodes of the show and for those two episodes it certainly seems that way you know originally if you remember the original version of Roseanne that was a show that tried to talk about all of the different issues that face the working class family and it wasn't quite as part is and I mean\nI I have to say I I I watch that show a lot out when I was growing up and I never thought of it as a political show at all\nYeah I mean I think it actually was a political show it just wasn't about a particular political party so now the shows kind of back to what it was doing before which was trying to explore these issues with an idea tour as you know breaking down some of the stereotypes that people might have about working class families and talking honestly about the issues they face\nAnd they're also talking a bit about gay rights because one of the characters came out during the episode and I think we have a clip of that let's check it out [noise]\nKnow [noise] oh I was kind of waiting for you to tell me about it [noise]\nI actually fell off [noise]\nIs basically ... grandson he seemed to address and kind of I'm In a in a feminine way in the revival and they had an episode that kind of dealt with that but I think they were sort of insistent that he wasn't necessarily gay now they have this character saying that he is gay\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners have W.

now volatility has returned to the u._s. stock market Wall Street jumped this morning but it's been a rough couple of weeks of three percent drop last Wednesday one per cent decline yesterday [noise]\nOf course that's nothing compared to what happened thirty one years ago today when the u._s. stock market dropped twenty two point six percent the largest single day loss in us history\nNew York times financial reporter Diana Henry case wrote about what led up to that day and what can be learned from it in her book a first class catastrophe the road to black Monday the worst day in Wall Street history I spoke with her last September and began by asking her what made her want to dive into this crisis\nWell talking with younger people in my circle even younger financial reporters I was astonished at how little they knew about the Nineteen eighty seven crash\nI Lived through it myself as a reporter but the mythology that has grown up around black Monday is really an amazing monument to Wall Street amnesia and let me tell you\nPeople will tell you oh it was no big deal was over in a day was one and done and nothing could be further from the truth so it was so\nI kind of wanted to solve a mystery here why has plaque Monday been so forgotten why have we not recognized what it was showing us and taken that to heart\nWell why did you start your book where you did in the seventies because he has to indicate that that was the beginning of what led to it\nGreat question and I'm Glad you raised that Jeremy my\nThe book opens on the silver crisis uh which was a bubble and the silver market but what was significant about that crisis which was in the commodity market far from Wall street was the way it quickly led to the traditional fire breaks\nThe panic spread from market to market from the commodity market to the brokerage industry to banks and the various regulators of all those marketplaces barely knew each other's names\nSo we open on a world where official Washington is still kinda trapped in this delusion that there are all these isolated markets that can be regulated separately\nAnd the silver crisis in Nineteen eighty blew that delusion\n... heated occasions when\nA panic refused to stay where it was supposed to so that by the time you arrive at black Monday you understand that just didn't just pop out of the clear blue sky this was the culmination of a series of\nMisjudgments missteps fundamental changes in how Wall Street worked\nWell one of the fundamental changes was the rise of electronic trading how how big a role to play\nIt was an enormous role and it was very unfamiliar to most investors at the time particularly the main street investors the extent to which computers were speeding the flow of orders into the marketplace at the speed of light\nAnd many of those markets were still operating at what I call the speed of life not the speed of light and they were human markets they were trying to operate\nAs they had operated for a hundred years and they were overwhelmed by the pace of automated order delivery\nIn addition if further in the background in the shadows beyond even the vision of alert regulators were the use of computers to devise new and destabilizing trading strategies to create new\nFinancial derivatives that were used in imaginative and unusual ways so the computer was a tool of the financial engineers who are creating the new products that would so ah affect trading on black Monday\nI must say as you're talking about this sounds kinda familiar ... after having just lived through the crash of two thousand eight you know people talking about a lot of a fast trading and new products that nobody understands\nYou're exactly right I mean in in Nineteen eighty seven there were these tighten investors who use these untested derivatives\nIn computer driven strategies and they nearly overwhelmed ... regulatory system exactly the same thing happened in two thousand eight too big to fail investors using untested derivatives in high speed heard investing strategies with fragmented oversight so\nWe're right back where we started only with exponentially larger scale and risks\nThat you brought up the issue of regulators you talk in this book about Ronald Reagan who took office or in Nineteen eighty one and was pushing for smaller government was appointing people who wanted to cut\nHave in the crash in Nineteen eighty seven\nWell it's sort of a mixed bag Jeremy yes um there was a new deregulatory fever in Washington the way that played out however was in skimpy rations for the regulators so they do the extent that the regulatory machinery was\nUnder staffed and under financed that was a result of this determination to cut back on big government but I should point out that after the crash it was a blue ribbon commission appointed by President Reagan led by\nA staunch Republican Brady\nWho recommended that we scrap our current regulatory system and put a unit a fight regulator in charge in Washington\nSo both the prescription for what we should do and some of the problems that gave rise to black Monday can be traced back to these political divisions but I should also say that\nThe Democrats in Congress on the left in the Nineteen eighties we're not really part of the solution either a they won and more funding for regulatory agencies true but they failed to undertake the serious oversight of these profound changes in the marketplace\nOne I Wonder if we can ever expect our members of Congress to be able to be good regulators of the financial industry because it is so complicated how can we expect them to understand all these new products enough to oversee well\nThat's why we need to look at the regulatory structure we have\nWe don't expect our politicians in Congress to understand nuclear energy but we do expect them to adequately fund the department of energy and make sure that the risks that that agency overseas are adequately taken care of\nI think the same thing is true of our financial markets yes they are extremely complex and yes they are\nAlgorithm driven and there's lots of rocket scientist from academia who were making fortunes on Wall street and that is arcane and bizarre for a lot of people in the political realm\nBut they still have the responsibility of making sure that the regulatory agency is appropriately structured appropriately funded and appropriately staffed so that you can understand what's happening on Wall street even if they can't\nDo do you get a better understanding and writing this book of why\nQuickly and spread and cause a market crash\nYes although it wasn't a big surprise yeah we've been laboring for decades under the um the notion of an efficient and market a rational market where investors make rational decisions and and those decisions are incorporated into the prices of securities automatically\nI never found that particularly persuasive I've got two big appreciation for how people panic in a crisis\nBut after researching a black Monday I don't understand how anyone can believe that that's an accurate explanation of how markets work\nWe're human beings we bring a lot of baggage to our investment decisions we could frightened we indulgent wishful thinking we ignore the red flags until it's too late that's the nature of the human mind\nI'm sure a lot of people on Wall street are going to read your book what about people who don't work on Wall street or don't work in the financial industry what do you want them to take away\nI Want them first of all to understand that this is not a mom and pop market we're the mice on the elephants dance floor here\nAnd we need to understand our role\nWhat I Hope they will take away from the book is a clearer picture of how today's market works and how we got here but I also hope they will realize that when the elephants or stamp heating and running around with their ears on fire what they should
