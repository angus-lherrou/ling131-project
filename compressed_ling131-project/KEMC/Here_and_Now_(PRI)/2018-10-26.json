B. U. R. I'm ...\nI'm Peter O'Dowd is here and now one person has been arrested today in South Florida in connection with suspicious packages sent this week to prominent Democrats CNN and people critical of President Trump we will be watching as that story develops throughout the day\nThis morning to more packages were intercepted one addressed to New Jersey senator Cory Booker\nThe other to James Clapper the former director of national intelligence and it brings the number of potential mail bombs to twelve and now just eleven days from the mid term elections many Americans are talking about the need to lower the temperature in national politics\nJoining us now this ... NPR's lead politics editor hide him and go hey they're so obviously we're going to keep him close track of the story and learning more about who the suspect is who has been arrested what we know for sure though is just how divisive these crimes have become in American politics and I wonder if you can tell us why\n[noise] [noise] well I you know I mean polarization it has been at an all time high for quite some time uh you know you look back at a couple of different ...\nAre worse than than today but there's not much in between uh and you know President Trump let's be Frank has been somebody who has\nCreated the sense that the press is the enemy of the people he continues to say fake news at his rallies and a point the finger at the pen that we're all kept in at the rallies or behind the riser is I was at a rally in Houston people were very nice to me going in\nA happy to take my questions a lovely people to chat with and talk to by the end in through the middle of as a crescendo of just anti a media stuff so that's what comes to be seen and President Trump has been somebody who's been a take no prisoners\nYou know I'm kind of politician for anybody who disagrees with him\nBut to medical the president's started this week by calling for unity and then he has come to this place of that you're describing now and want to hear from a White House press secretary Sarah Sanders who was speaking on Thursday\nOr if the president I think could not have been more presidential yesterday when he spoke directly to the American people condemned this violence let's not get lost and who is responsible for this heinous act\nIt is the person who made and sent the suspicious packages let's not forget that that is ultimately the person that is responsible and will be held responsible by this administration know clearly\nThe president thinks he's being unfairly linked to the person who did this but why hasn't he been able to stick to that message of unity that he started this with\nI mean it's pretty typical pattern of President Trump's I mean this is somebody who anytime he has criticized or becomes the sort of a focus of criticism then he doubles down he trickles down he digs that ah you know that trench and just going to fight for every inch\nAnd you know to some respects with Sarah Sanders says is true or the people the person who committed this act um is going to be held responsible or its adjusts department that the president overseas and that person is largely responsible for what they did obviously\nAt the same time you can't ignore the climate that's been created in this country where people view each other in ways that are in human and that is that a recipe for disaster especially for people who might not be as mentally stable or as\n\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm ... I'm Peter O'Dowd and we're waiting for a news conference from the Justice Department just a few minutes from now will be learning new details in our top story today one person\nIs in custody in South Florida in connection with a series of suspicious packages mail to prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump let's bring in Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent Carrie a tell us about this man who is in custody now in Florida\nIdentifying him as Caesar ... fifty six years old from South Miami as you said and his background includes a long wrap sheet a number of charges for related to drugs and fast and also charge in two thousand two\nFor threatening to throw place project or discharge an explosive device he also has a ...\nAbout why investigators a came and got to that than\nWe do know that Cesar ... was taken into custody in or near in auto zone business and that shortly thereafter people with FBI jackets and other law enforcement were seen securing this white van and transporting it possibly to evaluate it for ... century purposes or other purposes\nAuthorities have not on the record get connected that van ...\nIs there any notion at this point as to whether or not he was considered armed or dangerous at the time or any uh arms apprehended\nOut we don't yet know the answer to that question we do know that there was a massive manhunt underway for this individual that involve federal and local authorities\nAcross multiple states and we do know he is in custody now we have no reports of any law enforcement officers injured or hurt in any way in connection with that apprehension\nOkay Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent stay put if you will were awaiting this press conference from\nThe Justice Department of but for now let's turn to the political side of this of course it's a major part of the story a Republican strategist Alison Stewart is with us now ALS welcome to you thank you Peter great to be here and we also have democratic strategist and host at hill to be ...\nOr ... or else want to start with you know have a suspect in custody ... what are your thoughts going into this it has been a very politically fraught past couple of days\nHas been and it's been a very tense time and of course we can all say our our greatest gratitude and thanks to the FBI and law enforcement and those who put their their lives on the line to to make this apprehension so swift and\nI bring bring about a a sense of calm and of course look we're in a very politically charged climate and it's a very uh an intense time in in our politics I\nI think if we're looking at this through the political lens ... we have to give some credit to the president this afternoon who who did say that this is a time for Americans to unify\nAnd while we don't know the cause\nOf this or the motive of of this is a ... this is a time to bring the nation together and the president was was wise to say that anyone involved in this will be brought to justice in the face the full extent of the law and to rightly claimed and called this despicable a despicable\nStates ... I'm Sorry I interrupted you do want to bring you into this conversation do you think the president can do that can unify the country right now\nI really want him to a really want him to try\nUm I have been disappointed so far or that every time he is spoken out on the street gives words that are about Seventy five percent or so and then ... minutes or hours later he does or says or something that puts the blame on the victims let the media\nOr you know tries to lessen the some some way or make light of it in some way and I think\nThe president is job right now it's not clear politics his job is to bring people together I Would love to see the president of\n'em do something where maybe he called President Obama may be called President Clinton and offered his is health and and and made sure that the FBI all the other\nSources of your disposal they were protected it you know him and made sure the attorney general Jeff Sessions all ages older to make sure he was going to be okay this is the moment we're supposed to reach out and not just for the words but also with the actions with\nSome of the president has has not apparently reached out to any of those do whom the on the the male bombings there were bombs were addressed\nUm but I Wonder if you could tell us about the suspect we don't know a lot about him but if you were to believe that pro Trump ... stickers on the windows of his van he is apparently a Trump supporter so how would you as a Republican strategist Alice advise leaders of the party to address is\n... ... more than anything it's important that we not jump to conclusions and not speculate prematurely what his motives were but as you say looking at that van with a lot of the the photographs you saw\nAnd there was also that sticker on there with mention of CNN and it was not in a favorable term\nAnd I am a contributor CNN I met that building where this happened the other day or at least once a week and it it's frightening but I think from a Republican standpoint we need to send a message\nThat a while we can disagree politically we need to do so in a nonviolent way and we need to do so in a calm way and\nUh the best way to show if you're disappointed with the way things are in this country is to go vote and let your emotions be heard at the ballot box and I think it needs to be consistent and I will say\nThat in my view the call to end the race to the bottom starts at the top\nYou're saying starting at the top meeting with the president a drawl absolutely how do you think Democrats you deal with it\n[noise] well I think Democrats would be the same way that is no time to play politics the thing I while I disagree with the rhetoric that the president has been using for the last year and a half a couple of years regardless of the media is lock her up and all the chance all the things that we are only called through the mall I disagree with those\nI'm willing to say maybe he didn't know maybe he didn't understand the impact of those words maybe even if he did he never thought anybody would take\nActions upon those words I don't blame the president for the actions that have occurred but after those actions occurred the president now knows if those words have impact now we can judge him was full knowledge how he got what he does next and we're so far\nI'm not that impressed Alison I Would love to see him do a little bit more and say a little more\nI'm a motivation there\nOkay hang was with us if you can also NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson let's bring you back in uh we are awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department just remind us who is uh that we expect to hear from it and what are some of the unanswered questions that we're still waiting for\nYeah this is quite a line up we're waiting to hear from including the attorney general of the United states Jeff Sessions the FBI Director Chris Wray the U.S attorney in Manhattan Geoffrey Berman and that's important because that's where we think\nThis individual ultimately will be prosecuted where he will face justice several of those devices were recovered in New York and we know the FBI's New York field office has been particularly active we have a\nWe have an official from the FBI is New York field office William Sweeney we also have the NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill a we have the postal inspectors we have the secret service and somebody from the Capitol police as well so\nThis is a murders row of law enforcement it's very rare you see that many of these top officials on the stage in fact I have a question whether all these men are actually going to fit on that time on stage at the Justice Department\nAs for unanswered questions did he have any help did he have any help and are there other devices out there as we speak I've gotten an email confirming that Tom's dire a prolific democratic donor has confirmed that he was addressed such a package and there may be other such devices out there\nWe've got to find that out a law enforcement desperately is going to be hunting for those things because they fear they're dangerous even if they don't go offer detonate\nUm they do contain material that could be problematic and law enforcement wants to wrap their arms around all those devices out there they also want to find out whether this man had any help and what he was planning next if anything\nAs for motives it's not clear right now there is a social media account that's been linked to the suspect fifty six year old Cesar ... from South Florida\nIn that Twitter account he has gone off after a prominent Democrats including some of whom have who have been an address the use of these suspicious packages and that's one hand test\nNation That's NPR's Carrie Johnson I'm ... and just to to reset for the audience where we stand now with already the rest of the south Florida Man this morning in connection with a wave of suspicious packages addressed this week to political critics of President Trump law enforcement has confirmed that that man is Cesar ... fifty six years old as an address in Davey Florida\nAnd has a criminal record also has some ties to New York\nUh the arrest followed the discovery of three more suspicious packages and Carrie Johnson you just mentioned the Democratic fundraiser Tom Sawyer has said that he was the recipient of or at least the intended recipient of one of those packages and he issued a statement as well did he say anything about the package or how he found out that he was targeted\nYeah through a spokesman he said I'm ... it's confirmed that a suspicious package mail to Tom Steyer was intercepted had a male facility in California he says\nWe're thankful every one we work with is safe and sound that's our first priority but he says were seen as systematic attack on our democracy and the rule of law that extends much further than one isolated incident in Florida\nAnd he's talking about the need for people to come together and rebuild a democracy for each and every American I'm trying to find some unity\nAh during this very a dark period where many prominent Democrats had been at that uh recipients are intended recipient of these suspicious devices over the last few days\nRight I'm just thinking that if you are a prominent critic of the president and you have not yet been targeted but perhaps you could be because of positions\nThat you've taken and again we don't know fully know the motivation but this so far the the people who've gotten these packages up and critics of the president I'm Kerry have you have you been hearing from people who who are concerned that they could be next door that they're taking precautions in case they are\nI have been hearing from people former officials in the federal government and the Obama administration\nWho are trying to be more mindful of how they handle mail where they open mail and I'm being basically on the lookout for one of these suspicious looking a yellow mental envelopes with patenting that we've seen on the news for the last two days\nOf course on some of the targets of 'em were intended recipients of of these devices are really well known the attorney former attorney general Eric Holder\nThe former CIA director John Brennan this morning in New York another package was intercepted intended for the former director of national intelligence James Clapper and another one this morning in Florida intended for\nNot clear to me that were done yet apparently have\nAll those packages for all those people that you just mentioned were they all ... exactly the same so that you would continue to know what to look for a ... in in the mail string\nAnd for the vast majority of those packages the FBI or local police are both have confirmed that these were similar looking packages you know the energy that you've seen NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson I Wonder if we can bring back in the loop William Hunter former\nFBI special agent teaches in the criminal Justice Department Radford University of Virginia a new continue their yeah I'm here yes\nSo you've seen on TV a lot of scene and had described as as Kerry just did what the packages and look like\nIt at one point or if there are packages that are are more and more packages to come at what point um can you identify those is coming from either this suspect or somebody connected with the suspect or maybe some buddy who's a a copycat as often happens in cases like these\nYeah yeah yeah it's it's extremely difficult I mean you know ... it's obviously are easy to get some of these materials that that it's a lot of materials are are very common and so it's really going to take\nA a a close look by law enforcement to confirm whether or not\nIt is I'm the same suspect over a copycat 'em so you know we're talking about um review of ... the FBI a lab back in the field office looking at the actual forensics or so it's not going to be an easy call a quick\nCall until it's actually you've had a a thorough look at these things\nAt what point will you feel that the threat is over\nThere the threat is over yeah [noise]\nThat's that's a great question I mean I I think\nOf as a as a couple of things so first there's got to interrogate destruction so um if he's willing to talk and that's a that's a big gift um you know you can have\nA sense of of how forthcoming is how you know what his ... what else is out there the other thing is just as a collaborative than the electronic evidence\nIf you get in and with a search warrant and you're able to take a look at is I'm a computer his phone records that\nMight give you a really good sense of what all he's done I mean there may be just a ton of evidence at his house or in his car and it's a business and that's going to give you an idea of how extensive the threats are so I Would say within the next you know twenty four hours\nYou're going to have search orange executed you're going to have a done it initially generation\nYou know again it's working with someone else a tracking down any potential each other associates that made a healthy\n... special agent Luke William hunt a NPR's Carrie Johnson it looks like it would be like very soon\nTo the Justice Department for this press conference about the arrest that happened today just very quickly we know that there was a a white van with all sorts of political decals apparently pro Trump ... spent details on the side of it do we know for sure if this vehicle is directly tied to the suspect who was arrested\nHere's what we do know law enforcement is proceeding on the idea that it is somehow connected to the suspect that they have not said it is his definitively on the record I expect we're going to hear a lot more about that in the next two minutes or so when a news conference start as law enforcement decides to tell us\nWhat if anything this individual is charged with and how they know that\nAnd does he just like the individual you're talking about a fifty six years old of daily Florida where he is he right now\nHe is in federal custody or he was taken into custody in South Florida and the likelihood is that he as authorities are trying to find out more from him about whether he had any help whether they're additional packages out there and and any number of other questions they want to know to protect public safety\nWe have gotten a warning that this press conference with attorney general Jeff Sessions is going to be getting started with in the next few seconds I Want to say thank you dilute William hunt former FBI special agent thanks very much for your incite pleasure good to be here and Republican strategist Alice Stewart's um we uh we want to thank you to please hang tight\nBecause we do expect to hear from attorney general Jeff Sessions in just a moment\n[noise]\nIf you all for being here over the past week more than a dozen suspicious packages have been sent to through the United States Postal service through a media outlet\nA Hollywood actor and at least seven high ranking current and former political leaders and the Democratic party this is only unacceptable political violence or the threat of violence is antithetical to our vigorous system of self government\nI couldn't be more proud of the work each of them did in this case and the work they do every day we said from the outset\nWe would identify and the rest of the person or people responsible for these acts we can make that promise because of the confidence we have our ability to investigate in a deliberate precise manner\nToday's arrest means that New Yorkers in the day people across our nation are safe but its director ... said that might be more packages out there so I went still needs to take caution and if you see something out there called nine one one and in New York City we have a number also won eight eight eight NYC safe\nI Want to thank them as the public who contacted authorities with information during this investigation New Yorkers don't back down they step up every single time we've\nListening to special coverage of the Justice Department\nHer broadcasting the photos NYPD released because it's certainly help workers around our city identify additional packages and help move forward with this investigation thank you [noise]\nCould afternoon I'm Jeff from in the United states attorney for the southern district\nOf New York five days ago on October twenty second law enforcement recovered the first device from a resident of George Soros\nOver the last five days has more packages were found across the country delivered to former presidents federal officials in public figures are law enforcement community federal state and local has worked day and night\nTogether with other prosecutors from my office to identify and apprehend the perpetrator that has now happened\nToday my office has filed a complaint against Caesar say oc charging him with multiple federal crimes for the city of conduct [noise]\nSpecifically to defend his charge in five counts that included illegally mailing and interstate transportation of explosives and threatening a former president of the United states\n\nAs a legend a complaint the defendant male destructive devices to citizens of this country's who currently hold or have held our highest public offices president Brock Obama\nFormer secretary of State Hillary Clinton former vice president Joe Biden former attorney general Eric Holder Congress person Maxine Waters US Senator Cory Booker former CIA director John Brennan and former director of national intelligence James Clapper\nThe defendants conduct as charge is cowardly and reprehensible and totally anathema\nTo our democracy and now the defendant faces a potential total fifty eight years in prison [noise]\nThis is an ongoing an active investigation we will not rest until these crimes are fully investigated and the defendant or defendants are brought to justice\nI wanted to take a moment to thank our partners the joint terrorism task force the FBI the NYPD US postal inspection service New York state police the ATF\nThe hard working career prosecutors and investigators and the terrorism unit of the southern district of New York and I also like to thank the extraordinary cooperation we receive from the southern district of Florida that could\n[noise] good afternoon\nFirst of like me and my colleagues I like to thank all of our federal partners who participated in this nation wide investigation FBI ATF Secret Service New York police department and the ... local law enforcement agencies were about a valuable assistance Chile I can say this is the way law enforcement supposed to work\nThis was a massive investigation what's the what's a collaborative effort and was well coordinated with the say the sea bringing a special expertise to the table\nBut also like to recognize the mini postal employees who we think of as a eyes and ears were appreciating the diligence and awareness in fact it was a postal employee this morning that alert us to one of these suspicious ...\nWhere in the postal inspection service have a great deal of expertise in responding to an investigating suspicious mail\nPals suspects are trained to wreck respond and investigate dangerous man in the mail these dangerous male investigation specialists are highly proficient in the news the state of equipment\nFortunately in this case none of the devices detonate it and there was no injuries however postal spices will remain villages and monitor postal facilities to determine whether there are additional ... that have not yet been discovered\nWe will continue to work with law enforcement partners to ensure the safety of the male a postal employees are customers and the American public\n[noise]\nGood afternoon a textile us the secret service director\nJust as a uh the other speakers emphasized as of ... just want to comment on the importance of cooperation here\nOr we were in the forefront of this uh uh what are receiving early packages on Tuesday and Wednesday and now fully engage the joint terrorism task force another federal partners and just want to acknowledge the great work done by the FBI ATF the postal service and inspectors a New York city police Capitol police and then the different states involved in New York\nFlorida California Delaware Maryland even the district of Columbia\nSo and I also want to uh spend just a few minutes to emphasize or how seriously the secret service tasty threats how important it is to provide a protection to our ah protecting including four presidents and the current president and vice president and just thank our agents and officers and analysts are\nWho not only investigates cyber and financial crime provide world class protection to our protect these I think they've done outstanding work here [noise]\nI Would say or just a also remark that ah since Tuesday along with the director ray\nAnd they're bringing the justice thank you [noise] just drink and you\nAlong the lines of how fast this\nWhen did you folks a high school or something\nUh so\nEach of the devices was being brought a through what are called total containment vehicles to our lab and they were coming kind of Syria autumn a and we received some of them the first two that we were see where the devices that were sent to former President Obama\nA and B I director cleaver ... sodium Santa congresswoman waters and so the analysis began on that I think yesterday and we were starting to receive information over the course of the last twenty four thirty six hours was them yesterday\nKyrah fault our\nFor directory and a three year old fashioned\nDescribe your reaction to\nAlso could you give us a sense of why the\nSecond part of the\nSo of the first part of my reaction to hearing that we had a possible match\nOr just validated my unbelievable faith and confidence in mental image of law enforcement and in particular of the FBI lab there's a reason why the FBI's lab is\nKnown as one of the very best in the world and the folks who worked there are extraordinary and once I knew that they had a print I was pretty confident that we'd be able to find the right person as far as the the devices themselves\nA it's important to say as as is in the complaint\nOr that even if the devices and we're still trying to determine whether or not uh they were functional as they say is what we're doing all kinds of analysis on that to make a definitive determination but they did contain\nEnergetic material or which is subjected to the right combination of heat for shock of friction or could be dangerous to the public and the public should treat any device like that Gordon\nI'm telling you could you tell us plainly why was targeting\n[noise]\n\nI don't know and then uh what you might uh normally expect a a man apart ... appears to be a partisan but that would be a determined by the facts\nAs the case goes for now I'm not able to comment on that [noise]\nNot going to be this has been investigations stands at this time\n[noise]\nWe're focus not on the talk but on the work the work of the men and women of law enforcement here in the work that was done over the last week is something that should make every American proud and grateful and it's too early to stage for us to be discussing motivation in this particular case [noise]\nMight not sound like this pre survive [noise] we're concerned\nAbout people committing acts of violence under any motivation\n[noise] director you believe that he's the only one off\nAnd you continue to make reference to other\nYou have any sense of how many\nSo as I said at the outside and I think the attorney general's said as well uh this is very much an active and ongoing investigation uh we do believe that we've got the right guy a but we also know that this is an ongoing investigation and there's a lot of work still to be done which means there's still plenty of unanswered questions [noise]\n\nFunding for here and now comes from the listeners off W.

staples\nThis is here and now a remote island in Hawaii is practically vanished the small spit of sand known as east island was critical habitat for endangered green sea turtles and monk seals\nToday it is mostly underwater hurricane lock a tour through the central Pacific earlier this month and literally white Easter Island off the map\nSatellite photos show only sliver of land where the eleven acre island once stood out from the ocean and climate scientists say a warming ocean could be to blame chip Fletcher is a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii he joins us now in in chip you were on Easter Island in July\nWhen you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\nWell it was quite stunning [noise] um I had not followed hurricane a well off and do it at headed north from us but it never occurred to me that it might be a head into\nFrench crickets shoals and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stunned\nMost people have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures it here and now dot org but to tell us about it and why it was important to you\nWell it's a beautiful place um my research team which consists of\nA undergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July under a grant with the national fish and wildlife association\nLoose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system as small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there this is low\nWhere sea turtles could um digs their nests and lay their eggs safely and they're only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being deceased island which was the largest one or that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nest there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for those animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of sand still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turned in the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands that can be problematic because much of the doing area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses\nCan they turn to the north to some of the other ... are there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many huh\nYou knew this island was low line it was Sandy ... did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane to this much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those I figured\nThat this island under the threat of sea level rise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century um it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence\nI didn't expect with a location this far north that it's still a very strong chance of being intersected by hurricane\nBut of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes that that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actually is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are there are also in danger or their other
