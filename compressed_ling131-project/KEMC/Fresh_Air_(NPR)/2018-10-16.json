it as a comic\nGoing from a four year relationship to being single again and then being in a relationship again\nAnd what it's been like as a black woman to be an interracial relationships\nPhoebe Robinson welcome to fresh air it is a pleasure to have you on our show so you started in comedy about eight years ago ten years or near oh okay okay I Know what was the gender race atmosphere in comedy clubs like for you then\nI think it's the same as it is now it's a lot of straight white guys some women and some people color few queer people you know it's a very white straight male dominated industry and um [noise]\nThat can be exhausting I think is probably the most polite way to put it there is just the way that it seems like a lot of the white straight guys want comedy to be done and um if you don't do it that way if you don't do sort of hanging out that you do I think you can feel\nSort of lonely in a way that I Would say almost none of the other things I Do writing acting to to queens that that stuff doesn't feel lonely but a lot of time stand up those incredibly lonely for me\nYou know you're right that male comics talk all the time about their body functions and their manned parts but of women do it it's considered gross so what kind of reactions did you get when you were starting in comedy when you started to talk about a body issues and things like ... and a lot of you know men in the audience\nYeah I mean I think it just I just want to be clear that went anyone started doing stand up like your full trash you know what I mean like you you're just like not that great you're really sort of posting on personality\nI'm and you're hoping your jokes are kind of funny and you know I've been doing comedy for ten years and I think I've finally gotten to a place where I can occurs is I I don't have to believe it's oh so why bother I don't want to do that yet I don't want to I don't want to do it I'm not alone Wayne okay I'm not going to [laughter]\nHonestly the place I got to happened when I went on tour last fall with a lot of ... we did our why why tour across America and we were both kind of being like\nOh we're funny we've been doubting ourselves as whole freaking time at a law that has been informed by the fact that we\nHave different energy that a lot of the male comics we care yourselves different maybe tell her jokes in a different way or different style and we were beating ourselves up in allowing that sort of\nAre so reflected at every possible turn I think it's hard to like um imagine what it's like to not have left and so you know I I Do think that like if there was like a to do queens that would've been\nA game changer for me to just like here to black women like young black woman oh well I'm like thirty four but I'm like\nHey young black women [laughter]\nBut you know to hear to like young black women talking about\nOh this one time I got my hair done at the salon and they did this to my hair and like totally like mess it up I couldn't talk about why black hair woes\nAnd high school with like Laura she doesn't know she doesn't she just wakes up and she has to be flawless like straight here like she didn't have to go through like what I had to go through and so\nI think in the end it worked out okay but I did have to do a lot of work on myself I did have to kind of like be OK\nWith being out numbered in a way and not letting that makes me so sad and then also I think I was very lucky to be a child in the nineties with like ... or\nYou know Martin Family Matters and girlfriends and all these sort of shows where you can still see you know like Tracy Ellis Ross or I could still see like queen ... Kim Fields and be like oh okay cool so I could kind of see what I could be like if I was you know an older black woman [noise] you're right about\nBody image in your book and you say yeah since you were fourteen your brand has been consumed with all the way as your body is like not good enough meaning not attractive to straight do than for failing to meet fashion industry standards and say even in age thirty four with a deeper understanding of how we've been conditioned to have unhealthy relationships with our bodies\nYou're still kind of fixated on it so how have you tried to overcome that 'cause it sounds like you're like intellectual knowledge of how women have been a expected to conform to certain bodies standards ... is at a different place\nThan you are just kind of visceral like I gain too much weight kind of feelings\nI think that everyone has that sort of battle inside themselves about something whether it's\nBody or you know I'm a writer with no other an analogies great moving on [laughter] but you know what I mean\nThere's always that that thing that it's like that you ... you mentally you know better but conditioning still makes that soft outcome and so I think what I have done\nBut not like I don't have a scale in a house and make it is not about a number if you're just going like I Need to make sure I'm strong enough to get through the day rather than I I Want to make sure I look and nice pair of jeans\nI feel more powerful the little bit of experiences that have gotten with like styling and doing like these photo shoots and again these are champagne problems I just went up ... I Know that but there there'll be like oh yeah we have a size four and it's like that is unacceptable to me\nTo only have a size four is truly ignorant and inexcusable or I go to these like shoots and I tell people I'm a ten twelve\nThat's just what it is and there'll be like here's a six it's like how dare you truly it's like how dare you be like oh we'll be couldn't find anything in your size you didn't look 'cause I dressed myself every day I dress myself every day and I find everything I Need to have\nThis sort of oh well we only have a zero to four so you either ... or you're you're screwed is not how you should treat anybody I Would do these video games and Ninety percent of the stuff I wouldn't fit into\nAnd every time I didn't fit into something I Believe I'm Sorry and the Apollo time I would apologize after every single ... I'm so sorry and I'm like they knew what size I was\nFour weeks before I showed up I is not my fault I'm decides that I Am [noise]\nThere's an afterword and it didn't come to your book in part of your

still together\nYes we are still together\nWe um we're going we're what Fifteen months sixteen months I'm pretending like it's a child or a few months [laughter] are doing very um and we just moved in

like\nWanted to have that moment in my life where I'm like dating this guy and he just as like gives his verbal approval or whatever about man is like your your amazing and then that would make me realize I'm amazing and then we have this happy life together and so\nThat was one of the biggest lessons was like not\nLooking for this great relationship to sort of define me or make me realize that I'm lovable I just had to sort of figure that out for myself and be OK if I don't date someone for\nTwo years or two and a half years or five years and if I had been like found my soul mate on my partner by then does that mean that I'm a terrible person you know what I mean it's like all these like value systems you like placed on yourself and it was all predicated on what someone else thought about me never watched that check in and see how I felt about myself did you have to learn\nHow to a fully enjoy yourself when you were not with somebody whether it's going to go into a movie by herself or having dinner by herself [noise] um I just feel like I'm consuming this I'm watching this and I don't need somebody with me to fully appreciate the experience absolutely\nI mean I I did all that stuff where I just and you always think like you go out to like a diner or a movie you go by yourself and you think everyone is just like dropping like you're at a restaurant everyone's dropping therefore cars are going there is a woman [laughter] single by herself\nAnd they're all like focus on their ... they are not thinking about you you know and it was just was so sort of like self absorbed Ron Mike\nEveryone's judge me for being single and yes there are certain people and everyone's lives who will like judge them for being single but it was just kind of like who cares big look

welcome to fresh air\n[noise] Hi I'm really pleased to be here\nUm the plantation of your novels in Barbados I gather you do a lot of research for your work um did you find that plantations in Barbados were much different than the ones in the United states\n[noise] you know I'm not I'm not a ... a full blown historian but you know given my readings from my sense of things that seems so life on plantations in the Caribbean was much more much more brutal [noise]\nThis is kind of an ironic thing to say but the sense of preservation of of um of one's workers a you know there were were expendable so that the cruelty was a you know the death rate was much higher [noise]\nThe ah the conditions in circumstances of slaves lives for much more dire and I'm ... you know quite horrific to have to to do that research but some very important for me to show what that was like\nThe main character booked a is George Washington black who goes by the nickname wash\nAnd he's a field work or on the plantation but one\nWhich is a terrifying prospect um but the masters brother is their name is Christopher Wilder who goes by too much there's a lotta nicknames and ah he's a naturalist and he's building a hot air balloon and he request that wash his assistant mainly just because he's like the right weight he's as for ... for the balloon [noise]\nUm and it's a moment the changes washes live forever because a bond forms between him and this was white men such\nUm and teach will eventually help wash a scape but it's such an arbitrary moment an such an arbitrary change in this and this boy's life and not arbitrariness forever hearts wash\nChristopher does choose Washington because he sees him as\nBeing helpful to his experiment and that he is you know precisely the right weight a demand is arrow stats are which is you know kind of a cruelty in itself to to look at somebody and I think it out of them but then Washington really um surprises him\nWith his natural gifts like he has no no idea you know that this this young man it's just completely [noise]\nYou just don't naturally a gifted at a drawing and um he has a good sense for 'em or nautical methodologies and and all of this he really comes into his own uh under pitch [noise]\nBut um you know there is that sense and part of what I was trying to suggest to explore\nA ... character is you know although he's an extremely liberal minded men for his time ah you know there are limits to his to his thinking that he is in a lot of ways still tethered by a certain ideas and notions a\nOf his era you know he's an abolitionist so he truly has a very\nGeneral belief in the rights of men it's kind of a prescribed belief but in terms of applying this personally to people it's a it's a little bit more difficult for him\nAnd his argument for trying to end slavery is that slavery won't allow people to get to heaven if they allow such cruelty\nYeah that's one of his his main um ideas about it and you know this has been central to his a philosophy a adult life but you know having said that he somebody who very much does feel a great affection or comes to the great affection for Washington and so\nSo they'll washes scrapes from slavery and becomes a free man he not free from the time he lives on him you know it was haunted by his time on the plantation and I think one of the points\nYou're getting up in the book is how much freedom is available to someone born into slavery and also how for your the people complicit in slavery the slave economy\n[noise] yeah exactly I think that son teach for instance\nLikes to believe that because he has these in light and ideas that he is and because he's actually trying to do something to end slavery itself you know I think he has a sense of themselves as being quite a moral person and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)", "city": "Billings", "day": "16"}
