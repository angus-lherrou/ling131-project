your\n\n\n\n\nI mean are alive by your screaming various no more danger we will novel resumed a showing of the movie\nThan Vincent Price in a scene from the Tingler directed by William Castle castles low budget shocking height made him a hero to today's guest screenwriter and director John Waters\nWaters started his own filmmaking career setting new lows in bad taste most notably with a cult classic pink flamingos his film hairspray which was adapted into a hit Broadway musical was an affectionate and funny much to the teen dance shows he used to watch in Baltimore\nLast Sunday the Baltimore museum of art opened a major exhibits devoted to John Waters running through January six it's called John Waters indecent exposure and is the first major retrospective of his visual art in his hometown of Baltimore\nA companion catalog has been published compiling not only visuals from the works and photos of John Waters but also from other works that inspired him John Waters has been a frequent guest on fresh air in two thousand four Terry interviewed him about an exhibition in New York's new museum of contemporary art\nIt was a photographic series waters began in the early nineties\nMany of the photographs were tribute to his favorite films which not surprisingly include many old exploitation films and tawdry melodramas\nMost of the pieces Terry ask John Waters about in two thousand four also included in the new exhibit at the Baltimore museum of art including a photographic sequence from the movie Peyton place he told Teri why that Phil means so much to him\nPlace were first dirty book I ever read I Love grace Natalia\nNo that dirty but uh in Nineteen fifty six that was pretty dirty\nAnd oh it's a great you want to read Peyton place there isn't any sequels to it it opens up Indian summer is like a woman for\nA [laughter] but grey metallic has that famous author shot of her on the lumberjack dirty ponytail sitting at the typewriter and I was so obsessed I even went to her grave I went in her house where she wrote the book\nBut painting plays itself on the book came out I remember the ad campaign is how did they make a movie out of Peyton place or something like that\nBut when ... got to a sexual scene they would cut\nShort cut away shot of symbolism like like if someone was frigid they'd have a frozen lake where if somebody was getting turned on and they show up blossom and brain so it was all Corning nature shots and it looks like bad National Geographic shots but actually it's dirty shots at what they couldn't show them\nSo I tried to concentrate on what was thought of as sexy van and to show today how how ludicrous but maybe even sexy or if you don't see it so we're because we're so used to seeing everything today\nSince you didn't feel guilty about watching things in being obsessively interesting interesting things that weren't supposed to be healthy did you go the other direction to take a willing might as well planned up to the hilt and and be you know take on the pose of of the pervert [noise]\nOh I never thought of it that way I I I took one\nI had to create a persona for myself in the beginning when we made these movies because I didn't have\nAny advertising and no one knew who was what we had to think of a way to to publicize the movies and divine and I did that sort of as as a\n[laughter] I was the director and he was the same movie star and certainly I dressed weirdly but um it was always confusing I never um [noise] my audience in the beginning\nWas never gay or straight it was gay people didn't like other gay people let's say three [laughter] it was hippies just didn't like hippies it was it was always the outsider of another outsider group that that's that's what my audience began with and certainly I'm\nI encourage that but it seemed to work because yes in in the beginning underground movies when I made them\nThey were made in a way to offend the very people who would come there in a humorous way though always by doing the whole Kennedy assassination which we did and and divine place Jackie Kennedy was shot in Nineteen sixty five and came out in sixty six [noise] believe me that was to go over very well at the time\nBut at the same time it was a liberal taboo I mean I liked Kennedy I Love Jacqueline Kennedy or Jacqueline Kennedy of how she pronounces it um so I I was I was always making fun of things that I really really liked him respected\nWhy don't you describe what you did in your version of the Kennedy assassination lifted line in the role of Jackie Kennedy well\nThis was in a movie called each her makeup and it's about people but kidnap models and force them to eat their make up a model of themselves to death and divine was not the star of it he was supporting player in it and there it's the same or divine isn't drag just weird dried but with no way gone 'cause we\nHe starts looking through all these Jacqueline Kennedy magazines but there were many off at the time\nFan magazines and he starts to imagine themselves as Jacqueline Kennedy in the Kennedy assassination and we have the whole thing the capital Kate I mean a pitiful version but we have the chef for or we have 'em all the people that were in the car we have Secret Service agents\nAnd I'm divine as waving to the crowds are no crowds that was filmed on my parents' street and lose in Maryland I'm Maurice avenue [laughter]\nAnd ah and ah and then it is scored to our classical music where there's one note that if the gun shot and then divine crawls over the top of a car with the blood and everything and it's quite graphic but it was filmed so primitive lady that's a nice way to say badly I'm black and white ah\nSixteen millimeter grainy over expose that when I took pictures on the twenty five thirty years later it began to look like the real the brood or filming them one of the most famous eight millimeter movies ever\nSo I'm an ... I I I did a a photo of peace based on that pictures of something I did a long time ago and it goes around the wall around the corner of the wall because I I always joke that I'm a ... well I Believe in the art world that the frame is the height frame as the advertising campaign so to me it was\nToo big for one wall and it has to go around the wall [laughter]\nI'm In ... for any of our listeners who aren't familiar with divine when this film that you're referring to Jackie Kennedy devine was a you know it's very heavy man who who usually played a woman Indian movies and pattern himself in some of those rules and listen to him\nAnd and what do you think of real drag queens at the time\nWhether they were square at the time you know I think ... divine help make drag queens allow hip or are they all wanted to be best Myers and\n\nSo it was they were really square they weren't happy ever\nNow all drag queens or hip I mean you see in the wake stock and they're all really funny and have a sense of humor and they have funny names everything\nBut but then they were very very serious I remember in Philadelphia there's a great movie called the queen about a drag beauty contest in Philadelphia oh I Know where where you live and Harlow was the winner and I'm very very famous\nA drag queen but but we used Elizabeth coffee who was at the time I'm much more ludicrous and much more\nFunny and had a sense of humor about it and used to being a drag queen of as being um comedy ...\nTrying to be a pretty woman [noise] you know early in your career you said that your work is really about the sadness normal people feel because they're not involved in show business [laughter] so what do you spend\nAbout ... thing I ever said I didn't mean to be funny but I Believe that most everybody secretly imagines himself in show business and\nEvery day on their way to work for a little bit depressed because there are people are fed during the famous America [laughter] I guess you really needed to be famous [laughter]\nUm well I I I certainly can't complain about it I hate to hear people that are in show business complained about\nAny of that kind of thing what what on earth did you pick that field to go in for if you didn't want people to recognize you I've I've always said that show business is filled with the most insecure people of all that\nThat we base a life on having to get approval of strangers from everything we do over and over and over on each project\n[noise] you know in your book there are lots of skills of movies and I'm not to stills from movies that were transplanted in their time or you know violating some taboo in some small way [laughter]\nYou also have to rush failed or ... yeah but you also have a couple of photos of of ... the clown from howdy Doody [laughter] not not known as the most but okay next\nArab bell yes he was psychotic what kind of was the first thing and I was on the how to do to show my parents took me I was on the peanut gallery NBC Studios Clara Bell was a psychotic clown who never spoke who honked horns and shot you in the face with seltzer water\n'em and you know captain kangaroo unclear about were the same
