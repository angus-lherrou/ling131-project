contributing editor for Rolling Stone where he's written for more than thirty five years to Curtis new read and considered him a friend although not a close one\nAs part of his research Curtis interviewed many people read new including his first two wives Lou Reed cofounded the velvet underground which you played with from Nineteen sixty four to Nineteen Seventy\nThe band was initially managed by Andy Warhol and was part of Warhol seen well many bands of the time or singing about peace love and losing the Gen x Lou Reed was writing songs about heroin street hustler and transcripts of sexuality he continued in that direction as a solo artist\nBut he also wrote sons that had a spiritual quality to Curtis says other than Bob Dylan the Beatles and James Brown no one has exerted as great an influence on popular music as Reid has read died of liver disease five years ago at the age of Seventy one\nTo Curtis says he wouldn't have written this book while Reid was alive quote this book does not at all times see Lou the way he wanted to see himself\nAspects of his sex life his drug use and is cruelty that he came to be embarrassed about or discussed here in detail as our his generosity and his kindness his talent his vision and his genius unquote\nWe recorded the interview last November when the book was first published and started with the song heroin from the velvet underground first album\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nThat's Lou Reed and Anthony the Curtis welcome to fresh air and congratulations on your new biography of Lou Reed\nMakes you so much it's a pleasure to be here so let's start with that song which sums up so much about what may may Lou Reed different from other music\nAt being made at at that time um give us your take on heroin and how it fits into not only ... career but into the larger music of that time\nIt's I'm such a daring statement you know especially was recorded in Nineteen sixty five it came out in Nineteen sixty seven [noise]\nAnd you know lose various outrages under which they would certainly have filed a you know he's going to gay bars and acting out as a gay person you know we're elements of that but it wasn't like we're going to make him straight you know I don't I just don't think that was part of it\nBut it was mentioned when you mention gay bars and and him being gay but he's also with a lot of girls at the time I\nWell yeah that's true and that there are people I mean this was a really I mean it it's a very it's an issue very much at the moment interestingly because I'm kind of gone around the block\nThe anything he was on a like fluid in his actual alley yeah\nI mean one of his girlfriend's a describes him as inter and [laughter] it's the kind of interesting usage I think you know there was part of Lu I think that was up for anything and\nBut I've had gay friends gay male friends like write to me and say you know you describe this element of Lou but he was really gay\nAnd the other day I got one of those and it was you know it was a pretty stern email that you know made me think about what I had written I had lunch with one of his former girlfriends she was saying look there's no way Louis gauge\nHis sexuality with something I think you know as you gauge the adage you so you wanted to see you know and I I think Lou was kind of hoping to go and wherever that was\nAnd I think everybody had a language\nFor it then well that's right they didn't that language didn't exist [noise] yes I did want a guy I just didn't want to say one thing about his parents because you know there really was this sense you know after the shock treatments of of lose never forgiving them for that\nBut when ... left the velvet underground he went back and lived with his family\nI Am here girl price on Iran or exactly yeah\nKnow and and uh I once said you know his first wife was talking about Lou being cheap introducing a guide you ever wanted to spend money we were living in these all these small places he would never ask his father for money and at that point in my research I I took loose story as you know the truth\nAnd I just said well with his father ever given their money and she said of course he would have given him money\nYou know his father was a very conventional man who would have loved to have a son that wanted to take over his accounting business you know he didn't get that he couldn't get around you know a lot of what lose life and you know even his art was like but you know on the other hand whatever Lou needed anything he was there and\nYou know that was one of the complexities Lou dedicated his book of lyrics to his parents and his sister\nYou know a ... you know it wasn't as simple as a\nYou know as it might initially seem\nAnother thing that really just like amazed me\nA reading about this in your book is that after the velvet underground split up and he went on his own you didn't have any money not eat set so he got a job working for his father typing up in his father's accounting office yes extending have trans grass have is that [laughter]\nI Try to let it they don't have any I always would say goes you know well my mother always said you know like a you know you should have something to fall back on and kind of typing was not for me\nUm you know I think it was just a way to to buy time in making money and if they were already ... yeah exactly yeah somebody told me a story I wasn't able to confirm this but that the night Lou ... with the velvet underground you know after a show at max is Kansas City\nUm that his parents were waiting for him in the car to drive and back to Long Island I mean I could never get that confirmed but it's certainly possible and he certainly did move back there immediately and you know they had that kind of relationship it was a\nYou know along with a you know this kind of you know festering anger that Lou felt I mean he would never meet with them without his sister being there he always refer to them by their first names it was never like mom and dad\nUm and you know he certainly would characterize them in song you know in ways that you know must have made their skin crawl\nBut ah yeah but in real life you know got along with them fairly well so early\nIn um the velvet underground period\nThey team up with Andy Warhol like Andy Warhol brings them under his wing he wants he wants to have a man she I'm kind of have yet to kind of expand his his his his reach\n'em and what worked and what didn't work about that connection with Warhol what were they ... didn't work for lead\nWell let's you know that's very interesting question because you know um [noise] yeah ... or ... Andy wanted a band in the same way you know it was just like oh you know\nKnow rock and roll is getting to be a thing and so they found the velvet underground um you know through some you know ... you know artists who had gone to see them and thought they might work for Andy\nI'm you know a Andy Warhol and Paul Marcy has kind of like right hand man at the factory their studio\nDecided that the the velvet underground more kind of too boring looking so they got Nico yeah who is a you know a German model an actress and soon to be singer to you know to be their lead singer you lose not crazy about that\nBut I think he felt like Warhol was going to bring 'em a degree of visibility\nThat was good it was important and that he would just go along with it he limited Nico sports as patient as much as he could you know um she only saying you know a few songs\nOr the band was pointedly called the velvet underground and Nico you know like that is she's not a member of the band\nAnd as soon as he could he got ... you know he kicked Nico has the band as well after having an affair with her\nAnd well that's very true [laughter] exactly you know\nPart of those times um and\nThat was a you know so that was one of the issues of Warhol\nA Warhol was great because you know back then you know I was a kid in New York around that time where I was in the newspapers all the time they're not\n... you know not art critics reading about it and although that too but it's just like a this crazy guy you know he thinks that Campbell Soup cans or art and he went to this party the other day I mean every day was in the newspaper so whatever he did got attention\nAnd uh you know Lou took advantage of that but that also hurt the velvet underground in that\nYou know rock and roll certainly back then was pretty Ernest thing and the war whole seemed like a put on like a joke oh this is like an Andy Warhol version of a band you know for for people who hadn't heard them yet you know unheard I'm amazing there so\nYou know I think eventually like once they made you know certainly the first album and we're in the process of making the second one I think\nLou felt All right we've kind of established a baseline here now and he's got to go I you know this needs to be a more professional operation and you know there's no way Andy Warhol was you know a rock and roll manager of you know any note\nGas is Anthony ... is the author of the books we read a life\nIncluding his wives and his trans partner Rachel I'm Terry Gross and the expression that\nRight [noise]\n\n[noise]\nDrive\n[noise]\n\n\nAround\nThe new power Family Foundation supports WHYY fresh air and its commitment to sharing ideas and encouraging meaningful conversation support for NPR comes from this station\nAnd from Amazon Prime video with the Roman all the new theories from the creator of Mad Men starring Diane Lane Noah Wiley Christina Hendricks into Andrew rattle a new episode every Friday on prime video and from ...

I'm In the sun the lyrics are inspired by some of the trans women he knew from Andy Warhol was a factory so so let's hear it and then we'll talk about [noise]\n\nHoliday from Miami ... hitchhiked away from us they loved her eyebrows on the way to shave their legs and then he was she she says the the\nSick along in the wild and said hey honey ...\n[noise] Mm [noise]\nCandy came from\nActually read walk on the outside his album transformer which was produced with David Bowie I'm\nSo that so that was actually a head friendly but it sounds from your book like he was ... he wanted to hit so badly finally has any\nSounds like he was actually kind of ambivalent about it\nWell that's you know there were you know he was pulled back and forth by you know his desire you know look Lou Reed grew up in an era where there was no I mean the velvet underground sort of created this you know where it was possible they're good to be a rock band had have credibility and not have hits before that you either had hits or you went home\nYou know more than more than that yeah yeah\nPrecisely and even if you did have hits you know you gotta\nLu I mean I learned that um ethics kind of in his DNA\nAh but at the same time you know he saw himself as an artist and he saw himself as want us to do serious things and\nAnd take left turns and you know go in New directions and so the degree to which you know the record companies like oh okay great we've got ahead like now let's do take another walk on the wild side or walk on the wall side again and that kind of irritated him and you know of course he made Berlin which at the time was vilified\nOr you know later to be you know resurrected and and uh I ... but you know at the time it came out it was regarded as a you know just an outrage and crazy move because it was you know such a a harsh and depressing records [noise] um [noise]\nSo you know he would turn it on himself you know he would he would do whatever he needed to do\nTo to restore his standing once you have destroyed his standing you know because the next thing was rock and roll animal which was you know a big FM radio record of a big success at a big seller was alive album at a good one [noise]\nUm yeah but then after Lou made that you know a record or two later remade metal machine music which nearly destroyed his career it was just an hour of just you know deafening guitar feedback you know it was again a gesture that with ... before Lou did it\nAnd um that's how they wanted he wanted to have is music rich people and be loved and be popular but at the same time he distressed and that and wants to be like outside the mainstream and outside of that kind of acceptance\nAnd exactly and it's almost as if he wanted to punish people for like [laughter]\nHonestly I mean I think that was I think that was an element of it mhm mhm [noise] um so I'm In his ... he said that that album basically ended the period of his life where he describes himself as gay what what changed\n[noise] um well one thing was the end of his relationship with Rachel which was a which is documented quite movingly or in the song street hustler part call slip away\nWearing you know he says you know she took the the rings right off my fingers and you know he in an interview on you know at that time you know said\nNo that was real she did that I mean essentially you know saying like Rachel you know\nThey had been falling apart there's some\nLots of\nLots of theorize about why that is in some sense of I'm Rachel wanted to make a transition that she was taking hormones whether Lew did or did not approve of that but one thing that happened was Lu met I'm Sylvia morale is sue became his second wife\nAnd you know began moving more into that relationship and getting serious and that was\nUm [noise]\nYou know over the course of two or three years Luke got clean a got straight\nAnd um and his gay life became something that\nI mean he's still honored in certain ways a song like Halloween parade or a you know there would be references to it but he would never speak of himself as gay after that you know I think he had very complicated feelings about his um his homosexual life\nAnd even if he was out there as anybody could be he also turned on it and are often not with that\nYou know that much um [noise] bitterness but uh but still we would never discuss it [noise]\nYou know so I I Want to play a different accept at St ... the ... not to slip away part that you referred to sure where the part that's about somebody overdosing\nUm and the person narrating the story is like so called just so indifferent about it it's almost had setting to listen to you but it's it's yeah it's great music and it's great writing um so ... this is the middle part [laughter]\nA a street hassle trying to say anything about this this part yeah I'm\nDrawing on the story of a a guy who used to be around the factory he was found dead\nOr industry a as an thought to be kind of that he was hit by a car I mean that was the official story the unofficial story that was that he had died of a heroin overdose in somebody's apartment and they dragged him out onto the street and just left him by the docks\nI'm as if he had you know had an accident of some kind\nI'm Lou turns that male character into a female character and then you know describes the guy who is the host of the party 'em urging a his guests to get this girl's body out of his apartment\nDon't live in and it really was nice jogging and I really wish that with ...\nWould you know can be a hazard trying to sell to police shows how was your old guys and it's not like we did ... there was this new one to do and that was made you know I Would have been the first\nWoman to the moon during that we're within a universal choosing ages\nAnd [noise] the way that is really something you see that as long as we would you be more around the girl\nIt's either this is the worse it says I don't have to choose I get a loan and I knew I knew in\nTreating is when you ... when the weather being just lay around the yard is driven by mornings you know they hit and run [noise]\nNew people new chores and then move on to\nTalk of the things even colder all those things that they see that\nLevel than the right to be one they follow it you know it's called bad luck", "show_name": "Fresh Air (NPR)",
