Leonard Cohen as a writer performer and father and tell us about working closely with his father in the final year of his life\nLeonard Cohen lyrics have adept few songwriters have achieved reflecting reverence and despair ... beauty and his knowledge of broken this lyrics informed by his Judaism his practice of Zen Buddhism and has dealt with\nSome of his many well known songs include Suzanne so long Marion famous blue raincoat Chelsea hotel number two everybody knows power of song I'm your man and of course his best known most frequently recorded and performs song hallelujah\nAdam Cohen welcome to fresh air I just want to start by saying I Love your father's music I left his writing\nAnd I feel privileged to have had the chance to hear him in concert and to talk with him on her show and I'm grateful for the chance to talk with you today so thank you for being here when I interviewed your father and two thousand six after the publication of a book of his poems and songs\nHe asked to read a poem that he'd just written that hadn't yet been published but it's now published in this new book the flame so I thought it would be a perfect way to start with your father's reading of that home a street uh from our two thousand six interview\nOr used to be your favorite drunk good for one more or less\nThan we're both rode a look\nAnd look was always [noise]\nYou put on a uniform to fight for civil war or try to join but no one like the side I'm fighting for solar strength to one that's over much strength to when we moved oh where are you doing on this corner\nUp and walked away but I'll leave that little story for another rainy day\nI Know your burdens had videos you we'll it through the night the guru says it's empty\nBut that doesn't mean it's light so that strength to when it's over unless drank too when we meet all be standing on this corner where they used to be a street you left me with the dishes\nAnd a baby in the bath\nAnd you're tied with the militias\nI knew where their their camera flash well I guess that makes us equal but I Want to march with you\nA just an extra in the sequel to the old red white and blue so let's bring to when it's over unless drank too when we meet all be waiting on this corner where they're used to be a street\nHe's not like one of these contemporaries I won't mention any names but there are many wonderful contemporaries of his who have in my estimation become misspell jacks during the ... because they're somehow they succumb to the temptation of going back into their older catalog\nAnd their regurgitate in things whereas this man was speaking from the very Ron that he found himself at in life\nLet me re introduce you if you're just joining us my guest is Adam Cohen and he's the son of Leonard Cohen and now there's a new collection of Leonard cons\nFinal lyrics homes notebook injuries and drawings and these are all collected in the new book the flame and Adam Cohen wrote the introduction to it when they take a short break and then we'll be right back this is fresh air\n[noise]\n\nThis is fresh air and if you're just joining us my guest is Adam ... he's the son of the late Leonard Cohen and there's a new collection of Leonard cons final homes lyrics and drawings and notebook entries previously unpublished and it's called the flame and Adam wrote the introduction to it\nI'm going to ask you to read a poem that's published in the new collection in the past you miss collection of Leonard ... works I'm so is there something that you could choose that would be relevant to what we're talking about now\nYou know what I don't want to read this poems I think that I think in some way or another if we could urge people to um to consult to work with smaller samples otherwise it takes a kind of looks\n[noise] I'm\nWondering if you think that's because like when your father sang his songs or read his homes\nThere was this really dark quality but there was this like kind of existential distance from it at the same time and it transcend than quality as well that made for a really complicated mix of emotion\nUm is that what is traveling you by the idea of you you reading poems yourself that he brought this kind of just you know even through his voice this complicated quality of whatever painter anguish and spirituality who is expressing at the same time\nAnd that you don't feel like you could\nI think it's simpler than that you know I'm reminded of I'm reminded of so so many lines in which he talked about the solitude of the experience of the of reading and there's so many poems in which he alludes to the idea that ah that this is\nThis is a private matter and so there's something contradictory feels like a transgression for me to read them\nI appreciate you saying that as a son but as a fan of your father's work I Will say that he performed his work in concerts to large crowds of people and there are so many performers who have performed his songs so they haven't met the have his work has a life outside of his mouth\nAnd and his work has a life outside of the solitary experience of a reader sitting alone in his room quietly reading his poems so\nAlways wanted to I Want to get on record as saying you know and I'll go one step further with what you're saying just because I don't believe that they're contradictory in a sense I mean this is a man who's put the word ...\nOn many millions of people's lips you know so that that's the sound of a preacher men or that of course when it's attached to song uh it's supposed to lift and uh and exist away songs have always existed I just mean that there's something about\nReading the poetry that I'm feels instructional or a has a kind of rigor to it I'm of a ... quality that I don't believe was intended there's something more beautiful about the notion of\nPeople quietly thumbing through this book and observing and as I say really taking the time with the jewels that are embedded in every line taking their own time\nNot with my meter now with my voice\nCan tankers or in transit you\nKnow it's just it's a it's I'd I'd be lying if I didn't say it was a little disappointing but I I can I can live with that so I thought I play your father reading and not another problem with his\nFrom the interview that we recorded in two thousand six and this is a poem called titles and it was published in a book that he did in two thousand six of 'em homes and their ex so this is Leonard Cohen recorded in two thousand six on fresh air\nI had the title poet and maybe I was one for a while

burning a wire Chelsea hotel who by fire\nI'm so did you hear them I Do if you didn't need me [laughter]\nDid you hear a lot when you were growing up I mean it's like when I was growing up I thought about songs\nAnd singers but I didn't think about songwriters you know I just thought about like what's the sun and who's singing it um but but you are you at your father was a song writer she must have had an awareness that song writing was crafted something people actually did\nAnd you must like grown up with these songs I don't know if he played them around the house I don't know if even heard them when you were you\nKnow of course I heard them you know I I was a five year old on the side of stages watching them being performed a heartless going out into the looking at it the faces of of audiences or you know in in different times and places\nAnd um I was a deep deep admirer of the melodies of at first you know as a child just the melodies the generosity of the ... and then as I grew older that was the complexities and the beautiful marshalling of language and um\nAnd you grow older than you than you sort of see I remember um\nI remember I myself was making a record at the time and it's scripted and I asked my father for council is a dead you know meet me me me I really got to talk to you I got to pick your brain when we were sitting on the corner will ... in ...\nAnd I confess to him that I was going to scrap this entire record and was expecting him to\nRefining but instead he turned to me and said man he's scrap you record that's an amateur move said an amateur move he says yeah it's not about how you feel about the record it's how the songs make them feel\nAnd at that moment I realized that um\nThe la vida always had for his material wasn't just about their construction but was also about their intention out he was holding up this baton that he had been\nGiven by the love he had for the people who came before him and he was holding it up and [noise] and something about the canon of his work that has always maintained that uh that baton off the ground\n[noise] were you when you have parents separated\nUm five six from the don't remember how much did you get to see us either after that\nI'm In a relationship now and the imperfections of\nA union between two people ... has been demonstrated to me in vivid colors and dimensions and the fact that my father was able to stay in his children's life despite those complications and then some a was a remarkable is remarkable to me\nUm I my mother moved\nMy sister and I ... to across the world many occasions and not just to get away from him in fact not to get away from him at all but just to follow her own whims and uh my father would often even\nPark a caravan I'm at the end of a dirt road just to be near us um he he's always been part of our lives\nVeto he's he always maintained a role um in in our life despite my parents' separation\nA caravan as like a mobile home [noise] oh yeah the liquid you call those like a like a jet stream kind of thing\nMhm okay yeah I remember my mother\nMy sister and I all the way to the south of France where we lived a\nAnd there's a long dirt road and he bought one of these sort of care of and jet stream type things and put it to the tea where the road met the dirt road and you just lived there [laughter] my mother didn't want him on the property so are you know every day after school bus would drop us off we'd see dead\nIn his care of in that far\nKnow as I say the the the intent to be part of his children's lives um the deliberate this with which he contorted his own life and schedule to to make sure that he was present in our lives was ... feet\nAnd there's something really terrible that happened to you and then it in its own ways may be responsible for the revival of his career and for for um his reconnection to people\nI'm Around the world and that's that um he had an accountant or a business manager who like drain\nYour father savings and sold the publishing rights to your father son that's kinda like stealing so we'll just sell other publishing rights to his songs I mean that just seems like such a transgression um and like I think your sister who discovered that had happened like if I didn't even know\n[noise] yeah you know\nAs he often joked it is hilarious that he thought he could resolve his economic woes with song and poetry um in incredible that [laughter]\nThat with the canon of his work with his devotion to black eating pages and melody that that he built the life he built for himself\nAnd um when you experience this uh this episode that you're referring to it actually did compelling back out of retirement back onto the road and that is what was part of what I refer to as the most sort of joy is an unexpected um\nEpisode of his life which was to to discover that all this time absence made the heart grow fonder who knew\nHe'd always benefited from this kind of iconic status you know people that
