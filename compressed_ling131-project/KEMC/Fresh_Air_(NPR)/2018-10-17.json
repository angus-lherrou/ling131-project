Haskell welcome to fresh air and congratulations on being a finalist for the national Book Award Oh thank you so much Terry Gross [laughter] so did you know out of your way for many years not to tell people that your mother had been a heroin addict\nOr throughout my childhood it's something I definitely kept hidden when when my grandparents are finally told me I was in the fourth grade and I I'll never forget sitting because they called me into the living room\nAnd I remember thinking oh maybe we are going to go in another family vacation because the last time we had a family meeting they told me we're going to Disney World and it was fantastic [noise]\nAnd my grandfather he sent me down on the couch and he said it's time we tell you the truth about your mother and she's in jail and she was a drug addict and that's that's that's why she's been gone all this time now that was a fourth grade now she had been gone and in and out since I was two years old\nSo I didn't tell anybody for the longest time I I trust him one friend my friend Patrick my best friend I grew up next door to\nAnd I I didn't tell anyone I mean it's when you when you have these addictions and your family is I mean you sort of live this duality you you have this thing that you should hold back from people and then you you put your best face forward\nUm you know as I got older and sometimes I ... I Would share stories with people in high school some watch but it wasn't really until I delivered what I call an accidental TED Talks\nKids must have asked you all the time like how can the grandparents are raising humor as your parents\nThey would and I would just make up stories are my my father he he travels a lot for business or um you know I Would just you just find ways to to sort of deflect right to say uh I mean maybe that's my story telling skills began by by making up excuses for where my biological parents were\nMiddle your mother was in jail and halfway houses your father you didn't even know who he was\nI didn't I didn't I didn't learn his first name until I was in sixth grade\nSo you've written about your childhood and your mother in the form of a graphic memoir for young adults are they'll I'm an adult and I really liked it I I Would recommend this to adults but um why did you want to like target AT T on the ...\nWell you know I've made a career out of writing you illustrating books for young people you know I picture books I I have graphic novels for for the middle grade reader and middle grade as you know seven to eleven years old\nI got to go back to school [laughter]\nThey were so lovingly crass though you know they curse around but it was never directed towards me and I remember they want to say like you know we were okay if you Kurds but if you ever course at us you are in a significant amount of trouble young men you know\nUm they smoke two packs a day each nah or and my grandfather just be moans this movement of uh having places be non smoking\nYou know airplanes you can't smoke on the plane like what an inconvenience to the point we said Jesus Christ by the time I dying to get to heaven and they're going to say sorry no smoke\n[laughter] he died of lung cancer you die yeah you'd actually well at eighty one [laughter] any outlive your grandmother by a couple of years there's also a heavy smoker also heavy smoker yeah and I should say to\n'em you know she she died the summer before my wedding and unfortunately she died ah she died on a friday or my wife's wedding story was that Sunday\nAnd the months leading up to that you know my fiance at the time Gina now my wife she'd be over and and uh my ... my grandmother is hooked up to oxygen and we always had thought that she just had a bad bladder 'cause she was always excuse herself to go to the bathroom and you know like you know she's smoking\nRight with the oxygen around her and oh it's oh gosh that's deemed as though they were so lucky the hosted and explode\nYeah so do you think your grandparents were different people and they were raising you then when they were raising your mother and\nI Know they were I Know that my my my grandmother and my mother did not get along and I and I think a part of it was a ... my mother was their second child there first daughter\nAnd I really felt there was a lot of jealous when my mother still this that there was a lot of jealousy that my grandmother surely had for my mother Leslie because\nThat took Joe's attention away I'm Joe when Leslie always had a tight bond surely and Leslie's relationship was always front\nAh surely was also drinking ... a lot of them um she should drink quite a bit\nYoung you know have recurring nightmares as a town about monsters would you describe a nightmare [noise]\nThis recurring dream where I was in the middle of a field and on the outskirts of this field you know where they're just force\nAnd these tall lanky monsters like like almost like naked alien zombies would would slowly come out but if I made eye contact with the monsters they would freeze\nBut the problem was I was surrounded by these monsters\nAnd so while I Would maintain eye contact to freeze one monster the monsters to my back would approach me so I'd have to spin around and make eye contact with those monsters but that of course would free of those other monsters and they would start creeping in every dream ended the same way in which they were just on top of me\nAnd I vividly remember those dreams and and yes there in there in the book and and those were difficult to drop because um you know you're writing out scenes is one thing when you have a series of letters that make up words and make up sentences\nBut visually they don't look like anything but sketching out this book was difficult because you're facing these fears are facing these these nightmares or you're facing these people once again\nWhen do they stop these nightmares [noise]\nProbably some time just before high school I imagine I met remember how I remember having them throughout elementary school and it's you know the way I went to I went to ... school in Worcester, Massachusetts and back then it was kindergarten through eighth grade so I was at the same same school same building for all those nine years\n[noise] your grandparents later told you that that they often open up the bedroom door and find sleeping right outside of um did you have anybody to talk to these nightmares about\nNo no I don't believe I ever spoke to anyone that any of the trouble is you know my grandparents grew up in the great depression and they they you know it wasn't generation and so they certainly were the kind of people who thought he should talk about your problems I mean\nI'm a therapy would've been significantly helpful for me as a kid and and um and I go to therapy now in them open about that to help a distant ties you seeing someone is talking to somebody\nOn a professional level um and that's where for me are was such a saving grace because I I did work out some of these issues in my sketchbooks and and in my drawings\nWhen you took art classes and you're in high school\nYou are with your with your drawing you were really proud to tell your teacher that you had read a book about how to draw like marvel comics mhm and your teacher did not have the reaction you expected what did you teach you say\nOh he was the best piece of advice any teacher has ever given me throughout my education and I remember I I brought in this book was so excited you know I thought I was get extra credit I read the whole book\nAnd without missing a beat he wouldn't even let me finish my thought his face turned just had like he just looked he had a grave look on his face and his name is Marc Lynch and he said forget everything you learned\nAnd and by that what he meant was ... that that particular book really had like okay this is the way if you want to work for marvel this is how you have to drive ... this is how you have to draw muscles [noise]\nThis is how you have to ask\nAnd so he as an as a as an educator of the art and specifically use teaching comic book classes you know he he would just see these young people are judging their talent based on the kind of comics they were reading\nSo he really helped me realize that like a comic doesn't need to be superheroes and it doesn't need to be drawn just the way the artist or drawing them professionally at and in that moment ah and and back then this was now the early nineties\nThe thought of being a cartoonist you really figured you'd have to go and work for somebody else and dressed somebody else's character\nSo that advice by by Marc Lynch really set me on this path of oh I could do my own thing and somehow carve out a nice little life for me doing just what I Want to do that's a possibility\nAny tells you you had your own style and that you should develop that he did that upset and what did you learn anything nevertheless [laughter] from the marvel comics books Oh absolutely you know from the how to draw like marvel comics ... that that was actually useful for you\nIs certainly a there's a lot about gesture so if you're having a character say throw a punch you want to be extreme you know that the punches like really real back or the punch has been fully blown but not right in the middle so and it definitely had a lot of good points of um [noise]\nYou know framing you're shot you know there's still a lot of value in that book and I still have the book um\nBut in regards to art style I think any sort of how to draw book I think Paige wants to\nEverything about your [laughter]\nMy guest is Jared J. ... his new graphic memoir hate kiddo how I lost my mother found my father and dealt with family

I Would worry I'd wake up in the middle of night thinking what if what if I'm wrong what if she really isn't using you know but then I realized that she wasn't alone because she was with she was running herself with other people\nJust she wasn't making herself accessible to me\nAnd you know I was she knew I was writing what would become hate kiddo and I was getting to the point where I thought you know I'm a long in Detroit process from really going to need to talk to her about what I'm writing about and will she wants her real name or or should I come up with a pseudonym standing\nAnd I received a phone call one night it was march of two thousand Seventeen at the end of the month\nAnd it was it was her younger brother Steven and he informed me that she had died of a drug overdose she'd she'd already on heroin and it was heartbreaking to be right\nYou know and it it it affirmed for me what I I did what I needed to do to protect my new young family and on Monday morning I went into the funeral home in Stephen who's got the again he's like he's my uncle buddy is like my brother met me there [noise]\nAnd I know I really had the feeling of you know she's going to be cremated but I don't want to see her one more time\nAnd and the funeral director pointed out like you you don't want to see her now like I hadn't signed off to get the body to be transferred from the more to the funeral home so I said you know what well let's let's have a viewing and I had in my mind that she would worth address ... to to my wedding and so I had in my mind that I Would just turn up at her house\nI Would open a closet and sure enough there would be the dress\nAnd Steven accompany me and now it seems the afternoon\nAnd ah there's a man in the house then she she had claimed that was response or you know I later learned that you typically would not have a sponsor of the opposite sex 'em and they certainly will be living with you so later I later came to learn that this this man was her boyfriend and so\nHe opened the door and uh he was just completely out of his mind I mean he was high on heroin his eyes\nOfficer shoes on and he's talking a mile a minute and I'm Still ... tunnel vision that I Want to see my mom and make my mom beautiful again that I entered the house\nAnd um went to her bedroom couldn't find couldn't find the dress but then I my my my glance went over to her bureau\nAnd it was just filled with ugliness it was filled with metal spoons and turning kits and and all the all her for drug paraphernalia and so her boyfriend\nAt the time said oh you know what there's a there's the cedar closet and this other room right now of course I dress that was that important to her she would preserve in the seat her closet\nSo I ...
