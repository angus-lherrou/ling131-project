Virginia\nDivision of culture and history his latest book is called the princess and the pickup let's welcome below [noise]\n\nListen up y'all once there was a French and he lived on a farm in mountain range you live on a farm on a Grange and\nHe wasn't just any French he wasn't mountain France and he wanted to get married but yeah I Want to marry just anybody who wanted to marry a real mountain princess so he said to his momma because there weren't any mountain princesses in the general vicinity so he said to his momma he's still live\nWith his momma\nWhich might explain some things but anyway\nHe said to his mom and he said momma I Want to marry me a real mountain princess but the rain any around\nSo I'm going to go out and I'm going to travel through all the mountain ranges of the world see if I Can't find me a real mountain princess so we set out any hike through the Himalayas any ascended the Alps and the Appalachians any cruise through the caucuses he roamed through the wreckage he went to this year I was\nLooking for ladies in the air as\nLooking for ladies with one shoe\nBut he couldn't find any real princess that we're now he met a lot of ladies it said they were princesses but he wasn't sure that they were real princess is that they were probably frauds because let's face it you know princess costumes just aren't that expensive so\nHe went home and he was depressed and he said to his mom and he said momma I couldn't find no real mountain print so if you said I did meet some frauds he said now I cast some of those frauds [noise]\nNight a terrible storm blew up there was wind and rain and snow and hail and lightning and in a hurricane and and I do not I mean and what not and in the midst of all of that\nThere was a knock at the door and the press wants to open the door and because this is a story when he opened the door there on the front porch stood three beautiful prim prime princesses and he was so excited until they said trick or treat [noise]\n... me or doing some work when he saw a woman walking down the road she she was wearing a calico dresses she had hiking boots on her hair was in a mess and she walked up and she said howdy I'm a real mountains princess well he wasn't sure if she was a real mom princess\nBecause he wasn't sure real princesses walked around and hiking boots with calico dresses and their hair in a mess now she did have a stash that said mountain princess\nBut who knows right show each other home\nAnd he introduced her to his momma momma this year lady so she's a real mount princess well the momma wasn't so sure either and so she said the Sean and this is where if you have an already you'll figure out what their stories based on she said to her son she said I don't know if she's real mountain princess or not we're going to have to test or\nHe she said here's what I Want you to do she said\nI Want you to take twelve mattresses and I want you to go out and I want you to pile 'em up on the back of your pickup truck\nAnd when it comes time to go to bed will have that princess sleep up on top of those mattresses and if she don't notice that she's sleeping on a pickup truck\nWe all know that she's a real mountain princess [noise]\nAnd the prince okay mom okay a or were brainstorming should know about ideas he said [noise]\nHe's just a couple of issues one teaching house you not going to notice the pickup truck\nHe said you know I bought that pickup truck so princesses would notice me\nAnd the mom said how's that working out for you [noise]\nIt for a minute and she said\nDust Russell and then\nThe Princeton we ain't got real mattresses we got three of my address or an air mattress in one of those blow up wrap things and momma said use what you got so depressed [noise]\nAll that up on the back of the pickup\nInstance well it's time for\nBed princess let me show you were your sleep and it's I'm\nOut in the front door\nThe driveway up this ladder\nOn top of this pile of mattresses\nNow than we are about that and so\nFrance has climbed up and she went to sleep and when she was good in his late the mama gave the keys to the truck to her son and she said now\nI Want you to get in the truck and I want you to drive around I Want you to go up till I Want you to go downhill I Want you to go on a windy road don't want you to go on bumpy road if you don't notice that you sleeping on a pickup truck if you don't wake up will know that she's a real mountain princess\nAnd the prince okay mama brainstorming no better he said but\nIf I hit a bump\nShe's going to go flying off in and he says you know she's going to be road kill and I don't want to marry a roadkill princess now\nI don't know if you're aware of this but in the great state of West Virginia it is totally
