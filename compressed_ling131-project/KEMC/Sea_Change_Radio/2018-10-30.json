{"month": "10", "state": "MT", "station": "KEMC", "content": "From future producers hopefully within the state that not only encourages them to try and continue in an agricultural future but also they understand the MSU is invested in their futures well\nAlong with the contribution to forage efforts who are some of the other providers and vendors\nBig main vendors would be our local distributors which would be quality foods distributing which is based out of both men and some distribution which is also based out of Bozeman\nThey aggregate a lot of the local\nProducts for us so that we can have access to thirty or fifty or hundreds specific local vendors through one entity so it's like ordering through Cisco but it's all local products and then we do direct sales as well with companies that will deliver directly to us or will utilize one of the different\nDistributors that we have in the state and so for instance all of our fresh burger patties we are to those directly through ranch land which is in ... which is a processing company and then some distribution distributes them back to us but we do\nThat direct sales we also have some companies like the oil barn which is safflower oil which is up in big Sandy and will place an order for a pallet oil at a time and they will distribute that\nThemselves down to us and then they'll be other companies that will order from and then they'll drop ship it and so for instance tumble with cheese is a tea company based in big temper will order T from them and then they'll ship it to us in the mail so we have multiple avenues and that said for ... sake and the rest of our ordering managers\nIt does make things more complicated than ordering just through Cisco and but it's a labor of love where they get to remember to order all these different products through all of our different outlets and then figure out how to make it all works\nAnd how does the kitchen making all wear chef's flurries comments\nGood about these products is because they are local and they are fresh it doesn't take a lot to make them taste great simple as better with these items and we do bring people with different Connery skills and to achieve different results like we have the pasta ... station where we have\nThe fresh vegetables in there and we just do a saute on those with the little seasoning and that's all it really mean\nItems there where we can rotisserie some top ... are we can smoke some brisket those all again are simple techniques but that produce a really delicious quality item\nI first came onto the MSU Bozeman campus earlier this year to talk to chef John chairman renowned chef of Native American busy when he was here to lecture and cooked for the campus\nI asked Richard Huffman whether indigenous cooking will be integrated into the campus fair\nWe just completed a new contract with Harrington Pepsi in Bozeman and as part of the signing bonus generously donated a portion of that too or indigenous foods initiative is kind of seed money and because when shift Sherman came here we're all very inspired and instead of just feeling good we thought well how can we actually\nTake some of these ideas and these initiatives and get indigenous foods and like we've done with from the campus incorporate that into things that we do every day or every station has so we've been meeting on campus with different leaders in the Native American community trying\nTo begin to build those relationships we found that there's quite a bit of grant money out there that we didn't even know about and so we're looking at matching funds were looking at piggybacking on some of those are pretty excited that what we're trying to do is again use are are purchasing size\nTo go to a producer and say we need rabbits right now rabbits\nAre more expensive than New York state do you know somebody that's\nFarming rabbits or wants to get into the rabbit business we can buy buy in from Colorado but we'd rather buy it from Ford men or from the black feet\nThey've got a bias and prejudice that's going up there by a lake trout from the sewage scrutiny that we're serving as very much like salmon so we're already starting to incorporate a lot of those things but the bigger part is getting the word out and taking the long term view of craving those relationships and creating those opportunities with the Native Americans\nNow ... talks about another local effort\nPartnering with the College of agriculture we obviously get\nAnimals so they get beef and lamb and pork or that but you also operates towns harvest garden which is a three acre organic vegetable farm to dislocated about a half mile off the campus and\nStudents particularly in a sustainable food in dire energy systems undergraduate degree program will enroll in a course or practical on\nOver the summer to learn how to raise vegetables and clean them and market them through the essay which has like community supported agriculture program where members from throughout the humanity will pay the farm in advance and then\nBasis they also operate a campus farm stand where they'll bring vegetables to campus and set up some tents and tables and members\nFrom the campus community or if people are driving by they can come and\nPurchase that shovels and then they have some subsidized farm stands as well where they'll go to some lower income areas throughout town and sell\nSome vegetables at a discounted price but from our standpoint they also do some wholesaling and so we can work with them to have them grow something specific for us for one particular event or if it's something that we want to have many of whom they can have it\nOn a routine basis for us generally every summer there are some welcome back picnics that occur on campus for staff and for students and usually are catering sales manager will partner with towns harvest to\nIntegrate in whatever vegetables they have available for us for those particular events\n[noise] we have learned about concept production execution that ... the dining hall at MSU Bozeman them back and learn about how the system has reduced waiting and then we wouldn't you through the new shiny filling\n[noise]\nMm Mm Mm\nMm Mm\nWe're on the Amish you both been campus at the new rendezvous dining hall than e facility is brought a new flavors and styles eating but at the same time cut down on ways might to Savage shares\nWhen we open Miller two dollars and Fifteen ... there was a student here who did away study she started it before we remodeled and then did it again after ... remodeled and foment are wasted going down by about fifty percent which is kind of surprising because with all the options you would have thought we would have eaten oath taking more\nAnd then maybe the waste would have gone up what they were taking whatever they took\nWe were eating we had gone trailers we change some of the size of the place we tried to change up some of the utensils so that they were taking smaller servings but they could well welcome to come back and we did see quite a bit of a decreased and then of course we started composting and grown that program to Carolyn\n... provides further insights\nI think that there are more students and more student groups on campus that are concerned about environmental waste and food waste in our facilities and so we have them come to us and we partner with them to try and encourage people to be a little bit more mindful and we have ...\nTaste it don't waste it so it's unlimited access to all the food once you're in the dining hall but you don't have to take an entire serving as something you can take a little bit see if you like it and go back and get second or third or fourth or the next time they come into the facility you can remember that you enjoyed that dish and so you can take a larger portion next time\nFinally chef ... tells us how waste has lessened in the kitchen the\nOther thing is is that our waste also and decreased due to were not batch cooking anymore or we're not cooking on large volume anymore we're cooking what we need when we need it\nNow let's head into the ... the dining room reminiscent of the food court in an airport or shopping center\nWe begin our tour with Richard Huffman at the checking station we stand at the entrance and see the budget dining options shaped\nHalf circle of are they different concepts dishes however if you're just on your way on the campus and you want to stop and grab a coffee we have a retail window so you don't have to be on a meal planning
