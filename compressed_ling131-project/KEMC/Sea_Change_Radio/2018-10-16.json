water and stop every industry in our state\nEndangered species act when it was put into effect was put into effect for very very good reason and I think we can have both\nEconomic development crickets mining\nThan we consume species that are endangered in danger that you have to walk the line and one species get recovered like rules were a few years ago I stepped up and said let's take 'em off the list than we did it in ... in the long run and they just finished the last ...\nHere in Idaho Montana and Wyoming so it's incredibly important that we use commonsense Israel apply this and if it's used as an instruction obstructions method we need to say no\nIt should be used for the for the impact that it was originally put in shaping species that are endangered\nStrip Breckenridge find a word we should maybe I shouldn't have even had a discussion on ... until we reintroduce them and said oh here's an endangered species and they want to introduce them into our environment and then shut down everything\nSo that's the problem you have with the federal government intervention into states issues in states rights as they come in there and they put their thumb on top of it\nAnd are they destroy the underlying kind of we used to have thirty nine miles from eureka all the way down to Darby now we've got three because of that endangered species act as a big reason for that for those closures and we're not going to get those industries back [noise]\nJackie I'm a knock on the next question for Mr ...\nThinking that you Rosendale sci fi explain why Montanans are better off financially under the Trump tax cuts that simple math jacket I Love this lesson so I've been\nAround the state for the last thirty days and meeting with businesses and individuals across the state\nTo individuals are getting anywhere in the neighborhood about sixteen hundred dollars more that they're able to keep each year that businesses power expanding dramatically I went to an electrical contractor and muzzle law\nAcquire new from as bringing ten more full time employees on I went to ... creek products which is a company him as a law that\nHad a manufacturers special seating devices to allow folks are handicapped to enter into a hot tub or or a swimming pool and he is going to invest seven eight hundred thousand dollars\nAnd and I visited an aviation from and doing that over worded eight hundred to one thousand dollar bonuses to every two every employee and there were from has increased the compensation that is a kind of success that President Trump has brought\nHow do you explain to Montana and who are paying about three dollars for a gallon of gas even more for diesel\nChildcare costs are up\nInterest rates are up\nCosts of goods are up for those manufacturers you talked about because of the terrorists\nWhy are they better off financially now\nWell the ... again Jack in the math shows it costs to go up and they do go down and what we have to do is lie on the principles of supply and demand free market principles\nTo to actually govern those and not have the government coming in and picking the winners and losers and making determinations about where the marketplace should be when I was living in a while we saw the the Bach and the oil and take place I saw the minimum wage job from ten dollars an hour\nTo Seventeen dollars and fifty cents an hour in Sydney Montana\nAnd the government didn't have anything to do with it it was just simple supply and demand senator tester\nWell thanks for the question Jackie I Will tell you that uh I think Montanans appreciate the tax break or I see the problem is is that another two trillion dollars underwear nations to [noise]\nWe're we're having a short term game for a long term problem and that's a problem\nAnd I think that we can do better I think of the bill would have went through the process the committee we could have got public input where he could have made the bill a much better bill\nWe do need tax reform this bill was not tax reform and I will tell you in that regard are supporting a balanced budget and push for a balanced budget says I got there will be able to get across the finish when I voted against three out of five of Obama's last by just 'cause I thought this spent too much money\nAnd I've turned three point three million dollars back the treasury from my office so we can do some things that cut the deficit down but adding two trillion dollars a district where Penn is at our kids expense is not the direction reminder\nThirty seconds for those refinery dressed or Britain\nThan what we've seen as a jump from the ears of Obama administration of two percent GDP to four point five which is a raise the heart and soul of every libertarian you get rid of taxes if we got rid of the personal income tax\nAnd brought government spending into his constitutional confines we would have GDP is in the eight and nine percent every year but we have\nOnly thirty six delegated powers but yet we got a department of education with the federal government doing an education we got troops are over in wars\nThought of or is that the debt increase is being caused by a tax cuts is a false narrative\nCut legislation is going to generate more revenue than ever been generated for the federal government the problem is spending and debt increase is a direct result of that spending time talk to that cutting spending he increase the national debt\nEleven times the debt ceiling fell out of the times he's increase the national debt from eight dollars to Twenty one trillion dollars at the same time I reduce my operating calls by twenty three percent but we have to do this focus on free time fending\nFor next question from Tim mechanical and goes\nTo senator tester things change senator tester what percentage of ... for women and its reelected what will you do to increase the number of women and minorities on your staff\nGreat question let me let me back up just a little bit here by the way the numbers I got for to drill and increase on that by the tax bill was why the conservative think tanks in Washington DC put those numbers out or it could be much higher than by [noise]\nUm a lot um\nI think it's about half way but I don't know I mean I hire people based on their ability and I've got a lot of women on my staff [noise]\nUm but I have never counted up and and done the math to be honest with you um when I go out and hire folks are like my state directors a woman right now a lady from from anaconda it's about\nHow she can do her job and now she works and\nKen how she moves forward and I can tell you that I've got some of the hardest working women on my staff around and I can appreciate the benefits that they give to my office as far as policy work than constituent work for the best of the best and I'd say the same thing for the guys by the way\nWe've got a great office we're very proud of the constituent work we do we're very part of those folks have under the ground to hear about how important things like health care costs are public lands public education the list goes on\nWith him and a follow up question though what would you do if a member of your staff were accused of sexual harassment\nUm I Would hear 'em out and there was any merit to it that are going\nTo Breckenridge you have thirty seconds not quite sure how I can answer that attempt because I'm not in John staff here so [laughter] but if you are elected if I'm elected okay finally going I'm elected a I think is a better way to [laughter]\nAll right so um [noise] um you know I had um three businesses were we had a Eighteen employees\nJob description that we had some of the jobs that I had you know you're burning a chainsaw cutting line we're we're not to a lot of jobs that women apply for\nAnd so a as a survey or there's a lot of good\nAh intelligent women in our in our sector of society and uh I have the utmost respect\nFor every one of them just arose until\nI got to that fifty percent of my staff\nAre women my my point is there that I'm actually have have more control over my chief legal counsel as a Mormon my deputy all there is a woman my direct executive assistant who takes a lot of my um five daily management is a woman\nHigh hire these people based on their compensate and they're highly qualified and their understanding of the insurance industry and their ability to help me perform my duties properly and so I'm very proud of that fact\nCenter tests or even the final [noise]\nWell I just say that ah you know the fact is that we're talking about in Washington DC about equal pay for equal work is ridiculous we're in the twenty first century women should be paid the same amount as men for the same work [noise] I think that ah when we talk about a a lot of\nProblems in the workplace because of a of a folks making improper remarks or actions towards women I don't think we should have any tolerance for that and when it comes to hiring I think you open the door and if you hire women they'll do a great job for him that's what I found\nJackie on August next question Mr Breckenridge I'd like to go back to a an answer you gave regarding standing and get ...\nCan you name three agencies are programs and he would eliminate right now\nHealth and Human Services they're not there is no constitutional directive for the health and those are states issues\nAnd they need to be at the state they can handle them better third agency I cut would be the EPA in Montana you have sixty seven different laws rules and regulations you have to comply with just to flush the toilet\nAnd so Montana is very very strong on a on their environment clean drinking water standards are ten parts per million Montana's ... parts
