{"month": "10", "state": "MT", "station": "KEMC", "content": "Yeah and I've been very clear on this I Will always stand with Montana I've had a chance to talk to the president twice face to face on this is my encouragement was to him was to bring these trade negotiations to a close I've said all along I don't\nFavor broad based terrorists um we have not been treating barely a in a many of these arrangements are and I'm\nEighty percent of our gringos overseas as I've met with farmers and ranchers across the state we need free and open access to these foreign markets for our egg producers to thrive\nBut we still have issues with Canada for example grain growing into going into Canada was his greatest at speed quality this is not fair trade I encourage investor Lighthizer the trade investor\nTo handle that in the NAFTA agreement I was pleased to see Mexico come to the table that looks like the president's making progress to do with Europe I Will continue apply pressure to make sure we continue to have free and open access to foreign markets\nAll right and the Illinois Swanson your rebuttal\nWell the great thing about free trade is that is a mutually beneficial for everyone there is a natural human rights to sell and buy things as the free fair market value\nAnd uh I don't Sam with anyone messing with those really important economic signals that help us this summer the most valuable way to serve one another and\nDefinitely William ... level\nIt's been my honor to spend much of my career working with farmers and ranchers in Montana and Wes I Am absolutely committed to rural Montana I Want to see are a small communities thrive and and the vital a I have been raising the tariff issue for months and uh\nAnd I'm just not seeing any leadership at the congressional level from congressman gene forte or others\nUh we're doing foreign policy it with a sledgehammer instead of a scalpel and it's I it's hard to see an exit strategy and I'm looking forward to getting to Congress so I can be helpful or at the time when it's needed which is fairly not one that has already happened\nOr it's been doing for your final rebuttal well I've been I've been encouraged because I have a seat at the table with the president\nHave the ability to bend his ear on issues that are important employing found a few could be more important that our activism or we will continue to apply pressure to get these relationships Ross will cause the reality is we've been in a trade war for decades\nIt's just that the U.S has not taken the field and for the first time or we have someone who's standing up for us we cannot Lexus continue indefinitely over we need to bring them to a close\nThank you ah Jackie I'm an actor you have the next question was for Illinois wants the Swanson\nWhat federal policies are you advocating to address the epidemic of opioids and methamphetamine well\nAs a libertarian I Believe there's a natural human rights live free and that's every peaceful mentally competent uh adult was not harming anyone else or um and you know when it comes to some of these harder drugs\nNot opioid necessarily on his that's between the doctor and the patient um you know it's just it's a matter of determining whether or not someone who's mentally competent or not otherwise you have a natural freedom to take marijuana raw milk\nCigarettes alcohol sugar and decide for yourself the risks and benefits\nUm when we permit people to make these decisions for themselves such as by offering them other alternatives such as marijuana in Colorado they saw decreasing opioid addiction when they put up these other markets and possibilities\nOr ... or ...\nOr um addiction is just such a concerning problem and and really in Montana uh it's my understanding that math is really the uh the the concern over opioids foot but all of these are concerned including alcohol um I've supported treatment courts and\nThe addiction issues are are complex and I will say that that one of the places where these issues are strongest our on our ah areas that are experiencing poverty so we need to work to ensure opportunity and to ensure that\nUh that we have the services we need to help people that are that find themselves in a in an addict it tastes\nLike the punishment June fourth annual a bottle while I'm proud of the results that Congress as your congressman we'd delivered in Syria just this week we've passed a package of ... to the Senate and the house specifically do dress opioids and messy shoes\nTell me your business is the one in Yellowstone county ... and Kelly oh we need one up in the wider besieged focus more on rehabilitation of non violence or drug offenders are as opposed to incarceration that's a step in Morris Russian\nThank you in the Illinois influence in your little\nI agree with the sushi unfortunately that we need to take a rehabilitative steps when we have addiction situations with harder drugs like methamphetamine because people off of the street and patient treatment is rehabilitative rather than prison system\nRight to our next question comes from ... and his fourth definitely Williams\nMuslims are you concerned about the growing inequality when it comes to income in the United states we have the top one percent controlling a larger and larger portion of the nation's wealth while wages for the average person have sort of remain stagnant do we just accept this or other stuff we can take to close that gap\nExtra bringing that up because again the the tax give away\nUm aggravated the growing income disparity between a everyday working Montanans and ultra wealthy like congressman gene forte so uh I complained about the that tax bill I was vice chair of the Montana taxation committee that in the house\nIn two thousand Fifteen where we've passed responsible fiscally responsible tax policy\nUm and and you're right the wages now uh\nHave about the same buying power as wages in Nineteen Seventy eight there are a lot of people that have not\nBeen able to progress while the upper one percent and ten percent are making record profits so yes I'm concerned about the growing income disparity I've been talking about that since two thousand eleven on the house floor\nOr one of the things that I advanced and the legislature we laid the groundwork for an earned income tax credit which really help the\nFolks that the uh working families that the lower levels and I I Want to continue to help close that gap\nThis whole question if I may um do you support than higher taxes on the wealthy\nThink the tax give away is going to require a bunch of fix is a there are mistakes in is there a loophole that weren't close that thing was a thousand pages long I Can't imagine that represent as you unfortunately actually read that there were a A N handwritten amendments from the margins are\nFix this thing is I was in the June fourth and you'll lose a little\nWell it's it's important that we look at the facts here of the tax plan first\nOver hold his plans for over Thirty years really help lower income families we doubled the child tax credit we doubled the standard deduction that single mom I talked about in Illinois earlier\nRaising three kids her paycheck and I went up four hundred dollars a month there's been allegations that somehow this was done for the rich\nAccording to the billings Gazette my taxes actually went up that's what my account sewing too so this was thought to give away for the wealthy my wife and I have crosswords here and I will work to help the rest of Montana prosperous well\nThank you and uh Illinois response in your little\nYou know I'm going to repeat myself because I think it's just that important in Nineteen thirty one we had no that now we have more deaths than any other country in the world for every twenty dollars that America makes the federal government takes three borrows one and then for\nI you know they say that every young Republican as a libertarian and every young Democrats as a libertarian too they just don't realize it yet I'm not sure our country's finances can wait long enough for these\nFolks to go up thank you and Kathleen Williams your rubble\nI agree that the debt as a an incredible problems and and that just the budget that was passed in ... yesterday I guess as\nA congressman gene forte has a set supported a balanced budget then voted for the tax give away then talked about a balanced budget than voted for a budget that increase the deficit then voted against one that funded the\nThe defense and Pell Grants I mean it's just all over the map we need some consistency and I'll say that even putting a a more dollars in people's pockets us when our health care costs are going by that by trips\nA double digits is each year\nAnd inflation it's it's not a health thing I'm On the on the net", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Sea Change Radio", "city": "Billings", "day": "02"}
