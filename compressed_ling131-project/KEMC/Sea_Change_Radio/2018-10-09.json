{"month": "10", "state": "MT", "station": "KEMC", "content": "It sounds like that was a lot of research that went into understanding that time period and how accurate comical on you know experience was that was our fault him for for these not necessarily ... subjects at the time to inform you ...\nYeah well I'm I've been reading about that part of the state a lot for you know for most of my career so there has been a lot of research behind it for sure yeah\nAnd Alan I'm up on the\nMissouri brakes it's very isolated area and you're\nThe violence in your story happens really early and then it's a flashback when the bodies discovered you want to talk a little bit about that\nYeah so um I describe this book to when I where I'm Talking about the book to friends or when I'm I'm reading I describe it as a crime novel and it it opens with the crime I'm I'm always a little grateful when people\nGet past the first ten pages of the book to to read further it's not in this mostly violent book uh but there is an opening scene you know of course it's it's all downhill from there the challenge I gave myself with this book was to work within ... to write a crime novel\nBut then to flip it around to suffered so it's a crime novel it's sensibly something of a mystery but in the opening pages we have a pretty good idea of of who do than what happened as a writer how do you work with that that's that's kind of a challenge\nYou know I think both these books as sort of classical westerns in the fact that neither of your characters are real heroes they're sort of anti heroes and I wonder\nUm again is that a theme of sort of Montana literature the scarred individual\nYeah I suppose it is I'm In part ... part of the reason that turned out that way in in this but for me it was because I Am I always try to turn the stereotypes on their head a little bit and\nI'm so George I'm ends up being part of this lynching that you mentioned and um he's not there by choice um he's been dragged into it and even realizes halfway through the whole thing that he doesn't have a gun so he's kind of wondering what the hell is doing there yeah and he ends up being ...\nAlso confusing and an rarely unwanted from him so\nYeah I I think you're right that there's an interesting twist sometimes in Montana literature where the the the person who is least likely at least I'm desire desiring some kind of heroic title ends up in that role for some reason so\nNow when you've got a obviously an anti hero in your novel how much did that play a role in crafting the stock\nI'm not sure that while I was crafting the books that I was thinking in terms of hero or anti hero um I was trying to\nCreate a three dimensional character when you when you try to create as realistic or a person as possible you know there are elements of the anti hero that come through you know we're we're all flawed individuals you know so um to create a a real\nOr without qualification is is to kind of be a little lazy as a writer I think in some ways um I'd be interested in Russell's thoughts on this as well the idea of the anti heroes being\nKind of central to western literature it it didn't start out that way I mean I I agree with you guys that that's the thing that's an element of of contemporary literature um ...\nYou looked at the the history of literature in the west and and our heroes used to be very one dimensional you know you start out\nIt's the kind of the John Wayne archetype if you will so there's the white out in the blackout the good guy rise into town and sells everybody's problems a soda ... maybe the the trend toward the anti hero is a reaction against\nThat foundation or or playing a rip off I was in some ways uh I Know Russell is given some thought to this as well\nYeah I I think oh in western to blame for the the original template but um it's always been fascinating to me that it started to turn when will cast their became big and you know she was the first writer from the west to win any major literary prizes and [noise]\nAnd I think she was the one that first started to write about the west in a real way it was she ... she wrote about alcoholism and domestic violence and you know her characters were real\nSpread idea of writing about the west and never LA how I went in ... in your book and how much I it's very true to life at that time period and\nThat was a definitely a challenge with this book I wanted to have kept Catherine be someone who is not as stoic as women are mostly portrayed in the in that time period [noise] uh you know I think it's easy to fall\nSo I wanted her to be more vocal about her feelings and about her reaction of things um and that was really hard to do without you know sort of resorting to contemporary vernacular so um that was a challenge\nAllen in your book I'm thinking of the two women a very strong New York based editor character and then the mother who I wanted to do more are respond more and she doesn't can you talk about those two characters\nSo to to address the or the New York agent character ah I I found it helpful\nOr as a writer in reviewing the character of a place or an environment if you can introduce some contrast so\nWhen we bring a New York or eastern or character into the west and see the west through their eyes it provides a helpful foil ... to the subject so we\nSee Montana in two different ways we see it from a hero or anti hero and we see it from this character of clearly who's coming in from New York the character of close the strong New York a woman was meant to be in some ways a foil\nHopefully a character and she has her own conflicts and her own\nUh issues to resolve a so ... she has a substantial part of the book but introducing her also allowed us to see Montana in that particular way\nOr the other character ah she was in a ... as the flashback opens she was in a really difficult spot so she's and it's the Nineteen seventies she's a recent widow there's not a lot of\nPlaces for her to go one of the catalysts for the story is that she ends up working as a as a\nHouse made and the brakes are outside of Jordan and that was one of the few opportunities that she had a so in some ways her lack of options is is central to the store and she had to be in that position in order for the stories of the place\nI Love the idea of telling the story through their eyes I'm at some point in ... characters and and have this kind of a narrative that unfolded um wrestler you use a lot of dialogue obviously about that he had to uh to to get these storylines that costs and sounds like that that\nIt gets a little bit of play infection but to retain the historical nature of of a half the time period as important tail\nIt strikes me to mention these two books are alike insofar as there are two different\nWritten in first person so the character is telling the story and then we have a substantial part of the book is written in third person\nAnd the two voices are flip flopped between the two books so I chose to tell to write most of the story in first person from the male point of view then the third person was from the female point of view limited third Russell did the opposite to a first person from the female point of view from Catherine\nIn limited third from George\nI wanted to get in touch with my inner\n[laughter] and they're both placed in the most isolated parts of that ad is another ... difficult for him to write and do you find third person are our first question a little bit more challenging\nI've always liked the first person better um I think it gives you a more immediacy and more you can just get into the characters had more that's what I've always liked about it\nUh I'm I'm not sure I have a preference there it's all equally equally difficult\n[laughter] so um I Do have a question I'm Wondering both of you are not only prolific writers but you know so many of the writers in Montana I'm Wondering if they're of a knack killer for Montana or the west in terms of contemporary literature\nI don't think there is I think there there was I was talking to Richard wheeler recently um who's written a de novels most of them westerns and he he I had an interesting observation he said westerns are really southern literature\nAnd you kinda see that in the especially in the old western movies there's the the drawl you know and um so I think at one point there was the speech patterns in\nThe west we are influenced by the south\nBut um you know Montana has this really I'm attracted writers from all over the place and um the strength of the program in ... and and the Livingston community have really drawn people from all over the place so\nI think it's the ball to the point where people here just write about whatever they're interested in so there's not really a common vernacular anymore\nI I agree with that I think uh it's to the credit or those of our community that there's such a diversity of voices everyone has their own particular way of of writing about this particular place in these particular people", "show_name": "Sea Change Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings",
