than the whether it's the way they lived they hunted big game like deer wild buffalo even mammoth and Renault often by getting up close and personal was spears to take down their prey so terrible injuries would have been common and potentially catastrophic\nBut the Neanderthals had a secret to survive all they cared\nThat is they care for each other like a doctor cares for a patient archaeologist Dr penny spike in from the University of New York has found evidence that Neanderthals practice sophisticated healthcare and this adds to the evidence that Neanderthals were far from the

the ... an engine for quite a few years now but it wasn't really seen an times that\nI kind of systematic approach by the end the house just seen an old isolated cases which maybe didn't make sense\nAnd we've been trying to look at the whole patent evidence for cat intensive when we see with Hungary from very severe injuries and illness it which many points to it being a practice that guy that went on throughout that range mating and was really important festival\nWell I'm trying to get us a sense of context here I mean we're kind of injuries are you talking about how tough for their lives\nProbably one of ... famous Neanderthal I think as a man from Shannon at all and he had a a with it all a very badly injured leg was probably blind in one night and probably ... death\nAnd and really we can't imagine hand being able to make much of a contribution to exclude but he was attacked for about ten to Fifteen Years but when I say that you know broken legs or other breaks I quite common as a kind of other kind of inflammatory problems\nAnd so it was funny comments to say that in the hands of time I have you know more than one even to like say sequences of sort of severe injuries during their lifetime\nWhat then does that tell you about what's happening in the ice shelf\nWill just tells us in the case of the melting event there's been a permanent alteration of the near surface snow structure above the ice shelf and the the snow is very important because it just sort of a blanket that protects the deep arise from the atmosphere [noise]\nSo it's very important to know when melting is occurring and what steps it's occurring and analyzing the seismic waves you can get an idea of how the ice a profile if you will and snow profile has changed a due to an event like for me\nWhat we're hearing a lot about the ice shelves in Antarctica breaking up or do you are are you able to use this to sound from the wind\nIt'll be a useful tool and monitoring the changes that may occur in the near surface of the Ross and and other ice shelves we do know that ah\nThese enormous floating glacial masses can actually come apart rather quickly from observations of collapsing ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula where it's quite a bit warmer and in those cases a key factor was the uh initiation and propagation of surface melt near the top of the show\nWill take me through that what happens\nWell one mechanism that we believe is important as if you actually get to the point where you start to foreign pools of liquid water they congregate into ponds and these pawn sort of fracture they're way down through the ice and contribute to breaking it up it would be a\nA probably valuable to monitor the propagation of cracks across ice shelves as well with seismic graphs\nAnd when we think about Antarctica I I think we usually think about the huge glacier that covers the continent but yet these these ice shelves center around the outside that's floating ice how important are they in in monitoring what's happening to the ice at the south pole\nThe ice shelves in Antarctica play a critical role in helping to restrain the glaciers are in the interior of Antarctic are flowing more rapidly into the ocean and the Ross ice shelf is the largest of them all so it's extremely important component of the Antarctic ice shelf system\n[noise] what's your next step\nWell we hope to put some more instruments are like this out on ice shelves and a further study the process now that we've learned a lot about the basics of the signal and what we can do with it\nAnd it it's my hope that eventually will be able to use them to ah understand a directly what's happening to the snow column or in enough detail but we won't have to dig still pits and use other invasive techniques we can we can monitor important features of the snow and ice just by listening\nDr ... thank you very much for your time\nMy pleasure thank you\nDr Rick ... is a professor of geophysics at Colorado State university [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo your body but ah there's nothing like cooking a big one apart from the thrills there might be the promise of a dinner of the freshest fish you could imagine [noise]\nOf course lots of conservation minded anglers these days wouldn't think of actually keeping the fish they catch they carefully unhook their prize and return it to the water in the hopes that it will survive thrive and maybe provide the same phone again in the future\nBut there may be a catch to catch and release new research by a young marine biology student at the University of Alberta suggests that hook injuries could be helping the ability of released fish to feed [noise]\nMost uh Thompson has been an avid angler herself and she was two and did the research while taking a marine biology course at the battlefield marine science center on Vancouver Island this Thompson welcome to courts in courts hello Hi so what kind of effect did you discover the catch and release fishing can have on the fish themselves well\nWhat I discovered was when they're hooked correctly in the side of their mouth it can decrease the suction performance of fish so when they go to catch the food and they suck it into their mouth when you finish them and when you here's a whole and cause an injury inside their mouth\nTaken a decrease their feeding performance wow well how did you figure this out well I caught\nTen little tiny shiny perch around forty grams and I also each scene so I took a big way to net and I grabbed him all of the weather and Ayelet which is across from ban field and I basically compared how they've captured food with a high speed camera\nWill take me through that how does a fish capture food for section feeding fish they open their mouth and they increase the volume and basically the back of their throat by doing that it causes all the water in front of the fish to rush into the mouth and any food or shrimp or tiny fish in front of the\nIn front of the fishes mouth get sucked into the mouth\nSo they literally just sort of feeling like yeah there was that\nYeah [noise] so what then was the difference that you saw between fish that have been caught with a hook and those that were not\nSo fish that were caught with a hook actually had a slower velocity intake so it took a longer time for the piece of food to actually get in their mouth than the ones that we caught that didn't have injuries around their mouth was causing that\nHave you ever been to like got us larvae or McDonald's and you accidentally bent the straw too far and called little hole and then it was really hard to it's like a ... the soda it's basically the same principle of that so\nAll through the side so it just decreases the amount of water that comes from the front of the mouth so it it just doesn't go as fast into the mouth I guess\nI see the the whole in the ... the Russian isn't as strong as of yet you know the whole is made by the hook some fisherman was saying well we use bar blues works the ... don't have the little piece on the very tip that keeps the hook in the most of the focus move all the way around does that make a difference\nSo if you hook a fish optimally in like in the side of the mouse where you where you want it and says like down deep and like the the ... in the gills you're still going to cause a hole through the ... of the hook through the membrane but ah barbed jokes do a lot more damage than ...\n[laughter] so what does it mean for the fish if it's got this whole side of his mouth and it can bring in as much water and feed is more has officially\nI Believe that the fish will feed less and suction feeding fishes need to be very precise\nWith when they open their mouth and how fast they do it so they need to be very precise because you can only bring in a certain amount of water so if they have less of a suction then they're not going to be able to get those really fast freight types like little shrimp through a little fish there have a higher chance of escaping it'll lead to them catching less pray\nWhile in your experiment how much less efficient where the fish with the holes in the side of their mouths at feeding\nSo the difference between the injured and the ah an injured fish with about a hundred centimeters a second\nSo the uninsured fish had two hundred and fifty thousand meters a second and the injured fish only during the pizza to where I'm at a hundred and fifty centimeters the second so it's a hundred centimeters second difference\nWhich has substantial does the speed of the water going in their mouth that was the speed of the actual food item that I use which is a little three millimeter Cuba to worm\nAnd that's how fast they drew and into their mouth I also did notice that the injured fish were less willing to feed than the uninsured which was very interesting\n... well it's hard when you have a sore most yeah that's true [laughter] so then does the injury from the hook fully explained or reduced ability to feed\nFrom um computational data model that another person made on the same paper that I worked on no the whole by itself doesn't explain a hundred percent the observed things that I found in my study so what explains the rest of it I Believe it's stress\nThe unwillingness to feed because of the ...\nNews and the fish being caught and then released again\nA very big factor when you angle of fish you're bringing it in on the broad so you're fighting against it so you're exhausting to fish before it comes in you're taking it out of the water suffocating it when you were holding it out and taking the hook out and then you're releasing it back\nSo if the fish is above the surface water for thirty seconds the stress hormones and its blood don't go down at for two hours after\nSo it has a very large effect on the um the stress hormones and then other research shows that it's less likely to breed it's less likely to if it has a\nLike a brood patch or a bunch of eggs that it's protecting and it's more likely to abandon them it's less likely to feed and um it's also at a higher chance of getting preyed upon so it has a bunch of factors to the fish is survival just like catch and release alone\nSo what effect would it have on mortality rates in the fish two thirds\nOf fish actually survive from catch and release ones that are just die outright or a delayed mortality so like they get an injury and it just gets infected and then they die\nIt's adapted to massive climate change to planet killing asteroid impacts two tectonic shifts where the very ground has changed as continents are remade\nWell now life is adapting to what might be the tricky a set of new conditions of all\nWe built giant sprawling city's a brick glass and concrete Kenyans made a great buildings in a men's deserts of at fault\nBut evolution is not to be denied as we've made this new urban landscape natural life is found a way to colonize and adapt to it a few examples urban songbirds have changed their color their sound even their mating habits in order to survive\nFox's have adapted to living in the busiest cities in the world\nAnd plants have developed new types of seeds that allow for growth in cracks in city sidewalks those are just some of the examples Dr mental skill housing illustrates in his new book Darwin comes to town how the urban jungle drives evolution\nDr skilled housing is an evolutionary biologist ecologist and professor about diversity and lightened University in the Netherlands hello welcome to the courts in courts\nHello book thank you very much for having me\nWell first of all what fascinates you about this question of life adapting to our urban environments\nWell a couple of things to begin with it's very rapid evolution we've we're we're really observing species adapting almost as we speak much faster than than we tend to think evolution takes place and that's because\nCities are so different from natural environment that it creates a situation that requires ferry drastic adaptation that usually means very fast and ...\nBut also because cities are really expanding rapidly on the earth and it's really becoming a habitat in its own rights really becoming part of the earth's surface that is there for species to colonize it can be ignored anymore so I think\nIn the in the near future we're going to see a lot of wildlife being forced to adapt\nThe species that managed to survive in cities things to Darwinian adaptation\nWell it it is remarkable in your book how many species have adapted because we tend to think of cities as kind of a sterile environment where we clean away anything that's living you know there's something growing we cut it off or ... how have city has become so rich and by the diversity\nWell it's a number of things first of all not all species can live in cities there are lots of species that really need pristine natural habitats and they cannot survive in city so a lot of species do disappear when a city\nOr arises in a place but also a lot of species managed to survive and there's several reasons how they could do that for some are simply\nWe call that pre adapted they find something in the city that resembles their natural habitats think of rock pigeons for example the city pigeons are originally rock pigeons they they live in very very rocky cliff ... environments and to them our city with with its buildings is not that different from their natural a rookie environment\nBut also cities are actually quite diverse if you compare them to the rural countryside nowadays especially in North America and Europe where almost every maximum productivity squeezed out of every inch of land there's not much natural habitat left in the countryside for species to stir fry where whereas cities are full of\nInteresting little pockets of vegetation a gardens I mean the the cities are consist of thousands and thousands of backyard which are all different and especially for blondes and insects that creates a lot of diversity of habitat that they can live in\nAnd then of course you have the real evolution of species that are invading city and adapt as they invade and evolve new ...\nWell you say in your book that cities are like mad scientist creating their own ecological concoction\n[noise] what do you mean by the ...\nYeah that's another thing that of course we we humans\nBring in a lot of species I mean some species come into the city under their own steam but but some are brought in by us of course our gardens are planted full of species that come from all corners of the globe\nPets and ... and ... are introduced accidentally or unintentionally by people and cities are really a melting pot of species from all over the world which are forced to find a way to live together and and so a a blonde from South America can suddenly meat\nOr an insect from from Europe in in a in a city in China and find out that that the insects\nMet before that haven't evolved to deal with these species so too but to to use those opportunities they must adept than they do that well\nYou mentioned how cities create their own sort of micro ... little ecosystems of their own such as ah the parks in New York City were mice and they're doing quite well and and the parks are all different tell me about that\nYeah one of the things about cities is that there is a little fragmentation going on so in in natural environments will scores you can find vast forests that are sort of uninterrupted over large area\nIn cities these bits of vegetation and very much fragmented so New York city is a good example where of course four hundred years ago there was a continuous forest covering Manhattan and the five boroughs\nAnd of that forests all that has left now our our city parks likes like Central Park and Prospect Park does our bits of origin of vegetation and they're still bits of original phone that survive isolated from each other in these are ruined in these pockets of of forest in the city\nAnd the white footed mouse is one of the native\nRodents that live in in the east coast us that are surviving if that means surviving in these isolated bits of forest\nAnts in ... to ... living in the countryside these mice in New York City are adapting to their individual parks that they live in\nSo that their genes are actually changing to suit the conditions in those specific parks for example in Central Park demise have evolved genes that help them deal with a very fatty diet which\nOf course has to do with all the junk food that people leave behind in the park and that these mice eat in another park there's a gene that has changed their immune system probably because there was some some epidemic possibly brought in by by humans or other animals that has spread in that park and has has made this population of mice resistant to that particular\nDisease so every pockets of habitat in the city has its own signature it has its own little little a Darwinian landscape that species adapt to\nWell you have so many examples of plants and animals making genetic adaptations for urban life in your book it's ah we can't go through them all do you have any favorites\nWould I really like is an example from Europe that the the European black birds\nWas one of the first birds to invade cities already in the early Nineteen century in Germany and in Rome and from then on they'd have become more and more urban even though the forest like birds still still survive they still exist and it turns out that those urban like birds and the forest like birds overdose two hundred years have become more and more\nOf differences in the way they look for example they have\nShorter ... in the city and the shorter intestines also the way they sing they sing at higher pitch which probably has to do with the urban noise from traffic the also seeing during the night which the forest like bird doesn't do\nIn the urban situation they don't migrate anymore they stay in the city the whole year round because there's always food available whereas the forest like birds they migrate away during the winter to the south\nTo the extent that these urban and tourists blackbirds are not really into reading any more than a mixing with each other which for example has to do with the fact that migration is different as I mentioned so by the time\nThe forest like birds come back from their winter quarters to urban like birds have already started breeding because they're yeah there's it's warmer in the city because of these so called urban heat island\nAnd there's food to year round so it can start breeding in March already whereas the forest like birds only start in may so there's no genes being exchanged anymore because between the forest and the urban like bird\nSo this is really a bird that's on the way of becoming a separate species\nSo you're seeing the same thing in these black birds with their different beaks and all that between the urban in the rural that Darwin saw with finches and the Galapagos Islands exactly now there was another bird that has adapted to city life by using cars to crack nuts healthy felt that\n[noise] yeah that's right those are carrying the crows in Japan\nOr they have for a long time have been using the Japanese walnuts as foods and they've been dropping those from from a great high there picks them up from the tree and then they fly\nTo send me to sign that dropped them on the rock and then the ... and they can eat the inside then cities became available and this continued doing that but then dropping to the the walnuts onto ... onto onto the streets to correct them and at one point in in the Nineteen seventies it was discovered\nThat in the city of Sendai in northern Japan a there was in a population of carrion crows that wins one step further and they started dropping these knots in front of the wheels of passing cars\nOr which was much easier to correct them of course they didn't need to fly high up and drop to not repeatedly to until it broke into just place it in front\nOf the wheels of a bussing car and even stationed themselves at but Estrin crossing so when the car stopped that would help into the streets drop a few of those knots in front of the cars and when the lights turned in the car started moving they would", "show_name": "Quirks and Quarks", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "30"}
