people that had smoking issues and can't be around a lot of smoke so we keep a vapor only\nSo why are we here because by legalizing cannabis for recreational use our country is not just making history\nWe're embarking on a large scale social cultural and yes scientific experiment so while some might be worried about this great Canadian gun jak experiment people who use Canada's like these folks at the ... cafe say it's about time\nWas a long time coming in is long overdue I'm excited for it I'm very excited I feel like we waited a really long time or to a different world are about to pop into it's very very weird area very cool though\nI think once were the first domino falls within the rest of the road we'll see how great it is and uh you know and I'll just be one big\nNot because of their users I mean probably some of them are you know what they're excited about is the fact that this experiment will allow them to ask a lot of interesting and important questions about cannabis they haven't been able to ask before [noise]\nSo in this special episode of course in courts we'll find out about these questions and what we know and don't know about how Canada's affects the mind and body we'll explore all the family of active ingredients in Canada is and how it affects users\nWill try to understand this ancient plant and meet a researcher who's trying to grow plot better we'll visit a scientist conducting a unique experiment on high potency canvas out of a band in Colorado\nAnd we'll look at why candidates can be addictive for some and who might be most at risk we as a country are turning over a green cannabis leaf and courts in court today hears to explore the science behind\n[noise]\nYou're going to hear from a lot of scientists on today's show but since there's so much to know about what we don't know about cannabis we decided to recruit some special help as well\nDr Martin where it was one of Canada's leading voices on cannabis science\nDr where it's a pleasure to have you on the show to help guide us through all the questions we're going to explore today thank you for having me now you've studied cannabis as a professor of medicine at McGill University and you were vice chair of the federal task force advising the government on cannabis legislation\nAnd most recently you moved into industry as chief medical officer for a licensed cannabis producer canopy growth corporation\nSo I'm guessing you know as much as almost anyone about cannabis\nSo my first question for you is this why are there are so many unanswered questions about cannabis\nMay sound obvious but if you're going to study the effects of kind of some people you have to give it to people and this is very challenging when\nThe drug is prohibited it makes it very difficult for growers or producers to develop supply to test it and then of course we have to have special licenses from everybody involved in this study from the pharmacist or the nurses to the patients myself my entire team had to have special licenses to be able to handle the product\nWhen people smoke or fate or ingested they also receive can happen always other than teach seeing CBD and lots of ... and ... are found throughout the plant kingdom they're generally viola tile so you know you'll smell them when you get close to the planter you when you damage the plant\nAnd so cannabis makes a mixture of different ...\nThat given these distinct odor so that kind of ... smell of\nOf candidates that you can smell you know if you walk into a dispensary or what have you that's due to the ... it's not due to the cabinet it's we're actually not smelling THC were smelling the Europeans and Americans are limited what kind of miss the sensory so if you go into a dispensary in Vancouver

of thing\nYeah so for ... lab in collaboration with a with a friend and colleague did a study of this where we sampled\nDifferent candidates types or a stranger about a lot of options I mean we just got a nice new city ... believed to really had any really nice break taste to it and when we dug into this concept of ... that we actually recorded from the people that we ended up being the samples from\nA measure of how much in the car or how much like the percentage ancestry as we called it\nUm for each of those samples so you know some plants would be said to be a hundred percent ... and others would be fifty fifty into a city that others would be you know eighty percent ...\nThe question we asked was was there a correlation between the reported ancestry so what the grower or the seed company said about that plant and what the Gino type told us in terms of the relationships\nAnd we we found it really a moderate correlation between the report it ancestry\nAnd that you know type which meant to us that there was not a very good correlation that the the actual ability to discern something would be in the ... based on the label alone wasn't very high and so I personally look at the in the city the designation\nWith a grain of salt and I I don't think there's a lot of scientific evidence to back it\nSo we're going to step into an ...\nThis is purple Kush so purple Kush is

there's a disconnect between what we will we see the physical appearance with a plan that cuts\nThe street that produces those effects\nHold on another flight from our collection that has very narrow leaflets quite an open physical habitats the branches are quite sort of widely spaced and that would be what in general though I haven't I don't put a lot of freedoms in this in a team of

there's there's differences in in what happens when you consume different types of cannabis and those differences are probably due to\nDifferent levels of ... but when we look at the genetics and the

cofounder of ...\n[noise]\n\nNow the advice you get into cannabis dispense re might not just be about the kinds of high you can get from different cannabis varieties there might also be suggestions about which varieties might be better for pain relief reducing anxiety or for sleeping problems\nWe've had years of people using legal medical marijuana for therapeutic purposes and this has led many people to focus on what some think is the ingredient in cannabis that has the most medicinal potential it's called can dial often referred to as CBD for short\nThere's been a lot of hype over CBD lately and we're starting to see it in medically focus products not just something to smoker vape but in oils are creams that are meant to be applied topic late so let's bring back Dr Martin where to help us get at just how much of this has good scientific backing\nDoctor where what does the science say about CBD and how effective it is and it's a therapeutic drug\nThe science of CBD is in its infancy right now it's it's a substance that's been around for a long time the Brazilian research community were first looking at CBD for epilepsy in the Nineteen eighties or for anxiety disorders it's been administered in humans in clinical trials for a number of years\nBut it's only recently that we've begun to explore it therapeutically and this is most illustrated by the use of can dial for childhood epilepsy\nWere not reached a point where CBD as an approved medicine by the U.S food and Drug Administration will be seeing these scheduled and it's now available medicine\nThis increase in CBD and this interest in CBD has fuels an enormous interest because it is considered to be the non psychoactive cannot annoyed\nIt's sort of cannabis without the high if you like and so this is an enormous appeal not only to patients and people who are looking for a way to use cannabis or looking to treat different symptoms\nBut also to lawmakers who can pass laws that allow cannabis but only high CBD candidates this has given rise to a tremendous excitement and then as with many other drugs do sure it's received a lot of hype people have been now discovering the potential for CBD the problem\nAnd any pure pharmaceutical grade form for studies and so the science is now trying to catch up but it's fascinating to hear people tell us what they're experiencing when they use CBD assuming they're getting access to a regulated product that we know what's in it\nIt will be very important to listen to these experiences and follow that up with confirmatory research\nCannabis as a notoriously inconsistent as a plants were sent meant for researchers like use you try to study it\nWell we have to find people and I'm cultivation systems and frameworks where we can actually standardize that production this has been a challenge from a botanical standpoint until relatively recently where\nWe now know that there are systems and mechanisms to cultivate kind of is under tightly controlled circumstances\nMore slowly by smoking flour so yeah it's\nIt's nice it's sort of in your [noise]\nSo Dr where what are your concerns around the use of these high potency products\nWill impart the concerns are simply that we don't have access to them to be able to identify what the effects are if we can only assume that when they're that concentrated you are taking a very large quantity of the drug THC in particular I'm In a very short space of time\nDoes that change the effect does that change the risk profile we don't really know think shooting alcohol in a shot versus drinking a ... a cold beer slowly over the course of an hour different effect different potential impact we need to understand these better\nThank you Dr where Canada is of course not the first jurisdiction to legalize cannabis the state of Colorado famously was a pioneer\nWhich creates a strange legal tension because of the u._s. cannabis is still an illegal drug under federal law this makes life complicated for American researchers studying cannabis they have to do a delicate dance around federal regulations\nSo one research group in Colorado is taking a unique approach to learn more about how these highly concentrated products effect users [noise]\nThey've converted a van into allowed to take their cannabis research on the road\nMy name is Dr send them ended well an assistant professor at the Institute of cognitive science at the University of Colorado Boulder we're in a pretty unique situation in Colorado in that we have\nLegal recreational and Medicinal Cannabis in our state so as an adult and my state I could legally purchased a range of wide range of kind of its products are potency is all the way up to at times Ninety or Ninety five percent THC but as a researcher in my state\nI have to comply with federal law in terms of the candidates that I could bring into my lab to test in terms of the effects on people or analyze in terms of the plant content in order to actually research their products that people use in everyday life\nWe can't bring the product into the lab we have to take the lab to the people\nWe shouldn't freelance radio producer dengue\nI'm going to walk him out to the band they should be ready or if it's a white van\nDoes have the University of Colorado logo on it [noise]\nThey did they I'm Leah Leah ... nice to see you guys well that is a tribute tapestry\nSo that mobile labs really critical for that acute time point what happens immediately after somebody uses\nAnd so the steps were taking to collect the data even though unusual\nWe think will provide some very helpful and critical information for a public health [noise]\nSo one of the things we're testing is whether or not people change their patterns of youth so when they're using higher potency products do they temper or modulate their use\nAnd ultimately result in the same level of impairment as as these lower potency products or do these high potency products represent a unique level of intoxication where people are are much more impaired are much more intoxicated another piece that\nHappens is the question of how the brain and body adapts overtime to hire potency products and so if people are continually exposed to much higher forms of teach C do they end up just needing more THC in order to experience any intoxication or potential medical benefits that they're using for [noise]\nUm so what else have you do is I Want you to blow into the white plastic mouthpiece until you hear a click and they feel like you're running out of breath and there are a couple of events on the back so just try not to block those with your hand so we start every mobile labs session with a breathalyzer [noise]\nAnd that is to ensure that there is no alcohol that may compromise our motor control or cognitive measures\nAnd move on to the blood draw\nAnd so we drop blood and were able to get a very acute measure of their ... exposure [noise]\n... how much\nTHC is in their blood so we kind of get a peak measure as well as at a later measure of that in terms of their full THC exposure\nThen we also have a a balance task that we do with participants so\nSandoval so and so we have things like motor control battery where people perform reaction time test they perform balanced tasks they performed motor coordination tasks\nYou're going to that piece of paper with your eyes open for thirty seconds once you feel a tap from me they'll close your eyes and do that for thirty seconds\nAnd so we look at both immediately after use as well as a re evaluation about an hour later to see if any impairments are recovered\nOvertime All right we could go ahead and start again in three two\nOne with your eyes open\nUp a pig and\nWe also have a set of cognitive tests that assess working memory or things like sustained attention how long you can focus on that particular task particularly with distraction and different forms of a recall or memory that may be impaired under the influence of cannabis\nSo the next one will do is we'll play a couple of games on the eye pad\nFor these sort of university sanctioned games\nSo they're actually from the national Institute of health so their\nStandard across\nDifferent studies I Want to use it\nAll right so in this past year going to see a role of arrows that are going to be pointing different ways so you should always choose the button that matches the direction of the middle arrow so just go as fast as you can\nBreak or data are still very pulmonary but we are noticing that people using a range of potency use for concentrate so maybe all the way from Seventy to Ninety percent that within that range people seem to\nModulate up to a very similar levels so their blood intoxication levels are higher than they would be with flour but they don't differ across the sort of range of potency so it does seem like once you get to a very high potency products\nPeople are using sort of the right amounts for them to get to a certain intoxication level that it doesn't matter whether it's Seventy percent or Ninety percent for our data in terms of how impaired they are are having to do that\nAlso seeing a sort of a tolerance of facts that in these users of have high potency concentrates their impairments at least acutely does not look a lot different than people who are using sort of typical potency flower products however their blood exposure is much higher\nSo we're getting lead levels that are higher than I've really seen in the literature in terms of their teach the intoxication level\nAnd so that raises a concern as to what their exposure is like over time in terms of teach see how their brain and body are adapting to this very acute first and the very high level of teach the exposure\nAnd what might happen if they try to cut back on some of our data suggests possibly higher dependents or problem use\nMore abuse liability or clinical dependence is why it's head for users that these types of products [noise]\nOne of the things we absolutely need to think about this we embark on the great Canadian guns experiment is that we're legalizing a psychoactive drug\nAnd while we're long past the days when we feared reefer madness that doesn't mean pot is completely innocent as with any drug it'll have risks and costs compared to our other favorite recreational drug alcohol [noise] so we need to understand the risks of cannabis use\nAnd the first risk that comes to many people's minds is the risk of addiction so let's go back to work in the studio Canada science expert Dr Mark where\nNow Dr where you talked to his earlier about the things we know and don't know about the effects of cannabis on the neurobiology of the brain so what do we know about this question of Canada is an addiction for recreational users\n[noise] I think given the opportunity of legalizing in regulating kind of is coming up we will have a better idea of this question and it's an important one how likely is it that somebody using cannabis will have a problem with its use\nThe currently bandied about statistics suggest that of regular candidates uses about ten percent meet criteria of cannabis use dependence which means that they spend a lot of time thinking about it they spend a lot of their time trying to get it\nAnd it may affect adversely their social and work functions insulin\nThanks Dr where\nTo get a better picture of this we'd like to introduce you to someone's struggling with this problem we've withheld his name to protect his privacy
