[noise]\n\nHi I'm Bob McDonald I Love to sleep and I never get enough of it like many of you I suspect modern society seems to conspire against us getting enough rest\nWill today you might just learn a little about how to improve your sleep from a man who cannot control his own because he has narcolepsy\nOn the most well set sleep deprived posts and there is what appears to be part of it isn't really as just sleeping all the wrong times really really was asleep\nAnd do bird song sound really sincere to you it might be because of where the sound starts\nBird you know not quite literally on these things from near the heart\nAlso making a molehill into a mountain on a neutron star\nOr if the neutron star crossed is strong you can make mountains on it they could be a few inches or tens of centimeters plus giants\nMentor raise filter feeding skills might inspired\nAnd then Rick a shape back up and away from the filter all this in more today on courts in parks [noise]\n\n\nMost of us have experienced moments when we've nearly or maybe completely fallen asleep when we didn't mean to\nMaybe it was a university lecturer on a hot day when I started to slide close\nPerhaps it was during the school concert in a stuffy gym as you waited through interminable performances for your child's perfect moment to shine or perhaps you started to not off on a highway Dr coming alerts and start terrorists you drifted off onto the shoulder of the road [noise]\nWell thankfully for most of us this is a rare occurrence but what if this was your life a constant battle against unconscious nist that's fighting to swallow you\nThat's how Henry Nichols lives Mr Nichols UK based science writer has narcolepsy and in his new book sleepy had the neural science of a good night's rest he applies his investigative skills to understanding his narcolepsy\nAlong the way to get some important insights that might help the rest of us sleep a little better but soon ECOWAS welcome to courts in court\nThank you very much for having me now I get them kind of imagine or ... but I'm probably got it wrong so can you give me a sense of what the experience is light for you and your life\nI think most people will have that melting off feeding\nAnd then you've got to multiply it by ten hundred um it's just insane weight that you fight with for a little bit and the fighting is completely ... there is any one outcome ever you lose to sleep\nIs is it truly random just comes along at any time\nFor some people it is quite random so they have water cooled sleep attacks and that is quite alarming where you have absolutely no warning\nFor me there is to morning and it it tends to lay on too predictable things that we would all be familiar with like getting browse the in the in the afternoons yourself to lunch and when it comes to knock them see that's that's just specially strong it's like I'm starting to think\nAre obviously all of this is you go to get through the don't say that I think when people stop paying attention to their sleep and their sleep disorders such as they are\nAnd they go to the doctors and it becomes a common thing that does is we'll\nHave to get up to speed and pay more attention to it [noise]\nWell you also point out that a common things like before you go to sleep very you know staying away from alcohol or drugs or even looking at your devices and screen time things like that that they've they've also help you and ...\nThis is kind of embarrassing so off yes [laughter] I'm embarrassed that it's in a twin ... books is to figure it out but like I said narcolepsy can seems units can seems my\nCourse I'm a human and I'm you know susceptible to other sleep disorders why not\nAnd they they might be that I Can't do anything to repair the knock up see I Can't get those cells back I Can't get near transmitted back\nBut they might be other sleep disorders hiding in the periphery that I have been ... will not let see that stuff I can do about like my snoring or lose waste a little bit I might sleep better\nReally pay attention to my dies\nIs boring people but you know cut back on alcohol cut back don't drink coffee to try and keep your white lights in the day because you're not going to sleep at night so obvious just drink coffee off the midday you'll state bass I Try not to smoke all these sorts of things so you've got to do a lot since all the basics sleep hygiene stuff\nBut really important thing is the sleep stability said really trying to\nGo to bed at the same time each day and wake up at the same time each day even at the weekends not much of a lie and um the boat he will appreciate that regularity it starts to pick up on that path and I'm\nOne of the really key revelations means light\nWe as a society really didn't pay any attention to our consumption of light especially in in the\nHours off the darkness and we're just throwing off official lights and bright tell us official lights any disease that contain high levels of blue wave lengths to which the brain is extremely sensitive and every very confusing message\nUm ... effects would be telling your brain that it the ... up\nAnd said people than specially I think teenagers using these devices laws and late at night crucially um and then not able to get to sleep when that buddies much of being able to so now they're going to sleep at midnight one that they still have to get up to school so you end up\nReally unless we pay ... is a jewel attention to\nScreen time the amount of time children spend but also when they're spending it uh is is important\nYou know it's a rare sleep disorder but we know\nPeople who are not at the end of the sleep disorders really appreciate sleep like I think a lot of people take it for granted so I think we need to talk to a cop and speak up about the importance of sleep so that maybe we could get a place where society generally took it much more seriously and was much more healthy\nNichols is a science writer living in London england his new book is called sleepy had the neural science of a good night's rest\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\nBut since the dawn of course the fabulous performance of bird songs filling the air on find mornings around the world don't have a bird watchers will probably be able to tell you which birds are making those calls but even if you can't you probably still enjoy it\nBird song is the stuff of poetry romance even national identity after all what's more Canadian than this [noise]\n\n\nBut you want to know something interesting bird song is actually pretty weird because birds make sounds differently from just about every other animal you can think of\nIn fact a new study suggests that the Oregon the birds use to make vocal sounds is actually unique and the animal kingdom and evolutionary innovation that only burns possess\nThat's all according to paleontologist Julia Clarke from the ... school of geosciences at the University of Texas in Austin\nDr Clark welcome to courts in court Oh thank you so much such a pleasure to be here okay now when it comes to making sound I have a pretty good idea of how we do it we have a voice box or a larynx and it's got these little sort of like elastic bans in it that vibrate is er passes through them so how'd the birds do it well\nThere's some similarities but human um found making but in a radically different place because our ... our down on you know it didn't basically are upper throat or the back of our mouth so\nThe properties of those rubber band like structures to produce downed are similar things that are present in birds but what birds do is truly remarkable they move\nThose down towards the I'm essentially deep into the chat they really do think from the heart [laughter]\nI mean I think it's a I think it's a nice way to think about it because even veteran bird watchers might not be aware of where actually the sound is pretty because you can often see birds moving their beaks or um heads wild well vocalizing but that actually isn't wears down it's coming from\nWhere where is it coming from what's the Oregon so\nIt is I'm actually if you think of our wind pipe going deep into our chest and then branching to go to the lungs the bird vocal Oregon is right where or when the windpipe branches to go ... towards the lungs but it's not just the two blanketed than us it has all these new structures and it\nWill take me through that how does this hearings actually make sound\nWell the statistics of the sound of dump production or not that the similar in that you do have like a flexible or floppy vocal foods that are going to be located in the new place and there's a whole bunch of muscles that are around the structures so you know we know from like\nBirds that have simpler searing says maybe only have two muscles that are are kind of stabilizing the earrings and\nKind of influencing sound production but in things like songbirds you can have a ton of muscles so these are very complex structures and the muscles themselves are among the fastest ever described in a in an animal\nSo how unusual is the structure of the shootings in the animal kingdom\nWell it's kind of crazy unusual I mean if we think about it like there's lots of different kind of\nOur group vertebrate that makes down there are our code\nThat produce down in uh larynx we produce down in ... whales do as well um so you can think of all these disparate kinds of animals that all use the length based on sort [noise]\nSo what's really bizarre to saying why within dinosaurs did this completely new structure that's not really ... if not derived from a wearing it appears to be a new combination of structures and and developmental programs that are implemented deep in the chest\nTo make something that can also produce down and it um yeah it's kind of bizarre\nWell you mentioned going back to the dinosaurs was what's the connection there\nBirds are kind of dinosaur where with in that group we had all these other things that are are mostly extinct today that are not birds that are things like\nState as thorough and I'm over raptor and velociraptor and T rex right those are all dinosaurs along with birds\nSo we know that the structure of the change would have arisen some time with in the branching of all of the other dinosaurs and what we've been trying to figure out is what might have led to that change and when that change might have occurred\nOregon to make sound so does that mean that does this horse had Larry ... and and like this this came along as a new evolutionary experiment\nWell that's what this new paper is really about um [noise]\nThere are two potential scenarios that occurred within dinosaur yeah most likely dinosaurs it could have happened slightly earlier in that lineage where terrorists George branch off but we think it occurred within dinosaur ya\nAnd the two scenarios or that you have a ... face down or that is in its normal position like we see in the closest relatives to to this group ... billion they produce a variety of noise is using their larynx\nAnd you have ... based on trust it's fully functional it gets lost for some reason and in New Oregon developed that would involve presumably a quiet period where at least vocal sound production would not be occurring\nThe second scenario is that you have co president of two vocal Oregon in radically different places in a radically different origins and this is a kind of biological novelty that is actually pretty rare in the history of life where you have\nWhat they're inside are made of and how squishy they are and they are the densest thing this side of a black holes event horizon so all four forces need to be put together to understand them and we don't have a unified theory of physics yet and I think\nIn a way neutron stars might be the the observation of key to linking these not now but maybe sometime in the future [noise]\nSubject capital thank you very much for your time it was a pleasure to be here thank you for having to Bob\nDr Matthew Kaplan is an astrophysicist at McGill University is research was published in physical review letters [noise]\n\n\n\n\nOf the paradoxes of life in the ocean is that the biggest predators eat the tiniest pray the largest whale sharks and rays eat soup plankton almost in visibly small crustaceans and fish larvae\nAnd they do it by filter feeding ingesting vast quantities of water and separating out the tasty little creatures from it [noise]\nJust feeding strategy is clearly successful it's allowed filter feeders to become some of the largest creatures on earth\nAnd that also means that the way they do it might be worth copying that's what's inspired Dr Jim strolls or in his words with men to raise\nIt turns out these giant creatures with wing spans of up to six meters filter food from the water in a uniquely efficient way and he thinks it could inspire a revolution in filtering technology for things like water pollution that we desperately need\nDr ... there is an assistant professor of integrative biology at the Oregon State university's College of science I welcome to corks in court\nKnown for a while that a ... for a filter feeders\nA boat when we started to look at the filtering apparatus we hit a bit of a puzzle it doesn't look like a standard shelter\nIf you look at a typical ... felt a lot of them are just to play with a large number of holes in it so that uh any particles larger than the holes get a stock in those holes and then filtered out\nBut when you look at the filtering apparatus of ... what you'll find is that it's comprised of a larger re a intricately shaped when white clubs\nAnd so looking at that structure we really started to wonder how is this thing working and how are these animals able to filter out these open to\nSee movies of a man to raise and they they look like these big bats in the ocean was wings flapping in their mouth is a huge oval water coming is how\nThey actually eat well how does the water generally go through their body\nSo are meant to swim with our mouths open and they bring in huge volumes of water into their mouth it's hundreds of leaders of water per second the water passage essentially through the respiratory tract so in through the mouth and that out through the ... ... and where are the ... the lights are on the underside of their body\nAnd how small are the particles of food that they're reading uh they range in size but anywhere from say a grain of sand to a grain of rice in size\nSo how did you go about studying how they're actually filtering that water to get the food at\nWhat are we did was we measured the morphology of the shelter and apparatus and then we created a plastic model and then put that into a full tank where we could observe the flow patterns that developed around the apparatus and measure how particles interacted with the shelter\nWell what does the maturation filter actually look like when you get close to it\nIt's almost a ... pattern you can think of it like a vertical lines you have an array of plates one after the other water passes from the one plate to the next to the next to the next ah and then it passes out through the guilt flips\nOkay that's water now how is the food separated from their\nWell what's interesting is that the solid particles interact very differently with the er filtering apparatus they initially followed the water\nUm ... what we found was that they were being pushed away from the filtering apparatus how what we found was that the solid particles were being carried with the water but\nThe filter structures and then Rick or shape back up and away from the filter\nSo that water use are able to pass relatively easily through the filtering apparatus but solid particles are plankton are getting pushed away and then bouncing along the surface of the filtering apparatus before ultimately being swallowed by the animal\nOh I see so the the water's going through these these places you're talking about but the food particles are separated they don't actually go through the filter they go over the top of it\nYeah they go over the top of it but uh they're not trapped on the surface of the shelter instead they bounce along the surface or before ultimately beans followed by the animal and our digest it\nIt's amazing that you talked about little ... I think of a vortex like a a little tornado or is that what's happening there\nUh yeah there's little swirling Eddie's that are trapped between the filter loves a and those that little eddies um caused the ah the solid particles to hit the filter logs and then ... away\nNow if the manager ray is doing this in its in its mouth or does it have to be careful how how fast it swims or control that slow in some way\n[noise] uh yeah because uh the flow over that's held during apparatus is really important for setting that does flow patterns in that dynamic and said if the animal swims too slowly than the border to seize that don't develop\nA and if the animal swims too quickly than we think that the flow becomes too turbulent and that the filter also doesn't function effectively and so we think that the animal controlling swimming speed is an important part in a it's a function\n[laughter] so how does this filter systems that demands a re is using compare to filters that we use in our technology\nWell it's very different because in a typical ... felt there you have this sheet of holes or if you think of a\nA kitchen call under that you would use to string pasta or a coffee solitaire and as the particles are trapped on the surface of the filter because they can't pass through the poorest\nNow the disadvantage with that is that as the particles are trapped on the surface they will accumulate and accumulate a until they reach a point that water is no longer able to go through and the filter becomes less efficient\nWhat's interesting when we look at the mantle re shelter is that the particles are bouncing over the surface of the filter and so\nFilter so even after a long periods of time the filter stays clean and continues to operate at high ...\nWow so the ... raised don't have to clean and replaced their filters like we do with our coffee\nNo we really don't see ... stopped the clean air filter\n[laughter] so what lessons could we take from this to adapt to our technology\nWell that's what we're really interested in exploring now\nAh we're interested in seeing whether or not these principles can be applied to solve some of the engineering challenges that we face so one of the areas that we've been thinking about is and waste water treatment\nA micro plastics are an important and an emerging threat and so we have been interested in exploring whether or not these principles can be applied to improving wastewater treatment process these\nOh so we could catch micro plastics and prevent them from getting in the ocean\nYet we're interested in exploring whether or not does not to potential application\nBut well it's just amazing we think we're so clever but there's usually a case where nature does it better than we do\nThat's why these animals had been traverse in the oceans for thirty million years there's plenty we can learn from the\nDr ... thank you very much for your time I I guess Dr Jim stroller is an assistant professor of integrative biology and the Oregon State university's College of science [noise]\nDon't hide it flash of copper taunting him [noise]\nAnd you've got a flash with Congress\nYes there's a lot wrong with that ad from way back in Nineteen eighty but let's just focus on UV exposure and the Taliban that sun protection maybe the last thing on your mind right now as we enter the fall season here in Canada but it's still important you can certainly get a sunburn on a sunny fall day [noise]\nThe thing is though as winter sets in we might actually want more sun exposure UV exposure triggers our skin to produce vitamin D\nWhich can affect the range of things from bone health to immune function to seasonal depression so when it comes to UV it's pretty hard to draw the line between enough and too much\nBut Australian researcher Dr ... pool bond soul thinks he may have a solution to that question he's developed a simple wristband that can tell you how much ...", "show_name": "Quirks and Quarks", "year": "2018", "city": "Billings", "day": "02"}
