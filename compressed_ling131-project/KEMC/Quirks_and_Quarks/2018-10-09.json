[noise]\nThe Nobel Prizes were awarded this week and for the second time and only three years a Canadian physicist has been awarded a share of the prize\nDr Donna Strickland was honored for her work to quote the Nobel Committee for the generation of high intensity ultra short optical pulses\nThe technique she and Gerard mood developed to create super concentrated bursts of laser light has proved enormously important for everything from laser eye surgery to industrial laser cutting it's also proved to be a useful tool in scientific research which is the work that she continues to pursue today\nDr Strickland is in the department of physics and astronomy at the University of Waterloo Dr Strickland congratulations on the prize and welcome to court some quirks thank you very much now you've had a little time for the news to settle into how are you feeling at this point\nUh it's still overwhelming and I'm Still sort of tired from it [laughter]\nWell I understand or when you got the call from Stockholm you actually hung up on them\nWhile they asked me that they said it was a very important call in that I should stay on the line but I stayed on the line for full Fifteen minutes and then thought either this is the cruelest prank or something was wrong so I I hung up and then I got on my email and they there was a message to call back [laughter]\nYour prize winning weren't ... to your ph D research um so how did you become interested in laser research in the first place\nI'd just as a high school students McMaster University had an engineering physics program\nAnd I thought that was sort of I couldn't decide between physics and engineering so I thought that walk the line for me and inside that they had a program for lasers in electronics and I just thought that was really sounded says so cruel so much fun I thought that would be something to do\nI I can tell you that what my mother would say he's no longer life that she when she was she would say that I I was taken to the Ontario science center at the young child\nAnd my dad was electrical engineer there was a laser there at the time and he's he's supposedly set to me but I don't remember this Donna lasers are the way the future you want to see this\nThe sorting hat in the enormously popular Harry Potter books and movies was a remarkable magical device you could look into the minds of students and determine their strengths and characters and we're up their magical schools they might thrive\nThat probably wasn't the inspiration for our next guest research but there are some interesting similarities doctor a ruined the money has developed a new technology to evaluate the skills of aspiring surgical residents he does it using a kind of ...\nAnd it does look into the brains are those wearing it but it's not magical it's a high too\nThis it seems to be the best way to test whether surgeons in training or good enough to be let loose on the patient population at large Dr no money develop this idea for his PHD and biomedical engineering at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Hi welcome to court some quirks\nThank you very much thanks for having me\nHow or surgeons generally tested now\nBasically there's a set of training tasks that are let's say residents in the journal general surgery population would have to complete in order to become board certified\nAnd what we found is that there may be a lot of novices and experts that unfortunately share similar scores but may not have actually\nDevelop the motor skills required a to translate that into the operating room\n... so it was the old technique that a an expert would just watch a novice and say hey I'm ... and and give them a score\nA that's right you know there's a human ... subjectivity that's incorporated into these metrics\nSo why did you think that using brain imaging would improve this current system of testing\nSurgical skills are just like any motor skills really requires consistent practice and consolidation of these motor skills in your cortex\nIf you have that competency uh for fine motor skills you're going to have very specific activation in the brain that correlate to that fine motor skills activity [noise]\nSo how do you measure brain activity\nWe measure brain activity or using a technique called functional near infrared spectroscopy\nWhat we're doing is essentially tuning a very specific laser to shine infrared light into the brain and depending on how that light scatter as we're able to detect a lot of different interesting metrics or such as hemoglobin concentration\nAs a indirect way to measure brain activity a and the cool thing about this approach is it's real time non invasive and it's relatively easy to conduct especially in a conducive environment or such as a training environment for surgeons\nWait a minute you're ... you're saying it's noninvasive but you're shining laser light into the brain\nYou're you're absolutely right um it's it's just as a invasive is shining a flashlight on somebody's scout\n... what what does the person to have on their head\nReally uh it's just stay an elastic cap and that cat has just to set a probes that we're shining very tiny bits of infrared light a directly\nThe laser light into their brain measuring their brain activity what did you see in your experiment\nWe saw that there's three specific regions that are highly correlated to motor skills and they have very different activation between an expert at a novice these three regions are the primary motor cortex uh the supplementary motor area and the ... cortex\nExperts for example have very high activation in the primary motor cortex as opposed to novices who have very high activation within the frontal cortex\nAnd these are important indicators of not just motor skills are but also expertise and so we use these regions and were able to differentiate whether they fall into the novice category or the expert category\nWill will take me through that why would there be a different center motor the motor cortex obviously is what we used a controller hands correct yep that is correct All right so what's going on in the prefrontal cortex\nSo the prefrontal cortex it's basically the region where you utilized to actually think about the procedure or that you're performing for the first time\nSo I'll give you an example let's say you're driving and you're learning how to drive and your lane changing on a highway you're heavily utilizing your prefrontal cortex during the initial stages of learning that\nAnd as you've been driving for years or even decades it becomes an automatic process you're no longer actively determining or thinking every processed and every step of lane changing onto highway becomes automatic\nAnd that's where you no longer start to see activation in the prefrontal cortex but instead in the motor cortex the primary motor cortex\nAll I see a whereas the the old pros they're just doing it automatically they're doing it automatically you're absolutely right so now that you've seen this difference in the brain activity between the novice and the experts surgeon how does your test compared to the current method of testing surgeons\nWhat we found is that if we use the consistent and it already existing metrics there's roughly a forty percent chance that that resident as actually fall asleep you know past or has been classified as an expert\nAnd so with our approach if we say let's take a look at what's happening in the brain with an accuracy of Ninety five Ninety six percent will be able to tell you whether you have actually mastered that motor skills\nWow that's amazing so even though somebody might look good on the surgical table you say well I can see in your brain you're not really as good as you say\nTo exactly right and that's why\nSays seeing surgical skill competency uh and the big thing is that we want to make sure we always ate surgeons in their training and how they're performing these procedures 'em and you know we really think this is the way forward\nWhat to surgeons think about being tested by machine rather than another surgeon\nWell as expected you know if we've got some embezzling feelings a lot of them are on board you know we have had depositions come up to us saying that this is fantastic we think that this is going to be very important for assessing training competency\nI'm at the flipside we've also had many surgeons that are incredibly skeptical and they say you know what how dare you say that you know a machine can tell me a if I'm Better or not\nThat well how could this technique can be used in other fields of surgery\nI think the biggest impact is right now we've shown that this is a clear case for a training\nI think one of the area that you know this may impact is basically measure motor skills competency near the latter years of a surgeon or are there objective metrics that we can determine for retirement\nSo I I really think this will be an a solid approach to be able to objectively determine motor skills drop off a centrally\nSucked into money thank you very much for your time\nThank you very much Bob thanks for having a\nDoctor a ruined the money is a neural and data scientist his research was published in the journal science advances [noise]\nThis morning all be just hearing well ... ... close to swimming including this one where the shark attack occurred as officials trying to figure out just what kind of shark it was that young man's life\nIt's remarkably rare but every once in awhile the jaws nightmare comes true last month a paddle border was attacked by what is thought to be in a great white shark in the waters off Cape Cod Massachusetts [noise]\nUnfortunately he died of his injuries another well publicized attack occurred just a few weeks before that [noise]\nThat white sharks don't normally feed on humans very rarely they will bite us defensively or after mistaking a human for prey like a seal or possibly even just out of curiosity still those attacks are a huge cause for concern among surf\nWater when potentially dangerous sharks are around the problem is how do you know sharks are stealthy and off and all we have to rely on for warning is the sharp pie of a lifeguard watching for the un and the water\nWell Dr Kevin ... thinks she might have a better way rather than trying to spot a whole shark he's testing for miniscule traces of shark in the water\nDr ... marine biologist with the United States Geological survey at the University of California Santa Barbara Dr laughing to welcome to courts in courts thanks very much Bob\nFirst of all how surprising were these recent shark attacks on the east coast to you\nWell we have been seeing 'em increased supports the white sharks certainly where I live in California and other places around the world and and in part due to restrictions on fishing but also do the increases in their natural pray populations the seals and sea lions that the large adults feed on\nAnd so we do get a tax they happen infrequently and in fact your risk of being attacked by a shark in the ocean is really really low um what surprised me most frankly was that it was a fatal attack because most white shark attacks are not fatal\n[noise] so how then or are you planning to look for traces of sharks in the water\nThat we're receiving from the store and that's what happens when the planet passes if there's a moon there we expect the moon of course to to block out a little bit of light as well\nSo we initially solve this a signal when the Kepler data it looked tantalizing but it was not really enough to claim a discovery so we ultimately are asked for time on the Hubble Space telescope to follow this up\nObserve it again and see if we could confirm it when we get a we had that observation in October twenty Seventeen and we've been working on it since then the Hubble observation uh really is is sort of convincing that like I say we're stopping a little shorter claiming into discovery here but we see basically two lines of evidence\nThat suggests that the moon is a good explanation for what we're seeing we see gravitational a perturbations to gravitational hugging on this planet that makes the timing of the planets transits\nMove around a little bit of time sometimes it comes in early sometimes it comes in late or that's what we would expect the moon to do and then the other thing that we see in the Hubble observation is this little dip in the brightness we see the planet transit and then we see a secondary little ... right now where we're attributing to the moon\nWhat will it take to prove that it really is a moon going around another planet around another star\nWell if we could observe this object again when it comes around again in may twenty Nineteen we're hoping to use the Hubble Space telescope for that we've asked for the time we don't yet know if we're going to be awarded bedtime [noise]\nAh we've got this time around a pretty clean prediction for what we ought to expect when we make that observation and so if the moon holds up to that production\nI think we'd be a pretty convinced um but you know ... we have to see this target to this uh event that we're looking at the the planet itself takes Nineteen hours to pass in front of the star\nSo that's a lot of time and if you think about it the earth is rotating so you can't observe this event with any single telescope on the surface of the year\nWould be to stitch together data from multiple instruments and that would be quite challenging so going to space is really what you want to do and there's only really two telescopes that I can think of that or a remotely capable for forming an observation like this the Spitzer Telescope but really a Hubble is is the best game in town\nIf it is proven to be a moon do you get to name it\n[laughter] uh I don't think so I'm afraid of the planet of course already has it has a name kept or sixteen twenty five be the historical convention for naming moons around planets has been to give them a Roman numerals\nSo uh we've taken to a to saying this would be Kepler sixteen twenty five be one\nThat come out you could come up with a better name for that so I don't ... yeah well ...\nAround the office we call it the ... moon [laughter] that businesses okay never moon yeah which is kind of a silly name but I don't think that one that will fly ultimately\nThis is teaching thank you very much\nThank you very much for having me appreciate it\nAlex Gigi is a graduate student in the department of astronomy at Columbia University in New York [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\nI'd like to introduce you to someone\nMy name is Carrie Johnson on thirty eight years old or just about thirty eight and I got diagnosed as being on TALK of the spectrum I thought five years ago\nKelly Johnson lives in Montreal she's a mother with a couple of other jobs to keep her busy as well she's been diagnosed with autism but you can certainly tell she's what some people call high functioning\nThat's not unusual for people with autism they're often enormously productive incapable what is unusual about Kelly Johnson is that she's a woman and she's been diagnosed\nIncreasingly autism researchers are coming to realize that there may be a vast population of women with autism\nWho's disorder hasn't been recognized\nWe'll get into the wine later it may have much to do with autism being perceived as a male disorder ms Johnson wasn't diagnosed with autism\nI Would have panic attacks and what I didn't know was that my anxiety and panic attacks were actually being caused by sensory overload\nUm I didn't realize that I was going into like a note download or having sensory issues and that could be you know I I wasn't very good at regulating I still am to look good at regulating but St ... temperature being aware on getting too hot\nLighting can be very um I guess oppressive is the best way to put it a a lot of noise things like that so I was having symptoms but not knowing what was wrong\nBefore her diagnosis miss Jones who did see various kinds of help she had therapy it didn't work she suffered in confusion and distress\nI just figured it must have been just me because nobody else was having a problem so I figured well I'm Broken there's something wrong with me I couldn't understand why it was so difficult for me I just figured well I'm just beyond a help I'm just I'm Broken\nThe confusion deemed to it in things to someone else's diagnosis\nI sought out diagnosis when they sell 'em after my son was like no I just saw too many similarities in the way that we both kind of behaved um I found that I almost in the we understood hands and what he was going through\nIn ways that don't you know the cat quite be explained by maternal instinct\nThe diagnosis of autism has been life altering for miss Johnson partly because now she's getting the right kind of help\nBut mostly because she now knows who she is\nIt was a relief and absolute relief you know I stopped blaming myself having that self understanding has liberated me because I think a lot of a lot of my my problem was is that I spent a lot of time trying to make my health normal\nAh and realizing now that I can cut myself some slack but I I actually I don't have to do it the same way that other people do\nI feel like I'm living fear I stopped seeing myself is broken it's now I can just see myself as different and understand that that that's OK and have kind of a of pride in that so yes I Do have struggled but I Do have strength because of my brain and that's something I also try to share with my son\nCan be drawn to this one of the lucky ones one of the women whose autism has been recognized but according to Dr Francesca happy a leading autism\nWith autism who's condition is undiagnosed their social deficits struggles with sensory information and behavioral problems\nAre all too frequently mistaken for other modalities or simply ignored a doctor happy thinks it's time we started paying much more attention to this problem doctor happy as a professor of neuroscience at King's College London in England Hi welcome to courts in courts thank you very much\nThough autism is a spectrum disorder or some people are affected more than others so when we talk about women was diagnosed autism what kind of autism are we talking about\nThey typically would be those who have good intellectual functioning for example and they've managed to Moscow camouflage some of that or to them difficulties in different states at least when they're in public well\nWhen did the autism research communities start to suspect that there was a large group of undiagnosed women\nI think the key piece of evidence is that we've been operating with estimate\nOf the male to female ratio being maybe a full five to one and that that high a intellectual ability end of the spectrum maybe ten miles every one female and that being the kind of estimate in the late ...\nBut I'm very recent a review that looked at all of the epidemiological ... up to date\nConcludes that the ratio is probably three to one\nSo that in ... in the estimates so we were using and the accurate uh say good from really good epidemiological studies gives us this stock conclusion that there are thousands of women and girls who are going on diagnosed or misdiagnosed mistreated\nWill take me through this more recent research how did you get a handle on what the real numbers between men and women were\nSo this is that we're such ... headed up by ... and her colleagues and they looked at all of the studies in the ... that have reported the male female ratio\nAnd what they did was look in the different kinds of studies so some of those studies will have um looked at individuals known to clinical educational special services because they already have a diagnosis\nAnd in those cases we get those high on male to female ratios of maybe four or five to one but that other studies that have taken a much more rigorous approach that epidemiologic studies that have gone out into the population they've screened everybody for autistic traits and they've ...", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Quirks and Quarks", "city": "Billings", "day": "09"}
