to be headed to the U.S Supreme Court\nJudging from official announcements and from a procedural vote yesterday Senate Republicans have secured the votes they need to confirm it at is expected to submit to conservative majority on the court\nNPR's Ron Elving joined just run thanks so much for being with us good morning Scott now we can both named conservative justices shooters Stevens black men Kennedy who he issued who joined a liberal and progressive is on the court but uh this confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh could have impact for generations good\nYes we assumed the current lineup of five justices who were appointed by three Republican presidents do named Bush down to by Donald Trump will be around for some time\nAnd this will be the first time that the court has five members were alumni of the federalist society who it's been which has been a growing force in the court for years and a swelling presence on the federal bench it it's lower levels and with the Trump Administration and White House counsel Don McGahn or they have truly come into their own\nMore prominent than ever and us live or the group got started at a couple of law schools in the early Nineteen eighties it was a pushback by students and Google's legal scholars\nAre people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy of a few justices with big ideas about social and political justice\nMembers of the society of indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past two generations\nAsking the question of whether or not the basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution and let's underscore there's nothing remotely secretive about this right\nNot a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party and about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal population\nUm if Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation is the the the combination of of decades of organizing hum are Republicans energized to get out to the polls about a month from now or do many feel mission accomplished\nThere could be both a feeling of accomplishment and a feeling of opportunity to press further and some resentment over the confirmation process and some of the accusations that were raised in the way they were raised against Brett Kavanaugh\nBut midterms are more often driven by anger than satisfaction and right now polls show a lot of women and younger voters are unhappy with Kavanaugh and even many Republican women are unhappy with their party and that could also be a big factor in the midterms\nI'm now it's interesting to me you point to anger and that certainly reflected in in the surveys you mentioned unemployment is at a three point seven percent are historically low about a forty year low a and yet polls say about fifty five percent of citizens in this country believe America is headed in the wrong direction\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from universal pictures presenting the new film first men from Damien ... director of la la land

on a clear path to be confirmed for the Supreme Court\nBut the battle is become a flashpoint following allegations that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Megan McCarthy columnist for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views which we welcome and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh for the court but you also supported uh the pause\nAdvantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] um what's that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes I don't think so I think well I mean yes and no right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes\nOr perhaps not as often as we'd like\nUm I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with as it than looks possible\nThat they should confirm me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote\nYou know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that an investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're missing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the sins of the investigation do its job [noise] I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal and people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true on the other had both of them had testified at length\nAnd you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative by not providing she had basically two pieces of crowds I wasn't aware of the fact because she was well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she had told and sort of two thousand Seventeen to those and they tend to should\nPeople there basically to abuse of cooperation were her therapist notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have another name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes to the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear\nBut the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen\nA book that she couldn't let a church that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support right a judge\nNow the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed\nYou know I think this is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time it is an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible um and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my coverage the whole time there really is there were two talking points in this neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy in being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all\nThat's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for what Kavanaugh's gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless and totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth\nUm it's not the same as being put in a\nJail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ... making the colonel thanks so much thank you [noise]\n[noise] I'm\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from\nThousands of pages of financial documents\nThe president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations is Tim O'Brien he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course is executive editor Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nEasily the head of this one I don't think that's a news though I think the nuts and bolts of that\nAnd his father Fred Trump used a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious impossibly fraudulent to protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so and in wealth\n[noise] to keep it in the family\nTo keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump tasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid\nInheritance and gift taxes or in other words the trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred and instead they they paid around fifty million or so\n... when when Donald represent over the years I've built what I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people\nAnd uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co signed the loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty barren that story so that's another\nImportant theme of the story which is the president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you did you can recognize that maybe people going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\n[noise] yeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump in his siblings they used and appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that that was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and\nA differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it\nAll of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo it mostly may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think really will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pulled himself up by his own bootstraps\nAnd he he earned his living on his own rather than being someone who was born on third base and said he hit a triple which is essentially the story he's been putting out there for a long time\nTim O'Brien a Bloomberg opinion thanks so much thank you Scott\nThis week a report by Bloomberg said the Chinese government operative spotted microchips especially\n\nI'm joyous later with these headlines President Trump has another campaign rally on his scheduled this weekend he's doing Topeka, Kansas tonight this trip there follows the expected final vote this afternoon on Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination\nFor

night five four but Boston at the battle didn't\nYeah they sure did and this is exactly what the series is going to be having seen them since two thousand four when the red Sox to the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down and obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and\nLast night was a battle that I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because this is exactly what these teams are the red Sox have the better starting pitching\nThe Yankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox relief pitching really almost gave it up to ... Yankees had chances in sixth inning bases loaded basis lives in the seventh inning\nAnd if this is what it's going to be for the next four games I think we're in for a classic ...\nA Houston Astros put the crunch on Cleveland seven to two Couric looper a great pitcher got clue or club [laughter] why you like this grows a lot\nI think the Astros a but my\nThe Astros still won a hundred hundred and two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beat you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line up to the best team with the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like\nChampions again even though for a lot of ... that a lot of a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but they're that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they to stretch shut up against the Atlanta Braves and yeah this is\nInteresting because nobody seemed to be any good in the national league this year nobody seemed to really take control let's not forget your cubs who I picked to go to the world series had the best record in the national league on Sunday and they were out of the playoffs by Tuesday night\nAnd you won't forget that but now I'm just saying that it's it's a crazy here and and we're talking about the brewers as well suddenly the brewers got shut out last night so all of a sudden you're starting to see all these teams begin to really play their best baseball\nAnd let's not forget we talk about the champs being champs until you knock them out well the Dodgers have a National League champs they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year losing to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start getting warm\nAt the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you have a problem with it I kinda like what the Milwaukee Brewers are doing and they've got the rocks already on the ropes merit to another and maybe you go to Colorado and things change but I\nI really like Milwaukee and the Dodgers I think this is just going to be great all of it's really good\nFind that we need to mention a twenty games suspension or

they're reacting in there essentially sending the message that Tom Wilson to dirty player it's not just the fact that he had some cars in in drilled them in the head it's also that this is his\nFifth is his fourth suspension and the last hundred and five games so they have concluded that this guy when he gets on the ice is out there to hurt people and one of the things we always talk about with football is the danger but the thing we don't talk about is that hockey is just as dangerous and the guys that come in at a pretty high rate of speed\nAnd when you look at at the suspensions now

mid term election to talk about all of that we've got congressional reporter Kelsey Snell White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe and political reporter Tim Mak everybody hey there right\nSo it's pretty clear by the slimmest of margins Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the Supreme Court Kelsey walk us through when that became crystal clear on friday\nIt became crystal clear within a matter of minutes when Susan Collins the Republican senator from Maine announced on the Senate floor after more than forty minutes of talking\nThat she was going to be supporting ... and then just a few minutes later Joe mentioned the Democrat from West Virginia announced that he would also be supporting cabinet and that brought us to very clearly locked in yes votes\nAnd we're going to circle back to ... in a moment but fifty one forty nine is how that key cloture vote had played out earlier friday or at the time we thought there was still a chance that people could change their mind but but ... was that really a clear moment where it was like okay this looks like it's probably going to happen\nIt did look that way there was a few moments where we were chasing around Senator Tim and I were standing in different hallways different parts of the capital trying to find people like Senator Jeff Flake a Republican of Arizona and counting we mentioned mansion\nTo see if they were going to stick with their votes\nUm flake with a little bit cryptic we didn't really know what was going to happen and then ... and had lunch with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and he came out saying that he felt pretty good about things and from there it seems like we're heading in a direction where the fifty one votes were going to quickly come into place\nTim friday was a really tense day on Capitol Hill it's been a really tense week on Capitol Hill scenes Jeff Flake negotiated this delay this one we\nThe way in which the FBI would we open investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's background there's been a lot of questions about who could eventually get to yes on Brett Kavanaugh we we found the answer on friday but the fact is that there's been a lot of uncertainty and a lot of\nDemonstrations here on Capitol Hill and a lot of lobbying on both sides of this issue\nUs through what race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and a former representative he's been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and serve two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nIt's a race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson sneezing in in ... Scott and I had multiple Democrats tell me\nIn terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman carrying yes wise I actually had met her before during the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump She told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor but you know she she sort of has had this\nLittle bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at risk up in the beginning but who governor for the election\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had heard she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's had a change of heart in major part she says because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane ...\nHe's shown me he's working from ... to his show me what he'd do\nAn awesome but can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote isn't Florida\nYet still um you know activists will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now and the population has really grown and in part it's actually grown wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and so some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of bill Nelson's visibility within this community\nHave said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this communities power within the electorate\nYou know when you're talking about the Puerto Rican community Rick Scott\nYou know she broke up very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with people's Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times\nSo this was a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week ... you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate I should point out was being hosted by the local Telemundo station that was broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been seeing sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there\nThere were a couple of major issues that came up\nHealth care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country Bill Nelson really hit Rick Scott specifically on the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of Floridians\nThe other issue that came up a lot was immigration and Bill Nelson basically accuses Rick Scott as being this hardliner on immigration\nYou know on the other side Rick Scott is saying\nIs that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trends but similar voters throughout the country\nThat is really the case here in Florida as well because this is not the only statewide race and and we've seen that that other races are having an impact on the Senate race absolutely in fact I had one Republican\nOperative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls\nOr he's lead in the last four polls for example very very narrowly in within the margin of error but that's a shift the reason for that they said is the energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy is and\nWas yelling at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line right and and since it's Florida I think we can be pretty confident that are probably stay an arrow race between now and election day this is one of the most\nFifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country are at the ... come out to narrow thanks so much You're welcome and ... thank you

the mid term elections in so far this year there's been a lot of talk about it being the year of the woman but in the wake of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight a lot of Republicans suddenly talking about a backlash to on the blood\nDrenched jihad against this innocent man there's good and decent man\nWe're finding now that the ... if you were a white male\nShow male voters are suddenly energize\nBecause I think it could easily as well turn out to the ear of the man who feel like a target as on their back all the time and it's not fair\nAnd it may have a lot to do with calls from President Trump saying the real victim of the me too movement is innocent men\nA person who had never met said that I just things that were horrible and they're firing me from my job I don't know what to do\nMom what do I do what do I do mom\nIs this backlash real and what does it mean for the four hundred and thirty five house seats and thirty five Senate seats up for grabs in the next few weeks we've got White House correspondent Tamara Keith political correspondent Asma Khalid\nAnd political editor Domenico Montanaro here to sort this all out hey everybody hey hey there how's it going to ... we saw a shift in all of this over the last few weeks especially when it came to how President Trump talked about this you saw President Trump act very timid lead toward\nChristine Blasey Ford in part because the White House wasn't sure how this was going to play politically\nBut certainly she was very credible witness well\nGuess what that change in fact our NPR NewsHour Marist Poll that came out this week found a\nTwelve point uptick enthusiasm among Republicans those Republicans who are saying that the that this election was very important when we pulled them back in July it was sixty eight percent now that's eighty percent and it's largely driven by Republican men\nYeah what stood out to me in in that poll was in what's called the generic ballot so who are you more what party are you more likely to vote for in the mid term\nYeah there was a six point jump among men\nNow they were more likely to vote for Republican than for a Democrat just in the past week yes there is this just in the past week and that is absolutely has everything to do with the Kavanaugh hearings yeah there's a certain amount of backlash that has taken place you know they're so much focus so much of our focus and everyone's focus following\nThe hearing was on how women reacted um especially women on the left and there were women coming forward telling their stories that were women volunteering for campaigns and they there was a big surge in campaign donations but there was something else happening two men were angry\nTam we just heard all of those uh clips of President Trump over the last few days\nYou just did a story on this this isn't a new thing from President Trump\nNot only is it not a new thing from President Trump but it's not a new thing in American culture and politics so President Trump really ran on\nWhite Republican men that the culture has shifted beneath them that you know that they're being left behind that they're being left behind so President Trump and his campaign talked about the forgotten man he talked a lot about political correctness run amok\nAnd I was talking to Frank Luntz who's a Republican pollster um and he was saying that President Trump tapped into something that had been bubbling up\nAlong with the societal changes that have been going on for more than a generation\nIt has been used by some to try to energize the white conservative male to say hey look now you're the victim you're the one who's been punished\nAfter you spend a lot of time talking to voters all over the country you did that during the twenty sixteen election as well and I'm curious are you hearing more of this this kind of grievance view of the world in twenty Eighteen or twenty sixteen [noise]\nSo I had a candidate probably heard more of it in in twenty sixteen because I think it was something new that President Trump\nSeemed to be tapping into or allowing people to speak publicly about I think what we're seeing a little bit of right now is no doubt there seems to be a galvanizing factor behind some male voters I specifically because of what's happening with Brett Kavanaugh's hearing\nFAA now has authority to set a minimum how race is giving you a bigger seats Congress has not yet given you a bigger seat neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nDo do that also uh to ban cell phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and ditto for each cigarettes you might not have thought they were allowed but they hadn't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAll right and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated this Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic and how to deal with that that that got done to this week\nPerhaps the main thrust of the bill Scott has renewed effort to stop the shipping of synthetic opioids things like ... there were twenty thousand deaths from a ... a related overdoses\nAnd just a couple of years ago and to prevent the introduction of Fenton would really be a big big difference so the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority they're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients eligibility for treatment\nAnd they'll broaden eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs\nAnd also there's going to be more money and more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller\nOkay shifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S will have to be married\nThat's right they'll have to be legally married to qualify for that second base so that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see the same sex marriage is legal in less than ten percent of the countries that send them passengers and diplomats to the United nations\nSo those people the people who work for the United nations are going to account for roughly half the ... of the state department estimates will be affected so the state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual couple right now you can't get it\nDo cross the differences you can get a heterosexual marriage and just about any country in the world but in fewer than ten percent of the United nations countries is that possible so is there a plan\nFor for people who live in a country\nWithout same sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner they're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt\nAround That's NPR's Ron Elving catching us up on some of the news we missed this week as he does every single week here on the

through the mid term elections\nLiterally ripped out of there are [noise]\nThis week immigration they're bringing drugs\nThey're bringing crime there rape is\nPresident Trump launched his campaign with a controversial hard line stance on immigration and voters latched onto\nNumber I made that speech was badly criticize oh what's so terrible what he's turned out I was a hundred percent right that's why I got elected [noise]\nCarried that immigration talk into his presidency and turned it into policy President Trump moments ago signed an executive order this will affect the separation of parents from their children at the major backlash tonight against President Trump's travel ban the president's message is here\nGot Republicans out to vote but it's his policies as president that may turn Democrats out\nBeating heart\nOf this election is border security we have to dig\nInto all of this my co host ... sat down with NPR's John Burnett and Mara Liasson John covers immigration is based in Texas ... one of our national political correspondent\n... either high [noise]\nPresident Trump began his administration with someone who just got to get pretty mean spirited policy of the travel ban it was one of the first things he did in office and even more recently the summer that was his and he should have a family separation this was a huge low point for the Trump Administration\nIn part because they had to roll back a policy that they said was not a policy and many people were incredibly upset even people within his own party he\nIs a summary of where the policy itself stands at this point\nYes there are still several hundred kids that are in us custody and these shelters around the country and health and Human Services which is responsible for ...\nFor finding a foster homes for them and sponsors has said it's taking us a long time we have to do all these criminal background checks we have to fingerprint everybody in the household not just the family member who wants to take the child back but the larger question of what you did this achieve its\nGoals the goal was to act as a deterrent I'm really to shock potential immigrants into not coming to the U.S and I had an interview with the chief of staff John Kelly a last may and he said that explicitly to me\nA big name of the game is deterrence if if their family separation stands as a pretty tough ... could be a tough deterrent a would be a tough deterrent um a a much faster\nOlder I think a cruel and heartless I wouldn't put it quite that way the children will be taken care of\nAnd so obviously the numbers that are referred to earlier about the jump in the family units and unaccompanied kids crossing the border over the summer the shows that it didn't have a deterrent effect\nSo my sense of how this may at all affect the midterms you know the makeup of Congress because this issue again is one that I Would argue and I'm Out talking to voters um has somewhat again faded from the consciousness\nIf the debate is about border security Republicans win in other words if you're talking about abolishing ice which sounds like dismantling our border security system than Republicans when if you're focusing on separating kids from their parents Democrats win\nBut family separation is over now and overnight writing and so the of the president's on that executive order 'em and so I hear it down in Texas all the way from the attorney general's race to congressional races to the the big Senate race um they use family separation as shorthand\nFor you know look at the atrocities committed by this administration I just don't know how much traction they're getting without um but it's a it's a wide circulation\nBut these things are like like different ingredients in a big ... do I mean they all add up to a feeling that among Democrats and many independents that the Trump Administration has somehow abandoned\nBasic American principles and um you know I think that as a specific issue driving voters in the midterms no it's not that but it definitely went into the soup and helped Democrats make this argument that Donald Trump and the Republicans are way out of the mainstream and need a check and balance\nI think that the question moving forward will be the which party this entire conversation on immigration actually benefits because when you look at twenty sixteen I mean I'm always\nAmazed at when you see the voters who said immigration was the most important issue it was consistently Trump voters you know to to buy sort of a two to one margin more people who voted for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton said immigration was their most important issues I mean clearly benefited his voters then\nAnd he still believes that it does he said the other day that he thought the border security was the beating heart of the twenty Eighteen midterms he wrote down the escalator at Trump Tower and talked about Mexico sending rapists over the border this has been his go to issue anger about immigration he constantly before rallies", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Weekend Edition Saturday", "city": "Billings", "day": "06"}
