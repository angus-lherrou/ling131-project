start today with an account of two communities one is liberal the other conservative\nI Want you to gas which is where [noise]\nThe schools with stress [noise]\nPatriotism and respect [noise]\nIt would be a very rural base educational system\nHow is this would be fairly similar the lawns would be a very nicely kept in a leafy green and mowed the town of the class with lots of churches that's found one [noise]\nThan real memory people would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they would keep the yards natural lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those and churches that was easy right\nConservatives like order liberals embraced ambiguity now you may be rolling your eyes are even getting angry at these stereotypes but we all know there's more than a grain of truth to them so how did these two towns which I guess today refers to as liberal and conservative and\nGet this way when most of us think about how we came to our political views we tend to have a straightforward explanation we use our upbringing and life experiences as the basis for a political beliefs we imagine that our parents teachers in friends\nShape our views on everything from taxes and the economy to immigration and national\nSecurity but what if I told you there's something deeper into those attitudes drives that shaped the music we listened to the food we eat the politicians we elect\nThis week on hidden brain how the partisan divide in our country might arise not just from our upbringing and lived experiences\nFrom biology\nAt a regular basis right before an election someone was Sharon articles with me about how science proves\nThat the brains of liberals are stunted or a post on Twitter was say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\n[noise] these claims obscure something far more interesting and far more accurate there are genuine psychological differences between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts\nJohn hitting as a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln he has spent many years studying the psychological and newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives he is co author of the book predisposed liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences\nJohn welcome to hidden brain thank you Shankar pleasure to be with you when\nMost of us think about how we came to our political views John we have a relatively straightforward explanation that has to do with our upbringing and background\nAnd here's Democrat Nancy Pelosi\nWe act constantly reinvigorated by immigrants coming to our country their commitment and courage and commitment to the American dream which drew them here in the first place [noise] strengthen ...\nNow it's important to stipulate here John that it's entirely possible these politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shape the way liberals and conservatives in general think about the subject of immigration\nI really think or you know immigration defense or police law and order\nKnow if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who uh who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us than it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police or I'm going to have the death penalty I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted as the president wants to\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know they only makes sense is that they can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because this would help us to be a safer place\n\nAre now there are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the act of political considerations that are difficult to disentangle from psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings\nJohn one should liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures\nAnd he found they reacted very differently\nA positive picture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture would be things like I'm a house that are just been leveled by hurricane um or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe had people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a like a journal activity or skin conduct which is a common way of seeing if somebody's just having a reaction having\nA physiological arousal to that a stimulus and what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of images because they're they have some emotional content\nBut we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to chat who was liberal and who is conservative\nThat's true I never been a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different\nAnd the one that we did it goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different kinds of pictures actually we had the most luck with a picture self mutilation uh and and you're right when we did that it was very easy to categorize people you know\nAnd we could be incredibly accurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the basis of that\nLiberals brains when they looked at a mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the ... to ... matter of sensory too and that's the part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I take him in the ... century tree would be active\nBut it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of somebody stepping on a rafting they all goes right through their foot you're so matter of sensors to it'd be active\nAnd what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation medicines for two and conservative\nDoesn't mean that conservatives are hard hearted uh just means that that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nNow you could argue that a lot of this research is ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find are consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents but my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics the shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy\nBy this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you [noise]\n\nThere's a really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment and think about fraternal an identical twins\nIdentical twins have identical genes fraternal twins has similar but not identical jeans\nIf you follow a group of fraternal an identical twins each twin Paris raised in the same household each ... each the same food listening to the same conversations watches the same movies now if you find differences between identical twins as a group\nAnd fraternal twins as a group that suggest that biology non environment is the driver I asked John what such studies revealed about political preferences\nWere fortunate to have access to a data set a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda needs a long ago it's fairly dated data set a but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views and when we subject\nWorked quite heritable [noise] um although people oftentimes misread this our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent of our political views or come from a genetics but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science so many people didn't like that at all\nUh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was less genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent genetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not in zero\nBut apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that [noise]\nAnd so you you basically you're able to town in some ways that there is a loser link in the political orientation of identical twins then into political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you that there is some element of the biology some element of genetics that is driving political preferences\nExactly no that's well put an end again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nA heritable when you see these you know when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say\nOne of the big implications of all this work besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have with fresh inside\nA ... and you've made the case that in many ways the more we're able to see the differences between groups of people as inherent or biological in some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talked about that idea John [noise]\nWhen other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like handed us you know we used to think that uh if you were left handed that was just because you got into a lazy habits\nMy father was left handed and the teacher you know this is long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to to write with his right hand so we do that as as a flaw something that need to be driven out\nUh of course now we understand that being left hand it is very biological this is something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people realized that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do a then people are much more tolerant of that\nSo we were wondering if perhaps the same thing might happen with regard to politics if we realize that our political opponents were not simply being\nWe would be a little bit more tolerant of them that this was the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their conclusions\nWhat would you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath our deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because\nWe didn't always have this deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives there was a time when\nWe had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was off into the leftist more most conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a shortage of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years [noise]\nWould I Would say to that argument is that I Believe we have always had\nThis very same division this very basic difference between people who are fairly sensitive to threats\nAnd think we need to be vigilant and those people who are more into experimentation and try new things [noise] I'm Ralph Waldo Emerson has a great quote I'm Sorry I Can't give it to you for bait 'em but it's basically that ah the division between those people who are supporters of tradition and those people who are supportive of the innovation is very old and a structured the world since ... began\n[noise]\nJohn hitting is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln\nAnd many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in the fence fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see is they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery\nThey put that head of the democracy so now the conflict just descends into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength that they can also be in a credible source of weakness\nIn the question is do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history the answers been yeah and that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no [noise]\n\nI'm Wondering is one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually went in to say I believe very strongly that I'm right\nBut I Want to at least concede the possibility that maybe there are others who have something of value or it may be that history will show in the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know\nAnd I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future I think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think they could be wrong\nThere's a sense that if you believe in democracy so much\nWe you know ... every family people fight the coral they disagree about all sorts of things but if there is love and the family the conflict only goes so far the love breaks down than actually the conflict can bring the family part\n[noise]\nAnd the

Nick room knew\nHundred years later\nLive in rural areas near family criminal mind them ... and the thing\nWhen you think about some of the other leaders of the time there were certainly people who were advocating some portion of what the south was saying and Eighteen sixty one there were people who are saying look the system is so broken it is so\nFaulty that there is no fixing it we actually have to break it down and I think the point that you're making is truly when me\nWhich is that king wrapped himself in the black you wrap themselves in this ideal of the American democracy and that potentially is what made the cockpit productive\nRight so look you know there were a lot of things he was concerned about but he said let's take these principles and actually try to see if we can all live by them mhm\nMhm mhm I think we need to remember American democracy is far from perfect but it is extraordinarily resilient and it is generated\nTremendous progress economic progress social progress political a lot slower than we'd all like by boys things can go very badly and we all know that and so the question is can you continue to make progress [noise]\nSo which of these historical analogies describes the current moment in the United states are we on the brink of a new chapter in democracy\nOr on the brink of divorce\nAsked David about a number of more recent developments that race troubling signals about the health of our tomorrow\n[laughter]\nQuestion authenticity rock Obama's birth certificate very soon I had people looking at here in Houston articles for president given the magnitude of costume crisis\nThat show were actually children throwing a temper tantrum because their team lost [noise]\nOr these modern conflicts business as usual [noise]\nOr something changed I think both I mean it depends what you want the comparison to be I think that relative to much of the twentieth century we've been more partisan more and more partisan today than in a long time\nBut I have to say if you look back in the nineteenth century there were strong divisions very powerful divisions at one moment that of course led\nOften lead to very productive conflict so I don't think the question I don't think the right question is is there too much conflict I again I I think conflict especially if it stays in the political realm", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Hidden Brain", "city": "Billings", "day": "21"}
