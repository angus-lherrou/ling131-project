of the American Medical Association has found what many people have long suspected eating organic food appears to reduce the risk of cancer\nAmong some sixty nine thousand people tracked by French scientist over several years those diets contain more organics at about twenty five percent fewer cancers overall with thirty five percent fewer breast cancers and older women and the more than Seventy percent reduction in them focus\nThis study suggests but does not prove that pesticides and other chemical residues in foods cause cancer but there's no reason to wait for\nCan group can cook Ken welcome back to living on earth thanks Davis great to be here so when this study came out it showed strong evidence in support of the long held beliefs that organic food is better for us how do you feel that this study is out there\nWell you know I guess I feel as if we should have been doing studies like this a long time ago we really do need to be much more careful about the low levels of carcinogens that we still have in our diet the fact that several cancers here\nDid show or a market decrease to me tells me the organic food is probably targeting the mechanisms that are associated with those cancers and the other thing that's interesting while they speculated about pesticides\nThere are other chemicals in non organic foods that are not allowed in organic certain chemical dies a certain color rings\nA certain flavorings that simply are not allowed in organic food manufacturer that in addition to pesticides may be another reason why there's lower cancer rates amongst\nThese mostly women who are eating more organic food\nAnd of course if the product is made from genetically modified organisms it's not allowed to be labeled as organic\nThat is true as well and there really are not very many chemicals that are allowed in organic manufactured are packaged\nFood compared to conventional where there are thousands so there are lots of questions raised by this study but to me it goes back to the basic point a cleaner set of ingredients closer to nature fewer additives less processing is probably in general playing a role here\nSo how excited are you by this study and how much of a game changer do you think it might become\nI find it very encouraging it's just one study that's often said from time to time and they're right one study is just one study\nTo me this opens the door to doing more types of analyses like this a big populations and refining even further what we know about the diet of the people that are are responding to the questions what we need to do now Steve is we need to scale it up we're still talking about organic with a\nVery small footprint on the agricultural landscape and unfortunately still a very\nSmall footprint as it were in our diet but the other thing I I just have to say is you know this\nDoes not mean that eating conventional fruits and vegetables is a bad thing we think that's positive the real problem we we have in our diet is the processed food the the additives but this study adds that extra twist\nLiving on earth is supported by Joel ... dedicated to preserving and protecting our natural environment\n[noise] Mm\n\nMm

on earth\nThank you thank you very much need\nHow does it feel to have these felony charges thrown out on a ...\nI think we all have mixed feelings about that I've been feeling guilty with you know happiness that we are not going to jail and quite frankly that an off bail and may have the opportunity to do civil disobedience again because I\nHad to be very careful while out on bail because if I got arrested it could be revoked and I could spend all my time in the Clearwater county jail awaiting trial\nBut um you know we're disappointed that we did not get to put on the climate necessity defense that we wanted to with you know the very well respected experts that we had lined up to testify it for us like Dr James Hansen you know former climate scientists from NASA and Bill McKibben so it's a mixed bag\nEmily yeah I I'll go being stronger about it than that and say that you know I was really heartbroken not so much by the acquittal of course which is a good thing it was to sort of second best scenario we could have had\nBut by the denial of our expert witness testimony on climate change and on civil disobedience you know it would have been the dream trial it could have made a really big difference so they thought that this kind of trial might happen in that courtroom in front of those jurors and that might make set a precedent that would really\nHave an impact nationally on the climate change debate seemed like a really important thing to me and of course until four days before trial began it looked very much like it was going to happen\nSo you know it's it's a real shame that that it did not\nKnow as I understand that you could ask the judge to let you use the necessity defense\nAnd he had granted that to us\nList for for about the last year and a half\nSo at any point in that time period he could have\nConstrained us constrain the number of witnesses said you can't talk about this or that and he chose not to so the fact that he did that for days before trial began with stunning at the lawyers who couldn't have been more surprised we couldn't have been more surprised\nUntil that moment he'd been very very reasonable and it seems like all systems were go and to be clear the thing about that that was so striking apart from its sudden his\nWas the facts that normally speaking defendants do not have any burden of proof it's it's the prosecution that has the burden of proof normally\nBut because we were going to use a necessity defense and say that what we did\nYou know was essentially a necessary under these circumstances that we find ourselves in to prevent the greater harm of climate change we did have the burden of proof and all of a sudden he knocked out our ability to defend ourselves essentially because who is going to listen to a poet a retired lawyer and a software engineer from Seattle\nOn climate change you know we're not scientists we have no authority so no matter how articulate we had been it wouldn't have had anything like the same impact as the former head of the NASA Goddard Space Center talking about climate change and how urgent it is or about Minnesota scientists talking about how urgent it is and how much is already changing in Minnesota\nSo you know again we had no ability to defend ourselves without experts to testify to those things\nAnd the software engineering or co defendant was\nThat was ... a young father of three who was our support person or support people were all arrested they went in knowing that that was a possibility but it was certainly our hope and we're planning the action that they would not be arrested so we're very very happy that he's acquitted and home with\nHis young family were happy that he's acquitted but I personally am very sorry he didn't get to testify you know in the necessity defense hearing a in August a year ago when he testified there was not a dry in the room\nYou know when he talked about his young children and what they were facing\nAnd then the case becomes even more confusing I guess because the judge was on the one hand you can have witnesses to make your case and then he proceeded to go ahead to quit you of the charges\nThat was after the prosecutor had presented his case which was only two witnesses the sheriff who arrested us and and local Enbridge employee\nAnd all he proved was that we had broken some chains that were holding the log into the enclosure where the emergency shut off valve was and we never disputed that so we were charged\nLegislatures right now by the fossil fuel industry to give them you know further penalties against protesters and the statute we were charged under was specifically damage to pipelines and the judge ruled and he was correct that the prosecutor had not prove that we had damaged the pipeline and anyway yeah\nIn the ... century he was ruling that there wasn't evidence for a reasonable jury to convict us basic right that as a matter of law then that was because of course we hadn't damage that pipeline right\nI'm going to ask you to speculate about both of you in a ... about judge Robert Tiffany and the decisions that you made in your case how do you think the judiciary might have been influenced by outside forces politics sentiment\nThe fossil fuel industry\nThis is Emily in terms of you know what kind of pressures he may have been under or what he may have been I'm thinking you know whether his mind might have changed\nAbout what kind of precedent he wanted to set and so forth you know it's it's impossible to know and and it's you know distressing and it certainly something we've been wondering about he seems like a very reasonable guy he gave us a necessity defense he wanted to hear what we had to say and he wanted to let the jury hear it so\nYou know the about face was quite extreme\nWe know for sure that Enbridge provide something like two thirds of the budget that county so I you know they obviously have some influence direct or indirect we don't know I mean we have no way to know what may or may not have happened behind the scenes but\nThey fossil fuel companies have terrible amounts of influence and power in this country and you know that's why we have to fight them and the ways that we have to fight them because they do on and control our political system all on all levels\nTo what extent did you understand what do you do this direct action the law enforcement could bring felony charges against you know\nAbsolutely knew that that was not only a possibility but a strong probability and we accept that risk\nI personally feel I'm sixty six years old and I feel that it is my job as an elder and it is my job because I Am an old white woman who has the privilege of not having the cop show up and shoot me on site if I Do something like that\nThat it really is my job to step up and do these kinds of things I Know from my you know young activist of color friends that it's far more risky for them it's far more risky just with the police showing up\nWe're likely to treat them harshly [noise] we can look right now what is going on with the prosecutions of indigenous folks who stood up at Standing Rock and often were arrested for no more than standing in prayer and yet or getting felony convictions right now and getting very harsh sentences [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Living on Earth (PRI)", "city": "Billings", "day": "27"}
