government action on pollution and habitat safeguards to discuss the influence\nSir ... parental welcome back to the program Patt\nThanks Dave good to be with you\nKnow justice Brett Kavanaugh has been closely related to a number of environmental cases why why is that well\nHe's been on the DC circuit court of appeals which is the second most important court to the Supreme Court in the country for going on eleven or twelve years he's written three hundred different opinions of which\nProbably for the navy and dealt with either environmental law directly or administrative law issues that relate to environmental laws so he has quite a track record of writing opinions and environmental cases\nSo typically how has justice Kavanaugh ruled on these regulatory cases involving environmental law\nWell he styles himself in the manner of or the late Justice Scalia who was attached to a less strict construction is and what that means of course is that he looks to the text of his statue when he was asked to interpret it\nAnd if the text isn't clear enough oftentimes he will rule against an agency's interpretation and an environmental arena that oftentimes means\nThat rules which are trying to increase the level of protection for public health and the environment\nDon't often fit squarely within the plain text of a statute the statutes are general and vague often\nAgencies try to interpret them as best they can Kevin ... one of those judges that requires really clear explicit direction from Congress when it comes to rules that impose costs on American businesses he's quite pro business\nAnd he's quite strict when it comes to interpreting environmental laws against broad protections\nSo what is it important to her an outstanding case that Brett Kavanaugh has ruled on regarding the environment from his perch in the circuit court of appeals\nWell he recently ruled that EPA does not have the authority to require a substitute\nChemical that's used in refrigerant and a fire prevention devices that is a very potent greenhouse gas that chemical was adopted because it doesn't deplete the ozone layer so it was one of these non\nOzone depleting chemicals but the problem is that it's a terrible greenhouse gas in EPA tried to say well we're not going to substitute a greenhouse gas for an ozone depleted let's find a different chemical Kevin all looked at the language of the clean Air Act and said no it's it's limited\nFor [noise]\n\n\nReally [noise]\nComing up little known and in trouble our breasts race to save the butter not tree just hours ahead on living on

Mexico is yet another example of the increasing number of major weather events linked to climate disruption\nAnd according to a recent report from scientist with the inner governmental panel on climate change the IPC see we can expect more and more dire events such as Michael but only seemingly small increases and the globe's average surface temperatures\nThe twenty Fifteen Paris climate agreement call for no more than a two degrees centigrade increase from pre industrial conditions and suggested limiting the rise to one point five degrees would be beneficial but this new report finds that half degree difference poses huge risks\nKeeping below that one and a half degrees centigrade goal is going to be tough but the impact of failure will be even tougher says Princeton professor Michael Oppenheimer professor Oppenheimer has been a lead author Frye PCC reports for years and joins us now welcome back to living on earth Michael\nTo be here again I mean to cut to the chase how scared are you by this latest report from the IPC see\nI don't get scared about this issue because I've been living with it for thirty five years and that if it scared me I Would have gone crazy a long time ago however any sane person would take away a very very sobering message apart and reading this report\nThe effects of climate change are already here\nAre projected to worsen over tie\nThat the possibility of very big impacts starts to increased markedly is not\nToward the end of this century but very close a matter of a decade or two away if we do nothing or more or less nothing like we're doing now to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases that are causing the problem\nSo what's the basic premise of this report it and and why was it issued in the first place\nThis report has an unusual origin the Intergovernmental Panel on climate change producers thorough assessments of all our knowledge on climate change\nEvery six years or so and then in between those major assessments that produces very quick and pointed assessments of pieces of the problem\nFor instance I'm working on the next these are called special reports that I'm working on the next special report which is on the oceans and the icy parts of Earth like the ice sheets\nThe report that just came out is on the question of what is the level at which we should restrain warming in order not to enter a danger zone where the risks are just so high\nThat we may just as a group of societies not be able to cope with it\nThat's unusual because it's pointed at a single very specific issue that has high policy relevance\nNow what are the headlines from this latest I PCC report is that we have just a dozen years twelve years or twenty thirty or so to get our act together to reaching net zero output in carbon emissions to what extent do you agree with that finding and how do we possibly get there\nBe Frank about and I don't think we're going to get there and I also think that partly because of that\nThe framing that we have twelve years left or else is wrong it's counterproductive it'll just scare people in the report they frame it that way that's been a framing that the media has\nHas put on it is sort of like twelve years we don't do it we should do the world comes to win and that's not the case the reality is at every step you do the best you can and if you don't quite make\nThe target you try to do a little better in the next decade or the next couple of decades the world doesn't come to an end costs that is the risk just increased markedly and it becomes very very hard to cope eventually that doesn't mean that society's will completely disintegrate some well I can tell you that sea level rise is going\nWe'll make life just miserable expensive and uncomfortable for the rest of us\nSo what are the biggest challenges in this report or in terms of limiting warming to a degree and a half century\nContrary to what most people think ah the report finds that the challenges are not primarily technological the costs are going to be decreasing overtime although they're never going to be entirely negligible but\nThe real obstacle is a social and political one how do you get societies organize to actually reinvent themselves to be not independent of fossil fuels\nYou're saying the primary challenge to limit warming to one and a half degrees centigrade is us what in fact do we need to do then as society is as governments to to limit this morning I I Know there are many many aspects to it but but briefly what do we need to do\nAt the most general level what we need to do is abandon using fossil fuels as primary energy sources that means getting rid of coal the primary source of carbon dioxide from electric power production for instance as soon as possible\nReducing and eventually eliminating our dependence on\nPetroleum based products like gasoline primarily for transportation and\nProbably the biggest challenges that there's so much carbon dioxide or writing\nIn the atmosphere that even if we slow down markedly are ... and ... eliminate dependence on fossil fuels we need probably need to find a way to remove some of that carbon from the atmosphere eventually not immediately but as we get towards mid century\nIt seems we're going to need a way to suck the carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and people are working on that so that those are two things\nThe third thing is becoming more efficient and that means not just efficiency and production it also means societies organizing themselves efficiently for instance in the United states we have a very spread out\nPattern of development and that pattern automatically guarantees high energy use\nSo tell us why two degrees centigrade will be even worse than they already ambitious goal of one and a half degrees centigrade why does just half a degree make such a difference according to this particular report\nSo when the report was\nFor two thousand and Fifteen a lot of scientists were skeptical that they would be much of a difference\nScientists went out and started doing research focused specifically on the difference between one and a half to two degrees it's become clear that particularly with regard to extreme heat\nAnd flooding that there were a big difference is between one and a half and two degrees let me give you an example already by one and a half degrees there are places a particularly islands in the Pacific and megacities all around the world for which the incidence of the benchmark hundred year\nStorm or a hundred year flood event I should call it increases markedly even by one and a half degrees so that you're getting\nAt that level what is today a wandering a hundred year event becomes a yearly events think about that we don't deal with those kinds of events effectively now even though they're very rare what happens when they're happening all the time\nWhat's missing from this report in and tell me why there\nReally isn't much of a\nSocial and political analysis there isn't much discussion of the political and social obstacles there is discussion of the need for transformation but not that much discussion of how you go about it\nIn particular places and why it's difficult to do and the reasons for that our number one it's different in every place in the IPC she can't do a special report for every place on earth\nFunding for a

O R G\nI began the second part of our talk by asking Secretary Kerry they consider the issue of stranded\nAssets as it applies to climate change\nLet me ask you just to think reflect on this for a moment looking at American history in Eighteen sixty\nIn the south there was more monetary value in slaves than there was in the land or Eighteen sixty five that was a classic stranded s at all that valued disappeared to what extent today do you think we're being held hostage by folks who think\nBillions of dollars and it can't all be burned if we understand the science correctly\nTo what extent are we headed down a path I mean to solve the problem that we had was slavery I mean does the moral question there just like we have today with climate as well as the economic question to solve that problem we wound up in a pretty in a very bloody war\nI don't I mean I don't think that's the choice for for America now I think that I think uh most of the executives I Know at the higher level of the oil industry are all diversifying\nA shell BP they're all investing in New energy they're ready to move where the market we'd go and uh\nI mean we're not going to be able to transition fast enough that you suddenly dry up and not have oil or gas and ... there's going to be on the gas for a while it's just the nature of the beast we've got to try to guarantee it's not for to allowing why\nI'm simply listening to the scientists I mean I'm listening to the end and understanding the science if we don't move off fossil fuels fast enough we could reach what's called a tipping point where\nThings begin to cascade down words in a spiral of destruction and dying\nOf dying sees dying trees dying species of various kinds because it's not sustainable and if you get into that kind of a spiral nobody knows nobody can tell you how you break out of it I'm just applying the precautionary principle of the idea of governing\nMean we buy insurance to make sure our of our home burned down we're going to be able to rebuild it we by car insurance to fix the rack and hope in our life insurance and then somebody last of life\nThe family's okay why are we buy insurance against the death and destruction that will come with increased storms and increase climate change\nIt's beyond my understanding why are we going to have a president who is a desire of this science\nNinety eight percent of all the scientists in the world who ever watch this and looked at it with peer reviewed studies peer reviewed studies all say this is happening happening now and it's caused by not exclusively but largely by human beings\nAnd we don't respond to this whoa whoa to sending them we're entering into the sort of suicide packed\nIt could be worse than the United states civil war that right now we are heading I you know the goal in Paris was to keep the rise of the earth's temperature to two degrees centigrade and we were going\nCurrent rate we're not meaning that standard we\nAre heading now towards four degrees centigrade rise in temperature the average temperature of the planet that's catastrophic\nYou'll have water battles you'll have refugees moving you think we have tough migration challenges today where people can produce food and various parts of the world will their water dries up and they're not able to live what happens when the oceans change and you have a migration away from certain stocks that people have relied on for food and so forth [noise]\nThey're just so many unknowns here I'm not willing to just throw up my hands and sail someone's going to take care of this\nBecause that's just not responsible given the input\nBack in the day as lieutenant governor of Massachusetts which is not exactly ordinarily a very exciting position you made your mark jumping on the acid rain but tell me what did that teach you about the politics of environmental protection\nThat reasonable people with a reasonable purpose in public life\nAre able to work together Republican and Democrat in order to do things that are good for American citizens I was lieutenant governor but Michael Dukakis are allowed me to be the chair of the governors task force for him I worked with Governor John Sununu in New Hampshire I worked with Governor and Dick's Alaska of Ohio\nAnd we put together the three of us a and approach\nDrawn up by the way by the American Enterprise Institute is conservative approach to how you use the market to be able to\nAccomplish something you want to accomplish and there was a market incentives for people to actually buy in trade sulfur which reduce the amount of self or we we got acid rain under control through the system and then when I was in the Senate I was able to use that and put it into the clean Air Act\nAnd so it became part of the national program so you don't hear about it I said right now we could do the same thing for climate change if we had the leadership that was willing to recognize\nThe greatest market the biggest market on this planet is the energy market it is today\nThey're four to five billion users they're going to be about nine billion users next Thirty years 'cause that's gonna be a population of the of the world and we have the ability through the deployment of sustainable renewable alternative energy to be able to limit our emissions and control climate\nWrite in your book that a despite President Trump's role backs and attempts to roll back to President Obama's signature climate environmental policy\nWell I Am optimistic I'll tell you why first of all because living without optimism would be miserable [laughter] I don't want to be miserable but more importantly because I see what's happened in my lifetime which what what I write about in in in the book every day's extra mean",
