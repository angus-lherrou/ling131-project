are doing on the evil Democrats side and I'll tell you the man who's ... these hearings have been good for America in many ways we've got to seeing the faces of evil we've seen a pure faces of evil and\nAnd vacuum the camel or Harris they said was going to run for the presidency I can guarantee you America sees that she's an empty skirt\nShe seemed to be what she has a vacuous individual nothing there there's nothing there she was a small town prosecutor who was picked hand picked by the Democrat machine and they ran are up the flagpole she's gone I can guarantee you she'll go nowhere she still vacuous\nAnother one who who flamed out is Cory Booker called themself Spartacus you gotta Spartacus moment\nBut he went further he's shown himself to be an uh actually idiotic\nI Want you to listen to Cory Booker\nListen to this carefully he says that Kavanaugh's guilt or innocence doesn't matter you shouldn't be forced out right now irrespective of whether he's guilty or innocent\nNow this means Cory Booker believes not in the rule of law but the ... and the rule of the lawless and the rule of the mob mob rule how can anyone vote for this man so I think both of them have now disqualified themselves\nA for a any serious consideration beyond what they already are doing here is Cory Booker saying that Mr cabin or\nHis guilt or innocence doesn't matter listen to him and oh three astonishing\nWhen it ... had been revealed in an emotional moment where do you use language that that frankly shocked a lot of [noise] and not only\nNot whether he's innocent or guilty this is not a trial the ultimate solution has enough questions be re [noise] that we should not move on to another candidate for this is beyond\nComprehension so they've been found\nShould not move on to another candidate [noise] this is beyond\nComprehension so they've been found out to be liars and attempting to pin the tail on him saying he was a rapist than it is to know that that didn't fly so now they're saying because he reacted to being smeared\nHe's not qualified to be in the Supreme Court ladies and gentlemen the Savage jury let me ask you something if you had been publicly excoriated humiliated lied about and you had a chance to answer some of these questions what would you have done sat there like a moron you\nWouldn't have gotten angry what what do you want out of a human being and find a way what do you think the temperament as of Ruth Bader Ginsburg behind closed doors you think she doesn't scream and yell at people you think that which is not used to temper tantrums for the day they\nForces are on the American public are you joking you're telling me\nThat the man of overreact he didn't even overreact you imagine if it was me what I Would have said to them I wouldn't have sat there and take it uh I Would have shown over the temperature is I Wonder if expose them for what they're vulnerable with I wouldn't have sat there and taking that if they ... me and my family to read\nThis story it's called the ugly truth about time share everything you've done your family if I were buying a timeshare you name my help hello I'm Chuck McDowell CEO and founder of Wesley financial group ten years ago I started helping votes cancel\nTheir timeshare contracts and then the process started what's now called the Tom shirt cancellation industry Tom ... the only thing that you can buy that you can't tell me how much is going to cost or when it's going to end when you buy time share you gave them a blank check to fill out any amount they want for annual\nMaintenance and assessment face sound crazy the crazy thing is there's never ends even when you die your families\nNow going to be stuck with this burden stop the insanity to stay calm office now I guarantee if we can't cancer timeshare contracts\nAnd again if you think that I'm Alone in this a criticism of Congress of the media you mistaken every poll I don't care which side of the aisle is conducted by shows the same thing\nThe respect or the ... the the I don't even know where right where the respect as the wrong word their opinion the average person's opinion of car which is that an all time low the average person's opinion of the media is lower than that of Iraq dropping in a New York's sewer people hate the media\nAnd last night we hit a new low a new low in America below that it actually is worse than anything I've ever seen about the ... republic which was so degenerate that the average German who was not an extremist by the way you have to understand something about the rise of Hitler the average German hated Hitler\nIt was only a small fringe that put Hitler forward the middle class German was repulsed by Hitler but the degenerate seat of the ... hour period in Germany reached such a fever pitch that even middle of the ...\nGermany reached such a fever pitch that even middle of the road Germans said enough is enough and they started to rethink their moderate positions they couldn't take it anymore\nSo we have no longer any gatekeepers in the media except to block conservatives like me for oil outlets in the media is still America while I'm On the radio to understand something\nThat I'm Still standing here up to twenty five years of being as graphically honest as any person in the history of this media as open as I Am is almost a miracle it actually is a miracle\nIt is it got pocket God part of the red seized from Michael me in Nineteen Ninety four and here I Am that doesn't mean January is going to be the same it will not be the same my show is changing dramatically one hour of radio\nOne hour of a podcast but many stations that have been desperate to drop me will be dropping to show some new ones will come along I'll be very clear with us all political make no mistake about it and the radio media landscape is going to move in the same direction as Fox News\nCenter left instead of center right that's what's gonna happen across the media landscape center left instead of center right and they're making a disastrous era or on many many levels [noise] so now we see what happens when you stand up to the establishment\nAnd when the establishment becomes degenerate and sick\nAnd you say nothing about it you are allowed to function in this society but if you speak out against that you yourself become the victim the truth dies and along with it the truth teller\n\nLast night Trump gave a speech in front of a crowd and while he is right about what he said about Dr fraud the optics are awful he went off the rails now mind you I'll repeat what I said he's a hundred percent right in what he said about Dr fraught he does every\nSaid he's a hundred percent right in what he said about Dr fraud he does everything right from the heart and since this whole Ford Kavanaugh thing began he's been very measured in his comments he really didn't take sides always the front of the cabinet and always giving credence to Dr fraud\nAnd he doesn't even acquiesced to Democrats in waiting another week so the FBI could investigate these claims again I Want to repeat Trump is right about what he just said last night but the optics are awfully went off the rails you see in front of an adoring crowd in Mississippi he mocked Dr frauds testimony\nTo the tremendous applause we heard it and what happened every news Cast Lead with this all of the ... media outlets all the twisted sister's in the news business\nWe're having panel discussions on Trump's horrible treatment of sexual abuse survivor he gave them the father they were looking for now this doesn't affect solely the media or the Democrats but demon cat voters who are already looking to take out Republicans and the demon cat fringe activists\nWho are loudly confronting Republicans everywhere they can run into them or it also feeds reasons for guys like Jeff Flake stir\nAnd Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski to not support capital in a vote on the floor I think it was a terrible miscalculation on the president's part and I have to ask why does he do this\nWhy is it that when President Trump is in the White House setting he controls himself but when it gets in front of a crowd\nHe makes believe or he sounds as though he's speaking on a telephone to a television personality recalls them all the time and I think that's the problem I think what happens he goes off the phone from this TV personality goes on a stage after getting pumped up by him and thinks\nFrom this TV personality goes on a stage after getting pumped up by him and thinks he's on television when he's not he has to think about the consequences of what he is saying\nAnd so as I say to you this is a very difficult time to be in the media especially when I'm Michael Savage and the Switzerland of talk radio right that one down I declare myself the the Switzerland of talk radio\nWhy do I say I'm the Switzerland of talk radio well for one I'm not a registered Republican I never have been\nIn fact uh I don't go to Republican events I generally don't like Republicans\nHowever in the times that we are in there is no clear a choice than ever as to the safer party for most Americans and that is certainly not the lying filthy degenerate Democrats to be it's a terrible time to be the Switzerland of talk radio I'll tell you that right now\nAnd the phone number here is uh what's the difference with my phone number is what's the difference that I Am\nA producing a book that will be out Tuesday called stop mass hysteria what is a difference I mean I Know you're going to go buy it my hard core audience will buy it you'll never see it on ... on Fox News because they are part of the cartel which is a shame\nNot all conservatives are a member of that cartel they also are blocked from fellow news which by the way is going through a big change now that Lackland Murdoch took it over you're gonna see heads rolling out of that studio he's a super liberal from London\nHe does not want some of the people who are on Fox News to remain and they've known the actual is going to fall one day wait until you see what happens in the next few months\nI don't know what they're going to do once they get a phone news I don't know where they're going to go watch CNN MSNBC I don't know where they're going to find a job I guess they could always get to Dixie cups and the string and again a video camera and podcast themselves and then they'll find out what it is to be obscure on them\nAnd podcast themselves\nAnd then they'll find out what it is to be obscure in America when they had the chance to open themselves up to a man who tells the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth to help him God and they chose to ignore him while so many people listen to him they'll find out what it is to be on the outside one day\nAnd as I said you last week lead guard seed vengeance I don't I never have and I never will be right back\n...
