the port city and the only ten hurricane evacuate\nAnd it just said I'm On Tuesday the port city and the ... hurricane evacuation traffic flowing through the wall is tunnel ... experience you get the traffic was executive director of public safety James barber he updated the city Council on the situation he told them that officers were doing what they could\nTo assist with the smooth ride and we're getting ready for Florida residents\nEvacuating here to mobile and then also when the storm is over so here's what we know the the L A police department special operations division they had been working with L. dot\nHere's a quote from Mr Barbour he says we do not anticipate any catastrophic events here related to wind or rain but what it has caused the beginning this morning was a huge evacuation\nOut of the Florida Panhandle so what we have is the baby weight is backed up a clear across the bay into Baldwin county so all last phone commercial traffic that was diverted off the bay
