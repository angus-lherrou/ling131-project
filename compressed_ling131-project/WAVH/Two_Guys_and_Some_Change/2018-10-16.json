little bit more again yeah that'd be nice\nYeah it's a it's way more ... I don't know why we do the store sales in the middle of summer [laughter] yeah that's a and it it it wasn't as hot ... years ago when we used to this there's no way it was\nIn ... authors that apparently not not only that sucker we were younger [laughter] yeah that could have something to do with it but I don't know it's just I don't know how I did it have cable either then rock Thirty years ago\nYeah I Do a do it again now you're talking about going down as well yeah I don't know my big gone down there for sixty years [laughter] yeah\nYeah I was looking at the other day it was like wow I've been going to destroy strike for about thirty three or four years myself yeah\nBecause I didn't start going down there until after school yeah usually make part of our success today yeah enjoyed being part of it you know absolutely it was a ... you know a good family group and you know we're\nYeah absolutely it was so that you know a good family group in you know we're all having a good time in a lot of success with a bunch of rice says no one ... championships in a row yeah no it was a it was a lot of fun yeah ... yeah\nYou know well you know they didn't\nThey weren't start changing the rules so they can be more competitive with those that didn't work out for but [laughter]\nBut we're just talking about uh the only only time I've said in the stands immobile was during that time period and um I didn't really lock it up much rather be in pretty much fine that wasn't near as much fun that\nLooked like real tax break in gene we're going to actually get to working on some cars here after this break but we do appreciate you coming in talking about car show we will not ... McKamey Manor erudite where again\nYeah then they go get up relieve the guys and so I think that's going to be some tired suffers when they get by not back when they're asleep they're dreaming of rowing Cobb I bet they're not [laughter] I bet so dang die or did they probably have trouble getting back to the cubicle where they go to like a nap and yeah I was going to say it so yeah it's not fun\nAre they going to take a nap in how's it going to say it so yeah it's not fun and it seems like you would have a hard time getting to sleep but I bet after the first shot up all segments he will not know won't have any problem at all\nBut another thing that we really need to talk about some cars here tonight and in one of the things that I Want to you got what we do have a a text messages air from rapid rapid raised daughter I'm On her own shop here now I don't know we all know for their own were young and she working at it or not allowed to see a trying to take a train\nI Love to see the younger generation or get involved and get interested in a\nYou know the um she's got can you use a clear contact paper on the front of your card deck to protect your paint\nA and how about your head like you wouldn't want to put it on your head lights for sure because the heat would actually uh degrade anything that you tried to put on there but they do make is not contact paper but they do make a a I said earlier brawl\nBut yes um is it is actually is like a clear a vinyl that they put across the front um the trick to that stuff is it it looks great you know for the first couple of years\nUh about every two to three years you'd better get it off air\nYou know because they didn't so once it ever starts to cracker or chalk up a little bit\nYou can get it can't get it I'll have to ground it off is that good and then they did you go do my job right near you totally defeated what you what you were trying to do at that point ... let me let me bring up something here that uh we are fixed they get hit with the with the president ... Fifteen Percent\nEthanol bill ... and they're going to start putting a rather than just have a ... percent ethanol at all of these cash bumps I going to have fifty percent now for uh\nAt all of these cash clumps they going to have fifty percent now for a couple of things if you have a vehicle and you could correct me if I'm wrong on that scale if you have a vehicle that's two thousand one are newer than you could run that Fifteen\nBut if it's prior to two thousand and one say if you have a two thousand her or Nineteen Ninety nine or ... in Seventy eight model eighty something model all that stuff back in ... and you don't need to rent that stuff 'cause it ... well you\nKnow and and even if it doesn't mess it up you're dating to the to the edge of what the computer in the car can compensate for 'em because the cars around that time period we're not built for ten percent or Fifteen Percent ethanol\nThey were um they were built to run pure pure gasoline rice and um the more ethanol you put in to linger it is a is a little cleaner but this is leaner\nAnd um the computer's not going to understand what I Do with it right now I'm In\nThe another problem that you have with that is that\nYou have some of the newer cars you can go in or you can take it to somebody and they can program and change that and the programming in it and make it work okay I think it earlier one yes you do there is no one around those doing that with the earlier ones yeah ah it's just not you know\nFinancially feasible the other thing is\nYou don't want to burn it anyway and it's going to cost two miles ... right right that you know the miles per gallon is going to go down I'm In other words you go Barton more guys\nKnew what you've been to it\nYeah right yeah what's that going to do for the last say their mileage standard oil and that's what our just fix\nYeah what's that going to do for the last say their mileage standard oil and that's what our just fixing to say you know were did not like they're not they're not that now they're raising it constantly rising or a cafe writing which is the corporate average fuel economy and um\nTo a you know a reasonable amount anyway and now they're going I'm going to allow\nThe Fifteen Percent ethanol fuel\nAnd which is going to be the norm so all the cars are going to get less fuel mileage so they're kind of defeat and there was it going to say they all they don't go Martin as much oil yeah going barn sixty billion bushels\nMore of corn and we don't have to sell it to chat more tax or you know are these other countries or by the farmers not to plant and that kind of thing you know and and I can see the point on a lot of stuff that\nYou know it's a will actually how long that last yeah it's it's going to be interesting to see how that really goes 'cause\nHonestly I can see in the next ten or Fifteen Years that unless you have a and even even some of those in less you have a big truck\nI'm it's going to be all electric out you know the battery technology is coming up and come in Rome a further and further to the point to where\nYou know what it's a it's feasible there's cars out there getting three hundred and fifty four mile ranges fry 'em then when the battery technology gets better and the charging technologies get better\nI'm not going to be an issue yeah there's not an issue because we go now we're going to be glad it would would all ... and ...\nYeah you know as of course it's just a another technology that I've got to learn towards the end of my career\nSo another technology that I've gotta learn towards in my career I'm worried about what it but not worried about what is going to do the price of a bowl of corn flakes\nAre getting ... yeah well you might not be able to buy Haiti or flash right they don't have to borrow my neighbors are gonna have to cut back on break to jot it and then a looked like do you got a message here whether to make clear head like protector film\nSo I guess it is feasible I have not seen that\nBut uh they can be done for real take ... more sponsors and we'll be back\nScreaming I think he's\nTo take the amount of time in Mississippi\nBack where the hell are
