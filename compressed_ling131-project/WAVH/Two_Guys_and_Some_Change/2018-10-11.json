all these people in a room and they pick the winners ... no a bias there is no you know sway in the vote\n'em they let the people that nominated pick the winner and in every year or most years we have a clear cut winner and it shows up in the in the scores\nAnd and uh I've been there when you um when those winters have been introduced and of course the\nThe uh ... just to be nominated for it is a
