Republicans\nThey always say to our grass is probably the most conservative part of the state right now I'm you know obviously there's some parts of northwest Alabama that are pretty conservative too\nIt's good to have you on to tell you I Want to actually talk about that little bit of but of course talking about uh the governor coming to town is it before we get into it though is there some role is there something written into the Alabama Republican Party the Republican headquarters of some sort of have to be in the pine brook shopping center\nThe Republican headquarters of some sort of have to be in the pine brook shopping center\nI I think oh it it might just be one of those understood the lines you know that not disloyal [laughter]\nThere's there's probably people get mad at me right now you don't talk about that some of it just seems like that's the only thing that happens for sure okay yeah yeah so the the government comes down to opening up campaign headquarters out what's the ... where we're going to see tomorrow what time should we get there are ... are are you going to be speaking\nTo a couple of things that is I'll I'll on them like very clear in and it'll\nBe much looking forward to tells us the most ... most people\nBut it is so you know if you if you're not sure exactly where you go on just tell the girl that lives in your cell phone\nTake me to book some Indian is is right there it's still committed in the store\nRight right there and they'll outlets banners and besides you can't miss it shown that airport boulevard in uh in mobile\nAnd I think they're going to kick it off at nine thirty now this is the important part I got to say it should be over ten thirty corduroy ... somewhere you know in that area any be home in time for your football games\n[laughter] okay that that was just Egypt that's done good I'm Out there see the governor and not me I'm going to\nDeadly up up in ... her\nWe've been friends since so we're in college together and I'll support her everything she's ever Ron Paul and loved death if you see the sketch thing I've kicked off well no\nI don't think there's a lot of uh the politicians who said Alabama they want to see where they rank compared to the coaches and the state of Alabama generally are in trouble here but water less if you talk about the ... some polling here as in focus groups and I think they're going to lose out on that one what about this you know Jeff and I were talking about\nUh the gubernatorial politics or get governor Ivey has a substantial lead in like every poll I've seen here but are you still have ... ...\nSubstantial lead in like every poll I've seen here but are you still have all ... he's doing the bus tour he's come to town to more as well I mean if if you're sitting down with Governor ivy you talk about uh what would you do politically what would your play be right now anything just play prevent defence\nAh [noise] you know ... don't don't ... don't over fly I mean uh CNN golly I Can't even ... campaigns I've\nServed seven terms ... and and a lot of other campaigns ... the sequel\nAnd you know it's always fine line though what do you do what you don't do right now ... is better the are they own the ... o'clock ... ah more than that you know I wouldn't I wouldn't ... think doing anything\n... would you uh been waiting we're having\n... issue should fire herself all of her life was this moment of the girls want the the governor since they I'm Better and dishes ... golden opportunity ... and here's here's the interesting thing to me having dealt with governors for decades over four decades\n... one thing I can tell you about ... she's going ... honesty ... the courage with integrity she's going to do a good job for the people of Alabama and and and I just went ... ... what about this what about ... and out and I'll include this\nWhen she leaves office\nIt will be because she doesn't run or she gets defeated not because she's indicted or swamps her house for ... I mean\n... and that's good ... I Would like to have that at once and our state ... that's a good thing we need that as a minimum standard and our state we need to turn things around where they have been and establish that that's the normal right that's not the over treatment that is the normal and the state I gonna ask you that with the years you know and ... did you see her\nShe meant that is the normal in the state I going to ask you that with the years you've known Kay Ivey did you see her ad that came out this week\nI did not I um and yeah yeah so I'm a little concerned how didn't\nWell yeah it's the way she's sitting it's got a picture of her she is sitting at then governor literally involved with this governor's desk of course the first a female governor\nOf the state of Alabama when we go but but you can argue that she was kind of a proxy for her husband but that's a whole other show so but it's got a young gay ivy sitting there\nAt the desk like posing for pictures like any of us would do but on the back of the picture she writes\nI guess is or this is the closest that I'll ever get and then jump to a shot it jumps to a shot to Kay Ivey sitting at the governor's desk you know they're ... they're they're in our memory and I thought I thought that was a brilliant not just a\nOf ins in the state of Alabama to discussing you know why should you be governor but with the narrative being and we're talking about it on national level too it seems like you know the Democrats are the only party that cares about women and women are only\nA Democrats out there and it's all you know the men that are the Republicans I think she turns that whole narrative on his ear without coming out and having to say it doing it in a in a in a way that a little more subdued\nWell you know one thing about gay she's a good southern girl and kill and uh that that sounds just like hurricane like that but I guess I've been watching this that yes go on a on on every\nChannel you know when I'm not working that's what I'm watching and not just a mission to look oh that sounds just walk\n... you know you have a unique perspective I think being a mayor in a different part of the state and having spent time immobile just kind of contrast gods did in ... county ... county or southwest Alabama in that region\nI I think when you run a statewide campaign a lot of that you know there there's I don't want to say tribal but I I guess is it basically is you just contrast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou take ... and in places ... county and those surrounding counties they know where you go to church and know what kind of car you drive your car and that everybody knows everybody\nOh when you get down in this particular area and now I'm a ... different mobile I'm not that familiar with it but you get involved and counting and I live in Gulf shores so this is a mixed community people that have come from ... ... and I mean everywhere\nAll in in ... it's just a different mindset down here and and I was\nA surprise to be quite honest uh of course at Wal counting the state of Alabama or evolved over the years where\nIf you were Republican normally is the ... time running for office and now it is turn to almost the other other side of that coin\nBut down here I I thought wow [laughter] here so many conservatives down here and I really couldn't couldn't quite believe it or governor hobby should do he actually well here are hoping way she does but we'll county and I know she's got a ton of support oh in North Alabama and and throughout the state\nAnd we will ah will will see the outpouring uh tomorrow and those people show up that will be there like you said just tell your phone to take you to ... million right\nAbsolutely and uh just tale that light into your home that's where you won't go books million airport boulevard and um and I haven't spoken to the governor racially but want to share tomorrow was like okay we show what moral get this thing short [laughter]\nThat's right you got to get to the game ... very good he won't talk to you again very soon things going on with the fact\nThat any ... without any trouble lengthy back there you go thank you man we only means getting crowd thank\nYou for letting me talk about it and you're in jail for like show\nAll right thank you Steve means that for a former mayor of the city of ... and one of ...\nAll right thank you Steve means that for a former mayor of the city of ...\nAnd one of us now down here in southwest Alabama or we're here to ... motor cars midday move we'll live on location in theater hanging out with my friend Larry Kirby and talking vehicles by the way to I just went and maybe did one extra passed round the Corvette out there that the thing is that how many miles fifty thousand miles you know I mean it is cherry red Corvette\nAnd it's obviously cherry 'cause it's got fifty thousand miles on this thing is a\nWhy I think the better metaphor\nFor Doug Jones when as probably bought ... over the top\nWhere you have to deal with here you have\nTo you and I even get along I Would you have you have this long run of Alabama victories\nWill bear Bryant last championships and you had this just one moment ... right and then from that moment on politics changed I mean up football change in Alabama Auburn was more competitive ... yes that that to me that's that's what that could have been for the Democrat\n... yes that that to me that's that's what that could have been for the Democrats that could have been there ... over the top ... to a iron bowl they have it ... but you don't have all that yeah they've gone back to ... or whatever Auburn was ...\nRight and they're doing the same thing they're not trying to be a national sort of thing they do not building off of this by doing what did what Doug Jones have to do to when he had to get Republican voters to come over and vote he had to make Republicans look so out of step\nLet's be fair to say that that the the people that a lot of the people that came in to help Doug Jones when here weren't Alabama Democrats\nKnow was a book or I mean yeah Jason ... given a concert with Cory Booker virus all these all these types but\nYou know that that you do those things just to get the vote out in the in the black community but that's that was a big component there's no doubt about it but I think a\nBigger component that we often overlook is just how the suburbs over the ... suburbs the more affluent places the mountain broach the vest Avi hills how they\nThey went Democrat\nYou have this one moment in time now you know it's an anomaly of us because it was really more on the ballot but then you got to start thinking well instead of having this lab with Roy Moore what will we well we need to start thinking about building off of this and and and messaging ourselves is kinda the same way and\nKeep it in the middle between the lines kind of party they just said oh well that was fun we had our big victory ... was like army beat Notre Dame or something right and then uh the all of a sudden it's it's it's a it's back to business as usual they they're not building off of it they\nThey thought there was going to be a blue wave you get the ... the eyes of their ... to go down the line of these democratic candidates while we we got candidates running in every office this time around that's a step in the right direction\nWe we got candidates running in every office this time around that's a step in the right direction that's just not use has nothing to do with having candidates on the ballot it's all about what the party brand stands for and it has to differentiate itself of the national party\nAnd it has to be something that some Republicans traditional Republican voters in the state of Alabama which are different than anywhere else have to buy into and I think Doug Jones was on that path\nUntil this Kavanaugh stuff and I think people are saying oh he's just doing the Democrats\nHave a ... well said I Will get your tax and calls about that at three or four three zero one zero sakes I Do want to check in with my buddy Angelo and we'll we'll be going as as we get ready for the weekend what's going on the shop\nHad
