the president said he only I can deal with that that's going to be All right for you\n... we're talking about Tonight Show which is an ... or talking about the beer business yeah\nYeah in the summer let's celebrate was a good summer or we talk about the er I learn about the the the amount of leg work that they do to create a brand an image and the brand and how someone will step up to a bar and I'm raising my hand I'm guilty and say I'll just have whatever local I'd be a you got and all that effort towards creating the brand has been a wasted there's a\nA everybody I learned to in the interview with Chris trying to capture the next generation of beer drinker the millennials what are they going to drink what are they going to do\nAnd we know that they are moving from brand to brand they're sampling they're moving all over the place he calls at ... ... getting\nThat's used and the warehouse I got to have so many as ... used to keep up with them 'cause this one will run for a week or a you know there'll be a rush on this one and then a rush on this one and in order to keep up with this fickle demand I gotta keep coming out with new product for them to try and uh this next generation to try\nAnd remain relevant in the marketplace and it just kind of speaks to that valuable old school hard to find these days frankly but drinker in and out of Christmas warehouse like guy the the Bud Light guy that just goes back to the same thing\nChris warehouse like guy the the Bud Light guy that just goes back to the same thing regardless of the countless one hundred new brands that are on your grocery store while\nHe's gonna grab that same brand that he's been familiar with since he was Twenty one man continues to go back to that thing how valuable these people are the companies like crafts and how they retain them how they were dying and keeping them fresh keeping the you know the the product relevant the advertisements funny making these people proud to reach back in that case\nFor that same familiar brand beer I Wonder if\nThat is you know you'll get to some of the big advertising campaign was talking about Super Bowl or whatever the big beer commercials how much of that is recruiting do I mean you always want new customers obviously but how much of that is about recruiting new customers or keeping current customers I remember\nTalking to an ad guy about that one time he said an advertisement has three rolls one is new customers to his current customers three as employees making them proud of the brand that they represent that they stuck on the shelves that they manufacture in the in the brewers so it's a it's a little bit of everything\nAll rising you check out that show tonight of course if you want to go back if he couldn't be here at six you can go to the website\n... dot com where we've got all these shows and they continue to get downloaded we're happy to see a lot of traction on them and getting emails and uh information from across the country for people that are picking these things up listening to them wanting more information are offering feedback it's really pretty cool frankly\nYou know it was great because it's super ... and a as a mobile guy and so many of the voices are people that are from around our area but the messaging is free whether you're in mobile involving county or your you know in New York or Chicago or LA\nAnother one more component will move on uh\nHow many people out there or is it are expecting their children to take care of them I Will move into my with my children I expect my children to care for me and mine for many what is the expectation of people\nI bowl and retirement of the obligation of their children have made my children's sign contracts I take care of me they mind it made me sign contracts that I Would not need their help [laughter] you need a better lawyer bad [laughter] you better children do better lawyer that's right a drug\nSo that is so ... that show a ... about this about this and these are people that are you talking about the younger end of the baby boomers these people are this is retirement time\nYeah so I ... yeah absolutely now I Will turn fifty myself\nIn a matter of months and for the first time I met were happy to say there is a glimmer on the horizon that his retirement the sun has been poked his head up above the horizon but during the little brightness out there that I think yeah I can begin to since it it's still good Fifteen Years away\nBut I look Fifteen Years back and it hadn't taken long to get from Fifteen Years to today that time flew by yeah\nSo I look out forward and say maybe it's gonna fly by again and if so I Need to be thinking about this I think a lot of us will choose a week checking that show out what else you have in the works whether you had a wonderful conversation earlier this week by a guy that's been hit by the tariffs he's lost a huge piece of business he's in the timber business by the tariffs and\nHe's lost a huge piece of business he's in the timber business by the tariffs and he is a very big advocate of the current president's administration so he has been hit hard but he's afraid to complain because he thinks the tariffs are the right thing and I'm very curious though in\nHis ... getting gored and he's but he's still on board\nHe's on board of course he ... he wishes he could go back and say hey I'm all for the tariffs except for my space sure not my space here we go again except for my area of that I write a and I'm curious how many people out there had been hit by the tariffs who are are\nHaving to struggle first to regain the business lost due to this terrorists how many have found in a a an avenue around them the guy that I was talking to said there is an opportunity for us and Mexico we've never pursued it but now it's our sole focus is to go sell our products to Mexico straight from China to Mexico\nA water people doing what is their business out of the tariffs impact them how are they reacting what is their plan forward and I'm also curious\nDo you have a lobbying effort in place by your yeah your manufacturing community to try to knock this thing out so it's no longer impacting you so I'd love to hear from people who have first hand experience and their plans for managing the impact of tariffs on their best we've picked\nThe right down to do that I mean he writes state and ride down even though I think there's a lot of people that are as you described a backers of the president's plan what he's doing but yet there's ... walk down a couple of different streets here in the city and see people that are affected directly by the tariffs\nAnd it's an interesting thing it's an interesting twist loved the president hate what he's done to make continue to love the president right or an odd thing having trouble feeding my family loves the president is it that is that extreme you think in the one guy that I spoke to said it's going to be\nIs it that is that extreme you think in the\nOne guy that I spoke to said it's going to be a huge impact on his business and he's wearing a brave face man and he like you and me realizes this part of the world we are big fans of the president down here and he's afraid to say anything cross to drive so about him rather um but yeah in his case it's pretty extreme\nI tell them how to tell them there's life after that you know sacred takes them time to time and um yeah they still are they're angry at me but if you when you see it's right that he said tried [noise]\nSee it's wrong I don't know you'd see caterpillar a kind of use that same logic yesterday and yet when earnings came out in the market which by the way down all down one sixty right now to dance around one sixty to two hundred today a caterpillar down they said because of tariffs issues three am said something similar uh but then\nHe had companies like horizon that does some serious oversee production on you know they're going to have the phones the command to put their services on there up in earnings so maybe they had to work\nAround maybe they had to work around I certainly am not privy to any of that what about Harley Davidson\nThe down as that that down because of the export market there for their motorcycles is it because of importing you know the steel to build those motorcycles or is it the fact that they were across ways with the president\nThey don't grudge against the metro there's that one and there's also the fact that the Harley Davidson has built a business based on\nBaby boomers trying to remain young and you will you put the two stories together oh yeah baby boomers got to stay cool the exercise of millennials haven't really liked Harley's the same degree boomers getting old they're getting tippy his legs are getting stuck in and holding up a heavy Harley hard to do so there's a demographic factored into this thing to\n... a grab one call here before we finish up and if you plug those headphones in real fast at the underneath the deaths there because we'll do this on the fly like we do everything ah let's go to a ... will go to Tim ...\nLike we do everything ah let's go to a ... will go to Tim ... will grab one call here from Tim Tim Europe\nHey thank God that just happened here the conversation about the ancient and I was just curious when it company phrases

another job and try to build a new uh or one K. or say that other company offered the engine\nUm or do you think it's better if they read it out\nAnd that could be that that sounds like a financial advisor question and it's beyond my expertise I uh I'm unable to confidently answer your question with any amount of credibility to that uh uh you've got a tough decision to make\nSavings is always better than not saving saving more is always better to be saving less that's the rule that's all I can tell you you've got a great question for an advisor\nSo let's see this ... be be listening to the shows in the future get somebody on there to ah you answered this kind of questions\nYeah I I'm I I find this prep for retirement fascinating 'cause it's a perfect mix of extraordinary voluntary
