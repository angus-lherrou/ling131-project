{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WAVH", "content": "Well first and foremost I'm the mother of five children and three daughters and I certainly would be a lot more I'm also the mother of funds\nAnd I would be very concerned about uh my daughter or son I'm telling the truth and making certain that they have the the right to express themselves we hold certainly no ill feelings towards\nUm towards a Christian ... Christine but forward but at the same time we've got to know that the truth matters and an Indiana votes have consequences\nYou know we have a very tight Senate race here as well\nAnd when people choose to initially say they're going to vote for somebody because they are qualified are not qualified and then every five minutes the parameters changes to what we're utilizing to determine our vote people remember that\n... and one of the the biggest things in Indiana that we're saying is mothers are concerned about their children that are going to be the next generation leaders ever being willing to run for anything I've talked to so many millennials boys and girls are young men and young women\nThing I've talked to so many millennials boys and girls are young men and young women that are saying I never want to put my family or myself in that position\nYou know how in the world is judge Kavanaugh holding up underneath all of this especially for his own family [noise] so it's really it's a fascinating to me that these women are making it about race when everybody involved in this particular incident as white\nEducated and an upper income so it's a doesn't make much sense to me that that's\nIt's become about color it's become about um women it really is as much about a judge Kavanaugh having the right to um have his innocence presumed that they fall and be proven guilty so that's\nNot likely ... Indiana I think that's where a lot of voters and Americans come down there they they feel\n... that they didn't have a real strong feeling about Brecht coming on the same way the president said a ... up until we can go I didn't know he was but watching this play out watching that dramatic testimony seeing the accusations and the lack of evidence I think they come down to what you just mentioned\nIt seems a presumption of guilt and something else politics politics is overwhelming all of this this is ideological blood sport\nAnd a man's reputation his family be damned\nWe're going to take this nomination down becomes the marching orders\nNo matter what adult calls\nAnd I think the American people now are about to have a referendum on that idea\nThat you can take down a political opponent at any cost with no evidence and shame destroy use reputation for all the time but in public and even force of a of a woman who's going through some sort of distress into the open to be used as your political weapon\nThrough some sort of distrust into the open to be used as your political weapon that I think is is the Americans look it up and go man this concerns me\nGinger I Want to ask you um you you have a big governor's race a hotly contested one in Georgia between sushi Abramson and Brian Kemp he's up the Republican to burn company two points do you believe female conservatives are going to a rally there in the governor's\nYes I did and I think this Kavanaugh hearing it's going to really play into that because it's making women\nReally upset that people are playing that the women against man card and I'm Stacey Abrams is a woman\nBut Brian count is at a conservative man who stands for our conservative principles personal responsibility limited government and lower taxes all the things that we\nAre that's our party is all about so I really do think and I have seen just in the last week or so across the snake people are more motivated than ever now to get out get out and vote and not only that but volunteer\nThat I was at that kept campaign and the other day people were coming in to get yard signs and the topic of the conversation was exactly what we're talking about the Kavanaugh hearings and\nHow we see this politics they implied out and they'll they they are really playing dirty the leftist playing dirty and people don't want to see this\nThey really are just storage\nYeah no I you know as I look out and watches it it does have all the markings of the last presidential election where we saw a lot of drama for the cameras celebrities coming out now we've had walk out some protests and signs and confrontations with senators and these dramatic moments\nAt the same time in coffee shops in factories in the school on to pick up the kids if you lose some\nTrees in the school on to pick up the kids if you listen closely you're hearing something very different\nThis same dynamic I think is what propelled Trump into office and it was that kind of well he called it the silent majority\nI'm my sense is it just working Americans and Americans are not by nature political activists they don't get out in March there working there working they privately have their views about politics that they express over the dinner table or to their families\nAnd occasionally to their friends but it's not something you go to war over\nAnd ... today in Washington I have to tell you I've seen friendship shattered people simply don't talk to each other\nAnd it's all about politics it's because they they disagree politically and it's become an ugly violent thing where once it was dialogue to try to convince the other person to your point of view today it's slash smash and destroy\nAnd I don't think Americans but particularly women really want that now their core group I think who do and we're seeing them in the streets\nBut moms wives working women I I I don't think it's where they live I'm going to give a quick round Robin we're going to go through everybody again a starting with melody Potter uh from the Virginia Republican Party in West Virginia are your thoughts on where we might be headed here in these midterms\nI think that are due to the situation with this nomination of a a very very qualified a judge the Supreme Court I think that the Republicans are energized to get out and vote a for Republicans conservative Republicans that will support President Trump's agenda\nAnd I think the Democrats were also get out and do the right way to for cable because West Virginia is\nI think the Democrats were also get out and vote the right way to for people because West Virginia's counties there's fifty five of them and all fifty five went for Trump and the election so that meant and twenty sixteen so that means that we had had Democrat votes as well\nAnd I believe that the Democrats also are we're going to get out and vote for Republicans this time so I think that everything's looking good and we love our country and we want to protect our country so and I'm going to spend every last minute I can uh if it's my last breath\nTrying to stand up for what's right for our country\nOkay well I don't want you to do that for a military we now we need you in December so hang it may\nBe my last breath I'm so busy [laughter]\nWell you keep going great to talk to you know junior high our last\nWord do you um you're you're the you're in Georgia or the Republican Party in Georgia or given this enthusiasm we're seeing given the Kavanaugh fight in the in the way it's being processed by voters what impact will it up in the midterms\nI ... I think it is energizing new voters more and I also think that people that were kind of neutral and on the fence that were energized about midterms because a lot of times people don't get excited about the midterms I think we're going to see it where you've heard a lot about the blue wave I Believe the red way is going to come and people are\nSick and tired of being bullied around and they're going to stand up for their freedom so we love our country we care about our country and those people are going to come out of the woodwork and I think it's going to be a ... it's not just going to be a way it's going to be a ... and people are going to be shot shock and awe as what I predict\nA Jody Smith I'm I'm going to end with you you know Republicans are really bad at telling their story I always protect them so there's\nThat they can't tell a story to save their lives in this instance the Democrats gave them a dramatic story that ended up breaking their way how we'll just play the drama the intimacy and the projection I think many voters are engaged\nDrama the intimacy and the projection I think many voters are engaged in as a project themselves on the cabin on his family and what they've been through\n[noise] well I agree with what the other gal says said in Indiana we love our country and we were first on the board for Trump remember that Mike Pence's as logged in Indiana\nAnd we are here to say that we support U.S Supreme court justice that supports the constitution of the United states a living breathing document and for that reason because we are so strong we also will support a senator\nThat will actually be the incumbent because he is an outsider because he is conservative and because he will stand for the values that Hoosiers believe and\nSo we believe that we also are going to see a red wave a red sooner army in our state of voters that come out that never have before just as we saw during the Trump race where people voted for the very first time in their lives\nAnd we're looking for um these numbers to begin changing and that Donnelly will pay quite a price for his stand and saying that he could change his mind remember that he was voted the most ineffective senator in the Senate he could still change his mind and turn around but at the votes against this\nSupreme Court nomination I think that he will see that that he gave us a gift and the state of Indiana because people are going to rally to the cause\nReal fifty one forty nine today the senators voted for cloture but as you're alluding to um I think\nYou love to talk about\nDo with Paul find ball on FM talk one oh six\nBy out of the conversation\nTurning up your voice ... one of the five W.

I'm just going to vote with my party Democrats will take care of me when I get out of office\nWas that I mean does that resonate you just had a conference call yesterday with senator Doug Jones right that resonated oh there\nYou know I I Want to give him the benefit of the doubt but something just tells me that he knows and he can't vote whether Republicans in the situation or they're not going to do there's probably very little political gain I think a lot of the people in two years are on a remember how he voted one way or another\nI think Doug Jones strength was was always I'm going to be my own guy I'm not going to be a priority player I'm going to be a\nWhich could have bit of ... which I think could have been a dangerous political force or in the state dangerous not maybe not dangerous powerful political force if he did come in and somehow\nSoftened the deed behind his name to where you you could have people that voted for him and in the initial ... that would be like you know I mean I wouldn't exactly what I thought but look this guy is come around and look he worked with Republicans on this or he's back to president all that and ah\nYou know in my mind said the Democrats would be so happy\nTo have somebody you know national body would be so happy to have a Democrat in\nOne of the Senate seats in the state of Alabama they would let him\nDo it for you to stay in but here's what I think's going on I you make if he had stuck to his guns on I don't know why he needed you felt the need to get out in front of this eh it's baffling to me they needed to be the guy that speaking out against Brett Gavin\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd you know often I'm On the line with Jeff and all of it I'm On the telephone bond with my buddy Kirby Adele see 'em but now we're all here in person Larry thanks for having us out appreciate you coming at it let's talk about that so the folks who have not been dealt see 'em before um first of all give us a quick directions like like regular people directions like stuff I can understand\nWe are at one point one miles west of the interest a tent and Theodore ... guy\nSo get off come down to the west ours should call itself I Know that's not right but I feel south but getting a let's say okay and I'm\nComing in today number one I was walking through the selection of vehicles as always it's robots and if somebody is looking for you and I ended up talking trucks a bunch but you've got cars all over the place\nAbsolutely and we try to keep a great selection we listen to our customers and even if we don't sell them a car we want to know what they were looking for so if we don't have it they wouldn't go find it and get it for the next person\nAnd you know you and David have done that for me as well I don't even get pretty specific if you say you're looking for a vehicle I mean your your ask me like miles and the color and the you know how many doors that kind of stuff\nBut most people looking for a vehicle or really particularly want a ... a certain color maybe a little bit of you know one two three choice right but they're looking for miles and equipment to make things\nSomebody who was sexually assaulted they once again I it's like\nWe never like the senators are having to ask for you know if it Brett Kavanaugh had a record where he had been convicted this let's say you're done something collar would have been convicted this and then was trying to get confirmed then you could say OK these senators are going to take it on the chin as these protests are saying wind the world would you take somebody like that and put them on on the Supreme Court\nBut they're not and the ... and and it's strange to me because you would think that made these protesters would be there because of the a judicial philosophy bright capital right there'd be there because of how stance on abortion they ... they worry that overturn roe v Wade they worry about uh the but it's there screaming that that the senators are bound to sexual assault\nYou gotta you gotta cut take more of\nElevate your view of this a little bit of or a little higher guy had all that they I think went with the the the me too era\nThis they had to stop Kavanaugh's confirmation they didn't want kids losing the swing vote with Kennedy they know that if Kavanaugh gets from the court has changed for generations yeah so\nSchumer whoever else in the Democratic party are sitting around we got to find something to go after this guy on well how about\nLet's use those plays a let me two\nAnd they but they played that card okay go ahead yeah it's working you know I was saying that they put that card instead of the uh the overturned him in a row\nYou know what I'm saying to me that they would have\nThat would have been I predict where they would have going with it I wouldn't you know before I heard all the goings on you know and and what it came out but you've figured okay I get that that would be a legitimate way for for Democrats to get the base rally that say this guy's going to go in here\nAnd ah they're gonna they're going to reverse roe ...\nThey're gonna ... reverse row ... that ...\nLeast that there's been rulings and things you can ... I I think that's all ... what they want you to talk about what you to see\nI they're worried about other things unrelated to any of those issues ... he's he's the environmental stuff the way he'll rule and some of these things where there's a lot of lot of business interest evolve antitrust who knows what it is already has ... other people other justices agree with him I mean your body and he is the swing vote\nBright all we know we pretty much know are Thomas has got to go pretty much know we're all you know and and when you when you know we we think we know where we think we know we're all these guys are going to go there on the court right now right Brian\nWe didn't really know where Kennedy was gonna go a lot of times right and\nThat that that's that's all ... this is what it comes down to\nThey just pick this issue they could have picked if you look ... Kevin ... record ... ruling against ... so they could have picked the environmental stuff they struck the they went playing with the ... the woman card me to court I thing because it's still issues your the\nIsn't ... but it it it it's just this far\n... how far is that they will\nSay you other than I Would have thought that well yeah I mean ... bunch ... other than I Do you think\nMore senators would run for governor literally and figuratively\nOver uh hey you're gonna conform adjusted it's gonna ... overturn\nRoe or pay your income for justice he's just ... sexual predator\nMean ... you're looking at it there right now I'm going ... thought that was going to stop Donald Trump and it didn't I I don't know what the calculus has there but they focus group to the poll tested that they think\nI'd ... element ... the women's march element of the other democratic movement up right now is is is the most vocal and it's going to get the most results and I you know ... their credit I think they're right I think that's ...\nAnd it's going to get the most results and I you know to their credit I think they're right I think that's the reason we have all these delays and then this all this saga has played out as it has I just think it's just your typical politics and let's not\nLet's not try to get too into the weeds I mean we obviously getting into the weeds with it as it plays out as the vote but just understand why how do we get to this point\nThey didn't just this just happened this letter to the Dianne Feinstein had it all the stuff is it just it didn't just happen they knew they needed an angle here to go after\nCabin I and I think this gave him that best opportunity because it it gets to cameras and it gets people if you turn a blind eye to it it looks bad for Republicans Republicans don't want to be that they don't want to be the old man party even though they are caught in some regards right\nOr they or they just the representation in the Senate is\nThat's the optics of it was the ... at it on there it's it's all the cameras ... you know ... reinforces that um [noise] but you know let's look at a ... there's plenty old people on the ... the all the Democrats on this and talking you know that we're drilling cabin All right\nYeah but that's that was the Cory Booker Kamala Harris okay so less scary Cory Booker Kamala Harris\nSheldon Whitehouse a you know that's that's the whole angle that we can dirty him up in this process but the hope was always the guinea first by catching middle why are you know are are getting some inconsistency and have that a ha moment when they never got that moment and I think this was the car they had to play and they could have had\nThey had their Trump Card it could have been any number of issues that they went with this issue so we like we tend to like really think about these things on those levels and but we need just backed up and look at the politics of it to protect your check sharing just want to stop this what's your best about what's your best play well for\nYou and like you said is working they won't take your calls on this when we get back three four three\n... well yeah and like you said is work and they will take your calls on this when we get back three for three zero one zero six three for three zero one zero six but immobile we are lined at Elsie a motor cars in theater come out and grab a sandwich can get lunch with us\nWhile some of the gay RG news five Alabama senator Doug Jones is commenting on the confirmation process of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court he says it's brought out unprecedented ugliness from both sides\nJones says those for and against the nomination at publicly harassed his colleagues he also said his secretary has been harassed by callers Jones says that he will vote against Kavanaugh's confirmation he called the process rushed and flawed\nMother says bullying is to blame for her son's death now two teenagers have been arrested for assault on a child who later took his own life police say sixteen year old joined the glowing was assaulted at the guy tops of community center last month that happened in Milton skaters have arrested two suspects on battery charges or names have not been released ...
