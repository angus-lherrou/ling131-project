gets Bush league alright for ...\nFor Michigan what they did he wants to they they don't like being on the field but one at ten o'clock they were supposed to get off they ask them to get off of Bush and those guys wouldn't get off\nHe toward the build up a I took my college and toward the build up like he did I Would go to jail that was a criminal act I think I think he should get suspended for one game and I think Harbaugh for not having his players under control and getting them off the field that University of Michigan she'll be fined [noise]\nI'll pass it along to the authorities or do you think didn't bother me when did\nYou do you think that guy had every right to care of that field up like that\nI've always felt the future of somebody else's house you either pay the consequences were you get away with it\nThe future of somebody else's house you either pay the consequences\nFor you get away with a gun away with it\nBut I called the Big Ten coffers today they said they're investigating my daughter is going to do anything about it but I mean let me let me check soon the way to see what he has to say about\nIt or don't don't babies in West Virginia day welcome to our show good afternoon or\nGood afternoon call I have a question and a couple of well really a couple of questions\nYou made a comment a couple of days ago to all this sameness and craziness about the targeting or non targeting the Alabama player of the LSU player\nBut you know the most important thing in athletics is integrity and a level playing field\nAnd you made the comment that I wasn't aware that the director of a ... for the Southeastern Conference which is a graduate of the ... of the premier\nStole ... in football and the call I thought about that after you said that and I just wondered\nHow would people feel of a University of Kentucky graduate was the director of the shooting for for basketball in the ... it just didn't fit\nYou know let me let me talk about this for a second day in in ... and I'm coming from a different perspective because I'm not a partisan here\nBut people that are in positions of authority I have found no again ever you you find public officials cheating and bilking and\nTrying to put one over on the public all the time but for the most part I have found people\nAre honest they have integrity and if they appear\nAre honest they have integrity and if they appear to have a conflict I've always found people to bend over backwards and I will say this and you can laugh\nBut I Know Steve Shaw he used to be a neighbor of mine so I guess I don't quite well when I Lived in Alabama and\nSteve shark cares about his position he ... he cares about the integrity of the Southeastern Conference he is no longer concerned about where he went to school\nIn trying to prop up that school because he knows that people are looking at him and measuring him and when he was an official he never did in Alabama game because that's prohibited prohibited uh so now I\nDon't think uh it by the way I'm not sure he had anything to do with this call this this call was made on the field it was support now he's a he's in he's in he's in the control center\nBut uh he just got through talking to us a week ago on the show about how they have a collaborative effort and they don't want to explain\nI feel strongly about the issues facing today such as the right to defend myself and my family I'm leaving child has a right to life I Believe in smaller government and lower taxes I my family than town or because of these ... I'll be voting Republican on November ...\nHis message is presented and paid for by the Baldwin county Republican Party the national debt is now we're ... trillion dollars what happens next rising

theories and go to\nIman\nAfternoon or good afternoon I\nThat was a great cost that last call because see I see things from both spectrum ... with what you just say or or both of you know there are some things that are questionable and it's easy for us to panic that spans and said things but at the end of the conversation\nAgree with you totally that that these guys really pay attention to who they are talking about the the officials and\nThe concern in the care they have sort of get\nHey I made a booming I mean you're you're a professional you you go into people's homes and\nIn and do work um does the ...\nI I already know the answer but when when you go into an Alabama fans owned it does that matter to you you're still going to fix their\nTheir system or as well as you can then you're a professional you know we are when are when I Walk in I have declared a I\nDeclared that I'm going to do this job and then we'll do it like to ... ... reasonable honest and if there's any issues you come back to make\nBecause that's what I think that you're supposed to represent when you set yourself part like that and you you have to have that or you won't last long and this is what I think I see as a as a fan of college football with LSU a conversation\nSays fans are seeing something right now that we ever seen and did not expect to see we've got the nonsense over here to Alabama business clicking on every cylinder possible\nWe've got the nonsense over here to Alabama that his clicking on every cylinder possum\nAnd we were watching some pretty cool things happening there\nAnd and I believe this the LSU is number one team in the country bar none with what we have seen with our ah as if we're fans and I think everybody would agree that LSU has accomplished more this season than anybody especially when you throw in the pre season hot\nAnd I would love to see these to these two teams line up in the first quarter at complete fool story\nAnd and if something happens during the game you're kicked out injured whatever the case may be we all see that and understand that didn't accept that but his fans we want to see these two with no excuses everybody said he will games they're both good football teams we won't see them at their finest\nAnd uh\nThat's what I think we're missing but you but I also understand this the targeting call you could ... it meets the bare minimum of targeting but I've heard people say well look at him and stand in over to a kid but that's a whole different flag that's called Tony and you don't kick your kid out of the game for that and\nAnd I know my only point I made I I think in ... as you watch you frame after frame it it just made and here we go to a subjectivity or whether it affected the official\nOr not I don't know uh I Love to sit down and talked about official I think it would be pretty entertaining Arron is in Baton Rouge hello Aaron said are you doing today we're doing great thank you\nI only want to talk about the party and all you know that they'll do it over its old old news but uh I just really when you get your opinion on the program with you know the all the six and six dollars coming into the season and I would add or drones but able to accomplish this year or do you think this is something that's sustainable for him or do you think that you know you just had\nAble to accomplish this year uh do you think this is something that's sustainable for him or do you think that you know he just has a really good set of coordinate ... an S. excellent defensive coordinator in an office of quarter that's kind of service boys do any good things but I just want to get your opinion on do you watch it but yeah I mean\nI I guess um my honest answer is I don't know and I say that because I tried I Try not to just jump off and on the bandwagon and uh I didn't see this coming\nMaybe I bought into all the negativity coming out of Baton Rouge and it was definitely coming out of there we weren't making it up a ... and it looked like the place was coming apart the only thing I Would say is is\nI Would I can give you a better answer at the end of the year and I'm not I'm not saying I don't buy what I've seen because everyone buys with what we've seen the only thing that I have seen and you've seen as an issue than as\nWe've seen LA should be ones team going into the Alabama game and coming out of there\nAnother and that's what I Would be concerned about\nAbsolutely will appreciate\nIt may know thanks very good deal uh personally am I happy for it or join yeah like I'm very much\nI think it's a phenomenal story ah I mean if he ends up being the the steward of this program for a long time it's one of the great stories we've we've ever seen my beyond ... who knows a little bit about
