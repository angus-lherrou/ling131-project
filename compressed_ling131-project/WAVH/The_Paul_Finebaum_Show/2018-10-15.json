H. tell\n\n\nI I taught a long\nTo show them\n... years old\nHa\nHa ha\nBunny address them never ever in the way\nHour and it has been pretty exciting a lot of conversation about Auburn situation Georgia's quarterback what about his shoe gators fans happy but let's get to the headlines here as we begin the ... will look at\nEverything in terms of changes what do you look in the mirror though this is a Robert has been coming up big time expectations\n\nThe Washington Post ... they're reliable paper record for Georgia football for Georgia a nightmare in death valley Kirby\nFor Georgia a nightmare in death valley Kirby\nObviously we didn't play our best football game today that responsibility starts involved with me thought she did a hell of a job there quarterback play really well he got 'em in the right place and a lot of run checks and we didn't tackle real well defensively which we've seen before and then all we we couldn't get any rhythm and the second quarter\nAnd it was frustrating all day we had some place where we missed some opportunities um but we didn't make place and we had to and it would probably lost the chicken game for the first time too and that's not indicative of who we are but I don't want to take anything away from LSU for children they did a tremendous job their fans had a tremendous environment\nAnd we got a standard that George we played too and we didn't do that today the good news is we get an opportunity to go out and get to work get better\n[noise] hey my question is how how did the uh Georgia fan invasion down in a tiger stadium workout Dan is up next in Georgia hello Dan ... damn good afternoon\nHow are you doing ball all good order to get your opinion on something I thought going into that game it would be a key to take the crowd out of the game early if we could\nJust go straight into we got was actually the ball after they get their field goal we went down and if I'm not mistaken we didn't even throw cash we were running round and round and and then it came up at the time to kick a field goal and we were in that they feel do\nYou think that was a good call it that one of the game where shall we put the three point\nI don't I don't hate to generalize but I I don't remember seeing all that many good cause all sense William that game\nThat was the only time we really had a little bit of rhythm going and we never got anything after that I just thinking if we put the once on the board and it may have turned out a little bit different anyway\nYeah I I think is a fair point and I uh\nI I Do remember that I mean there were there\nAnd I um\nI Do remember that I mean there were there were just a lot of mistakes made I think in in in game planning that are that are from a thank you very very much good to hear from you\nLet's uh checked out\nAnother Amanda ... in um Kentucky oh America\nHey how's it going ball it's going great thank you\nAlso have a well I'm calling in yet we're from Kentucky but we are huge fans I'm I'm not going to take anything away from LSU bay straight smack does in the mouth Saturday\nUm but everybody's calling for from pet like I'm not sure that we need a cube ... change at the moment I think that bill is gonna be a dude he's gonna be great but where we got was from Cheney like you're going to run it down their throat field was slap\nHurting people there were two allies you guys down after one son and yet he we just abandon the run game like hello and then they wonder Kirby\nJust said like you just replayed his presser and he said we couldn't get a rhythm going off in the late ... Doug because you're playing hokey pokey with the bat you put one in you put the other one in\nThe next guy can play well in that environment and so I think I'm not sure that this is a all going to land on from I mean he did fear lord take effect on that are down but you know he's playing what he's been given\nWell now here you know ... and I think it's important to remember of the season resets or against Florida\nAnd I have\nA pretty good idea what I think is going to happen there you probably do as well so\nI Do and I have to say that plant is he on drug\nMy mom really rich\nOught to drugs are I mean I I mean if you\n...\nYeah I don't know drugs are I mean I I mean if you called siphoning off gas tanks drugs\nAnd like your pain almost got the size than be alone\nRight on that that would allow it by the way you're right I mean that game I mean you get their mug a coup does I mean he he made a gutsy crawl turned the game around and they\nDid absolutely and he talked about he talked about what was he talking about is Mullen eight or whatever but then again if you'll recall that last year Kirby Smart smacked him in the mouth to what was that like thirty eight history or something real like you know so I don't think you know I mean we're going to show up I think this was a step back\nBut I think hurt people flipping around with and I'm hoping will have a bigger combat\nYou know and they didn't tell the name or\nThat it was not a end all be all because the sounds ridiculous but Georgia wins out\nThe national champ it's really that simple\nSt Paul thanks for taking my call Greg you knew where I was going\nYes I did um it is that some so um when they went out and you get to go yeah it's when the red M. that's right just like LSU so I'm using the same spot\n[laughter] if you wanted to ask us really wanted to see a dumpster fire he could have flown the team down to have been as way lower and seen a real one\nUm is sort of set in his own tires on fire\nBut you're right about that I mean the situation is bad today it could get better and it could get worse [noise]\nExactly so here's a a thought I had on the Georgia game when they were all the announcers and people on the ...\nWhen they were all of the announcers and people on the conversation or talk about when it's you know fields when a when is Kirby gonna make the change of ... fields in well there's two reasons why I think it didn't happen and you can\nOffer your opinion on what I'm going to say and that's this the first reason is if you take\nFrom out then you send a message telling that he's not good enough to be the issue and if he's not good enough to be there so LSU how can you be good enough to know them up and then\nYou ruined his psyche for the rest of the year it's not the rest of his career\nThe problem with that is that feels is nowhere near the finished product um and so just like lead and said I mean the guy didn't even throw a passing that game so if you ... you know this all world guy then uh you make the change\nSo he's got two quarterbacks but like most other teams that have two quarterbacks one of them isn't anywhere near ready to take over what do you think\nGreg I'm I'm confused on that I mean I I think it's I understand how you can say he would rooted for I I I think sometimes you just have to roll the roll the dice and try and make something happen and then\nThey explain your way back to it if it doesn't work but I I felt like that game was over unless the unless he uh pull something out of out of his hat that he did and then lost badly\n[noise] in ah Alabama welcome to the program I good evening\n[noise] I don't know how you doing man we're doing great\nI talk to you in a while put a missed a curb is finding out what it's like to play or you don't play your uh [noise] you know you may look bad for saying this but he was playing with mostly rich fliers I fell out Rick\nNo he didn't handle it but it wasn't just him that didn't handle it I don't think the coaching staff handled it I don't think the office of wind handled it I don't think the receivers handle that I think this off and uh as much of a chameleon is it can be let's take what the defense gives that\nGuess what at the end of the day George has got an identity crisis what are they who are they what do they hang their head on what play can they run in the dark they had trouble running any play in broad daylight in Baton Rouge\nSo give us your read or up to this point there were questions questions were answered some of them works answered Saturday in Baton Rouge what your gut feeling on the rest of the season for the for the dogs\nWell I mean I I still think you've got the same questions on your defensive front as Kirby said you know we kinda got what we got we got to make it with what we have a they're not going to grow another six foot five\nThree hundred and twenty pound defensive tackle between now in Florida so they're gonna have to make adjustments probably Gambia gamble a little bit more on defense they've been playing a very comfortable to deep not allowing any big play that I think they're going to have to get more aggressive with their scheme I also think they're going to have to use Justin Fields earlier in games I I understand\nI also think they're going to have to use Justin Fields earlier in game I I understand that you know Kirby wants to shop would and pound the ball and we're teams out well guess what\nLSU didn't get worn out I don't think Florida is going to get worn out I don't think Kentucky is going to get worn out\nI think George has got to change the game plan that six to ... start Paul you set yourself Georgia with six to know in spite of itself they'd been stumbling around a little bit Vanderbilt rush for Ninety One yards and one half tendencies back their quarterback three times\nThere'd been signed that once Georgia was challenged by a team with equal athletic ability and good coaching that this could happen\nLike I Know you're in Georgia now ah but you you covered the the the end of the regime last year in Knoxville you saw the chaotic coaching search all former finally bringing in Jeremy Pruitt are your thoughts on what happens Saturday in Auburn and what it means to the Tennessee program\nNo means a lot you know you'd be the number Twenty one ranked team on the road I think had been twelve years since tendency pulled a road upset to that magnitude when Phil former was still the head\nCoach so I mean that is the wind that Jeremy Pruitt needed he needed that Markey when the first season\nTo give the fans insurance that hey this guy can get it done I Know there have been some questions after last his earlier this year Tennessee has some challenges with their personnel got to tell you this though that quarterback Garrett tunnel stepped up and play the great game Paul to me that's the whole key you don't win in this league without a trigger\nAnd guarantee tunnels plant a lot better than I ever thought he would and that says a lot for that coordinator it says a lot for Garrett tunnel and it says a lot for Jeremy Pruitt 'cause his defense is just plain old nasty I mean he is really scheming 'em up it back to it we had\nCoach former on earlier a and just back to that decision uh certainly a lot of people were wondering where he would go by the time he finally took over we all know it started with Greg she auto and many\nHe finally took over we all know it started with Greg Shawn Otto and many national media criticize the school and then some weren't even sure when we got down to former taking over for John Curry but\nJust remember back to that chaotic moment and to think that tendency football would even have a pulse right now\nYeah you know you gotta give coach former a lot of credit it took ... six days to make a Hi Ernie narrowed it down to three great coordinators deal Tucker and Jeremy Pruitt and I think he like Jeremy ... Jeremy reminds them a little bit of themselves you know Jeremy never been to head coach he'd been an assistant for a very successful coach like coach former was under Johnny Majors\nAnd Jeremy can swim with the sharks and what I mean by that\nIs Jeremy is going to make the hard decisions and do what it takes to win\nHe's going to tell the kids they're going to sit down he's going to recruit over some kids that are currently on the roster is nothing personal never forget the coach and he got a chance to get to know your players yet that proved that in the spring he said I'll get to know when they're on the football field\nThis guy all business Paul ... is a tendency to when he's made some hard choices and the voucher plan tough physical football right now [noise]\nSpeaking of the all business uh my Griffith are with us a couple of things by a again for those who don't know my view covered Tennessee now he's covered Georgia was also a selected as the football riders association beat writer of the year he was worried about a couple of months ago and I've got to give you another another\nA pat on the back I I was once a a longtime sports writer and I now\nSee my colleagues every week and the idea of you have your dress code man you you are bringing it tonight uh giving hope to all those young sports writers are they going to fire to be my Griffith\nOther kind of where Paul I'm just here to represent it got to work for a great company a cocked media group and dog nation dot com with some articles in the Atlanta Journal constitution I'm here to represent those folks and appreciate the opportunity\nArticles in the Atlanta Journal constitution I'm here to represent those boats and appreciate the opportunity and you do it well thanks bike always great to talk to you about Mike Griffin is joining us from Athens\nA interesting perspective there on or what happened in the end is continuing to happen in Tennessee okay you're caught our interview with Philip former earlier it was really a great opportunity to uh talk to him about Saturday's accomplishment we have time to talk to you the final thirty minutes of this show when we return\nOne increase security over your cards regions lock it lets you mock your regions personal cards right from your phone with a touch of a button it secure easy to use in costume Isobel regions member FDIC messaging and data fees may apply\nOn this episode of the world's ...\nLike I say as an aside accounts like what's inside my now\n... can be stricken and ten basic chicken too large mashed potatoes and poor mascot for an again and I\nWhat really matters is pretty incredible what chicken you can teach your life [noise] anyways and railing\n\nClose and I know star with low because Louis has the power tool brands pros count on every day\nComing now during the ... days I get up to thirty five percent off so let's all tools like adult Tony Little cordless drill or a cordless impact driver vote was battery included now Ninety nine dollars each time by ordering ahead on line and your order will be ready for pickup in store stopped by our visit laws for post dot com pretty tail so\nProne now that you know start with low ... ten thirty one last last us on the\nFront of the ... recovery rather receive that delays their office Spring Hill airport at old show also don't sixty plywood agitate job Springfield the ... service wrote in\nThat old shell also develop in sixty five ...\nStates Springfield the ... service wrote an aircraft in Wall Street they want it south water church street now we're no problems downtown but heavier traffic east bound by age ... bay way towards dancing\nAt spring of Toyota thirty sixty to get really boulevard and mobile right across the street from Glasgow they offer the spring of advantage you're trading value out the door ... thirty minutes or less ... twenty five thousand Miles Davis and\nI'm ... but he had to talk when is six five traffic\n[noise] doctor bills forecast is brought to you by chemical metal buildings exceeding expectations for forty seven years called six to six zero five nine for Kim ... metal building that's K.
