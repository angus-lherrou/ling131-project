Bo and uh I like to ask you and then if you don't mind traveling in a talk a little bit about what this honor means to this university on his fans [laughter]\nI think when you look at what Tim as did while he was here\nUm and what he's done since you know I mean he's a ... a transcendent per transcending person you know I mean not just an athlete I'm you know what I mean his his work that he does a around the world is special uh you know what what's crazy is\nHe does a around the world is special uh you know what what's crazy is and I and I got to live at part here you know and him and I got to walk out with with uh with ... and I'm looking I'm like where's tendency okay get them off the practice failed shut up is that was used to doing it that you don't see college players\nThat were you know one name athletes while they're playing college football or around the world and one of the most famous athletes in the world and then he's used that\nStage as an athlete both and you know I think one of the most underrated things he's ever done is played pro baseball you know because I don't think anybody realizes how hard that is you know playing quarterback and playing football and making it to the NFL that's pretty special but are you know that's what his focus was in his intensity and\nYou know he just gonna he's gonna will things to happen and what made him so special but it's really the outside stuff that makes them special person you know I think he he teaches lessons to people around the world anybody that has anything to do with the leaves a better person\nAnytime you have contact with him you leave a better person uh and and the effect it has on people around the world is just special and I'm so I'm proud of you [noise]\n\nYou know\nI think I think for me was special about um tomorrow is um steals my grandfather's dream to see in\nFlorida when an FCC championship he died before that happened you know and\nAnd we talked about it when I got here how much it means to the state to these fans to people and for me being a gate or wasn't something else for years as a lifetime in so to be able to you know bring back you know my kids and hopefully grandkids stadium and say you know we we did some really for\nFunds cool special things here I think that's what's memorable for me\n... you cannot run those years ah no matter what you've done but ... if you had to go back there and you're you're you're you're joked about it but what\nOnce you're done but if you had to go back there and you're you're you're you're joked about it but what what was he like to to be with every day to coach\nAnd also you know I mean we have a more reasonable you know [laughter]\nI mean we have a very unique relationship I Would say that there's probably very few people in the world that within about thirty seconds I can push every button to get him like bright faced read like ready to just like go crazy you know because we spent so much time together you know during those years and\nAh such a great relationship and you know when you're you know I I laugh or the the three years where together I spent more time with him than I did with my wife and\nUm and I mean that's you know that's a true fact than you do you have such a great relationship as so much fun now I mean\nIf you got to understand the the intensity that you said that was all the time um you know he's that intense showing up everyday ready to work ready to be prepared [noise] um you know and uh and doing that as a coach that's what you love you know when you can sit in there and\nYou know you're you're just ball you know what I mean and this is this is how we're going to attack and here's what's gonna happen hairs are gonna execute here's\nHow I Need you to do things leadership\nEvery aspect of of just talking to every aspect of it and um you know he was a young guy I'm you know I mean it was you know you look and and I don't still to this day and sometimes people realize the pressures\nThat he was under as a student athlete you know of of that way of you know you'd sit in the cause and the request and all this stuff that he did that you know and I know I always tried to be the ... tried to be the bad guy we want from practice\nRight I'd always be the bad guy trying to make sure people stay away from 'em and you know and he can still just be a college kid at at times and um [noise]\nBut he he's our head a dentist you probably remember\nWhen I first springs practice cause I enrolled early and spring practice and I had like a it's like our first Wednesday practice\nSpring practice cause I enrolled early in spring practice and I had like a it's like our first Wednesday practice and I had a bad practice finished and the two manager I think I threw a picture Reggie Nelson and I remember going to his office afterwards and I was emotional here looking at me like why are you most shore crime right now and I was like I Do anything to be a great and everything\nI had a long talk after you remember that day and your office and\nUm you know those moments like that where you really you know you learn so much and people talk about just in the games 'cause that's what they get to see but it's behind the scenes in those moments when you you talk or I'll sit there and I'll say but coach small and why\nTeach show me this I don't get it or anything showy and you\nYou learn it and you work through it and you work through your struggles are the good things for the bad things are things that come easy you know practice there'll be so many times where I'd like to me the ball and I'll get it done and if you'd have to train me no you can't just will everything sometimes just trust me in trust the process and this and so it was so much of\nBeing you know getting outside of my comfort zone that's something that goes ... did a great job of as pushed me to places I wasn't comfortable in\nSo in the game I was comfortable and whatever situation we're put in a fair to\nWe had a lot of fun yeah you know one of the things you do see and people don't ... you know to an end meetings we'd have a lot of fun to be on football now you know you sit there on a on a friday you know uh you know we sit in the quarterback meeting in an urban would you know quarterback meetings and start one special teams meetings would start\nRight and everybody knows what it said that forty five minutes special teams ... that's an hour and ... and it might be hard yeah you know will sit there and all of a sudden I'm like okay I'm a guy to meetings done like no special teams just ended we're going to start the meeting now for the office and\nUh so we'd have so much either you'd have a lot of time together and we spent time talking football non football life ... everything and I learned you know I Hope I'm you know to me one of the things that great\nUh everything and I learned you know I Hope I'm you know to me one of the things take great pride in his coach culture you have a positive impact\nOn your players on young people's lives you know and\nI Hope that when I was able to do is was be a positive impact on Kim's life and help them achieve goals that he wanted to achieve in his life because I Know also on the non football Saturday he had an unbelievable positive impact on my life on helping me become the man and the father and the husband that does that or I Try to live up to and the culture that try to live up to every day\nTim I I Know\nIn in ... it's never about you but tomorrow I I Know it's important to your family's cars are here and talk to your dad about it but is there any way to put into words what that this day is going to mean to all the ... and all of your friends and family\nWell I think it means alive it means a lot because it's um I think it's an honor to my parents as much as me to my grandparents to all of the people that have invested all the coaches who have love me cared about me all the players you know proceed Lewis Murphy feel trout line all of the guys that we played with and um you know everyone's invested in that\nBut more than any award or recognition\nTomorrow's about Florida trying to beat LSU [laughter]\nAnd he got that right well I Will say this you know I may not be that I don't think I Know with him no one who he is his name being on\nOn the ring of honor's really special deal but after that ceremony I don't think his intensity outlines going to be completely change on winning the game and we're recognizing the two thousand a national championship team tomorrow and every one of those guys that are on the sideline intensity about winning the game is I\nI Know their competitors they're going to want that just as bad as anything else not to put more pressure on you
