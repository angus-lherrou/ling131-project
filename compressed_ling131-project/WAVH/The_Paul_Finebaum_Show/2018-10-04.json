{"month": "10", "state": "AL", "station": "WAVH", "content": "Hurting up here are boys\nBattle talk blow six five you Amy H\nA big Orange Beach mobiles\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nShe will demand the commissioner of the Southeastern Conference from his office some news today\nAbout the commissioner of the league has extended his contract and congratulations commissioner sank he a um I I mean I Know you must be pleased with uh where you are and where this conference was going\nTo start with where the conferences and where the conference going and it's obviously great to be a part of it so the uh the announcement today and the trust of our presidents and chancellor as as the daughter of exciting but we're right back to work\nNo doubt and I'm ... I'm sure it's a it's\nNot something that you're probably thinking about but it's always nice to move these things off the off off to the side so you can get back to what the ... you're supposed to be doing and what let's talk about this conference first football uh I'm sure you catch the uh the eight people every Sunday afternoon and you know you don't have to look too far for a SEC teams\nWhile I saw I think your tweet where are you made an observation about our performance goes that all so I'm not the only ... come on [laughter] yeah it has come out\nNot only for either ... come on [laughter] yeah it has\nCome on and that's exactly right yeah it's it's it's a testament to the uh support provided to our programs are coaches are student athletes use I was watching your interview with mark and the the progress that's been made in Kentucky's program a year after year and it's taken a while and to see them\nOr at this point in the season uh undefeated as a tribute to them but that's happening all across this greatly way or the good first couple of weeks of all to see that play out through the rest of the season [noise] yeah I Do I\nDo want to ask you about Kentucky because the ... everyone's proud of the accomplishments up there but it it would really gets me commissioner or the fans I mean they have literally taking over\nA this program and many others were such enthusiasm and I think it shows that when when people don't look a too closely at a legal life is they're missing out on some of the great stories [noise]\nThey are you know the first time I ever visited Lexington\nA was in June of two thousand three and obviously you think about basketball there's great tradition there but they have this huge football stadium Mitch Barnhart his staff have completely remodeled that stadium I was there for the Auburn game a couple of years ago on a Thursday night and you saw that\nEnthusiasm and passion play out\nUh we just finished athletics directors meeting like literally a few moments ago Mitch as our chair and like they have a three hundred of their their leading donors traveling the College Station there's an excitement on their team not only for where they are but the chance to play somebody new someplace new\nAnd uh that's part of the excitement that I think they feel as well\nTo make sure I I Want to go back to a ... year tenure nearly three a little bit over three years now since taking over for a commissioner ... we have a graphic on our screen talking about some of the [noise]\n... we have a graphic on our screen talking about some of the\nGreat accomplishments in terms of revenue sixteen national championships so we all were so proud of the basketball tournament this year and that was one of one of the things that I I Know you work so hard on to to make sure the right people were in place and the emphasis on college basketball or with eight in the tournament and of\nCourse a base baseball uh speaks for itself and and so does football I Know that's a lot to digest but as far as part of what you do every day and what this conference represents\nWell we we stand in many ways eyes the commissioner stand on the shoulders of the people in front of me you know my uh close this with my can and working with him here for so many years and what he put in place a and Roy Kramer before him has been a friend of mine for twenty five years and\nAnd even through the legacy of commissioners and the decision making\nSo when I say it's an honor it's an honor to lead this great conference given the status that you just explain but also to to step into the shoes which are are huge in an office to fill given the great leadership this conferences hat overtime and that's produced\nA those outcomes sixteen national championships in the last three years we had eleven runners up last year and you don't want to talk in this leak about second place finishes\nBut to have that many teams out of our Twenty one sports poised to win and and the five national championships aren't across this league AA plus two more and and bowling\nAnd or in a rifle in sports we don't even sponsor but our schools do is just a testament to what happens across the board it's not just a football league or you cited the improvement men's basketball but that women's basketball national championship and Seventeen\nWith two SEC teams to see it happen in baseball and then last year in football again at a testament to the the\nTo see it happening in baseball and then last year in football again at a testament to the the the success and support that our programs enjoy not only do they enjoy they they build upon every year [noise] yeah\nI Know it it's always great when as the commissioner you you go into a a winning locker room uh I also know how difficult it is we've had it in baseball or we saw women's basketball and of course we saw it in football or we know about the winners how difficult is it\nFor you or you're you're happy for ... for the winners of ... of the league but you also have to go and talk to the folks who don't win who have gotten so close\nWell and and we do that at our championships regularly but that's not the end and our teams know that to be a factor is great meaning you know the whole it just means more thing shows around our conference championships those trophies and in the title of an FCC champion\nOr something precious to our teams but then when you go to the national championship level and you're excited you know in early January to both of your teams they are not worry about whether the FCC will have a national champion\nBut at the same moment you see the elation on on one team's face and across her fan base you know there's there's a disappointment that ah that that other team didn't achieve the technical\nWhat's great to see is you take football the the motivation that's present in Kirby and his staff and the excitement that still continues around the University of Georgia program as that's the way you build and\nWhen you keep or having access like we do with the national championship level I think eventually those those trophies that destination will will be there so\nI Know this league is always working with various people are on so many issues last week basketball coaches were and you just alluded to the the athletic director is uh I I think the audience will be insured how how this works because you have a lot of uh\nDirectors or I I think the audience will be insured how how this works because you'd have a lot of a very key important people in those rooms and and I know that you and your staff have pretty a specific agendas how ...\nWhat happens at these conversations\nWe talked about having meaning filled meetings and that's a coin a phrase that we've coined here so we want to make sure whether it's athletics directors or presidents and chancellor me next week coaches\nOr other administrators that we're fully prepared and talking about the importance strategic issues and that's happened over time but we're even more intentional about doing so you know Paul I enjoy that a Destin conversation you and I have\nThe bright lights beside the beach but between\nDestined meetings there was a great deal of work or you take our athletics director is it's almost a bi monthly in person meeting ... monthly conference calls to talk\nThrough issues and as I said for example that media days the football scheduling conversation is one that is a regular topic when we have an annual football focus mating\nOr senior one in the ministry leaders who will produce the next generation of athletic directors I'm convince you've seen Carlo Williams who was at Georgia leaving now leading at Virginia ah but that's the type of of people we have the type of women leaders we have an Nestle\nThose are important conversations talking about things from a vision for our tournaments the how do we ah structure and officiating a fee process that works Ross works for our officials how do we improve\nThat every all of those are are ongoing conversations that happened uh many more times than just along the side of the Gulf of Mexico and invest in every year\nIn terms of the big\nPicture items certainly uh there's always a lot going on on the SEC plate we but we heard of that ad coach in Alabama\nGoing on on the SEC plate we but we heard the coach it Alabama Knicks have been talking about attendance yesterday and then I I Am interested in in your thought not not on that but but overall because uh it seems to be on a lot of people's minds are as we all look forward with this great game\n\n\nYou are with us we'll get\nBack to the calls them areas in Brooklyn hello Jerry good afternoon\nYou're you there Dr David next up David could be my area but\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was a fan talking about the nic said than getting handed the uh of fans\nFor yeah tell you what we'll do either of those you miss it will try to say bring replay that though we we we had that at the very beginning of the show a yesterday at saving is a press availability he he I think there originally or the question if I understand this correctly or he was he was asked about the the fans supporting\nTo uh in terms of what he said about ... about Jay Lynn hurts and then he went on to uh make reference to the lack of fans at the end of a a an eleven o'clock [noise] game against Lafayette\nIt's correct and when a ... bill the students are sororities and the ... kitchen to get more seating and uh you know with them doing that they're taking away from the fans that will pay money\nYeah I'll tell you this is a for those who who just have just come on board I'm sure that would include some of you this is what Nick Saban said yesterday\nThink what makes this a special experience ... when we have you know a great support from uh everybody in the program a everybody that supports the program all of our fans all of our students can honestly say I was a little disappointed that there weren't more students at the last game\nUm so and I think we're trying to address that ah I don't think they're entitled anything eight or ... and me personally I think it ought to be first come first served and it's I don't want to come to the games I don't have to come but I'm sure there's enough people around her to like to go to the games and would like for him to come to because they support the players\nSo I've never said anything about that before you know when I first came here used to play the tradition thing up there and everybody was cheering excited and happy and it was great spirit I now they don't even here they introduce our ...\nFear and excited and happy and it was great spirit probably now they don't even here they introduce our players nobody even cheers so um I don't know maybe there's something else somebody I'm Talking about maybe I shouldn't talk about it maybe already talked about more than I should\nKnow introducing [laughter] nobody here I got to ask somebody who goes to the games that is true K dog is that accurate do you not charity more for your home team\n\nI I yeah I tell you one grim problem was one of those lines down there a rookie there\nI Am Paul how are you working on my rent\nWe're doing great [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise] you go the other room and I'm really\nAppreciate the hand

Alabama than us is very sad news very devastating um but on a on a different note I was telling your screener that I was at my local cops do here in ... California and ran across an act\nOf by the name of the northeast I don't know if you're familiar with who he is but he was Hank I'm Breaking Bad which is my all time favorite series and he lives here in town I've seen them a couple of times but he saw my Alabama's shirts we started talking and apparently a huge Notre Dame fan which I felt sorry for their but anyway\nUm he invited me to his home state of Alabama Notre Dame shit a clash\nOf the uh the uh playoffs so I'm On I'm Sally Notre Dame fan I'm hoping that they open that they ah they can make it through the rest of the season along with Alabama so the two kittens are hooked up again\nThey can make it through the rest of the state it along with Alabama so the two kittens are hooked up again and just thought I'd share that story I was just a just a really really cool guy um had a huge Notre Dame fan so also I just wanted to say I haven't talked since um\nSince uh to his words about a jail and I you know I've been ripping Jay Leno as far as you know I just don't don't think of as much as a quarterback but\nUh I I Can't say enough about his um his uh sportsmanship and is being the team player and and uh at a later on that team I mean hats off to jail for for a stick it out but he put to change it for themselves so anyway I just wanted to get that out\nDoing it right there Oh thank you very much I'm not going to hear from you and we're going to see if we can figure out what's going on these calls here I'm Ronnie is up next in Kentucky you know running\nHey how're you doing All right thanks for the call\nI just wanted to talk about a Terry Wilson are quarterback young and uh his passing day\nUm I Know everybody says it takes a saying in you know as you note that the ban 'em for Russian and everything and I know you know you might have a tough time with that everybody says well terrorist gonna have to um you know fail to pass the ball but I Believe you know in the last few games\nNow he's not getting the big numbers um but he's all but he is getting um his passes and making completion when he needs to 'em so I I Believe these you know doing pretty well let's say\nA Mississippi State he had a couple um key passes um that got touchdowns um you know we're on touchdown drives um last week he had to drive where he had um several pastors in a row that were\nUm completed and help\nSeveral passes in a row that were\nUm completed and help on a touchdown grab 'em back in Florida he had a couple I'm really great passes on so I I just think the fact is it's not that you know he is a terrible asked her I just believe that you know he has his path to limit it because of the running again\nBut he also has um the ability to ask when you need you know when he called the fall and I think ...

I'm kind of like on the east side of Brooklyn you know like the other guy was on a I think the west side or vice versa I'm kind of with mark side you know uh the guy to be called Rochester that's all I had to St Paul ... they\nWere good to hear from you know what can the Brooklyn every every once in a what's on my working out among other two are probably the west side\nSo am I looking out at ... at the uh from the west side okay nothing really matters to me\nLet's move along in the camp is in Gainesville, Georgia hello camp\nI Do not the day we are I think you are well\nI just don't talk about Georgia I mean they got me a little scared I think they're\nAlso has a little while but uh where do you think about it I'm against LSU it's kind of scary\nYou know your your Japan [noise] em em talk one I Can't answer that until I see what happens this this Saturday a LSU goes into Gainesville and wins then um I might favor issue in that game\nIs kinda scary but um yeah that's a scary game\nYeah I I I I'm a I'm not a quiver canning on on that one issue I just would really like to see them or I Know they've done it twice\nOr the Auburn game ... was pretty significant but uh let's see how they do against the gators so thank you very much for the\nCall Jimmy is in Chicago hello Jimmy\nHey Paul uh yeah regarding this uh this saving situation I think lots of ties with students especially you know this this generation and I think most of them don't realize like the\nThe older fans that this is the most prolific ten year period of success in college football history and I think you know they just made me just tend to take it for granted there at an age\nYou know they got a lot of other things going on but I also agree you know I don't want to go that's one thing but but if that's the case then you know make the tickets available to people that really know how important it is that it means a lot too I mean I think the season ticket waiting list is how many years\nReason I don't blame you I mean it's yeah you know the old joke is\nThe list is how many\nYears so it's not a movie I mean it's you know the old joke is you have to wait for somebody to die you have to wait for somebody to die and then the person who inherited to die\n[noise] yeah I mean I think the bottom line is just like the tickets available the people that really want to go and uh you know our our our most likely to stay you know if not to the end of the game will end to it but\nBut only ... everyone is different are you from Matt in town so you're not running to leave the stadium but if you're a student and I'm not defending them one way or another I I like to hear from some when you go to the game it's fifty six to nothing it's\nRight you're you're ready to move\nOn I I don't I I I get that\nThat's fair yeah but it you know it is yeah you know it's just kind of interesting thing you know there's a I guess when you're baking things like that I you know it becomes a a big deal for some people are not as much for others but what I wanted to talk about was I think the most almost totally ignored\nAspect of this off at ... and the success it's had to me has been the plight calling a my clock sleigh I think it's just\nBeen oh edgy brought that up I I was with somebody on a plane or their dad will not ... not identify the person because there are extremely close ties into that program and uh you would know what I'm Talking about Jimmy ah but this person told me a ... and he has an inside view\nOr that that may be the biggest surprise uh because you have a you know ... or ... you had some question marks but ... who many people were did not believe in as the office of coordinator has been a star so far\nThere is no question about it and and then you come by the want to touch if an anus yeah\nMoved you know when he throws the ball squares his shoulders toward the target wanting the rose and you can tell it's ... it's connected to his ... his confidence is so much more visible mouth he really looks comfortable out there\nAnd uh you know those those two coaches had in my mind that just made a tremendous difference and not to mention I mean obviously you know a to a already had a great mechanics and so forth but when you have of a quarterback\nCoach the quality of ... which is obviously makes every body better and it's just been really impressive to watch\n[noise] no it has a great to hear from you or Germany thanks so much Taylor\nIs a calling from Tuscaloosa Taylor welcome to the program good afternoon afternoon barrio I'm I'm doing well so do I understand correctly you are a student\nYes sir I did my undergrad at the University of Alabama and I'm In grad school now so I've been here for seven years um okay so I I feel like I\nI can talk a little more on the students died I you know you hear alumni complaining about students not going well would they failed to mention is they raise the penalties for the students to upgrade the ticket so when we get it it's on our act card and if we want to get a regular ticket you have to pay a penalty well now we can only do one upgrade per season we're in the past\nYou know German or calling out his fans this year I can assure you\nKnow you're right the two guys are speaking from a different pope but let's say at a different level I agree um but but I thought saving it was kind of funny I thought said was being statement but I don't really blame if\nIt wasn't as you know uh it wasn't a classic saving rent or ... or\nTo ask you about what I think is the most interesting part of it and and that's what he always fights in complacency and you've seen leaders at every level a savings always fighting it but I mean right now it's hard to it's hard to get away from it because every I mean there are thirty five point favorite this weekend on the road\nI had a friend check this I don't think there's ever been in in at least recent history of road game in the SEC where Alabama was that big of a favorite\nOh I've said many times do you and other people whether you're looking at athletics or you're looking at business there are plenty of leaders and plenty of organizations that you get to the top there are a few\nThat day for any sustained period of time\nThey are so rare in business you have to look at guys like Jack Welch when he was a GE for like Twenty years Steve Jobs that apple before he died Bill Gates Microsoft before he left the company and went to do other things Warren Buffett around you know as done it so that\nThat is so rare and so when when you look at this string of championships that day then has to look how how how many years was between polar bear Bryant\nStay then has to look how how how many years was it between polar bear Bryant\nDoing that they've been Paul was it Thirty years apart something like that yeah it'll it'll be\nIt'll be that many or more before somebody replicates would say but does that bode got his jumbo get his probably Kirby will get his you know some other names but to win and stay up there like say then is an exhausting exercise\nTalking are here to to Kent Smith mar ah there are there are so many interesting games can we talk to about ... Iran or in the off season and then the the surprising many many people with his success or what's he doing down there is it sustainable\nYou you know what that feels like to pay Paul in a positive sense roars around and I was kind of wondered about him too I feel like I'm\nHe's gotten comfortable in his own skin and uh you know sometimes the most successful leaders are people who just recognize what they are and what they are not and I don't know what went on between him and a Mac\nCanada but that that that got cleaned up he's obviously comfortable with him singer and\nWhether he's got a team good enough to sustain a number five ranking in the country or not\nI don't know but I just think um\nHe settled in and said I'm going to I'm going to be myself I'm a run the team the way I think I ought to and if that works that's great and if it doesn't work out I'll I'll be okay with the outcome and that's a great place for a leader to wind up now many people work very hard trying to be something they're not\nAnd that never works out you know pull a couple of guys that have interested me is a you know that that interview you did with Joe Morehead on friday and yes I said well I'll tell you what that\nOn friday and yeah so is that dark well I'll tell you what that look that he had on his face was as deer in headlights as I've seen that reminded me\nOf last year of some of ... last press conferences that Florida and then and then what that teams and so more head was so tight and and he was he was almost twitch when you bring up Marlins name and the interview and then there's team plays an egg on Saturday\nNight and ... I just wonder uh I don't it's not whether or not he's confident coach there's no dispute about that\nBut I think he's he's gone from maybe a a you know associate Penn State maybe like running a small department store and Pennsylvania to run\nOne of the biggest Wal Mart's are competing with the biggest Wal Mart's down in the southeast conferences and these weren't as a whole different ballgame but boy that that was a worrisome look on his face friday\nYou know you're you're you're correct a and I'm you know in terms of what was transmitted on the screen I can sense of being there he he was he just\nHe kept he was talking but he wasn't but you didn't you didn't really get the sense Kennedy believe that I Want to ask you about another coach you've had experience with him in the SEC who's now at Penn State or he was a\nMore heads boss last year James Franco and continues to put good teams on the on the field competes well and then usually throws all the goodwill away after the game or what about James Franklin Saturday Night\nListen to Paul Paul less than a and and for your listeners here's one thing to remember whenever we're making our judgments the one number one thing that distorts our judgment is pressure so here's Franklin right method to go in the game fourth and five\nHundred thousand people at home against the Ohio State gotta keep that ball they called to time out Ohio State called ...\nThey've got to keep that ball they called to time outs Ohio State cause one he comes back with that play call and even me as sitting at home after that play and I thought that that can't be right but you know what were they doing and\nI'm I'm telling you in my opinion he cracked under pressure bad judgment and then once you do in the post game press conference compounds compounds that by going on Iran\nThat ... what does it apply to the issue and starts talking about the players go into class excuse me coach if they're not going to class you probably should have dealt with that last week or last month or last year\nUm and you know at one point he said we're we're a great team but we're not elite and we've got to get there he could've said that and shut up and people would have bought it and the other thing I heard that I don't buy they said that the the play was fine it just was executed well the military has an old saying every battle plans perfect till the enemy shows up\n[laughter] and\nAh you know I'm sure every football players perfect when they're in a conference room drawn up on paper but I\nDon't know if there's anybody that believe anything was going to happen\nOr should have happened except leave that quarterback send the ball in his hands who got new where you are so I think James Franklin that night in the call that he made and the way he may have been the post conference\nIn the post game press conference was an example of bad judgment under pressure and Paul what I worry that from that one and I asked John Hayes I hate to hear that it makes me wonder not Franklin is hit his stealing because if you make that kind of judgment is that\nKind of moment and you can't just recognize that say you know what I made a mistake that was a good call then your chances of improving beyond that are pretty darn limited so right now uh Franklin we're stopping the stock market I'd say I'm call a top he's peaked in ... near the experts\nI'd say I'm calling laptop he's peaked\nIn ... near the expert I'm just a observer but the tone of his voice out so I gave away a lot too\nYeah and and he he ramble yeah um it was it was that it was that guy a feeling that stress but I I think in those situations all those good no I did handle that the right\nWay and then he had a run in with a band to\nYes he did he was hostile towards a fan and I'm sure that the average shooting is er\nYeah every mile Bob issue I mean that that that's not a good look to to give ... you can do it are no fan like me getting our owner would jump from Tuscaloosa\nCourse now and and Paul we have to remember when you have a visible position like that and you're making money like these guys are making you are really getting paid to make that one tenth\nOf one percent of decisions and judgments at times that they matter everybody else can make the Ninety nine point nine percent decisions when there's no there's nothing on the line but when it's on the line that's what separates you from the pack that's why you're making five million in somebody else's making fifty thousand and\nI and I think he failed on every count showed no knowledge of the fact that it just it's very easy but very hard to sit in a press conference say you know what I think I screwed that call up\nYou know what you're better off staying that and to act like you didn't do where\nYou are what are they stay in power politics Paul the cover of solve is worse than the crime right and I felt like his rant was a ...\nBut you know what is that that bothered me even more I mean because I I\nI did an analysis that Sunday Morning and that was the first time I I heard it I didn't think he had taken responsibility and then I went back and listen he\nHe did but he didn't he said I own it but it was unbelievable\nWent back and listen he he did but he didn't he said I own it but it was unbelievable\nNow it it was not it was not believable\nUm you know people crave leaders who are genuine authentic and the leader who is genuine authentic\nUm well acknowledge when a hit here her make their mistakes because nobody thinks you're infallible and so they don't understand that by sitting there and saying you know what that was a bad call I made\nI could I could have done better there\nI could've helped my team more people would've practically stood up and applauded him his team would've appreciate it and it would've been history instead here it is it's Thursday on your show and we're still\nIt you know it's the same thing urban Meyer did by their language after the fact they perpetuate the issue\nBut I'll never forget the state's burger arose with him once in his team had his ... his quarterback and thrown interception in the end zone on the final play the game I said well what we what were you thinking there is so what do you mean it was a perfect place he just didn't execute\nAnd and and I can you imagine setting those uh those Wolverine fans into a to Z all that ... you know what I Would do and this is why I Would never replace sleep\nI Would get what's the Michigan head gear or whatever it is so you know there were like in the Wolverine or whatever their ears with our do I would grab the Michigan Wolverine headgear the ... I Would start to put it on my head the fans would go crazy and then I Would light a match to it\nHad these that'd be nice [laughter]\nHey can you check on the hazing is he laying on the floor I'd rather see in Haiti today I mean I\nThought by now if you'd be back to normal but that last gasp she ran over Franklin then stopped in fact over him I mean talent have hit it tastes Dana\n[laughter] pretty bad [laughter] hey is hazy so around\nAfter that last guest\nThere's no sign that hazy\n[laughter] I think all of the trail polar rolling down there still rolling the Gainesville may okay\nI made a cold [laughter] hey you\nKnow I'll tell you what they usually though ... that was the first time when when Ken brought up the James Franklin and getting getting into it with the fan on the sideline after the game I I didn't realize that happened or looked at the video not a good look for James\n... not a good look at all and especially one that fans are questioning the call that obviously proves that it was that he was second guessing shelter the snap like that\nBut anyway hey Paul you know I like to come out every once in a while and give a little bit of rape to the media and how they handle things but the the guy I heard yesterday that the sergeant that may be the smartest guy in the media I ever heard by man\nOh yeah he's up in Newark who has a Ohio State number one in the country\nI could I couldn't find any fault with what he was staying at the height\nThe country yeah I could I couldn't find any fault with what do you stay at\nThe height of the big picture of that\nAnd figure out a storage it every time I hear the word surgeon I think a surgeon Carter and an ... Jones down at Tennessee have you put out a PD first Selena I mean I haven't heard from that\nGirl for since the season started out and we are well she's writing a book oh that's right and she showed miserable living in Ohio and you see I Can't remember but she likes to\nCall in and crack on are but in the buckeyes but I never hear are calling in when the Tennessee I still want to FCC game\nI don't think so ... let me ask you this before you go Yes sir uh Larry is up next from Alabama you have any message for him\nI Hope we see you again on January Larry 'cause you know what will happen to you\nAbout that [laughter]\nHey a a a I ...
