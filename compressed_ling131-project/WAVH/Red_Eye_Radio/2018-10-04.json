use Marshall and uh some use a certain types of PVC now they actually have some that that you can use metal and some ... some type of chemicals to print so they can print body parts\nYeah so that's got to be organic that an enemy not necessarily organic since ... been colonel food\nNow I like I uh oh yeah well yeah I Know I said well\nThe reason I bring it up as there's a story that they are they are now selling principle print of three D. portable homes homes political for four thousand bucks\nThey think this is actually going to bring an end homelessness and concrete set up to him yeah kind of it does look concrete light but I'm sure it's plastic it's gotta be plastic right but they they show these tent cities in these in you know a lot of impoverished nations that and I think actually ... ah San Francisco has a tent city somewhere\nI'm probably other major cities do I'm In Seattle yeah um but ah they imprint these homes for four grand and they're not particularly large but there are ... they don't look too bad because you might start ... nice little place to live actually you know Mali any but somebody and they've been\nA lot of those street printing homes and it is some sort of a like a stuck up material it's not plastic that's being used on that\nIt is some sort of a like a stucco material it's not plastic that's being used on that but it's good because they say that it it's great against the elements it holds in uh the temperature it's cooler during the during the summer and warmer during the winter\nI mean it's a there's definitely a lot of positive aspects to it\nYeah it must be interesting to see how that technology continues to evolve we are going to be bringing in our second guest of the evening the how hot they hunted haunted housewives\nA treat charging Kathy Webber and just a moment reminder tomorrow night Rebecca foster would be with us for readings with Rebecca it's the first Thursday of October and we do that in the first Thursday of each month\nYes so make sure your calling in early because of the phone line still up fast\nThis one was this one was fun we get we get a lot of referrals from doing our presentations in our book talk and for anybody in the paranormal who think you make a lot of money off the books we make most of our money I'm from our public speaking gigs we don't make very much money off our books\nBut uh the books turn into opportunity to speak and\nFor books but uh the books turn into opportunities to speak and through that is where we usually make the bulk of our money and because we are trying to make money doing this is as much as we love it and it is a passion we are trying to uh at least offset some of the cost involved in and doing the work that we do\nSo we got a phone call a few months ago from a ... somebody who is who is recommended by one of our libraries and um they said oh I heard you guys are fantastic and we'd love to have you come in and two are bent and it was a senior group and\nI was like oh that that sounds great and she's like oh you come so highly recommended can't wait so we set up the gig and we're all confirmed caffeine I showed up there tonight and his way on the end and about an hour away from where from where I live which is almost another half an hour from were Kathy lives\nSo we show up at the event and it's a senior center at the seniors group\nAnd the first thing they asked us we notice everyone was in costume was\nDo you need a place to change and\nWe're like well no we we we we were okay and I don't you have to put on your your costumes and we thought well maybe it's a costume party and like well we don't really have a costume we\nWe put our aprons army have haunted housewives embroidered aprons everywhere and they're really cute and it's a nice visual and when we do our presentations\nBut she's like well what what do you need for your performance they thought we were doing some sort of of of a singing and dancing or or live action player we're not sure exactly what they expect that we were like it's a PowerPoint presentation we just need a screening a projector\nComplete and remind we met at the end of Young Frankenstein we're ready to monster and Dr ... going to do\nThe end of Young Frankenstein monster ducked friends during the song that became dead so that's what we would be but\nHe was like we want we are going to pull it off to envy we were hurt Lee was bringing the corner going what are we going to do what should we do but we did we did explain to them this isn't a story telling you know we talked about her book and I said the lady\nWe're going to tell some stories and you know it's going to and then it goes story that's good for Halloween and she's like oh okay and she seemed like relieved\nSo we went through our whole thing we didn't ended up we did not get any type of power point information or you know there was no project or there was no screen these ladies had no idea what was going on so there were about fifty of 'em and we just went up and did our best and told our stories\nAnd they didn't fall asleep so we were like this you know they're doing while they're shaking their heads like they're listening and at the very end uh we got ready to to say goodnight\nUh started packing up our things because you know the ladies were ready to move ahead to the brownies\nAnd snack time one lady gets up to offer the prayer before they start their meeting and starts to proselytize on the dangers and the a devil being involved in the paranormal and how what we do we must you know\nCover ourselves in prayer and she just kept going and going and it got worse and worse and I said we better hurry and get outta here they're going to burn off at the state\nSo quickly packed up and like kind\nOf in our heads and ran out of there and she kept going on and on about\nThe demons involved in paranormal and how we shouldn't be so glib about what we're talking about and love my gosh it just ended really badly\nAnd when Theresa had to go back into the building to get something we had forgotten I was we had a plan like if she didn't show up how long 'til I should go in and get rescuer and should I call the police you know\nShow up how long should go in and get rescuer and should I call the police you know because I didn't think this was going to go well [laughter]\nSo we'd go to a few minutes here before we have to do to break 'em I Want to get a sense of when you decided to write this book how did you start to research the stories that ended up being included in the book\nOf the some of the stories are are there well known ghost stories they're they're a historic people so these are real people and real events and um we were fascinated by the history because we we come from up a place of history that's kind of our our our needs we really like the historic uh\nAspects of the paranormal and the stories that we tell so some of these stories just came up when we were looking for things to do presentations on and we found these incredible stories\nAnd uh we we we kept running into a lot of them had this common theme of why they were a love story not necessarily a happy romantic flowers and candy love story but they the the central themes besides the haunting seem to be love\nSo after running into a few of these when we were looking for things to talk about\nWe decided well maybe we can put a bunch of these together like Cathy said some of these are ... are in the ... and in a in a very bad way so they become almost a a a true crime story that happens they have a haunting attached to it but the crime is driven by my passion or obsession\nSo ah we just found that these stories ... ... ah they they stood out to us and then we ... it became a\nJust the job of narrowing down the best ones that we wanted to put in the book where we could represent all the different aspects of love in its various forms and um and people that might be familiar to where readers so not all the stories will be familiar but\nAnd people that might be familiar to where readers so not all the stories will be familiar but many of them people will know who we are talking about or be familiar with the story itself\nAre there any personal experiences do you have either have you experienced any of this year so\nOh yeah we would that personal experiences we we intervene those 'cause like I Can't these first book is a lot of her personal experiences my book was a lot of our adventures together or places that we had been in places we investigated but with for this book since a lot of the stories\nAre very uh famous stories famous haunting famous love stories but we have an entire chapter in the book that deals with animals and pets and pet spirits and and uh that that devotion that our pet showed us and\nHow that law that bond of love is not broken because they animal stories seem to be the most popular people seem to really enjoy that\nI've written for online magazines before in my most popular stories that generated the most traffic were the ones about animals so we have stories in there with people that we know in our own personal experiences with animal spirits and that type of love\nAnd yeah and you're right animal spirits animal on doing this and so forth are so\nI mean everybody loves a man especially when you lose an animal I I've had my own experiences here when I lost my my dog Jake was Thirteen year old black top German Shepherd and still and Jimmy and I have talked about it you know after we lost him lying on the bed going to sleep and\nTold him get up on the bed like you did every night\nUntil later between life and I and so and that's such a\nSuch a great feeling but also it's one of those ones that are the tears your heart out when you when you really when you ask them\nYeah it's an extremely popular and and it's something that every\nYeah this is an extremely popular and and it's something that everybody can relate to so we're very that that chapter in fact we probably could have done a whole book just on that and that is something we can to consider for our next book but\nI'm In even tonight can't these granddaughter was with us at the presentation and\nShe wanted that we wanted to end on happy no because we thought we were going to get burned at the stake the spreads invasion so we we actually cut out our best story like the scariest story in the book we cut that out of the presentation and we added the animal stories in\nAnd I can't these daughter came\nShe gave her little personal story about her uh her pet cat that passed away so I think everybody can relate and even if you maybe don't believe in goes you can relate to that on that you have with your animals and your pets especially you know of that family cat or a dog\nWell because ... they're pretty much just like what are your children they really are and it's just it's amazing because you don't realize how important they are into until you lose them\nOh yeah and that's one of those bonds that I think easily continues on young the grave\nBecause they were so much a part of your daily life but not like a person where we are talking to them but they were just there always and I think because you have\nYou meet with them on a different spiritual level than you do with human beings I just think that that's such a strong bond that it's easy to imagine them still walking down your hall or laying on your bed or the different things that would occur when people say I know that my animals still here with me\nWe're talking with a haunted housewives trees are being kept the weather and we're discussing their new book love beyond the grave true tails of haunted hearts and we're going to take a break and we're going to really get into a lot more of these stories on this book it was Jews and\nReally we're going to get into a lot more of these stories on this book you're listening to Jason in JV beyond reality radio will be back after that you know\nStay tuned for more beyond reality radio\nBe jealous I've been China on line with\n... castle who was an interesting character to just say the least and he he he wasn't a doctor I don't think he was really doctor but he claimed to have this medical background he was working there and there he encountered a young woman named Maria ... does\nThere and there he encountered a young woman named Maria oils\nAnd he believed that she was the woman he was destined to be with his his true love and he had seen visions of her since he was a young man in Germany and then she walks into his hospital and he's in his sixties at this point and she's Twenty one twenty two years old and\nHe basically became her private physician and promised in her family that he could rescue her and safer from tuberculosis which he could not um and unfortunately the story ends with a or doesn't and the story goes on to have poor Maria di\nBut he managed to a\nSet up for her a burial it to me she was in a mausoleum that he had built for\nAnd he used to go visit her in this Muslim for years until one day he decided that her spirit was calling to him from the afterlife for to ... to married to be married they she wanted them to be married and live together as husband and wife\nSo he took her body from the ...\nIt took it back to his home and he did his best to preserve it and he filled her cavities with with with a cloth and paper and\nPut wax on our skin or replaced her eyes with marbles and and put a wigs and and ... in lotions all over her to try to preserve her physical body\nAnd he lived with her in his home as a man and wife in in every way that a man and wife are together\nFor seven years before it was discovered and then it became this national sensation when it was discovered that he had stolen this body from the grave and it was a performing acts of ... on it and living with this\nIt was a performing acts of ... on it and living with this corps\nAnd this poor woman who died of tuberculosis was stolen from her grave uh was raped after death in this home in Key West and then after it was discovered he was arrested and she was put on display again\nAnd it it was just absolutely horrible and the story of curled handler is a very a very popular story and not\nIf you've ever visited Key West you may hear about it 'cause it's\nLike they're the worst thing that ever happened there but it was an international sensation and he was such an interesting character I mean I only touched on is his weirdness and his eccentricities and that story is is probably my favorite because it it's so macabre and so many levels\nAnd then of course it ends with a haunting um but that one is definitely my favorite in the book\nWill unfamiliar with that story and that story broke us some time and I believe her sister is the one who had heard rumors and told the authorities that this was going on when they finally found the situation but he but charged withdraw he went free on that\nHe was he was arrested but he was never charged the only thing they could really charge him with was um abusive a corpse and\nIt had been seven years so the statute of limitations on their crime and run out so yeah he was a\nHe was disgraced and he he he didn't understand he thought he did nothing wrong because in his mind and his warped mine he truly believe that she initiated this\nThis love affair that she she was calling to him from beyond the grave please rescue me I'm cold and dark gets lonely here please take me home I Want to be married to you he was a nut job but the story itself was crazy and it was you're right it was the sister that that her\nBut the story itself was crazy and it was you're right it was the sister that\nThat heard the rumors and say what happened he was to go visit this grave every day and then he stopped what's going on and she's the one who found the grave empty I was very very disturbing I mean I just my heart just breaks for\nFor the oil is family and poor Maria I mean there's so many different aspects that story she was married when she first contract it to ... and her husband was like yeah I'm not sticking around for this he wasn't the for better or worse type apparently so she just had it rough I feel so bad for her and then to to just be\nStill a disgrace like that and to be\nTo be put on display like like some sort of a an oddity I mean that that makes it even worse there's pictures if you look it up if you look the story up you can see pictures of people piling hundreds of people piling past her her ... her corps when she's laid out after her discovery is is really really sad\nLike seven thousand people interviewing us for that one by the name of corals hands were jammed called panther\nWas his real name he he thought he was related to count in a hospital who was this woman who is to be married to the king of Poland and she became exiled and lived in this castle near his home and he thought he was related to her I could not find any\nAny proof that he actually was any relation to her but um it his mind he was a she was her she was his spirit guide according to him\nIn his mind that that person was actually going to have him come home yeah go on to remind we have time for you to tell us when we're in stores\nWell my favorite story is it started as a ... like strange history so it kind of calls to us and this was the legend of many clay and I don't know if you're familiar with it but as I did my research\nThe legend of many ... and I don't know if you're familiar with it\nBut as I did my research I found out many clay was very much a real person her family were real and they did live in Michigan\nAnd the story went on that um many at a young age moved to Michigan near port ... which is the biggest town nearby but they were actually living in forester forester was a shipping town in the Eighteen hundreds they shipped can you imagine lumber\nSo um they built this huge stock in the Eighteen forties like a a feat of engineering at that time nine hundred feet out into Lake Huron and they were welcoming the ships to forester to pick up their lumbering to go about their way I mean at that time it would've been scooters and freighters\nBut um as time went on many had a little bit of wander lost in her heart as a fourteen year old girl and of course she was drawn down to the docks where all the activity and the excitement was\nAnd she visited the dock almost daily when the weather permitted met a sailor\nThen the town got involved because they noticed she met a sailor and we're got back to her parents who were very disapproving\nLocked or in a room so she could not meet her young sailor that she loved and when winter came all she could do is see his ship out there in November leaving the port knowing that he didn't know what had happened to her and she could not say goodbye when um when the spring time came she rushed to the docks\nTrying to find news of her sailor and no one had any information until finally one day a gruff merchant man walked up to me and said I Know where he is he's at the bottom of Lake Huron during the November Gales his ship went down and everyone on board did parish including your love\nWhile many just a young girl was distraught walked home to her\nYour love well many just a young girl was distraught and walked home to her house she got on her best gown and walked through the town a passing by people waving for Laura Lee and walk to the end of the dock\nAnd jumped into Lake Huron and this was April so ... around the great lakes we know the lake is not appropriate for swimming in April was probably between thirty and forty degrees and she drowned almost instantly uh the newspaper article said they grappled for her body for for over an hour or so that's a sad story in itself\nAnd when they pulled me out of the water the a corner listed her as death by suicide\nOr being so upset about losing her her one true love at fourteen\nThat she killed herself and the the legend goes on and the stories continue that this town a forester\nIs still haunted by many ... who wanders along the lake I found quite a few uh as I did my research I found quite a few people saying they had encountered that goes to ... to even to this day um\nThere's like some old buildings there and in the eighties there was such a a an interest in many clay\nThat uh some of the people try to capitalize on the ghost\nBy um like one man owned a steak house and he started advertising he had the best steaks in town and that goes to many Quaid did my hunch is steak house so they started sending tour buses to this man's steak house so that people could get a steak and meet the goes to many clay\nAnd he was found to be you know kind of a little strange and he he actually was brought up on charges of fraud because he didn't have the best steak\n[laughter] and he didn't have the goes to equate either so many ways legend and very much like many stories were familiar with you know she's the goes to his out in the waves calling to young women who's hired have been broken to come and join her or they're in her water\nTwo young women who's hired have been broken to come and join her\nOr they're in her watery grave and she's seen along the banks of a of the lake there in forest are still regularly to this day when I was researching I found songs and and books and all kinds of things dedicated to her and then I caught one of the shows on TV was doing a\nUh some extra than a house

V. or gas tonight for the first hour is ed Rome and he is a Canadian musician also a paranoid and soon as the U.S his website is ed Roman dot net and we will come in to the program head welcome to be on reality radio\nHey thanks so much and go and to be here now that you're coming up so now I'm\nAt what point I Know you're a musician or an ... but at what point did that paranormal enthusiast become part of how you describe yourself\nYou know I guess we're all defined by our experiences and at the same time or limitations but um you know there's so many things that happened to you over a course of your life or or a period of time\nAnd I think um that all sorts of this sort of chalk itself up on the on the belt loop is things you just can't dismiss anymore I always think people will you know they consider certain things circumstances are coincidence inside of those circumstances\nAnd you know a police investigation will consider you know something that's like that as a lead and and for me when things are happening in sort of a staggering fashion\nSometimes I I have to go wait a minute ... there's something happening here I'm In ... then then at the same time growing up with it I guess you you know it's been part of my family allegory as far as like my grandmother telling stories about stuff from the old country classic you know sitting around the kids\nMy grandmother telling stories about stuff from the old country classic you know sitting around the kitchen table at dinnertime and and and I guess you you become sort of almost like hyper aware\nOr and and and some people will say well you know your your anthropomorphizing something and some in some situation as a result of feeling that we're being that way but\nYou know some of the circumstances that have happened to me personally or like you know I I should have put money down on the line because I Would have one in terms of like one to a trillion in terms of that's him next to impossible for that to occur as far as being coincidence\nSo we talked about these experiences that she told this for you or what type of experiences are we talking about well\nMost recent I mean I had a friend pass away I'm a number of years ago but you know it seems like yesterday to me but uh so I'm we're at the wake I go outside I see these three kids that are walking by their the telling a story about\nHow they're they're they're involved in a sort of delinquent activity and and I I'm I'm sitting there arbitrarily kind of like over here in the ... the subject and I go well listen you know like I have to stop you for a second and I think they were worried I was going to like you know\nTurn the men or something and it was like no you have to understand what you guys are talking about right now\nHappened with me in a good friend of mine that just passed away when we were both your age and we did this exact same thing I said look at if I go back in in here nobody is going to believe me so would you please you know following me back and so I can tell them what happened\nAnd as we go in and and you know those people have had you know what's going on and I'm like hey let's not have to tell you something I explain\nAnd you know those people were head you know what's going on and I'm like hey listen I have to tell you something and I explained to us and police goes quiet everybody's like pale face and I said what's wrong and I and they said we were just telling that story and and I see\nThose things and I go to my ... I say to myself well look at you know ... what are the chances of me leaving the room at that point to go outside what are the chances that these three kids would have done the exact same thing and I'd be there to hear it in that urban for a moment late at night\nAnd then go upstairs with these three kids to try to prove this is what happened to me 'cause you're always looking for proof and I found it interesting that that was happening and in there they are talking about\nAnd and I go to myself this is there's a bigger and I don't know I Can't fully explain what the meaning is to me it's my friend going hey buddy\nYou know I'm Still here and and I love you in a way because he was a trickster and he loved to have fun with life and in that exemplifies\nExactly what you know ... ... ... in terms of like look you know I'm going to play around with you to be perfect as far as the scenario was concerned\nSo that that to me and most recently um you know it's something that has really punctuated my my thought process above above that kind of a thing\nAnd this has been going on these types of things for you for um a sexually your whole life\nWell yeah I mean in my in people in my family in general I sit around with my mom sometimes and talk with her and my mom like why you know do you suppose this all happened to like us and she's like well we're weird\nYou know or or whatever we joke about it and stuff and and and she goes I don't know you know ... ... I mean even\nStuff and ... and she goes I don't know you know ... ... I mean even the ... the ... you know like people are like oh here's had with his family UFO story it's like\nYou know when you're young everything that your your family says especially when they're older his greatly impressionable on a young person and you cannot help but like\nYou know your ears perk up because the room goes silent and the story unfolds and and you you know and so like you know my mom would say well you know that happened to us I don't know why it happened to us\nBut you know yeah we have you know in an incident that occurred my my mom was making dinner one night all of a sudden\nThe pipes in the ... started rivaling like underneath the sink and the windows were vibrating a little bit and she was worried that there was something wrong with the ... pump or the furnace\nOr or or Sunday so she went to the basement nothing was arm came back upstairs and the the stairs gave way to like a like a big bay window and she immediately like ducked down because she thought a like a small assessment aircraft\nWhat was going to like hit the house\nAnd then she was she realized after a couple of seconds she's like wait a minute nothing's happened and and then she she said well what is that like and like my grandparents' brothers and sisters we all look out the window and there was this like\nBall of lights or if you will and had a series of sort of a glowing lights that were around the bottom of it there were almost like a vortex of lights this world into themselves and\nIt was very bright almost like an art light according to the story didn't cast any shadows even though it was like night time you know trees\nDidn't cash the shadows even though it was like night time you know treat didn't cast shadows or you know fence posts didn't cast shadows\nAnd then it it sort of lift it up and it my mom's they bounce a ball like follow the topography the landscape and then the next day because of the best thing we live close to a little airport and they had reported some stuff in the local newspapers about tracking some famous they couldn't explain\nAnd the observatory there was a pure and released a couple of reports about it so that kind of weight solidified stuff for me because it was attached to those little what was in the paper\nRight you know well it's always it's always um\nI guess comforting in a way to get some kind of a third party a confirmation that what you experienced isn't something that you experienced alone no credibility to this to it\nWe're talking with ed Roman uh for the first hour of our program tonight to use a Canadian musician Andy paranormal enthusiasts we've just to be done or conversation with that you can visit his website it ed Roman dot net and we're going to continue the conversation on the other side of the break\nAnd the phone numbers aid for four six eight seven six six nine dental fried eight four four six eight seven seven six six now you're listening to Jason in JV beyond really radio will be back after this\n[noise]\nSo this this was like whoa [laughter]\nCommonplace like what do we have for breakfast wait a minute what's what's going on right it goes way back\nWell let's let's quickly jumped to our phone lines we have Chris from Missouri who wants to weigh in he Chris welcome to the program\nHigh it will go to the show and thank you what's on your mind Christmas\nWell first of all I have to say that changed [laughter] any anyway I was going to say in theory about ah this happened about ... the ... when ... came out without Bruce Willis ...\nYeah well anyway we recognize than we did a family thing we had there was probably six couples and probably ten kids and one of the fathers\nRan a local um I got to be by the ... and so he bought tickets for the kids anyway they were in the back of the ... that one was cry and cry and cry and cry and cry you know and I get there and then we see them kind of watch it and it's right at the moment when you find out what happened you know when you figure out the movie\nI'm trying to watch it and it's right at the moment when you find out what happens you know when you figure out the movie\nAnd my daughter kept saying mom mom mom and my great hold on hold on the line like mom you know as I said just a minute and about that kind of one of the moms came over and she said look and she pointed up to this guy\nWell it looked like a Roman candle ball the bigger that was just you know shooting straight down inflamed behind it and I was like oh wow it's it's a media right\nAnd that's the time it's stopped\nIt bounced winters stopped and I'm like oh no it's not and it ... back and forth up\nDown sideways you know several times and then it just split into two diagonally while right after that here come to fighter jets I mean were\nThey were going after it\nAnd I thought it was interesting too that weekend there was a Richards ... at the air force base they had a um air show that we can and then there was also one of the downtown Kansas City airport and whether that was coincide with what we saw that it was awesome I don't know what it was\nInteresting to do with the rain was there any media reports subsequent to them\nSo you know I mean it unless there is normally a meter doesn't stop any balance we're all just like I always have to do the sound effects I go like\nYou know and it just stopped literally stopped and then it went left right that's right you know diagnosed ... up down up down up down really fast and then it gets split into two when one went left and right I Know it\nWas one gone it's gone\nYeah so\nI have another story too about face recognition that happened at the federal building in downtown Kansas City she wanted to hear it\nYou know to to make do with on this one\nOkay well All right I'm we look there to south of vapors from myself a someone drove me and he said you know I Need to go down there too there's some things I have to file too so I'm not the kind of taking care of myself he's standing next to me it doesn't\nThe ... so I'm not the kind of taking care of like that the standing next to and they tended to secret terrorists guy command and they they they're you need to kind of like that and all the away and like why why what's going on anyway\nHe had some kind of as a protest there in the eighties like Nineteen eighty five this happened in two thousand ten they recognized and an escort and not a belt and\nMy well it's been around\nA long time I guess it has been well thank you so much Chris for calling in and sharing that with us and the story about the object in the air that looked like the meteor and then just stopped and made some erratic movements and then split um does that add sounded all like the the orb experience that you were discussing earlier\nNo ... to me and my mum like she describes a craft that\nThat almost seem to like lift off and they're like the fact that there was this sort of description of these lights that were on the bottom half of this sort of like a shaped orb\n... sort of gave way to the idea that it was some kind of a of a craft because she ... she was also talking to a pilot friend of hers that said well what you know like what has life like this and the guys like I don't I don't know what I was lifelike like that and it was silent but everything was vibrating\nAnd she is she's she described it in and everybody's recollection it moved over the barn moved in a self easterly fashion we live on farmlands ... undulating profiles of the topography so\nIt was almost like actually following the landscape and they lost sight of it you know as a dipped into the valley is heading heading south east of where we live so and I guess ... that's when the other thing my dad wasn't there he was out of the council meeting that night\nAnd when he came home and my mom and my family when he's like oh now you're crazy and data so the next day\nHome and my mom and my family when he's like oh and now you're crazy and data so the next day my mom's got the paper see\nI told you you know like we were not crazy right like so that was also why it was part of the you know the story like in the next day you know it was in the paper because I guess a lot of people had seen something and they report it and I remember that timeframe too even in the early seventies and stuff\nAnd I my family be ... huddled around the TV we only had three or four stations\nAnd there'd be some report coming in from somewhere and they're you know people saw this that and the other thing you know cut the commercial I'm asked but again it was like wow you know uh something happened here to my family they\nHave a hard time explaining what it was but this is what we think it was\nBecause I don't think it was plasma or swamp gas or\nYou know and the other thing is I mean I you know ... ... from an aerial perspective we live on on an old creek system and and that particular area itself I Know creeks and water systems or you know occurrence of water they carry subtle bits of energy\nBut at the same time you know if I was flying in an aircraft or something was going on and I needed to follow something a creek or river system would eventually lead me to a lake or an ocean or\nSomething to that effect so I could understand a coastline or more about the area but you know I'm only speculating well obviously he's just it's enough for me to know that that that everybody is like you know it happened and and that's that's what's most important\nWhat we're going to run out of time talking with you and we haven't even touched on the whole sasquatch sightings you and your family of experience so why don't you know are these things that you've experienced yourself or these experiences that you're just you're family members that\nWell the ... I'm going sasquatch but really you know to tell you the truth like I'm Still processing it and in some cases have some fear\nI'm Still processing it and in some cases have some fear of going back to the forest that's backed by my place angst planet quickly like I mean look we have ... in the area and my dog has been chased with a big garden\nGrow a lot of food or I'm going to the garden coyotes with the dog I can hear them in the back forty and they're going crazy so the dog put them in the house and I go back\nAnd there's got to be like an alarming amount of them and their Yelping and nipping usually they're either fighting or carrying something apart or something on a and there I see this in the first impression I have is this what is the person doing and a jump black jumpsuit like this could do soup\nAnd a bell a club in July\nAnd it's facing the the forest where these highways are I Can't see them I hear them Yelping but they refused to come out\nThis thing all within about and I'm I'm kind of coming up to the crust of the hill looking down on the slope of the hill so I'm coming up to this and seeing as a visually as I'm approaching the the crust of the hill\nAnd and I are all of a sudden it ... it coaches down and I lose sight of it 'cause there's a lot of like big raspberry bushes and grape vines and stuff that's in the lower part\nIt both out of there I go down on one knee and almost start to like wanna leave 'cause I'm unsure of what it is on four legs it's bold and it crosses an alarming amount of space\nI Can't be the true judge of it and you know I mean close to fifty feet unlike for downs and at this point\nIt looks it looks felt when I was looking at it and I thought you know ... and we turned it had a very large mass like almost like a football player but it was running like a jak rabbit and then it stops\nIt's like a football player but he was running like a Jack rabbits and then it stopped\nStood up on two feet turned to its left and walked across forty half a forty five acres on those two legs and kept going over a fence line on two legs into the next set of bushes\nAnd I lost sight of it now at this point I was so afraid\nCrawled back for more I was 'cause I was in a half January flexing have looking over my shoulder what's gonna happen here am I going to be attacked visited there\nAnd and went back to the house and started to try to process what happened but it took me months\nTo go back there I Can't talk to contact to John in during the angle who's a well known biologist in the ... the subject he turned me on to some people here you know ... that are part of the researchers organization for this kind of stuff\nThey came up here we did a bunch of looking around I mean this was already months after the fact because I as I pointed out but I I even asked for a couple of hundred friend of mine was like Bill you know you've been hunting for years you know yeah yeah yeah have you ever seen a bear do this now\nYou know like I Know black bears can walking distance\nBut I'm Talking about a ... a big distance and and just\nHe was standing at first then comes right you know again I'm Still at this point trying to process it and and by contacting John you know and I also reached out to a couple of other people but I just was like well this has got to be the natural train of events", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Daphne", "day": "04"}
