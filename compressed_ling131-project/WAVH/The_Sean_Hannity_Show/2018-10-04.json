but as we always do we'll start with go ... miles out as the tigers get ready to travel to Mississippi State this weekend at the six thirty kick three thirty air time here and the Auburn sports network from Davis weight stadium\nAnd a tigers coming off a a win home cutting went over southern mess\nAnd um joked with a lot of people this week about about that last Saturday I said I left the house at ten Fifteen in the morning I got home at ten Fifteen at night it was it was a long day wasn't it cut\nIt really was you know get home I guess I go about eleven and you know when I was planning on getting home or spend time with the grand sons didn't work out and you know really appreciate the fans of static around I mean that's what really stood out to me for those people that stuck around I was much appreciated and of course the gang got closer and they really helped us to to victory\nWhat during that delay because it it's thirty minutes and then it's another thirty in it and it goes on and on I mean what what are the guys doing what can you do because yeah you know\nHe has pretty unique I mean you know when you go in there you think you're going to be in there for a short period of time so I mean from a coach's standpoint I mean we were in there making adjustments here's what we do want to go back out and then you're ready to go and then course over the loudspeaker and you know another thirty minutes and so\nYou kind of take a deep breath and then they said another thirty minutes and probably after about the fourth one that's when you realize that\nThere's still a different deal is we just had our guys just relax a little bit and\nSomeone listening music and I'm just talk to 'em you know coaches kind of the same thing in mind as they got closer you know we just knew it was kind of unique in the sample we had about four minutes before half time\nAnd then the other opposing coach decided you know he's still one of the Fifteen Years you know we were kind of debating whether we just do the five and stay out there but the other ...\nStill one of the Fifteen Years you know we were kind of debating whether we just do the five and stay out there but the other coach wanted to go Fifteen so that's what we did was that the longest one rather delight ... oh yeah yeah there is no doubt I remember when he was fourteen in Arkansas huh you know is probably you know it was quite a bit shorter maybe an hour or so on and\nOf course west Virginian two thousand nine yeah it was probably about to say I am so that was that was along with\nIt as good talking to folks there was a time where I mean I'm not saying they wouldn't have stopped the game but they would not have stopped it for a lightning strike within eight miles I mean there are games that you just play through some of the top and the old days yes you know there's no doubt this is a new day course your practice the same\nWay yeah you know for lightning strikes within eight miles I have to go inside and very fortunate we have an indoor because it hits all the time\nAnd um you know again that was just our first one out in a long time I talk about the wake of practice as you get ready for Mississippi State 'cause you you know it's our first\nReally a true away or a few me road game the FCC in a hostile environment I really think our players are excited about it you know there's something special about that bonding thing that when you go on the road and it's you know Seventy players and coaches against a nearby stadium and\nUh you know there's been good energy I'm your players have a lot of respect from Mississippi State they know they're a good team and got good players and\nUm you know we're expecting to get their best\nIs there more that goes into\nGetting ready for a road game or is it the same is getting ready for a home game or ... factor that at all that a little\nBit different I mean especially your first time in a hostile environment within noise I mean we're really worked hard with the noise and\nEverything goes with the communications and you know if you ever check anything it takes longer than you worry about the clock and so we really been thinking about all those logistical things that we had an experience yet um you know worked on the crowd noise in the red zone third downs and the checks everything that goes with it and uh so then you've got a little bit more\nDown and the checks everything that goes with it and uh so then you've got a little bit more time you know we're a young more time to spend with your with your team you know on a road game which I think it's always good to\nFrom an ... standpoint on the road is always more difficult because that's typically when it's it's the loudest and at that place it's a different I mean it's just different because of the cow bells what are the things that that that you need to work that that you guys work on when you get ready for just going to places like ... where it's\nAll about the ... yeah and you know you just um like I said that the crowd noise the non verbal communication I think is so important\nI always think about snap counts and everything that goes with it and you know in the road you only travel Seventy so you know this will really be a lower number than what we've been dress now and so logistically you know that can be a positive you know as far as just the number on a sideline\nWe wear defenses playing and um you know filled position being so important you know in in league play I just think he's a he's a tree weapon\nI mean obviously what he does on the field as has been impressive but just his age being older I'm sure has also kind of helped him adjust quicker in and help them become a leader\nI think so you know we played profession\nOf helped him adjust quicker and and help them become a lead\nYeah I think so you know we've played professional Australian rules football so you know he's used to the pressurized and stuff like that and the pressure is not been a factor at all and you can kind of sense that he's got to erode confidence about him and I think he's yet that ability even rub off on some other guys to show or one of the team favorites right now\nI'm going into this weekend with with movie a little thing to talk about and I know you can't reveal a a lot of the plan obviously but just how a smart may factor into things a little bit more ... Miller my fault not a factor it and things a little bit\nThe first of all ... Miller we thought did a super job last week you know he's been kind of primarily a third down guy you know he gives us some flexibility and he's a veteran guy you know and I think when you got youthful guys it's always good to veterans out there you know and of course the the freshmen will have a role um you know kind of one of those things ... game\nTo see how each game unfolds and and see who's on\nThe line we have always catch guy smiles on when we come back more questions as well if you have one you still have time to get an email is hey you beat tiger talk at Gmail dot com has the email address or you can send us a tweet to at\nVoice of value tigers will work in some more questions here as we continue on here this next segment all the Mississippi State coming up this Saturday at six thirty kick in and ... and we will be on the air beginning at three thirty central with the with the tiger tailgate show stay tuned tiger talk continues in a moment\nYour family but I'm the one size fits all plant now with the rising blend family can get different unlimited plans starting at forty dollars per line for mind with borderline clientele and limited with I don't pay that means everyone gets the plans they why would I think they don't know what are you waiting\nFor civil rights and and put an end to the one size fits all family plan B.

are so used to travel\nOn jewelry will\nFollow I use sports network on Twitter from behind the scenes contact you can't get anywhere else and look for the link to the daily Auburn Tigers today feature now more tiger job\nOn the show here coach got smiles on whether it's all been able to use your best choice for tailgate wedding and\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReal pleased with that group what when you\nWhen you look at this defense I mean what there's so many things that do stand out but what's the one thing that impressed you use the most about this\nYeah I think how hard we play yeah I mean you know and I think everyone knows their uh their position they understand the defensive coach stills ask them and do they know the ranchers if somebody tries to hurt we adjust um but it's probably the thing that the passion and how hard they play\nIt in this day and age you see all sorts of stats and ... that stand out this week from the defense aside\nA just a job that you guys have been able to do against Nick this child who's one of the well he is quite possibly the best rushing water back ah that ah the the SEC is he has seen since cam obviously but you've held him and his crew to just three point nine yards for Kerry and that's I mean he's a big part\nOf their ... that's a big feet they have no doubt when you to continue that Saturday him and he's a he's like I'm running back and uh [noise]\nYou know anytime that your quarterbacks runner it puts a little bit more stress on the ... plus one runs and everything that goes with it and they've got some good running backs too so it's kind of one of those those double a double for how\nHow do you ... how do you compare Nick which Darryl to uh to uh Cam Newton in terms of not not necessarily tell they're both very good but just the style of play\nWhere I think they're both big guys yeah and they're the type that fall forward you know I I think it's hard to compare anybody can measure you know but ah but they're both\nBig as a defensively also you you guys have not you've tackled well there you you don't miss a lot to tackle Deron Williams\nLeads a leads every one of the SEC in terms of percentage of of miss tackled just for an example and uh that that has been an area again that I mean you know it's obviously very important because in this league if you don't make the tackle bad things are going\nWhere I think that's a big factor too and I'm just real proud of her coaches you know tackling nothing\nBad things are going where I think that's a big factor too and I'm just real proud of her coaches you know tackling I think a lot of its coach and and uh they're Williams you bring up I mean he's had a super year made a lot of impact plays you know one of our team leaders and a really played the high level\nAnd the secondary I thought your secondary was really pressed and really challenge this week I guess other mess I mean and I thought they they they rose to the occasion\nCoach yeah I think so too you know ah you know when when one on one situations I think our technique is improved each game um you know it's not just the older guys I think those three young guys come in there and we don't we don't drop off much and they're starting to get more confidence and not play like a freshmen so they're really helping us out on the debt ... it's\nAll right let's talk a little bit about Mississippi State as you get ready for the bulldogs and we've already talked about the crowd and all of that but just the team itself up from a defensive standpoint very experienced on that front what um I mean what do you see in the personality of the ...\nI think the get non starter back then I thought they were really good defense last year but you're exactly right it starts with them up front and\nYou know they're they're big physical guys you can tell they play with a lot of competition because they've been playing a long time and uh like I said there are two edge guys are extremely athletic um they get great jumps off the ball\nUm they put a lot of pressure on quarterbacks and that's probably the biggest concern you know that I'll be out right now it's just a just how explosive they are on the edge now their internal guys I'm very impressed with the\n... defensively the defense ... shoot I mean he's a guy that's been ... been around a while but you see that every waking asleep\n[laughter] yeah yeah I Know he's at Tennessee ... Penn State before then it's actually the first time we've actually played against them but you know uh he inherited a very talented a defense\nOutside of Nick Fitzgerald you mentioned the running game from Mississippi State of an op ed simply what what do you expect to see\nYou mentioned the running game from Mississippi State of ... what what do you expect to see from coach more heads the\nI mean they got a shortage back from last year I thought was a pretty good all fence and obviously you just said earlier is you got a chance to be the all time leading Russia from a quarterback and the SEC history so\nYou know with that being said with all those guys back you know they're they're\nThey're capable of scoring points and um you know they've got our defenses attention and ah you know we'll we'll see what happened to have you ever cross paths with coach Morehead before and known known not ... we had you know just er meetings um you know the spring and seems like a super again obviously has a very good football coach\nIs yeah I think that's very accurate and you know to states credit they have done a pretty good job of protecting the football they haven't given it away a whole lot they want to turn over a march against Florida last week but just couldn't do anything with the turnover that they got\nA you know so I Hope that continues for for the bulldogs is weak as terms of special teams you know you just looking at raw numbers I think Auburn probably has a little bit of an edge there because they've been ... better than ... ...\n... I think Auburn probably has a little bit of an edge there because they've been ... better than state as they've been consistent in doing that and they've been good and the return game and those are areas where states still trying to build a little bit you know they've they've switch partners in the last week you know it hasn't been a a one guy position\nAnd they're getting better at returning gigs I think Brian colds given him a shot in the arm there but yeah those two areas could certainly have a factor in who walks out with a win on Saturday talk a little bit about\nYour new ad carrots coach Morehead and just kind of ... his personality in the sense of what he wants to do with with his this team this\nWell he's a great guy and you know he's been easy to get to know or he wants to get it right and he's made that very clear to the media he's made it clear to the fan base and he's he's got a track record of demonstrated success especially when you're talking about the often so\nI have confidence that he's going to be able to get it done I just think there's a learning curve here because in a lot of respects while they may look the same to the naked eye when they line up on often it's they're not doing the same things that Dan Mullen had him doing for the last nine years\nThere's a lot more that goes into this Arpaio instead of that power spread read option type game that they had had\nSo I think that just takes time and you know when you're talking about college football or sports in general times not something that a lot of people are willing to give a so you know we've all got to be a little patient here\nAnd as much as we were looking forward to this being a big year and it still could be we just got to be patient and let these guys do their job and hopefully it will begin to translate this week and when you get into playing all western division teams now the rest of the way\nIt'll turn into ... oil it's a it's\nAll western division teams now the rest of the way it'll turn into state as well it's a it's going to be a an interesting I sure feels like the first one to ... he's going to win this thing [laughter]\nSomebody gets toward if somebody gets to twenty you know the defense is there some good\nUh you know Thirteen seven that might be where we're headed well you know let's say oh well I ...

getting ready for their season opener November sixth against scrambling and the coach Geri Williams lawyer was kind enough spent some time with the weather all anti birch um earlier this week I think you're right\nI've spent some time with the weather on average them earlier this week\nGarage spent some time now with tiger's head coach cherry Williams a floor Auburn practice has been done for this ball club just talk about the first couple of days of practice and what are you hoping to get out of these these first practices with the time\nYou know one of the things you know everything's good right now they're excited you know that a lot of energy\nI'm happy to be off the track and running so they have to be in the gym right now we're just looking to get you know a little bit more rhythm and things you know we we had a few people that were our hurt 'em so now we've got some bodies and it's good to go against the scout team gets a little bit more competitive and not just going against each other\nAnd talk about the the depths of this dream because you certainly got some more options with a with an outstanding freshman class a top Fifteen new freshman class coming\nYeah I think that's going to be one of the big differences to be able to have some really good players coming off the bench I'm not saying that we have our starting lineup yet but either way we've got better skilled players coming off the bench that can really help us a lot\nUm you know with with the return and deny a McKay and Asia Alexandria and unique Thompson we know what we're getting there are now when you add you know a lot more ... you know small players with them as well it's definitely a better combination and that's what we've seen throughout these practices\nTalk about a couple of kids that were on campus for your last year but did not play one of those is crystal for him who had to sit out a year after transferring from Duke what what can she bring to your lineup\nShe definitely brings the experience you know plan at the highest level you know plan and the ACC she's been a great addition you know to us this far\nUm ... white who set out last year um also another you know another big art you know both her and crystal both um ... give us you know some rebounded from the guard positions both of them can get on the ball\nUm the guards that give us you know some rebounded from the guard positions both of them can get on the block and smoke and post up smaller defender so it definitely gives you a different looking office at\nDefensively what did they bring to the game or do you know that right now\nI don't know because they haven't been any you got to be enough to understand what's going on [laughter] you know actually both of them right now practice have been at the top and one thing that they learn to play in the top of the press is work up there\nThat is I mean you look at at the top of your press in\nAuburn always pressure so the top of the defense [laughter]\nBasically and it it takes a little while to learn exactly what you're looking for from a fruit yeah trying to raise Tanner and seeing the Mohamed and ... and you know jazz up top jazz Jones up top I mean it takes a little bit to to learn exactly it's kinda like you're the point guard of the different sort of that [laughter]\nIt does and then you almost gotta get into a rhythm where you're playing it yourself you know sometimes when they start out there trying to do everything you know the right way and do this and do that when really there's really no rules up there you know you want to kind of try to play as free as you can with the lowest wagging little grass it and this is well\nJohn McCain's back it's hard to believe she's senior I mean 'cause she's been she's been starting almost since day one as as your your point guard a and you look at what she has done through her career the game that she had against St john's down at Baylor\nAnd the NC double a tournament that was kind of her coming out party so to speak and what she's done for you I mean she's turned in just an outstanding career and hopefully they're even better senior season coming\nOh yeah absolutely we want deny it works extremely hard and and she's been great for you know the last three years even want her to have a fair bit senior year\nThis year maybe a little different you know she might not be called upon to score as much as she has been but what we need her to do is to create schooling for other people as well and I think that's one thing that she has done this often you know as well\nFor other people as well and I think that's one thing that she has done this often you know as we started season is she's finding unique in days Alexandra little bit more but tonight so quick I mean she can get ... she's going to make the defense attract to her and she's been doing a very good job of kicking out are dropping off", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show",
