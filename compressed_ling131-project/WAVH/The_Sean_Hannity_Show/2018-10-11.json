chemicals all your gas\nHey Jodie aware here of course at the beautiful nexus cinema dining facility adjust off of you wrote south agree lot out here in West mobile I've got a crab ... coming so uh that's gonna that's gonna be a nice and I know you've looked at the the food menu here what do you think you're going to be bringing it\nIs we of course are prepared to the dog lover and football and maybe drowned some of our sorrows and some cholesterol or their boots\nTo to talk of and football and maybe drowned some of our sorrows and some cholesterol\n... shrimp is amazing so either the voters shrimp or if I may make no mistake by\nThose are very good winters on both cases so I'll let you have the choice there I of course like I said I'm going to get that crab Everest but as we as we medicate with food here and I tried to sue there are wounds another disappointing effort for the tigers on Saturday a\nIt's a again disappointing in that I think the\nThe team is not performing up to capabilities is one thing if you don't have the players and you don't have the horses to do certain things and you don't perform to expectation that way but it's another thing altogether if you've got the capacity if you've got the players if you've got whatever tools you have at your disposal whether it's\nYou know cutting down trees and you've got a hack saw versus a chainsaw or whether\nYou know you're trying to print something out and you got a a a printer versus a typewriter if you got the right tools you can make it happen in Albany got better tools offensively then they're using right now in my view wrong anyway\nMore that's why I think it's so frustrating because we have the players\nUm and undoubtedly we have some of the some of the best coaches in college football but obviously is a disconnect going on I don't know if it's in the coaches meetings or or or what have you but it's a total disconnect going on with all the talent that we have\nAnd the the I guess the the play that we shall we can and we got on Saturday is is not Auburn football\nWell defensively again we gave up over three hundred yards rushing three hundred and forty nine that's unacceptable only twenty two points let limit them to sixteen points until the very last few minutes of the game but still [noise]\nSixteen points until the very last few minutes of the game but still you can't give that many points and uh or gives you that many yards rushing the ball and that's we've looked at the numbers of of snacks every week we talk about defense of snaps\nYou got it right there in front of your Marlin Davidson played sixty six naps Nate Koch fifty six that's a lot of wear and tear on those guys there's going to show up down the road and in the fourth quarter when this course ... not only when you're dispirited because officers of doing anything but when you get out there that long\nComic possession state hit the ball forty almost forty two minutes we had an Eighteen minutes [noise]\nThat's a recipe for not just to last for disaster going forward\nMama living witness that if you're playing over fifty sixty ... it's a high percentage change that you're going to lose you know I I I live that I did it and uh was one of the most frustrating seasons that I've had you know when I play far\nI'm probably going to be one of my favorites that for every time I come in now again the crab Evers and I know that you\nFavors it out for every time I come in now\nAgain the crab Evers and I know that you've had to enter a big fan of the fillet mignon bikes and those are treated you right before as well as the ... shrimp so folks um tell you when you come out here and go to a movie and watch a movie here\nYou're sitting in a lazy boy they bring food drinks and I'm not talking about popcorn and in hot dogs unless that's what you want but we're talking about crab popcorn shrimp fried shrimp or chicken bites you talking about flaming yawned bites\nNachos beer specials\nA harder ... you feel like you needed your number and then you might need it this week but it's just it's brought to your lazy boy\nAs you and you order on an eye pad it's a fantastic experience and I really encourage you to come out this is a great place to come watch a movie can watch the ball games on the\nSixteenth big screen TVs we've got an ear they plus they have a new coffee bar in the morning if you want to come at seven o'clock on your way into work and you live out this way great coffee in the morning to get your day started right so come on by next to send them a dining cannot recommend\nThis place enough and they say it's for the uh the previous break we were talking about defense and [noise]\nI think defensively will be as good as as anything we play going forward regardless I mean it's not going to be about [noise] about us and again even though we lost the game defensively gave up a bunch of your way too many yards on the ground [noise]\nBut didn't give up a lot of points sixteen till the very end and you could argue that play at the very end of the first half\nOr did they only gave up seven points but you as as coach Kevin Steele said someone asked him about that he said well we should have to put in the backfield where the blitz called we had a chance to make the play in the backfield didn't make it you can't make it let it be close enough that you put\nTo play in the backfield didn't make it you can't make it let it be close enough that you put the referees hands do not put it in the referees hands and that's why you don't reach the ball as the goal line you don't give them a chance to take it away from me so\nWith that in mind tell you tell me what you think and what what can they do this week or do you expect him to play the way they had been playing this week against Tennessee\nA lot of missed opportunities ah this past Saturday defensively that has been a strong suit farming football for a long time and I don't see it changing Kevin steals a great defensive coordinator problem one of the best minds and again\nI'm I'm a hundred percent sure that he's going to have those guys focus and ready to go indefinitely bounce back this tendency game\nWe have a caller on the line that's go ahead and take that call go ahead you're on the all the talk radio program\nYeah got a couple of questions for a sea uh regards to the events because those guys have been playing wife out all year or the Shawn Davis was obviously has been breeding 'em something planning that don't want to go job\nBut then that caused you any condescension locker room because man those guys have got to be just a ... I don't care really humid and where you're at the bus in your book and the judge terms or returning senior\nAnd uh and look what we're turning junior wrote her dream but it looks to be like he's progressed and do you think\nFrom a quarterback standpoint developing alive as girls actually capable of actually developing a quarterback I mean you can't count ... Marshall because those guys are just you know building unicorns I'll hang up on us\nWell and do your ... he jumps in lists like keep them do forget that Nick Marshall actually was worse his senior year then he was a junior statistically and we were also obviously record why so a ACL let you answer manual of\nMental question\nA defense the guy that was in the same situation I'm as a defense of mind\nThe defense the guy that was in the same situation\nI'm as a defense Amman and what I teach my kids and I'm pretty sure what's going on in that locker room is coast Kevin Steele is saying\nIf they don't score they don't win you know and that's when it comes down to you know if I'm giving up points that the defense of guy how can I argue about what the office is doing even if we score three points there should be three zero\nYou know that I mean it may cause a little tension but at the end of the day when I teach to my younger guys and what I thought of when I was in the same position is to close my eyes when officers on the field\nThere's nothing that dolphins can do besides score points and the only thing I can do defensively if given the ball as many times as we can to put them in better position to score the ball\n[noise] well and we did that first ah one of our series a down to get a three now the intercept a pass getting them the ball gets all of a small but forty aren't once we get about nine yards and then on that a\nThird down in about four or five those stream past the movie what low he gets outside of Calvin actually is one guy\nAnd Calvin actually could just redirect him a little bit what was going to get a lot more your niche and actually didn't do anything and of course later on in the game we saw\nThat a Montana sweat that even defend from Mississippi State just abused actually a horse I don't know what the coaches saw during the game that would have led them to believe he could handle it that actually could have handled that even though he was a four or five star recruits he clearly isn't ready for big time yet\nAnd got to got abused there in the last few drives so\nBut we didn't give them any help I compared to you weren't that over and yet back in two thousand on when we went up and played Syracuse and Murray go Crittenden had to guard or tried to block Dwight free and couldn't do it\nAnd my Rico Crittenden had to guard or tried to block Dwight free and couldn't do it almost got for Jason cable killed and it took Jason cable two years to recover from that game [noise] which hopefully unfortunately he did later on thinks of Bobby between those coaching a button that said\nJerry ... still miss and yet they're open receivers\nThat he's just not seeing and he's not pull a trigger getting too and I'm not sure\nWhat's different this year from last year whether he is going ... if you remember you remember the Brody game where we sat grow the eleven times and he just he just stopped looking down feeling was looking for the look for the rash and it looks like that's so ... we're we're Jerry ... is now\nI mean we can't put it all in the office and ... yeah they have their their wools in their mishaps but if I'm standing in the pocket and there's two open received was and I don't get the ball out\nThat's count on the quarterbacks fault too you know so you have you definitely have to get the ball out in a wash this weekend and we got a watch days that I'm a I feel like take a step back every week no last year was a\nA more than adequate quarterback you know ... years back to to be a top quarterback coming out this year\nA maybe a housing hopeful even and your plan below below average in sub par football by not making reason I had no mercy\nHe's the tenth ranger receiver obviously the tenth rated quarterback in the conference right now below ... just about everybody let's go back to the phones and take a call go a caller you're on the talk radio program\nAnd Oreo Oreo I'm not going to be done and I'm Glad you only get three or four minutes and top because I'm not gonna eat what is known a [noise] you know vote you an hour to be in the cinema parking lot in the dark and through you know up in the air\nA lot in the dark and I threw you a football up in the air with no one around you could probably find it I cannot fathom how when nobody is within a twenty yard radius\nDid um can't get the ball to the uh\nI I don't know what happened during the week and I don't know about you guys you know back in the day in my office they hired a consultant\nI thought it was kind of a joke I still do to this day but then we need a consultant to go on the sideline on this time of the week during practice and say well you know what here's my chalk board\nCoach I really don't agree with you doing this and you're doing that I mean what's another couple of million dollars to pay a consultant ... ambience the parents will but you know God this is getting to the point where we're scared of this weekend\nWe got a major major problems\nWell and do your point you make a very good point and we talked about this earlier that it just keeps if this keeps going I expect chitlins you to leave on his own just to professional preservation because he can't have a lotta years on this ... on his resume like this expect to get a big job job holiday with\nThat that was my first instinct I don't know if it's chip I don't know you know I I like coach still taking taking the ... you know taking it and and saying hey this is my phone what happened on my side of the all but I mean you know I don't know can you guys think of any kind of light at the end of the tunnel 'cause for me the doors close them\nWell let me ask you this or have we seen this movie before undergo smells on\nI'm telling you ... you hit the nail on the here\nDoes I mean two thousand Fifteen thousand six to ... no doubt no doubt and was there a different are the same officer recording\nI mean no doubt and was there a different are the same officer coordinator then as we have now I get I get you there um so you know ... is basis change we had different recruit a wide receiver coaches\nThat they made his coach and get ... now\nSo we'll move or changing some of the pythons in the ... and the and the bishops but the king is still the same and so until there's someone\nThat and this is what a senior in I'll give ac credit for it we said earlier and I hope you heard but until someone comes in and they can tell good smells on\nI agree with you and you know apparently seven million a year didn't vote it used to\n[laughter] so maybe that's not a lot of money [laughter] was\nThat I Lived in God's name\nVery precise each call and let's go to Jeffrey ... of all sports dot com and Jeffrey's appreciate your hanging on as we've got to a couple of callers I think you heard the tenor and the attitude of a lot of Harvard fans ... not a lot different from what you\nA lot of Harvard fans traveled a lot not a lot different from what you're hearing around your neck of the woods I'm guessing\nIt uh it mirrors what I read every day on the bunker and and had been reading for several weeks now it it seems like the or the general consensus at least ... at least spreading not just on message board but it's a it's getting out with a lot of frustration definitely who the sand based on you know\nWell and of course my son I got a one of it over and he was telling me there's now a crowd funding or go fund me page to buyout got his cousin a buyout now that's a it's going to take a lot about forty nine million\nBut um is there we we talked about last year after the LSU game\nHow ... it was almost like a ... a switch was was flipped\nAgain but she had carry on Johnson there you had great and Smith It's on an NFL roster you had Austin goals and who is the season the guy you had a dairies James who's inexperienced season guy he had a a a good center experience center in case you know and he's still on it and I fell roster he got that right now and apparently you got to ... we got to rebuild\nJarrett stood him because he's gone Jason Campbell owners are fairly young Jason Campbell right right so\nThat was thinking the other day you know before the season started who would've who would've thought that after six games people will be questioning whether ... needs to be benched or not\nA you know we we knew there were questions on up and it's the law and we didn't think it was going to be bad we didn't think it was going to be terrible and and don't and and now I don't think anybody's going to argue here this mind is um von ... is terrible\nI'm it's inexcusable in my opinion and it's a definitely unacceptable for program on Auburn who you know it's not coming off probation is not limited scholarships who um you know you had to turn over with off line coach that you brought in this technician J. B. crime to supposed to turn these ...\nOver with off line coach but you brought in this technician J. B. crimes who's supposed to turn these guys into a you know what I'm capable lived and um what we what I saw you know whether it's my court and\nAgainst our our cable Kim against LSU my court and against Arkansas or Calvin actually against Mississippi State\n... it ... they were\n[noise] you know it was ... it was embarrassing performances to be honest with you though those three guys right there in those games um didn't look like they had a learned a lot at least this year and\nA a hawk and understand the frustration come from all reside in and then not only do you get the office of wine or the weakness that we all were were thinking going into the season but your street the only strength on off this coming into this season I'm also is it is you know could could you can make an argument to replace him as well so\nA lot of things going bad for all of our own office right now and you look back at the Mississippi State game and I think there were at least three touchdowns left on the field to\nBe over throw some stood them various slate and drop the touchdown pass in the end zone and booby ... low fumbled going in so there's that you know there's Twenty one point that\nYou know we could have been avoided that do you make those plays me as we see you got to make those plays all in all of them should be making those like you know we're we're not talking about Vanderbilt here\nYou know uh [noise] my aunt in years past I Would have said Kentucky but that they're much better than Auburn right now at least going off in soap opera can't be making those mistakes or shouldn't be making those mistakes and certainly can't moving forward\nJeff how you doing\nDoing well ac ah I don't hear your belly grumbling somewhat of a little more I've been listening to sound like you're getting full there\nYeah I got the slimy young by just a little in butter right now it seems pretty awesome is clear pretty awesome\nButter right now ... says pretty awesome is clear pretty awesome can we argue that are counting Ashley against the kid that the sweat came from Mississippi State reminded you of a white free me and my mind Rico when they played Syracuse that year\nOh yeah yeah yeah I'm actually may sweat like an all American no doubt and maybe he is I don't know\nBut in and I was talking to educate our publisher the other day on the block yeah if\nYou would think you'd have running back past blocking running back in there to give kids some help he's a red shirt fresh from you know this is this I don't know how many games played it in this year but he's obviously not a well polished enough to take on a guy like sweat one on one where's the failed um\nYou know what what what else you did he have solvers because different like match protected and make sure the quarterback had time they only going out to receivers sometimes on routes and made it happen\nOr because they were able to give ... through a very good um the biggest problem he has right now the scared he's he he have Chuck can end up he's throwing all he's ... he's expecting he's in his debating pressure you just in case of by getting hit\nAnd until ... office blind or some way somehow can alleviate that I I Can't understand how that is going to change\nIn Geoffrey to your point a missing guys are open he's also he's not seen open receivers on many plays where he's holding and holding the ball\nOr whether it's a check down where he's got a short guy whether it be Chandler Cox for somebody else open for for a short five George gain or guys that are that are okay tell me to open the windows he's just not seeing\nA were talking earlier that it made the analogy looks like ... and the eleven sat game where he was just watching that he was watching the rush come in at some points and it wasn't even looking down the list there was a ...\nHe was watching the rush come in at some point and it wasn't even looking down the list there was one read quick throat\nIs complete snowball ... it's like everything that can go wrong probably my worst the quarterback how can how can a quarterback regrets\nAs much as your demand last year [noise] [noise]\nWell I think ... can you hold on to the next day but we haven't even gotten to the ... the basketball and recruiting but basketball's which can be really exciting and even though we had the a tip off at that too much corner cancelled the way back with more you're on TALK radio program\nIf you'd like to call in at three or four three zero one zero six three for three zero one zero six so Megan San Antonio Komen and rival sports dot com or a ... job Geoffrey laid back with you right after the [noise]\n\n...
