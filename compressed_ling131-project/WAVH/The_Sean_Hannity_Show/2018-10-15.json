all this we can't carry this charade and ms lie out any further we've got to just come clean [noise] All right so I promise that I Would come back with little music and of course we're talking about the whole list was Warren situation\nAnd I got the Trump audio from the rally back in July which is a key here and it really is fascinating audio to listen to\nAnd then we have the chunks of audio from the Elizabeth Warren little five and a half minute documentary short film on her life which\nIs obviously trying to clean up her little acclaim mess of being Native American because she's going to run in twenty twenty there's there's no doubt about it so everyone ever ever ready for song time everyone what to sing along Iran or we go\nOn every now and we'll do it\nOn\nThe six seven eight nine\nOne little is with Lauren\nI think we had enough of that All right so All right I'm not politically correct but it's like I used to seeing that so I was it like preschool I remember we used to sit Indian style\nYou know you you you don't say now it's Chris Cross applesauce beers with political correctness you can't say Indian style and be more now it's it's Chris ... we used to sit in the semi circle the teachers to say All right\nEvery once every ... go over here I remember being like a little while you know the three four year old kid and we all we all sat in the in silent then one day some time back you'd want the Nineteen eighties boom no more sitting in the style\nOr let's get some of the audio here and and again\nAlex kept the some of the audio here and and again\nWho thought that this was a good idea to show such a minute but ten chill amount of Native American DNA who want to Elizabeth Warren's team for the fence was\nSmart I I I don't know [laughter] I mean this bloodline is so scant this bloodline is so distant\nI mean even Democrats are ... are trying to say what\nThe hell is she doing one wanted shaver listeners [laughter] I mean it's this doesn't show that she's a quarter Native American I mean it potentially she is one and one one thousand twenty fourth Native American potentially\nWhich is again I think a bowling ball has more Native American DNA than that\nSo why would she doing this why if you open yourself up the even further scrutiny here why would a lizard was why would you do this\nWhen the proof is not unbelievably conclusive at Wal see is a huge chunk a Native American why would she opened up listen Trump is going to jump all over this why would she Oprah herself up the further ridicule from really the ... the universe but especially president ... why would she do that\nAnd you let Democrats today that are wondering the same exact thing why would she\nEngaging they're so close to the mid term elections I've got the answer she's\n... doodle I she she's a weirdo she is a weird weird bird that\nWe're though she is a weird weird bird\nThat's that's that's the explanation she thinks that this scan evidence is actually exculpatory and helps her\nShe's out of out of a TV show which [laughter] you know she thinks that Trump's taunting actually\nEnergizes her base\nA boy listen I as I said when we first opened the show I this is a clear indication she's trying to mop up this mess finally she made it worse\nWhen how low the potential Indian DNA is in our blood I mean that's that's crazy I mean this is insane [laughter] anyway there before I get to the audio or the the actual\nAnalysis was done by Carlos the bustamante he's a Stanford University professor expert in the field I guess he's consulted to like twenty three and me and some of these other a DNA uh uh companies a and a bottle and there's some stuff on the around that he contributed\nA to um Obama's campaign\nUm we're it's not the same guy so there's a different um some are trying to say oh this guy's an operator for the Democrats um but apparently he's never donated to Elizabeth Warren and it was a different bustamante the donated to the Obama campaign back in two thousand eight\nNow here's can his ... his conclusion\nWas called the vast majority of Elizabeth Warren's ancestry as European but added that the results strongly support the existence of and\nBut added that the results strongly support the existence of an honest mixed Native American ancestor that goes back potentially just to a degree of one one thousand twenty four\nI mean folks I I I\nMean even a ... I don't know how to get to a thousand twenty four I mean it's even sooner than the in good film was when there was slice it up the garlic the garlic in prison so it was way for the in with a razor blade I'd be [laughter] things like that they're on let's get the audio and then I'm going to squeeze in some phone calls\nIf you want to get in if your Native American any thoughts does anyone think this helps Elizabeth Warren\nWhere do you think that this thing just makes them more of a laughing stock I once go back to July\nLet's go back to a great falls Montana and here's how the president got into the one million dollar offer and now they're trying to call Trump on the carpet for this\nGuy [laughter]\n[noise] I think of it [noise]\nShe of the great tribal\nAs a let me think about that\n[noise] me time she's base or life on being a minority\n[noise] oh God this they always want me to apologize for saying it [noise]\nAll used and I apologize\nThe real ...\nOh God this I'm On\nIt's causing a problem you know that name because even the liberals who say they get they get to know\nEven the liberals are saying that gets taken you know the I shouldn't tell you 'cause I like not to give away secrets but this was let's say I'm debating Pocahontas right I\nYou I'll do this I Will take you know those little kids they saw it on television for two dollars a\nLike Ninety nine bucks but as I was born in Scotland just turns out he was born in Puerto Rico and that's okay [noise] you know I says I was born in Germany well he wasn't born in Germany who was born someplace else I'm going to get one of those little kids and in\nWhat did she claims that she's of Indian heritage\nBecause her mother said she has high cheekbones [noise]\nSent her mother says ... we will take that little kids and say oh we have to do it gently because when the me two generations wants to be very just [noise]\nGently take that Ken and we will slowly toss it hoping it does then editor and injure her arm\nIt only weighs probably two ounces [noise] and we will say\nWill give you a million dollars to your favorite charity\nPaid for by Trump if you take the test or did you hear in India\nAll right so there's the audio and\nWe have Elizabeth Warren telling Trump to pay up ... Elizabeth Warren is down totally Trump hey here's what I Want you to donate the money and it's a it's a Native American or\nOrganization so Lisbon Warren tweets on by the way out real Donald Trump remember seeing on seven fine now was July ... last summer that you give one million dollars to a charity of my choice if my\nGiven one million dollars to a charity of my choice if my DNA showed Native American ancestry I remember and here's the verdict please send the check to the national indigenous women's resource center and then there's a link this is a tweet\nFrom earlier today [noise] [noise]\nYeah but one one thousand twenty fourth potentially on the low end Native American really does that qualify for a million bucks now I Trump today was asked and I have the audio this was that the White House this morning reporters are asking questions as he's a heading out to marine one [noise]", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "Daphne", "day": "15"}
