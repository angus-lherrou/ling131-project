G v or gas tonight for the first hour is at Rome and he is a Canadian musician also a paranoid and soon as the as his website is ed Roman dot net and we welcome him to the program head welcome to be on reality radio\nNet and we welcome him to the program he had bought them to be on reality radio\nHey thanks so much and glad to be here\nNow they're coming up so now I'm at what point I Know you're a musician a and apparently more enthusiastic but at what point did that paranormal enthusiast become part of how you describe yourself\nYou know I ... I guess we're all defined by our experiences and at the same time or limitations but um you know there's so many things that happened to you over a course of your life or our period of time\nAnd I think um that all sorts of this sort of chalk itself up on the on the belt loop is things you you just can't dismiss anymore I always think people will you know they consider certain things circumstances are coincidence inside of those circumstances\nAnd you know a police investigation will consider you know something that's like that as a lead and and for me when things are happening in sort of a staggering fashion\nSometimes I I have to go wait a minute ... there's something happening here um and then then at the same time growing up with it I guess you know it's been part of my family allegory\nAs far as like my grandmother telling stories about stuff from the old country classic you know sitting around the kitchen table at dinnertime\nAnd and I guess you you become sort of almost like hyper aware or and and some people say well you know your your anthropomorphizing something and some in some situation as a result of feeling that we're being that way but\nYou know some of the circumstances that have happened to me personally or like you know I I should have put money down on the long run because I Would have one in terms of like one to a trillion in terms of that's next to impossible for that to occur as far as being coincidence\nSo we talked about\nAs far as being coincidence\nSo when we talk about these experiences that she told this for you or what type of experiences are we talking about well\nMost recently had a friend pass away I'm a number of years ago but you know it seems like yesterday to me but so I'm we're at the wake I go outside I see these three kids that are walking by their their telling a story about\nHow they're they're they're involved in a sort of delinquent activity and and I I'm I'm sitting there arbitrarily kind of like over here in the ... the subject and I go well listen you know like I have to stop you for a second and I think they were worried I was going to like you know\nTurn them in or something and I was like no no you have to understand what you guys are talking about right now\nHappened with me in in in a good friend of mine that just passed away when we were about your age and we did this exact same thing I said look at it if I go back in in here nobody is going to believe me so would you please you know follow me back and so I can tell them what happened\nAnd as we go in and and you know those people were head you know what's going on and I'm like hey listen I have to tell you something and I explained to us and police goes quiet everybody's like pale face\nAnd I said what's wrong and I and they said we were just telling that story and and I\nSee those things and I go to my ... I say to myself well look at you know what are the chances of me leaving the room at that point to go outside what are the chances that these three kids would have done the exact same thing and I'd be there to hear it in that Herbert for a moment late at night\nAnd then go upstairs with these three kids to try to prove this is what happened to me 'cause you're always looking for proof\nTo try to prove this is what happened to me 'cause you're always looking for proof and I found it interesting that that was happening and and they're they are talking about it\nAnd and I go to myself this is there's a bigger and I don't know I Can't fully explain what the meaning is to me it's my friend going hey buddy\nYou know I'm Still here I Am and I love you in a way because he was a trickster and he loved to have fun with life and in that exemplifies\nExactly what you know ... ... in terms of like look you know I'm going to play around with you ... be perfect as far as the scenario was concerned\nSo that that to me in most recently um you know is something that has really punctuated my my thought process above above that kind of a thing\nAnd this has been going on these types of things for you for um a sexually your whole life well\nYeah I mean in my ... people in my family in general I sit around with my mum sometimes and talk with her and my mom like why you know do you suppose this all happened to like us and she's like well we're weird\nYou know or or whatever we joke about it and stuff and ... and she goes I don't know you know ... ... I mean even the ... you know like people are like oh here's had with his family UFO story it's like\nYou know when you're young everything that your your family says especially when they're older is greatly impressionable on a young person and you cannot help but like\nYou know your ears perk up because the room goes silent in the story unfolds and and you you know so like you know my mom would say well you know that happened to us I don't know why it happened to us\nBut you know we have you know in an incident that occurred my my mom was making dinner\nWe have you know in an incident that occurred my my mom was making dinner one night all of a sudden the pipes in the ... started ride leading like underneath the sink and the windows were vibrating a little bit and she was worried that there was something wrong with the some pomp or the furnace\nOr or or Sunday so she went to the basement nothing was arm came back upstairs and the the stairs gave way to like a like a big bay window and she immediately like ducked down because she thought a like a small Cessna Aircraft\nWhat was going to like hit the house\nAnd then she she realized after a couple of seconds she's like wait a minute nothing's happened and and then she she said well what is that like and like my grandparents' brothers and sisters with all of the window and there was this like\nAll of lights or if you will and had a series of\nSort of a glowing lights that were around the bottom of it there were almost like a vortex of lights that's world into themselves and\nIt was very bright almost like an art light according to the story didn't cash the shadows even though it was late night time you know trees didn't cast shadows a fence posts didn't cast shadows\nAnd then it it sort of lift it up in it but my mom's side of bounce a ball like follow the topography the landscape and then the next day because of the steps and the thing we live close to little airport and they had reported some stuff in the local newspapers about tracking some famous they couldn't explain\nAnd the observatory there was a pure had released a couple of reports about it so that kind of like solidified stuff for me because it was attached to those little what was in the paper right you know\nBecause it was attached to those little what was in the paper\nRight well it's always it's always um\nI guess comforting in a way to get some kind of a third party a confirmation that what you experience isn't something that you experienced alone no that credibility to this to it\nWe're talking with ed Roman uh for the first hour of our program to not use a Canadian musician Andy paranormal enthusiasts we've just to begin our conversation with that you can visit his website it ed Roman dot net and we're going to continue the conversation on the other side of the break\nAnd the phone numbers aid for four six eight seven seven six six and I get into free date for four six eight seven seven six six now you're listening to Jason in JV beyond reality radio will be back after this\n[noise]\nCommonplace like what do we have for breakfast wait a minute what's ... what's going on right it goes way back\nWell what's what's quickly jumped to our phone lines we have Chris from Missouri who wants to weigh in Chris welcome to the program\nHigh it was on the show and thank you which one you're mine Christian\nWell first of all I have to say this go change [laughter] any anyway I was going to say a story about a happened about ... the Louis when a fixed and came out without Bruce Willis ... yeah\nYeah well anyway we're at the drive and we did a family thing we had there was probably six couples and probably ten kids and one of the fathers\nRan a local um government propaganda or something so he bought picture for the kids anyway they were sitting in the back of the truck that one kid was cry and cry and cry and cry and cry you know and I would get very annoyed because I'm trying to watch it and it's right at the moment when you find out what happens you know when you figure out the movie\nAnd my daughter kept saying mom mom mom and I'm like right hold on hold on the line like mom you know it I I think just to me about that kind of one of the moms came over and she looked she pointed up this guy\nWell it looked like a Roman candle Bob the bigger that was just you know shooting straight down inflamed behind it and I was like oh wow it's it's a media right\nAnd about that time it stopped\nIt bounced when it stopped and I'm like oh no it's not and it ... back and forth up down sideways you know several times and then it just split\nHave you back and forth up down sideways you know several times and then it just split into two diagonally while right after that here come to fighter jets I mean we were\nThey were going after it\nAnd I thought it was interesting too that weekend there was a ... at the air force base they had a um air show that we can and then there's also wanted to downtown Kansas City airport now whether that was coincide with what we saw that it was awesome I don't know what it was\nInteresting do you do with the rain was there any media reports subsequent to them so\nYou know I mean it unless there is no hardly a meter doesn't stop me balance your ball is just like I I was actually to the sound effects I got like\n... you know and it just stopped literally stopped and then it went left right that's right you know to diagnose dial up down up down up down really fast and then it just split into two when one went laughter and went right I Know it\nJust one gone it's gone\nYeah so\nI have another story about face recognition that happened at the federal building in downtown Kansas City she want to hear it\nYeah it was just to make a quick on this one\nOkay well I um we went there to south and papers for myself ah someone girls and he said you know I Need to go down there too there's some things I have to file ... so I'm not the kind of taking care of my dad he's standing next to me you know sending to Secret Service guys come in and they they serve you need to come with us\nThey hold him away and like oil what's going on anyway\nHe had had some kind of a protest there in the eighties like Nineteen eighty five this happened in two thousand ten they recognized him and escorted him out of buildings\nAre well yeah it's been around a long time because it has been well thank you so much for calling in and sharing that with this and the story about the object in the air that looked like the meteor and then just stopped and made some radical movements and then split um does that it sounded\nIt made some radical movements and then split um does that add sounded all like the the orb experience that you were discussing earlier\nNo ... to me and my mum like she describes a craft that\nThat almost seem to like lift off and they're like the fact that there was this sort of description of these lights that were on the bottom half of this sort of like aids shaped or ...\nWhat what sort of gave way to the idea that it was some kind of a of a crap because she ... she was also talking to a pilot friend of hers that said well what you know like what has life like this and the guys like I don't I don't know what has lifelike like that and it was silent but everything was vibrating\nAnd she is she's she described it in and everybody's recollection it moved over the barn moved in a self easterly fashion we live on farmland ... undulating profiles of the topography so\nIt was almost like actually following the landscape and they lost sight of it you know as a dipped into the valley is heading heading south east of where we live so\nAnd I guess ... that's when the other thing my dad wasn't there he was out at the council meeting that night and when he came home and my mom and my family when he was like oh no you're crazy and data sort of the next day my mom's got the paper see\nI told you you know like we were not crazy right like so that was also why it was part of the you know the story like in the next day you know it was in the paper because I guess a lot of people had seen something and they report it and I remember that time frame to even in the early seventies and stuff\nNot in my family be huddled around the TV we only had three or four stations\nAnd there'd be some report coming in from somewhere and and they're you know people saw this that and the other thing you know cut the commercial I'm asked but again he was like wow you know uh something happened here to my family\nBut again he was like wow you know or something happened here to my family they\nHave a hard time explaining what it was but this is what we think it was\nBecause I don't think it was plasma or swamp gas or\nYou know and the other thing is I mean I you know [laughter] it from an aerial perspective we live on on an old creek system and and that particular area itself I Know creeks and water systems or you know currents of water they carry subtle bits of energy\nBut at the same time you know if I was flying in an aircraft or something was going on and I needed to follow something a creek or river system would eventually lead me to a lake or an ocean or\nSomething to that effect so I could understand a coastline or more about the area but you know I'm only speculating well obviously it's just it's enough for me to know that that that everybody is like you know it happened and and that's that's what's most important\nWhat we're going to run out of time talking with you and we haven't even touched on the whole sasquatch citing you and your family of experience so why don't you know are these things that you've experienced yourself or these experiences that you're just you're family members of that\nWell the ... I'm going sasquatch but really you know to tell you the truth like I'm Still processing it and\nIn some cases have some fear of going back to the forest that's backed by my place and I'll explain it quickly like I mean look we have coyotes in the area and my dog has been chased with a big garden will grow a lot of food\nOr I'm going to the garden coyotes with the dog I can hear them in the back forty and they're going crazy so the dog put them in the house and I go back\nAnd there's got to be like an alarming amount of them and their Yelping and yet usually they're either fighting or carrying something apart or something on a and Larry see this in the first impression I have is this\nUh and there I see this in the first impression I have is this what is the person doing and a jump black jumpsuit like this could do soup and a bell a club in July\nAnd it's facing the forest where these highways are I Can't see them I hear them Yelping but they refused to come on\nThis thing all within about and I'm I'm kinda coming up to the crust of the hill looking down on the slope of the hill so I'm coming up to this and seeing as visually as I'm approaching the crust of the hill\nAnd and all of a sudden it ... it coaches down and I lose sight of because there's a lot of like big raspberry bushes and grape vines and stuff that's in the lower part\nIt both out of there I go down on one knee and almost start to like wanna leave 'cause I'm unsure of what it is on four legs it's bold and it crosses an alarming amount of space\nI Can't be the true judge of it and you know I mean close to fifty feet unlike for downs and at this point\nIt looks it looks felt when I was looking at it and I thought you know ... and we turned it had a very large mass like almost like a football player but he was running like a jak rabbit\nAnd then it stopped stood up on two feet\nTurned to its left and walked across forty half a forty five acres on those two legs and kept going over a fence wind on two legs into the next set of bushes\nAnd I lost sight of it now at this point I was so afraid I crawled\nBack for more I was 'cause I was in a half Jenny afflicting have looking over my shoulder what's gonna happen here am I going to be attacked visited there and and went back to the house and\nBe attacked as it up there and and went back to the house and started to try to process what happened but it took me\nMonths to go back there I Can't talk to contact the John in during the angle who's a well known biologist in the ... the subject he turned me on to some people here you know ... that are part of the researchers organization for this kind of stuff\nThey came up here we did a bunch of looking around I mean this was already ... months after the fact because I as I pointed out I I even asked for a couple of hundred friend of mine was like Bill you\nKnow you've been hunting for years you know you have you ever seen it bears do this now\nYou know like I Know black bears can walking distance\nBut I'm Talking about a ... a big shift and and just\nHe was standing at first then comes right you know again I'm Still at this point trying to process it and and by contacting John you know and I also read so to a couple of other people but I just was like well this has got to be the natural train of events", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Clark Howard Show", "city": "Daphne", "day": "04"}
