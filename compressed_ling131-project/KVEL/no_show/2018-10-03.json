expect to be treated respectfully he could be forced to resign as current traditional physician because having\nA quote convicted unquote rapist on the benches unseemly\nFor these reasons he now has the right perhaps not a legal rights butter right based on fundamental fairness to have the charges against him put to the test of clear and convincing evidence\nOr some standard close to that a judge Kavanaugh been rejected an ideological or professional grounds before the sordid accusations were leveled he can go back to his life Robert Bork did\nBut if the Senate fails to confirm him now his life will never be the same judge Kavanaugh wouldn't have been my candidate of choice for the Supreme Court I'm a liberal Democrat who believes Republicans improperly denied judge Merrick Garland a seat on the high court\nBut this is no longer about who would make the best Supreme Court justice\nWell listen to this is about the most fundamental issue affair and issues of fairness this country has faced since the McCarthy Era\n\nWhen innocent people were accused of trying to overthrow the government and have their lives ruined defaced on false accusations won't being denied old semblance\nSemblance of due process or fairness the American civil liberties union stood strong against McCarthyism for demanding due process by demanding due process and hard evidence\nBut the ACLU now argues that quote unresolved questions regarding credible allegations of sexual assault unquote\nBe resolved against the accused nominee we have come a long way since McCarthyism but we now live in an age that risks a new form of sexual McCarthyism we must not go to that even darker place darker than McCarthyism\nLiberal Democrat Harvard law professor\nDarker than McCarthy is\nThe ... so it turns out the left side physicians and McCarthy was not for for being irresponsible for smearing people who were innocent but simply because he was on the right\nThe left is allowed to do exactly what they oppose what they claim to oppose\n\nThis is a very very bad moments in American Life\nDays before your ah your your vote they bring up a high school charge\nDays before\nI said it should've been ignored and they could have been going on in this way\nThere is no evidence we cannot govern the United states of America and and uh it's appointees based on high school charges from thirty six years ago against the man you should read folks the American bar association praise of this guy\nHis judicial temperament his fairness his is a is knowledge of the law he turns out to be a wonderful man but when the entire media of the country virtually the entire or arraigned against you\nAnd you have a woman say what she said there even though if you read the report of what is her name\nMitchell Rachel yes Rachel and it's the last names ritual right Rachel Mitchell the woman who seems to have asked you know put very on challenging questions\n\nThe wall Street Journal published her entire analysis what we should put it up put it up but then it's pretty good dot com\n\nI can only provide bunny assessment of Dr forwards allegations in a legal context and the legal context here as my bottom line hey he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove that this case is even weaker\nThan that this is from Rachel Mitchell a prosecutor of sex crimes sucked the foreign identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses\nEither refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate that\nI Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee nor nor do I believe that the evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of the evidence then do you understand the difference folks\nThere there is the standard beyond reasonable doubt that is for conviction but outside of the legal world all you need is the ... I think in the ... ... if I'm not mistaken in civil suits the preponderance of evidence standard\nThat's different from beyond reasonable doubt just preponderance of there but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\n\nA very dark day in America it's a very dark day because the ... there's an entire\nPortion of this country the left that does not believe in moral norms they acknowledge it that they oh if you put them if you do you believe in moral norms oh of course of course but tell them yeah where are they from their their from them their moral norms are left this moral norms\nWhy did they have such contempt for vice president Mike Pence Mike Mike Pence announced he is not in his in his public career he has never sat in a room alone never dined alone with a woman other than his wife has always been another person man or woman president when he's\nMike Pence announced he is not in his in his public career he has never sat in a room alone never dined alone with a woman other than his wife has always been another person man or woman president\nWhen he's been with the woman and they mocked him for that in fact there were there are articles about how parents would be worse than Trump because\nThey on the ... red cabbage I grew up Catholic private school educated we have a very very similar backgrounds I've got two point\nOrion hold them I Want to hear them but I don't want to interrupt you I'm very curious to know your points\nSo we're leaving pulling up St Paul I'm\nI Can't tell you how much I can I ...

doesn't have to like\nWhat do you know the president which we all know he doesn't but he should at least support the people that elected him and they're not well\nLet's remember what he said it remember what he said it was sixty minutes on Sunday night he said well would you he was asked would you be able to vote this way if you are facing the voters\nThese Scott absolutely not which means I'm only at doing this because I don't have to face the voters again otherwise I Would just do what was politically expedient so now I'll do what I Want to do that's basically what he said\nYeah but

California you know you got burned you no longer allowed and\nThe fact that that that the state governors and state legislatures but not held accountable because they tax\nIt like New York it's ten

party where the houses exactly with any specificity and of course most importantly how she left the party with whom she left the party how she traveled back home when she got back home\n\nThe alleged assault has not been corroborated by a single person including none of the people she's named including as well\nHer lifelong girlfriend Leland Kaiser that apparently is no change based on reports today\nShe hasn't provided a consistent account of the alleged assault\n\nAnd she had big trouble remembering important recent events like in her discussion with the Washington Post reporter whether she actually gave portions ever therapists notes to the report and others in July the whole copy of the therapists notes or read from the therapists no she doesn't remember\nShe can't remember if she had an actual copy of the therapists knows when she called the Washington Post or she had gone to her therapist's office and read them I Can't remember any of that\nShe won't provide the notes to me\nI got to tell ya I operated\nBy a single person including none of the people she's named including as well\nHer lifelong girlfriend Leland Kaiser that apparently is not change based on reports today\nShe hasn't provided a consistent account of the alleged assault\n\nAnd she had big trouble remembering important recent events like in her discussion with the Washington Post reporter whether she actually gave portions ever therapists notes to the report another says in July the whole copy of the therapists notes or read from the therapists knows she doesn't remember\nShe can't remember she had an actual copy of the therapists knows when she called the Washington Post or she had gone to her therapist's office and read them now I Can't remember any of that\n\nShe won't provide the notes to the committee\n\nShe won't provided to the committee she can't remember the day that she had the polygraph to this is very reason this is what a month six weeks eight weeks ago whether it was on the day her grandmother passed away or not she can't remember if it was video or audio recorded and the committee would like to know they want to see\nIf in fact she was traumatized during the course of the [noise] excuse me lie detector tests did she claims\n\nShe talks about the psychological impact it had that she doesn't want to fly she was difficulty flying now we know that was a flight out lie and say that yes a flat outline she's flown west coast east coast east coast the west coast she's flown to Hawaii French Polynesia Costa Rica all over the world\n\nBut when she was asked to shop for a hearing she couldn't fly although it has said that she was already on the east coast\nShe didn't know that the Senate Judiciary committee Republicans the majority had offered to go to California\nTo interview her in any form\nAnd uh\nWhy didn't you know ... people say her lawyers must have withheld information\nMaybe the large didn't with all the information maybe she just didn't give a forthright in which\nWe know from her ex boyfriend\nThat she never mentioned Kavanaugh's name she never mentioned sexual assault in the six years that they live together and then a few years before that that the day that we know she had no problem with claustrophobia because she had an apartment that was five hundred square feet that's a small apartment\nThat's a very small apartment\nWe know that she never mentioned Kevin O's name to her boyfriend who live in boyfriend have six years so you have to\nBelieve the unbelievable\nTo believe her testimony against Brett Kavanaugh you have to believe the unbelievable you must suspend your reasoning and now that I've gone through this she's not the bubble lady\nShe came forward she said it was or civic duty she's presented herself to the American people and we get the judge said it's not the only body that gets the judge you and I get the judge and we don't have to self censor you have to be rude and hateful and all the rest I'm not that we're not doing that\nNow what a cabinet I'll say that was so unbelievable that contradicted absolutely nothing that I'm aware of what that he may have had more drinks one day then another day he's the one who showed up with this calendars\n\nHe's the one who had witnesses who said he was never there\n\nBut you see the FBI didn't interview hammer afford now according to Ford's lawyers who are very upset and of course the Democrats are one in the same but that's not the nature of this investigation it's not a criminal investigation\nThey testified in public under penalty of perjury there's nothing else for them to say\nSo why do we continue to play what see what the Democrats we should play brass knuckles where the Democrats say enough already and Mr flake and ms Collins of ms Murkowski you wonder is wrong with the Democrats go ahead we're having a vote this is over\nWe're not going to participate in any further shame we're not going to participate now and the trashing of the FBI I'm not talking about the senior people at the FBI now they're trashing the FBI if there lecturing us for Eighteen months about the FBI\nThat's not the senior officials in the FBI who are doing these interviews these are special agents I have no doubt the hard working men and women in the FBI that the Democrats claimed the like but they hate all law enforcement let's be honest\nSo enough so now we don't need to deal honestly we don't need to deal\nWith people who are\nDiabolical by about\nThat includes flight that includes Collins that includes Murkowski who brought us to this point I guarantee you\n\nIf it were their husbands are flights wives were being treated this way they wouldn't agree you know what maybe we should extend this for a week\nWhy\nWhat took place this weekend enlist speculation endless analysis\nOf what the insanity is ubiquitous\nIt's all over the media all over the media I'll get to them later as I always do so to
