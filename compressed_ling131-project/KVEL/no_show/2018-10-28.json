storm what a great story [noise] it's amazing I have a question I Believe we have the technology a poor financial institutions to prevent personal funds from being transferred to the United states to Mexico Honduras\nGuatemala and I'm Wondering if that doesn't make\nSense for the logical or at least a part of a logical answer to the immigration problem we're having\nTo stop the remittances from here to Mexico\nMexico Honduras Guatemala\nI Would imagine we do have a technology to do with the question is whether or not or it would be effective are these people are already here are and the question is what do we do to prevent more illegal alien from coming here\nAnd that's what the president's trying to do or if he were to somehow try to stop remittances or and or remittances that his money coming from people in this country to Mexico if I Believe they're a second uh largest source of income after oil\nUm I don't know it seems to me that doing that would also exacerbate the problem in in Mexico I hear people say that\nUh if President Trump for example withdraws the aid from Honduras Guatemala it'll simply make conditions there even worse or and or would create even more so called migrants it seems to me the argument against Mexico his at Mexico's economy under developed\nAnd needs to be developed and you stop the remittances if even if you could do it legally\nI'm not sure how that would create conditions that would make it better for Mexicans to stay in Mexico as opposed to coming up here illegally but thanks for the idea of cannot look into it Thai is in San Antonio Texas tiger in the Larry on the show\n[noise] Larry love your show man thank you so much thank you um so\nYeah the first of all your gentleman a fantastic on that as a conservative\nOr for now a long long time one of the things I've understood is that the Democratic party has had an absolute going well hold on the black community now and the mind that uh for about six years and they had no intention of ... what is going to take what you've done among like them to get out of the cells\nAfternoon so\nBut but to my point you you had a caller ask you how many legal immigrants are accepted into this country and um\nAnd I happen to know living in San Antonio I'm married to a Hispanic woman her family is from Mexico\nWe as a country per year except about one million legal immigrants of which about six hundred thousand\nOr residency changes I don't know maybe they have dual citizenship and they're moving to America I'm not sure what situation it so that leaves you with about four hundred thousand so that boils down to almost eleven hundred per day okay legal citizens that we are accepting entered this country and at this point in our\nHistory we have the most legal immigrants that we have ever had and that's thirty seven thirty seven now if you if you estimate on population a\nMillion and do that math that comes up ... percent of our population ... illegal immigrants mhm\nSo you know to make the argument and this is through not only democratic uh you know president for Republican and medicine raisins and and this has been going on for a long long time um but\nYou know I wanted to ask you you mentioned earlier on your show that Mexico has that when the policy for ... body who enters the country illegally\nThat's right my my bigger question here my bigger question is if Mexico is and from what I hear they have a ... and the willingness to help you you say that there are pretty much just escorting them and kind of you know I'm just\nProtecting them or whatever they're doing and how is it that these people are not\nRounded up by the federal rally immediately or at least\n... at medium as they possibly can\nFor out of the the the integrity of Mexico's ... mhm\nThere are pretty much just courting them encounter you know um how you protect them or whatever they're doing and how would these people are not rounded up by the federal needy Italy or Italy medium is a ... we can't for the integrity of Mexico\n... ... ... ... if\nThere is entering legal you know so why should they why should you know if they're agreeing to help us and we just went on to a new trade deal with\nMore just things like the third mainly assuring people to our border and then they're going to see how we think\nThat's exactly what's going on why do you think Trump is so upset raising puppies so angry because the Mexican government allows the so called caravan from central and South America to come on through their country because they know they're coming up here [noise]\nWhat is the whole system feel rigged there isn't the answer the drug maker spend a great deal of money loving to protect their profits over one hundred and Seventy one million dollars to

are tight tight tight the Republican support according to every pollster surging with a real chance now the Republicans make gains in the Senate\nAnd hold on to the house of representatives one eight hundred nine five five [noise]\nSeventeen Seventy six our phone number the um world of cable TV [noise] has just exploded I just got off the plane from Pittsburgh\nAnd basically everybody is incredibly upset because last night in front of a huge crowd\nA cheering crowd that was out there to support beautiful ten that's the new name that's remember the artist formerly known as friends\nOr the Kennedy formerly known as lion Ted is now beautiful to it which is appropriate because he has worked closely and effectively with President Trump and it's good that President Trump came out to use them to support Ted Cruz and his hometown\nIn any event a President Trump dropped the N. word no he did and\nA lot of people have suspected that this was a word he was comfortable with well\nHe said it\nOn national TV international TV and now the world's has been shaken Jewish foundations and uh the likes of Rachel Maddow and Don Lemon and the people ... over at CNN\nOr people have basically roll down their thunder ...\nThis was apocalyptic it's the end of the world because President Trump used the N. word no not that n word that would be serious this is actually also serious then it's an n word that I'm comfortable with the N word as nationalist can someone tell me what's wrong with being a nationalist\nWind is that anyone should actually be upset about this here's what President Trump said last night in his um rally on behalf of beautiful had listened\nGlobal is in order to global is [noise]\nThat wants to frankly not caring about our country so much [noise]\nAnd you know what we can\nSort of became a national issue\nWere not supposed to use that word you know what I'm a nationalist sub\nOkay he's encouraging people to use that word I'm ... I'm ... I'm a nationalist too I I Am and I I don't\nUnderstand why people should have a problem with that word if you want to try to answer that question you can one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen

his job right now he is the leader of the Republican Party at the moment and he wants to Republicans to win the question is is he playing politics\nIn some kind of devious underhanded and reprehensible way by using the term nationalist to describe themselves will get back to that one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six a a quick word\nFrom the alliance defending freedom\nWere pressing forward we need support for this great organization and uh right now we are transitioning I mean in terms of the season\nInto fall and sometimes people get allergies and they have strains throat and they can't talk properly\nBut imagine\nIf you lost your legal voice when it comes to speaking up against some government bullying that sometimes is just wrong\nAnd for instance I I think part of the governed bowling that's just wrong has to do with trying to force people to put little boys and little girls and people of all different ages\nTogether in the same showers and same bathrooms in school okay imagine this indicator Georgia there was a case\nWhere parents were actually stripped of their rights even protest on this transgender bathroom issue listen to this one Decatur parent\nWhen you send your daughter to do\nYou have a level of expectation that you're you're not going to be worried about you know they're not going to be you know exposing fucking that you're not aware of as a parent I learned about the transgender paused for my wife she just happened to be on the front page of the superintendent and got windows\nPolicies that there were an acting that was going to uh open bathrooms locker room sports teams overnight lodging to both sexes\nOkay overnight launching right and uh it tragically that transgender bathroom policy it already led to a five year old being sexually assaulted and our girls restroom at school and if this can happen in Decatur, Georgia it can happen in your child's school\nBut alliance defending freedom is standing with parents nationwide offering free legal help to protect their rights in other words it's terrific to have activists them parents getting involved and getting active trivia of him and going out and voting\nBut you know what sometimes you need some legal defense just to get your voices heard\nAnd that's where alliance defending freedom comes in if you'd call right now\nYou give a donation to

an incredibly bizarre\nIt seems to me the the overreaction that stunned reaction to a president from using the word nationalist look I I Will always a acknowledge there's a possibility that President Trump wasn't planning anything he didn't wasn't trying to do anything\nBut I think this comes down to a pretty well thought out and I think inappropriate and smart strategy for including the election campaign let me tell you why\nBecause right now he sees that the best chance for Republicans holding the house and gaining in the Senate both of which are goals is to emphasize how far out of touch the Democrats would become that's why\nThe energy for including the election campaign let me tell you why\nBecause right now he sees that the best chance for Republicans holding the house and gaining in the Senate both of which are goal\nIs to emphasize how far out of touch the Democrats have become that's why I think the Kavanaugh hearings were so important with a cabinet hearing\nShowed was that even for people who might have some doubts about President Trump and some of his character and his personality and this and that\nWhat you saw from the Democrats was just so infinitely worse and more hostile and more out of touch and showed such contempt for basic American Standards of of decency and due process and everything else I think that a a great horror people on the Republican side\nSaid not that no and we have to come together and fight it and that's\nWhy this rhetoric about jobs not moms and that's also why the rhetoric about nationalism it seems to me\nI don't think there are many conservatives who are troubled by the idea of being a nationals and let me explain\nTo you there's a new book about nationalism by an Israeli writer named Jerome has only\nAnd it's it's worth considering because one of the points he makes is that nationalism goes pretty directly\nWith the idea of democracy because if you're talking about a nation state is your real try than the ideas and that's been very much the way it is in America is what patriotism means\nIs that I find myself as an American\nAnd going back to a theater Roosevelt again in the new nationalism the whole idea was if you are an immigrant you drop the idea of carrying the flag of your former country you carry the American flag and your nationalism your tribal affiliation which you care about what will you and give your heart to\nIs our nation not a race not an ethnicity and the fact that that there are so many people out there and the commentary it and so many Democrats who don't get that who are offended by the term nationalism\nI honestly don't think that's helping the Democratic side\nI think of anything it helps on\nThe conservative and Republican side by the way if you're one of those people just offended by the word nationalism\nGive me a call and tell me why\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six uh Michael in San Diego you're on the Michael Mann that show\nYou like oh I um I think that America is neither a country founded on nationalism nor international is a more global is\nHow can you say that we weren't found it on nationalism a we were founded on individual is

Mann that show this whole discussion about nationalism and President Trump calling himself a nationalist and the indignation that you hear about that from the left fits in almost perfect lead to a very controversial column that appeared yesterday\nBy our friend David learnt or who's a professor at Yale by the way and a very very brilliant guy the the column appeared under the headline the real reason they hate Trump\nAnd by the way I don't entirely agree with his column but I'm kind of mostly due and\nOne of the things that ... says about the real reason they hate Trump is because Trump represents things about the average American that a lot of intellectuals and certainly intellectuals or left really resent\nI mean all of this stuff about we can't or have Thanksgiving anymore we have to have Thanksgiving is a day of mourning and yes that was the thing here in the city of Seattle and back in two thousand and eleven I think it was uh the school board\nDeclare that we had to observe a day of mourning associate with Thanksgiving 'cause the Native American this basic idea that we need to stress guilt rather than gratitude about our country\nIs sick an awful and I think that

male American or the average white American\nWe know for sure that come two thousand twenty intellectuals will be dumbfounded as a number of women and the number of blacks will vote for President

not use the term nationalist a lot and the journal and the hall on hold on the point about this is can we recognize that American nationalism from the beginning of the country\nHas been different because it has not been based on race in other words the ... and ... in German nationalism\nA such as it is it all very complicated there's a I have a a tweet that came out uh basically defending Hitler in order to condemn Trump that we have to get to in a moment\nBut ah at Hitler wasn't even German he was Austrian and that's why his nationalism that he talked about was all racial and based on race but\nWell it's interesting you mentioned the French because that's the route French nationalism is the root of chauvinists I'm which obviously as negative implications\nNow show than is um is is different because Chauvin is is a ... who is associated with it it's considered an extreme form of nationalism now if you take an extreme form of nationalism\nAh where are you you were insisting and

now if you take an extreme form of nationalism ah where are you you were insisting that\nYour nation must rule the whole world\nProblematic but one of the points that the people who've written about this make in defense of nationalism in in defense of identity is that if you don't have a nation defining who you are\nAnd do you define who you are based upon race or ethnic background\nOr something other than a a national inheritance or a national cause\nIt's far more dangerous and far more toxic\nAnd uh in terms of ...

Trump\nAnd I think that Trump's antics as a personality that depressed part of the Republican base but the Kavanaugh hearings brought out the ugliness of the left their complete disregard for normal

a contributor at Fox News we're talking\nAbout the the upcoming elections ... one of those things and and again you made this observation before John we're both admitted political junkies follow this stuff a lot ah but the house races with four hundred and thirty five of them\nAre so confusing to most people my strong gas is that most Americans most Americans I think probably an overwhelming majority could not identify who their representative in the house of representatives actually is couldn't given it\nSo what do we do about that or just basically live with that and try to break through somehow into people's consciousness on these house races\nWell incumbents have an advantage in when Ninety percent of the time because they do a lot of constituent work\nFor their people and they also get around the community shake hands and become well known so while not everyone knows who their congressmen is a lot of people in the middle of the independent voters\nOr if they met their congressmen or their gotten their mothers Social Security check taking care of the Congress was off as they like the congressman\nAnd the the the job of a congressman is twofold it's to represent the people and also of course\nSo while not everyone knows who their congressmen is a lot of people in the middle the independent voters\nOr if they met their congressmen or their gotten their mothers Social Security check taking care of the congressman's office they liked the congressman and the the the job of a congressman is twofold it's to represent the people and also of course vote their conscience that it's a balancing act\nAnd ultimately voters have to decide what's important to them\nSadly the vast majority of people don't vote well about half the people will not vote in the selection\nOf those who do vote a lot of people will vote by party down the line but you'll have some people will say well even though I disagree with my congressman or woman I like what they're doing and they have integrity and they're honest person\nI yeah and uh whether it's it's the same kind of thing if you ask people in general do things that Congress is honest and legit it's usually very very low approval rating people don't trust Congress an institution\nThat then you ask people what about your own congressman congressman Smith I I happen to have a congressman Smith whose ... are representing my district as as it happens so what about ... and they said oh my congressman he's the exception he's really a good guy\nIt's in the normal way people feel when they talk about public schools are are medical care anything else is that I'm the only one who's fortunate in an island of dysfunction and the wealthy and the summers in public\nAnd keep the house it may be in part because at the last minute people who are really mad at Donald Trump will say yeah but I'm really so mad at him that I Want to get rid of the guy that I've liked her met and shit or shaking his hand or help me out\nAnd that's why in general you'd never bet against incumbents so some of these Republican incumbents me in the end when because they've built up goodwill over the years\nBut the real problem as the forty empty seats right there were forty Republicans ... or more\nEmpty seats than in decades and that's why I think the Democrats do have to be favored to take back the house because at an open seat a basically you're much more able to vote party strict party line\nSo I'm In in terms of I Know that the Republicans have good chance of knocking on some democratic seats I Know there's a district in Minnesota where the Republicans actually now favored by the cook Political Report\nTo win a democratic seat um ... where do you think Republicans should place the emphasis in these last two weeks the campaign in order to try to hold on to the house\nWhile I think that they have to emphasize three things one is you know even though there are problems in the world were peace\nAnd frankly we are more respected now than we were two years ago that's number one to\nThe economy is really good and that's not an accident or ... or ... policies having a delayed reaction if you want higher taxes and want to take a risk with picking the economy backwards vote for the Democrats to take over Congress and the third is\nYou know there's some basic things the Democrats don't seem to

this rock star reception really a one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six or let us go to Mike in Cleveland Mike you're on the bench show\nMichael I think that would ban Democratic

outrageous that we're any monuments museums so beach oh\nOkay I I look as you know I'm a ... and you've heard me before on this Mike I'm sympathetic to that point of view not that they should have been hang a but that uh to have a monument in the middle of a city park well Nathan Bedford Forrest I think was just removed or is about to be removed\nFrom some um him and I believe in Memphis, Tennessee and Nathan Bedford Forrest was not only a Confederate general he was the founder of the Ku Klux Klan\nAnd so okay but you see this mountainside is is different um and it it's different because this is like Mount Rushmore it was a work of art it was a public project\nAnd I think it's perfectly appropriate would signage around it reminding people of everything that you said\nThat ah these are people who fought against the United states\nAnd in context of this entire monument was put up\nWith a ... at a time when white supremacy and neo Confederate apologetic were held to be the case but we're very different place in our country right now\nBut to literally blast away this three acres the image of Jackson Lee Ann Davis covers three acres on the face of this mountain\nAnd the idea of just blasting it up it it seems to me that a number there in a number of black leaders in Atlanta\nWho do believe that that it's a Neal's lea polarizing and pointless to insist on blowing up a a beautiful city park let's go to John in Kansas City John you're on the ... that show hey\nYou know my heart I'm well you're very good ... and I listen to listen to your ... okay maybe about ... ...\nNo no I've never I never say that this was their heritage I never say that they have because the heritage of treason should be rejected\nAll right okay okay but you're in the outfit you why they're so beautiful historical and all that I Would you feel that there was a mountain of Adolf Eichmann I'm Rick killer law that they lost the war to they were fighting for their country that there are good\nBut again and again I I I Would I Do not use the argument of heritage I that's not the point the point is if there was if there is an art work a piece of art is carved into a mountain that can't be moved because you cannot move aid three acres\nCulture that it's a Thirty Years' to make you only blow it up\nOr\nIf there's something like that it's different from moving a statue and I again I Do not believe that they're at I think it's important to preserve for instance I don't think that ... should be blown up\nI think it's important that it preserves it is part of the record of history and they didn't have any statues in Auschwitz but if they have them there that should be preserved as part of the historical record as well\nAnd given the fact that ah they've taken out some of the they used to have a plantation house at a at Stone Mountain\nThese preserve date is part of the record of history and they didn't have any statues announcements but if they had them there that should be preserved as part of the historical record as well\nAnd given the fact that\nAh they've taken out some of the they used to have a plantation house\nAt a Stone Mountain I think they still have a place that was there recently they still have a place called Confederate house with Confederate house doesn't have anything inside it anymore they just have T shirts say Stone Mountain\nAnd or should it have anything inside it at that some people the Confederate souvenirs no of course not\nAnd and really trying to bring the stay together I um I I don't see any choice except for um a

more and um come up with something I bet you anything it was it it's in the group of um blister beetles or a cat doesn't matter what kind of be will it is very a boss you know like I mentioned\nLike here in this situation probably in those you know would just walk to learn more about this guy for other uh been to ask about it but from what I'm seeing on the Internet it must be fairly common that the ... mushrooms scanned the attack by\nCertain legals and then has to be a an interesting solution because the motions are pretty delicate very easy to to ah damage okay back to the\nTrees and again the number is eight six six or for for three four seven eight\nOne of the reasons why this is such a good time to plant a new tree is that the fall color\nIs starting to show up north it probably is already there here in the Dallas Fort Worth area we're beginning to see a little a fall color show on\nThe plan my a new uh Texas\nI she's starting to kill or just a little bit the Japanese maples you're starting to get\nA new tree is that the fall color is starting to show up north it probably is already there here in the Dallas Fort Worth area we're beginning to see a little a fall color show on the plane that's my\nA new uh Texas I she's starting to color just a little bit the Japanese maples are starting to get a little color might gain ... even showing tiny signs\nOf a color I'm about to meet the uh uh Texas champion again go and I'm really looking forward to it may already be in pretty good uh a color but my point about that is correct morals are starting to show their fall color and you know other\nPlants are as oil the the the time of the year when you can be the most consistent about getting the fall color on plant that you wanted to buy the fall colors on the point you know and when there's fog Keller on the plan and the nursery that's not even a hundred percent a guarantee you\nI've seen situations where I picked a planet Allen nursery that had\nA red fall color for example and then in my garden it turned out to be more of a golden uh reddish color kind of a um you know the little bit different shade of uh of fall\nColor they had in the nursery but generally speaking there'll be about the same so she's going to give you some indication a crime or else have I have wonderful fog or a lot of people don't realize that you know the whites and the purple tend to have this didn't flu foolproof either but the watching the purple tend to have yellow fall color\nAnd the things in the ... to have read fall goer and sometimes it can be very very good I was just\nTalking to a friend of mine the other day about their landscaping and we're talking about using\nA buck out of the Mexican Buckeye my bank Mexican back on the front of our house is starting to color just a little bit if if we get a lot of people ask me what felt the fall color and they think that the more secure and we've had all this rain it'll be good fall color\nIt tends to be just the opposite of that you tend to get better fall color on plants when there's a little bit of stress involved in playing a little bit on the dry each\nSide um that the green quote for a ... white better and the good colors come out better if you have a little on the dry side\nAnd if it's blue sky and bright bright sunshine I think that makes more difference than anything we've got a picture under dog would in\nThe dirt Dr dot com on the website and in the library\nWhere we're showing a dog would leaf were well one leaf is covered the other end where they covered you don't have good fall color\nWhere they it it's not covered by another relief and they've had full sun on the bright red color is rich and beautiful so anyway that's one reason why it's a good idea to shop for your trees\n[noise] uh in in the fall also it's the best time to plant them because if you plant or new tree right now when when you're ... light summer's starting to get cold and moving into fall we're not really into fall yet or\nWere you know we're rushing into it pretty good if you plant at that period of time and this goes for any ... plan not just a tree but you will pick up\nA burst of route gross\nThat you wouldn't get by planting later in the winter you're going to get a little bit of ... growth\nAll through the winter for most people and most plants\nBut if you plant in the fall you're going to get that nice burst of growth in the fall followed by a little bit of a general rule grows through the winter and spring that tree would just take off like it's been there a long time it really will make a big difference you also cut down the chances of\nLost by transplant shock to almost nothing\nBecause the the plants can really take a the the fall in the in the winter weather this has all the time on transplanting\nThat you can either dig and ball and burlap or go to our mall owned the plant and move it or you can bear route your plants if you need to move a plan from point a to point B\nAnd Barrett ruining them once you've gotten into some fall color and especially if you are just a little bit longer and you actually have a frost in all systems are completely shut down in the plant\nYou can bear route a plant from a pine tree to through you know an exotic introduced a kind of thing or to any native it doesn't matter what kind of treat is have great success\nBut if you haven't a fix that foyer exposure first and you haven't fixed that circling of an early in the roots your tree might well yeah but it's never going to\nBe what it could be it's never going to live up to its potential it's going to be much more prone to insect in disease problems and gonna have other issues you know borders and things like that well let's step back a minute I didn't tell you how to fix the gurgling\nThe round and round and round roots that hit the wall and turn into a you know the ... ball being a big not of roots couple of things you can do the first one I recommend is to put it over in a bucket of water that's bigger big enough to put the entire ball over in\nWater and the underwater let's sit for an hour or two\nNo matter how long the at least an hour and then try with your hands\nOr try to pull the roots ... loose and radio and pull them out so you can write have him radiating out like they should be growing\nOr you know in a big wide a shallow dish shaped hole that you\nHave dug if if that works great that you solve the problem right there and in the process you can with the smoking you could make sure you get all the soil all for the fire and ... and a identify exactly where the ... areas\nIf that doesn't work and sometimes it won't sometimes the reach of wrapped around around around and hit fused together so\nUh you know so solidly that you can't loosening up by simply a soaking it in water if that's the case you've got to take your ... or a pocket knife or a a some kind of a cultivating to or something and tear up\nThat outside age just rip it up\nAnd don't worry that you do any damage it's a lot more damaging to the tree for it to be used\nThen to be torn up\nWhen I Do my lectures one of the show a couple of different examples of plants that were in bad shape what was done to fix that and the the smoking is always the first step and then the physical a\nDestruction of that fused a ... ... ... is the second thing to do and then um plant plant if you're in the ... process asked if you put a little Garret juice\nInto the uh uh the water you know that's even better thing to do there are a little bit more on all that I Want to talk about let's go to the colony and talk Kathy for men hello Cathy\nMining Howard I Can't planning quite okay I have some ... miles coming up for the stopping aren't by a large screen that and I have not been successful in fat plant that want to try [laughter]\nOkay they like yet how far out so I say\nWell let's let's talk about a couple things first these little seedlings that you see coming up are you sure their savings or not a growing off the roots of the big that was the mother tree\nWhy not check\nIf you're getting some routes when you dig it up it is the leading edge drawing from seed and you know you just do it at this time of year and move it over and you should be fine the watch more common much more common\nIs that a fright Merle that's too deep underground will be sending a soccer's off of the reached us\nAnd so they don't have any of their own roots at all so basically all you're doing is moving a crowding over to the new spot and probably if that's the case reason you've been failing at it is you've got to hand if that's the case you got to handle it like a cutting\nMy misty ... daily and you know baby Annette along until it is able to force out its own roots and start growing on its own\nAbstract plant\nToday I Can't I now that it's just that\nIf it stayed lane and it's got its own roots you can dig it up and like I say at this time of year barrier reading it it should work find in fact go ahead and ... so you can say for sure whether it's the link\nOr whether it's coming off of another rude and it's just a soccer and it doesn't have any roots at all in in that case like I said you've got to treat it like a cutting because that's all it is\nOkay yeah I ... and how they go around to like take these are probably about a foot tall\nOh you don't need to go out more than a six inches or something because even if it's got roots on a on a little tiny tray like that those returns will be going out laterally very far at all\nAnd what I Want you to do is to see whether it is a seemingly or not and so you know start out six or eight inches and dig it out and then just kind of loose in the oil from it knocked all soil often as to whether it's God's from roots or not\nOkay well the one I did last year I get that one really long so I think you're right they're just coming out from their child\nWas probably just a sucker off the mother yeah and\nAnd like I said in that case it you're not dealing with anything but a cutting you're not dealing with a transplant you dealing with the cutting and you've got to get to give it that you know either a greenhouse situation and high humidity or missed it on a regular basis or something like that that's the only way you're going to\nA force it to kick out you know its own roots and start growing it will do that used to give it a little bit\nMore tender loving care you see what I mean\nI ... and I could do that\n[laughter] okay well dig and dig up\nSome and they if they are they if they have any roots on them\nAnd the only thing I can tell you other than missing them just water the soil that you've plunged them into you've planted them into a little more often keep it a little bit more and more so than you can probably get 'em to ah to root without spray in the top\nIf you if you put a little covering over him of some kind some\nClear plastic container that would function like a greenhouse or just put some sticks and bamboo and drop some plastic over so you create kind of a little greenhouse situation they that will also help them to root\nOkay they're willing to try

momentum seemed to turn around in a Republican direction after the Kavanaugh hearings you agree with that\n[noise] well I think a lot of people had baked in the cake any negative attitudes they had the President Trump\nAnd I think that Trump's antics as a personality that depressed part of the Republican base but the Kavanaugh hearings brought out the ugliness of the left their complete disregard for normal procedures and rules and the rule of law and I think that\nAt best that show the Democrats to be the equal of Trump in violating norms and politics\nAnd at worst almost extra constitutional so I think that Trump\nManaged to succeed where nobody else ever thought he would he managed to get the Democrats to drop their own to October surprise on their feet and never to blow up in their face\nAnd yeah it's it does it does seem like that and I know there are a bunch of people like Dean Heller\nA who is long considered our most endangered centered in the center for Nevada

alliance defending freedom or call them the whole free eight six six nine five four\nThree three eight eight that's eight six six nine five four three three eight eight back with John Fund a John is the national affairs columnist for National Review he worked for more than Twenty years for Wall Street journal and a is also a contributor at Fox News\nWe're talking about the the upcoming elections ... one of the things and and again you made this observation before John\nWe're both admitted political junkies follow this stuff a lot ah but the house races with four hundred and thirty five of them are so confusing\nTo most people my strong gas is that most Americans most Americans and I think probably an overwhelming majority could not identify who their representative in the house of representatives actually is couldn't even name so ... what do we do about that\nOr just basically live with that and try to break through somehow into people's consciousness on these house races\nWell incumbents have an advantage in one Ninety percent of the time because they do a lot of constituent work\nFor their people and they also get around the community shake hands and become well known\nSo while not everyone knows who their congressmen is a lot of people in the middle the independent voters\nOr if they've met their congressmen or there's gotten their mothers Social Security check taking care of the congressman's office they liked the congressman and the the the job of a congressman is twofold it's to represent the people and also of course vote their conscience if the balancing act\nAnd ultimately voters have to decide what's important to them sadly the vast majority of people don't vote well about half the people will not vote in this election\nOf those who do vote a lot of people will vote by party down the line but you will have some people who say well even though I disagree with my congressman or woman I like what they're doing and they have integrity and they're honest person\nI yeah and uh whether it's it's the same kind of thing if you ask people in general do things that Congress is honest and legit it's usually very very low approval rating people don't trust Congress an institution\nBut then you ask people what about your own congressman congressman Smith I I happen to have a congressman Smith whose\nRep I represent my district as as it happens so what about ... and they say oh my congressman he's the exception he's really a good guy it said the normal way people feel when they talk about public schools their medical care anything else is that I'm the only one who's fortunate [laughter]\nIn an island of dysfunction and if the if his numbers in public\nAnd keep the house it may be in part because at the last minute people who are really mad at Donald Trump will say yeah but I Am really so mad at him that I Want to get rid of the guy that I've liked or met and shit or shaking his hand or helped me out\nAnd that's why in general you never bet against incumbents so some of these Republican incumbents me in the end when because they've built up goodwill over the years\nSince the real problem is the forty empty seats right there were forty Republicans ... or more\nEmpty seats in decades and that's why I think the Democrats do have to be favored to take back the house because at an open seat a basically you're much more able to vote party street party line\nSo I'm In in terms of I Know that the Republicans have good chances of knocking off some democratic seats I Know there's a district in Minnesota where the Republicans actually now favored by the cook Political Report\nTo win a democratic seat um ... where do you think Republicans should place the emphasis in these last two weeks they campaign in order to try to hold on to the house\nWell I think that they have to emphasize three things one is you know even though there are problems in the world were peace\nAnd frankly we are more respected now than we were two years ago that's number one to\nThe economy is really good and that's not an accident or a ... a bucket bombers policies having a delayed reaction if you want higher taxes and want to take a risk with picking the economy backwards vote for the Democrats to take over Congress and the third is\nYou know uh there's some basic things the Democrats don't seem to care about one of the rule of law\nIs proven by Kavanaugh and to why are they saying nothing about this caravan this mob whatever you want to call it that moving up from Mexico as the wall Street Journal reported today which is very pro immigration this is outrageous that we have these people encouraged to move to the United states that influence our election\nAnd at the same time the Democrats are completely silent but a fundamental issue of national sovereignty\nAnd apparently this is the work of a former president of Honduras and his henchmen\nOr what's the wall Street Journal is written about and the Daily Beast is written about that this really started uh as as basically a means of undermining the current center right president of Honduras and to hold the American people\nHostage to the vagaries of on the door and dirty tricks campaigning doesn't seem a good idea Jon\nOr of the Democrats need to step forward and say this is wrong and I hear crickets cricket\nWell exactly what they have nothing to say because again they would much prefer to a run on the the the ... the family separation issue which they've tried to make a great deal of apparently sixty two percent of all democratic adds\nA feature health care isn't that a mistake don't you think\nWell it's putting lots of eggs in one basket and you know\nThey say because again they would much prefer to a run on the the the the family separation issue which they tried to make a great deal of apparently sixty two percent of all democratic ads of each or health care\nIsn't that a mistake don't you think\nWell it's putting lots of eggs in one basket and you know I think for existing conditions are important I don't think they're that important to that many Americans\nOkay and the Republicans have been very emphatic that we are not going to endanger people with preexisting conditions that those guarantees will remain a we are speaking with John John John appreciate your insight and a hope but maybe you can come back again\nSo look this all has to be taken in context a meanwhile a a quick word from relief factor this came in from Melinda\nThe teen every call everybody is so polite timed and and helpful and most of all\nPhysicians

and I\nWonder if this nation for the Confederate those guys they were traitors in any other nation those kind of a mouse would have been I think it's outrageous that we're any monument museum so beach oh\nOkay I I look as you know I'm ... and you've heard me before on this Mike I'm sympathetic to that point of view not that they should have been hang a but that uh to have a monument in the middle of a city park well Nathan Bedford Forrest I think was just removed or is about to be removed\nFrom some momentum and I believe in Memphis, Tennessee and Nathan Bedford Forrest was not only a Confederate general he was the founder of the Ku Klux Klan\nAnd so okay but you see this mountainside is is different um and it it's different because this is like Mount Rushmore it was a work of art it was a public project\nAnd I think it's perfectly appropriate would sign is around it reminding people of everything that you said\nThat ah these are people who fought against the United states and in context or this entire monument was put up\nWith a at a time when white supremacy and neo Confederate apologetic were held to be the case but we're very different place in our country right now\nBut to literally blast away there's three acres the image of Jackson Lee Ann Davis covers three acres on the face of this mountain\nAnd the idea of just blasting it up it it seems to me that a number there a number of black leaders in Atlanta\nWho do believe that that it's a needlessly polarizing and pointless to insist on blowing up a a beautiful city park let's go to John in Kansas City John you're on the ... that show hey\nYou know my heart I'm well you're very good job or do you make it into your explanation okay maybe your thought\nUs to insist on blowing up a beautiful city park\nLet's go to John in Kansas City John you're on the Michael met that show hey\nYou know my heart I'm well your way I ever made it and I listen to your explanation yeah OK many in fact they'll get their heritage\nNo no I never I never say that this is their heritage I never say that ... ... because the heritage of treason should be rejected\nAll right okay okay I hear me outfit you why they're so\nBeautiful historical and all that I Would you feel if that was the only mountain of Adolf Eichmann I'm Rick ill or know that they lost the war they were fighting for their country that their character\nI again and again I I I Would I Do not use the argument of heritage and that's not the point the point is if there was if there is an artwork and piece of art is carved into a mountain that can't be moved because you cannot move age three acres culture that it's a Thirty Years' to make you only blow it up\nOr if there's something like that it's different from moving a statue\nAnd again I Do not believe that they're at I think it's important to preserve for instance I don't think that ... minutes should be blown up I think it's important that it be preserved is part of the record of history\nAnd they didn't have any statues and outfits but if they have them there that should be preserved is part of the historical record as well\nAnd given the fact that\nAh they've taken out some of the they used to have a plantation house at\nA Stone Mountain I think they still have a place that was there recently they still have a place called Confederate house but Confederate house doesn't have anything inside it anymore they just have T shirts they Stone Mountain\nAnd or should it have anything inside it as that some people the Confederate souvenirs no of course not\nAnd and really

show everybody has heard so much about the Senate race in Nevada and the Senate race in Arizona and the Senate race in Tennessee and the Senate race in North Dakota and all those high profile Senate races but they're a bunch of others and\nAlmost always there is a big surprise uh that comes out wow I didn't see that one coming\nBack in Nineteen eighty when Republicans ended up taking twelve seats in the U.S Senate yep twelve seats\nThere was a situation like that in the state of Washington longtime senator you'd been elected for ever been there since the earth cooled name Warren Magnuson\nAnd boom on election day he loses to a guy name Slade Gorton who's a friend who became truly a great great\nRepresentative for the state in the United States Senate\nNow could history repeats itself there will be some surprises on election day and one of them could be right here in Washington state\nI'm joined by the Republican nominee for US Senate in Washington I'm Susan Hutchison Susan great to see you again thank you Michael it's a pleasure and by the way you can find out about this race it Susan for Senate dot com that's pretty easy\nUh right now you just told me something that is is remarkable ... even in the most recent polling that you have of likely voters the cause of this mobilization of Republicans that everybody is feeling all across the country this is getting to be close race could be as close as four points\nThat's absolutely right Marie can't well as an Eighteen year incumbent she should be sitting well about fifty percent right now and we've got her about five points under fifty percent so um she's in trouble and and uh so we've been working really hard in order to close that gap\nAnd what is the big change that you're going to bring representing Washington in January of next year so what Maria Cantwell has been doing we're not doing\nFor these last sixteen years than the last what twenty four year\nWell she's been in public office she's twenty five years right handed a congressman before and Twenty years in federal office\nSo this is her six federal race or election I should say but um what what I think it's going to happen if the people around the country are you going to realize that this is not the deep blue state if people believe\nI was chairman for half a decade of the G O P A state party and we know by data and also by looking at our legislature were split halfway down the middle and so when that happens that's not an indication of a\nOf a deep blue state where a purple state and and\nThen by the way and this is one of the important things that if you actually when the Senate race\nA that could turn out enough Republicans to flip both houses of the state legislature 'cause it's one vote in the Senate and what is it one one now yeah both and so what would change one seed there and then makes a a world of difference I'm Sorry go ahead\nSays on there that he literally right if we have our voters vote all the way up and down the ballot\nOr that is exactly what's going to happen and the other thing that people don't realize is there an awful lot of good Democrats who have become very disenchanted with their party there not socialists they don't want this new vision that has been so articulated by the Seattle city council\nA lot of your listeners around the country heard about that head tax that they pass\nAnd uh we were ridiculed across the country for it because they were going to fight homelessness by basically forcing employers to lay people off because they couldn't afford to pay this hadn't tax to the city and that's the kind of crazy ridiculous taxation that people in this state are fed up with\nAnd and your opponent is on record of wanting higher tax rates\nAbsolutely and she voted against the tax cuts in jobs bill she said she would rescinded\nA there is like all these big government Democrats there is not attacks they don't love it's another way to get people's money\nAnd the people of this country are seeing a new way and that thanks to Donald Trump kind of it doing with his policies are what hasn't been done in a very long time and I particularly loved in our state and across the country that unemployment rates are so low for our ethnic and minority communities\nAnd I again you're you're running a very vigorous campaign you're out there all the time you you can't match I'm Maria in terms of money I mean she's been there three\nFull terms in the U.S Senate um what's what would be your first priority if you actually win this thing\nWell we have a lot of priorities in this state and a lot of people may not realize that we were inundated with forest fire smoke based on very bad policies that keep us from clearing out the under brash and getting rid of that tinder uh it's ready to explode the moment there is a forest fire we have had\nCatastrophic forest fires in our federal for us and that's got to change and that's one of the first things I Would do another thing is we are really hurting when it comes to transportation and because our state is so a poorly respected in the halls of power we have very little cloud to bring home any kind of money from the federal government and I said I can bring home that\nThat there was a forest fire we have had catastrophic forest fires in our federal for us and that's got to change and that's one of the first things I
