that's just some of what boys have to deal with\nIs talking about the importance of supporting our police because of what goes on out there not forgotten a crab they were dealing with today in the capital as you have the the protesters and again from a political movement standpoint\nWho doesn't want to be part of that is what I Believe ideology and by the wayside for a moment one of the things I've never been able to get my brain around\nHow especially young people go yeah those people make a lot of sense you know what I should be due I should be part of that now\nLet's be real for a mom and a lot of those folks in D.C are pros they're paid\nThese are folks who don't have lives the rest of us we go to work we have lives\nAnd we uh you know you go about our business later the day and go oh okay that's where the losers were up to today yes those are all the losers rub through today the losers that go out there and they get paid and in many cases they end up getting paid more if they're willing to get arrested so yes they do they are those people but nevertheless just in terms of winning hearts and minds\nIt's fascinating now that's the second was talking about police talking about law enforcement and we've had obviously this immigration debate that's going on for ever and a seemingly no resolution in sight but the other um aspect of\nThat conversation that often is April ... ... refugees and I have long had\nMy focus on refugees\nFor a couple of reasons one is principal and the other the implications of refugees\nNow a lot was made though it wasn't big in the news cycle because obviously we know what the news cycle has been\nBut a lot was made that we ended up having the u._s. refugees in decades at least since Nineteen Seventy five according to the state department oh my gosh we're not importing you know even more people are into the United states and paying for all that to happen\nOr it according to PBS at the end of August only Nineteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety nine refugees had been brought in the prior eleven months compared to forty five thousand there weren't just made it oh my gosh and that was a bad thing right\nThen they went on to talk about how we're only anticipating three thousand being brought in next year oh my gosh that's just terrible now here's one is often not discussed the implications\nThe implications when are we going to be compassionate to Americans before we try to be compassionate to the rest of the world here's the way this works what you're not told\nWe as taxpayers have to bring the refugees into the United states the average cost tends to be around fourteen thousand dollars per refugee and according to the center for Immigration Studies the typical immigrant guess what happens when they get here where they live on government assistance for a minimum of five years\nAnd the average five your cost per refugee sixty four thousand three hundred and Seventy bucks that you're ready\nTo hear how much it costs to relocate a refugee into a safe zone if we get involved\nA thousand fifty seven bucks so we can actually relocate rightfully sixty four refugees into safe zones without importing them into the United states\nAnd by the way Ninety One percent of refugees we bring into the United states ended up on food stamps and sixty eight percent also ended up receiving ongoing welfare other programs made available now how compassionate is that\nWe found out that we have the lowest unemployment rate in many decades three point seven percent\nHow is it that we've made progress with those that have been long term unemployed those that had the toughest time those that were not as educated that weren't skilled how have we made improvement in young unemployment anybody ever think that maybe cracking down on illegal immigration\nAnd not bringing in refugees to compete for entry level work might make a difference\nSomething that's never just got back on June seventh of last year I actually made the case for how it could happen\nAnd we have seen over the past year plus exactly that is it anywhere near the entire reason no but it absolutely is part of the reason people automatically suggest that we have a responsibility and that kind of cost\nTo import people in ... competed against the most vulnerable in our society if you're really cared about the most vulnerable in society you give them the opportunity to ask what Donald Trump has been doing his policy once again\nOmission is the most pervasive form of bias in the media\nTo start the story one side of the fact I'm Brian mud and\nFor the great one more go there [noise]\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel whoever the iris tens of thousands in back taxes he told the Irish they didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief\nSo he engage them after my got the Irish to designate Nathaniel ... case as seat and see status currently not collectible that's a big win because it basically says\nNo use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here optimal kept finding on Nathaniel spy happened so the IRS agreed to a deal\nThe ball that's a big win because it basically says no use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here I kept finding on Nathaniel ... happened to the IRS agreed to a deal\nAnd if not for us than than who's going to be so again every cop is a good one but now hundreds of thousands almost all of them are and God Bless them because of now for them where or any of us are any of us\nAnd uh let's see I I Believe we're actually getting in right now on the line that the police officer oh go ahead and go right to you you get to the front of the line because you're another the police officer want to hear from you Ian go\nAnd see how are you tonight hey doing well fantastic now I just wanted to comment that I have to agree with all your saying I've been in law enforcement now for six years and it's especially with coming from my department\nYou just see it face to face 'cause we we are in a college town itself so I'm everything that the media puts out toward this you're definitely feeling it especially from the younger generation who only been taught that way and it's like one interaction after another where you're trying to change that\nGod Bless you man and are the folks who served with you um you know there is one thing I'll tell you in a again I Do the series down here in South Florida every week\nI Will tell you that there is a lot of support\nKind of like the silent majority that came out in may Donald Trump president elected more Republicans top to bottom of the United states of America in twenty sixteen than any other point since Nineteen twenty eight\nLove is out there are a lot of good folks that that really do get it in that do support yeah I Know just often isn't depicted in the media and certainly with many politicians but but do stay strong and and thank you guys are all you do a certainly is appreciated\nBy we'll switch gears go back to senator Collins and her big day Joe in Gainesville, Florida Joe oh [noise] [noise]\nHey Joe\nJoe Europe [noise]\nAlright Joe you're you're you're up let's go to Glen in Springfield, Illinois Glenn go\nTo Brian or can you hear me good yeah we got ya\nOkay hey thanks for taking my call and thank you for all that you know I'm I'm call on a some central Illinois I'm proud to say that Springfield is my home town that's where I'm calling from\nBut I'm I'm afraid to say I'm not proud that big turban from my own self ... had a I heard\nSome of the comments that he made the other day a face to face to Brett Kavanaugh and I was appalled a that's there's no uh respect there no uh no uh professional demeanor now\nAnd I think that Dick Durbin and and and I'm saying it I Want to his constituents Springfield, Illinois take care of an old saying that apology\nNo doubt and I I credit\nSenator college it's refreshing that she took the time to sit down with this man and get a one on one card I kind of a conversation with him I gave her credit for that\nNo doubt she her find this moment and uh you're absolutely right about driven and all the others I mean me how many politicians are we we started with\nChuck Schumer today and the Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation a line [laughter] he\nBefore we heard or anything from from Christine Ford before we had any backs present it said that he believes her in what happened in this country in part\nBecause of people like Dick Durbin because of people like Chuck Schumer who said that they believed her\nThat's all part of the damage that was done in this country go to Anthony in New York Anthony go\nHow would you do it very much for your for your great show\nI I just wanted to say I'm finally proud of the Republicans I'm an independent but I really finally proud of the Republicans they started fighting back\nUh it looks like a it's like karate kid number three hundred and fifty four way that you know Mr me I eat trout goes out and the teachers are ... or ... I had to fight back against the early age\nAnd the Democrats definitely didn't expect this so they they got a kick out of hand it to them so you got an\nInteresting take here this is not something that's been advanced it at least in my presence before I'm I'm interested if you get your take you were saying that potentially Donald Trump being Donald Trump may be provided the\nNecessary Jews for Chuck Grassley to figure out that he's not washed job for Susan Collins ago holy cow I Do have the backbone for Lindsey Graham too I don't know it actually it tends to be smart against is that kind of what you're you're talking about here\nActually actually really because I mean if you remember when Trump Card every time every time it was clearly something everybody everybody would go hide under rocks and now they're all coming there are fighting back and they're standing up and I mean [noise]\nFor Susan Collins ago holy cow I Do have the backbone for Lindsey Graham too I don't know it actually attempt to be smart against is that kind of what you're you're talking about here\nActually actually really because I mean if you remember when Trump Card every time every time something everybody everybody would go hide under rocks\nAnd now they're all coming back and they're standing up and I mean I mean I get Lincoln Murkowski your ticket\nAnd then when it's that's in it but uh it's okay she actually she had to say welcome to watch it once it gets thrown out or not it again so but as far as the rest of them are finally crowded I'm standing up and doing the right thing\nArguably Walmart deserves better but I appreciate that that's a really really compelling thought a good call Anthony in New York there let's stay in New York for a moment let's go to Frank Frank spend extremely patient of rank go\nYes or ... or I Would just like to say I support\nThe confirmation of\nA justice Brett Kavanaugh but I just want to find out I I've been thinking about this the whole entire week what's wrong with these Democratic senators how can they keep bullied all the stories\nThat from the from the lady uh but actually they actually don't know what the procedural issues are in the Senate they don't understand what they're talking about when they're accusing\nOf Brett Kavanaugh of things they have the actual physical evidence in regards to what is the capital has showed every bit of evidence he's proven where the timeframe where he's been\nAnd what he has done throughout his life and they continually\nFor some reason to believe that what they hear from this woman is actually\nTrue and let's say whether it is or is it but I Believe I'm Sorry a a ... I made five boroughs democratic where we're from the city of New York I have a different understanding of different things but I I feel very sad that the Democratic senators Congress are confused\nIn regards to what they're thinking feel about Brett Kavanaugh as a whole I think they should give this guy won the last month and then we will see if they were right in the world they should actually think about resigning\nInteresting a very interesting call there well I and I understand given your political disposition why you were inclined to travel down the path of given them one more chance\nMy my daughter will ultimately is a bit more uh maybe cynical which is you know if it's the by any means necessary and you know politics Trump's all\nPun intended but the interesting I just specially coming from a Democrat to hear that on principle you think there comes a point or close to it to where these people should resign All right so I Am by mud in for the great one\nMonth low man

losing forty one twenty\nTwo Mountain View and this is going to be the third or um opponents in four weeks for the youth\nA spaceship and August high school a few weeks ago on the same field Mountain View last week and now or um high school it's kinda like Ohio State beat or I'm a high school and they will capitalize be this year because or a football glory as back\nOh here's a trivia for ya uh this is the fourth time since I've lived in burned all that these two teams that played\nAnd they have something in common it's a last year last year when or um high one the state championship it was their FIRST Championship since Nineteen Ninety four which ironically is the same exact year that they use less one their championship\nYouth in Orem high a tigers played back to back at rice ethical stadium a it was just called right stadium back in those days on that old astro turf\nOr the or my tigers beat Davis fourteen to sex and then you went to one their championship game after a very very snowy night so a lot of people who were on that same\nHave very fond memories of that I'm sure from the U.S aside I happen to be on the arm side back in those days are or football or had some great times in the nineties and then kind of fell up basketball was a big big thing for ... for a long time\nAnd now football glory has returned under the coach of Jeremy Hill who was part of that Nineteen Ninety four or um state championship football team\nSo or I'm coming in a heavily favorites even just the coin toss\n[laughter] if you see the uh if you see the arm tires next to the U.S to use\nAt the coin toss or you could already see the advantage that or is going to have in this game they had a extreme size advantage over they used to it I Know when a\nWhen we're at now you last week and I was talking to some of the coaches are Maliki who previously coached it or I'm I guess there's a big division between those schools now even more so than just the standard bribery but ah where you know there's a lot of bad feelings between the two schools\nUh they said mountain you said and and they lost big or by the way the week before we played them\nNot to be said we're just trying to get out of there without getting hurt and that is a very very real concern for teams to play or because they have a lot\nOf division one players ... kicking it out of the end zone and touch back as the youth are kicking from the north the arm tigers received from the south the tires are going to take over at the twenty Arlen\nAre the it's an all black uniforms tonight with some white and red shrimp mostly upset a lecture him with a with black helmets and feathers on the helmets or with their classic look a golden yellowish golden pants with a they're white road jerseys and the golden helmets with the blue paw\nAnd Jeremy Hill no doubt brought that back ah because that's those are the same exact colors and uniforms that he played in back in the nineties I Know that changed a helmet looks a few times but boy they just it looks like a college team versus a high school team right now this is this is incredible\nField and going back the other direction is across the forty across the fifty forty down the opposite thirty and taken down inside you territory that right there is just a fifty probably a fifty two yard run on the very first play of the game\nAnd honestly this is what we were just kind of afraid of Orem high on the on the ground\nFor their fifty something yard snow is still ah junior running back so that one\nHe went all the way left and went back through the middle of the field and then pushed out of bounds almost exactly at the thirty so it is a fifty are games okay fifty one year again is is that the twenty nine so first attend tigers shocking three or series left one right\nAnd one of the backfield shocking quarterback ball in the right has three step drops look at last\nIs looking right no one's no one's open he's no one's giving them any pressure either until one of the youth finally jumps through and he's going to scramble for some yard edge of all\nSo finally one of the youth defenders it looks like they defended the secondary pretty well that quarterback had no one to throw two\nHe did scramble for let's see what the final tally about eight yard so that the Twenty one or twenty two yard line it's gonna be second into for him\nSo eight yards on that's in there at the Twenty one yard line so to plays into runs for arm\nAnd fifty nine yards worth of the office to receive it was left to right\nIn shock on his quarterback latest Cooper

yours sir\nHi shot at you for taking my call and thank you for a trip to nearly bringing up the true for everybody\nI'm Glad to be here every day thank you for giving me the microphone\n[laughter] uh basically all I wanted to say is is the obvious\nThis of this whole case is that a Ford is perfectly willing to do to a judge Kavanaugh what she has accused him of doing it to her assaulting a him on a daily basis just fall state in the present\nAnd just so much fake uh evidence everywhere\nListen she she identified and there's a there's a part of me that really sympathizes with this is such a serious issue in and I don't think we give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled us including the president\nThey handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves she gave the names of four people and none of the pork and corroborate her story including the guy that was supposed to be an eye witness to it at that point they were really you can't go any further with it and he adamantly\nDenies it so it's um it's a matter of just simple okay if somebody corroborated it we'd be in a very different position today\nI got to take a quick break but I don't have power\nFree

doctor Kermit gods now\nAnd how the woman goes into a clinic comes out of there is no police report\nI helped expose the crime the mainstream media tried to cover up we had instructions directly from governor origins office not to expect of course when the producers of the guys numbers he came to me for help I jumped at the chance I personally donated to make sure this film got me God's new movie opens October ... well it's amazing\nExactly I mean Republicans bless their hearts are so literal that they offer this stuff every single time and they feel that they have to\nDebate the details of this or that tastes when actually there's nothing to do with the details with justice itself\nThis is a tactic designed to hold onto power when\nRon answers and Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the census is going to be re watched this you have to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some use some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron this at this as a racist unit was going to happen because it had to happen\nAt work right there there are in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad in Missouri by the Democratic party said oh you know elect Republicans black cross a process of going to be burnt on people's lawns\nOr I ... well the James Byrd at I mean our war telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you in the census at all and just really outrageous claims and\nYou know one of the things I'd like to see come out of this that what has now become a predictable tactic\nThat they get called out on this Brett Kavanaugh up until two weeks ago yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen\nAnd now all of these allegations all of these solicitations and it doesn't matter like if Michael ... is making the claim that thirty six years ago\nThat there was a gang of boys that were routinely drug ... girls and then waiting in line to gang and trail raped them and that this was happening with the regular cars but nobody said it at the time nobody told the teacher a law enforcement official up parents\nThat it just kept going on and was covered up for this long because I Know where I go to where I went to school if one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds\nWell it's ridiculous I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive ... gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody no one else does either in she on the tenth one was raped herself and didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven years okay I don't have time for that actually there's a whole country\nWith all sorts of real problems to address\nWell it's ridiculous I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive public gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody no one else does either and she on the tenth one was raped herself\nAnd didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven years okay I don't have time for that actually there's a whole country\nWith all sorts of real problems to address as to what you really have to be a Republican senator I think you had to take that seriously these people fall for the same gag every single time for football and you have like the senator from Arizona's like oh really you're hearing really\nIf there are multiple claims being made yes they should be investigated this is a guy who's had six FBI investigations into his background in space Twenty years\nWho had a clearance that allowed him ... codes ticket nuclear arsenal\nThat vetted and yet we needed another on the basis of claims that have no sense to actually shut all members of tactical question for it I'm just making the obvious point she claims that this happened to me and for people she says for president of course they didn't happen and no one has the brass to ask follow up questions that I mean\nIt's a joke is what's actually happening it's a joke and only the Republicans in the Senate don't know it\nWell this is either some said they had no recollection amber of anything like that ever happening or being at any party in the case of a best friend she said well I I don't doubt what professor border saying about I don't have any recollection but also professional foreign identified one person\nAnd that was mark judge and mark judge having been in the room when this alleged assault took place\nAnd he has said over and over again that's not true now they made statements under penalty of felony and if they so when the FBI goes back to them if they changed their story they would be admitting to committing a felony\nSo I'm not really expecting a whole lot to change here except now the Democrats are put out a statement earlier today and they are now demanding all the witnesses telling the FBI how to do their job and meanwhile when they had a chance last week to talk about Mr Ramirez or\nA Michael ... client they passed and they punted and they didn't bring it up but now they want to extend it into that aspect and put so\nBut why we playing along with this I mean they actually\nGoing to tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra work done it was supposed to be limited in scope and uh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way Jeff\nFlake is not in control the Senate they could pass it without flake and where the leaders other than ... and I hate to say is Lindsey Graham seems to be the only person\nWilling to tell the truth but where the rats were the other Nineteen Republican senators out there on television make their case not just for Brett Kavanaugh but common sense and presumption of innocence but where are these people and\nThey they control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of the agenda pretty much that the president Lana under giving the finger to their own voters and on this one thing they can't just tell the truth\nWhy are they were they afraid of exactly I don't understand\nWhat do you think that you've been in cable news a long time you were back in the crossfire days I think even had a stint shortly at MSNBC I don't know how that worked out for you but\nUh I got fired yeah um well\nI mean I think that they are one opinion network and that's it and it's all conspiracy all hate Trump all the time but\nI'm now you've been doing really well in the Fox news channel news shows doing really well\nAnd uh what is the difference that you think is happening with cable news today I mean we're on the opinion side of things and Fox obviously I was a news division but\nI kind of look at what I Do is a talk show host as being the entire newspaper we report news sometimes it straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions other interviews we have people give opinion\nUm we do sports we do culture pop culture it's to me it's the whole newspaper all these other people claim to be reporters and they're anything but\nWe break a lot of news on our show and we have reporters working on the show there are only job is to find new things to flushed out do interviews I mean I you know I I had been in this my whole life\nTo what my family did I don't feel insecure about you know why you're not a journalist whatever I don't care what you call me but we bring new facts to light\nEvery night and I see are dropped more than any of your car to explain what this means it's a really confusing time it's I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen why did Trump get elected ... who didn't get a black to grow up what actually happened and what actually happened was\nThe people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions about our culture our economy our foreign policy they never said sorry and they never learn anything and so ... got mad at punish them and good for them to why would\nSo that's I that's what I think my job is to explain what this means and I think you know maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right now\nNo I think in the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it I don't really like for example there'll be days on his radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on T. V. there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that I have opinions\nAnd that's what it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism is part of what I Do but we don't just do that [noise] um anyway talking\nA little bit weird that all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be\nCrushed to silence why don't necessarily know what I mean there are less than nine Tucker there was a ... it's been a handful of US Soccer there's not that many and by the way there's a\nOrchestrated effort and millions of dollars being spent to shut down any anybody that dares\nTo not hold that prevailing left wing view but anyway we're putting it up on Hannity or on the website ... dot com\nThe ship a fool's how selfish ruling class is bringing America to the brink of revolution Tucker Carlson is with us his show every night weeknight eight PM ah preceding Hannity on Fox News channel and you're going to be a guest on now one of our pedals tonight we look forward to have a new\nI Can't wait thank you Sean\nRight Tucker thank you Hannity dot com Amazon dot com bookstores everywhere\nA listen I Want to remind you if you are a responsible gun owner you running out of time to clean your free lifesaving guy you're free audio book now if you want the truth about what really happens when people have to God Forbid ever use a gun in self defense\nThey're going to tell you about it it's the USCC a free shocking true stories of self defense it's an audio book just text were free F.

basis of the boys have a good selection\nSay he's not confirmed because flake or Collins or Murkowski or Heller okay they just don't believe him and the Republicans dropped the ball they have NO PLAN\nAnd they just like well you know and where do you need your vote because we're a repeal Obamacare do they lose the house and possibly the Senate\nWorst case scenario it to the junk they don't get them through down because of the Republican mhm and because of this week with Jeff Flake\nPeople are just like okay the Republicans are worthless I mean and they don't come out with a huge plant yeah I think you're right they'll try to turn that into a reason to get to the polls but if if it's the Republicans that causes it I don't know that it was kind of work I don't think it'll work okay\nAnother scenario he is confirmed it was a house in peaches Trump the house or in peaches Kavanaugh on perjury I think that is\nThat when the house you know they're gonna at least attempt is they will attempt to Trump and probably Kavanaugh to\nCorrect if you lose the house and the Senate these things are happening and there there's no chance of them being removed but you will have the next two years of non stop impeachment hearings of both capital\nAnd Trump OK mhm the only one that seems good to me is I'm a ... if Kavanaugh loses the boat\nThe only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the vote which could be really bad because it'll be the Republicans that do it\nUm however Donald Trump comes out and while he says yeah that's over here's the guy heat up the ante and you get a guy that all conservatives are rabid about\nGuy somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a skill Leah\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites I mean they're okay with him but no I was willing to die and a sword\nFor memory might remember Kavanaugh was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them he ... them later I personally think the best course of action\nIs to nominate let's say let's say flake in college come out and go you know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great\nDonald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next the nominee and you know what he's already been vetted for the FBI and every senator knows them\nSo we're going to be calling for a vote next week easy easy you know yeah that's the thing to do because then you have them battling just on abortion right there at the same place they'd have about everybody correct and that's not going to hurt conservatives getting to the polls\nIf if you put a dodge conservative\nSomebody who says yeah I think abortion is wrong and if it comes before me I'll look at the case of course but I think it's wrong I think it's murder\nTime yeah but but but lives in I mean you I mean you don't have videotape\nWell it was yesterday or tape now we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ...\nWe have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the Kavanaugh thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing\nThat we have to take her word that there is video with the with the with the\nEffort and we don't have that evidence yeah we have a a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence in the forties so we I mean like we haven't seen him out more than we ever preponderance of evidence in in the elephant case however um what's interesting about this\nIs that fifty six percent of Democrats believe Christine Blasey Ford allegations fifty six percent only eight percent say they ... they believe Kavanaugh fifty six to eight\nIs a split there so you assume\nThat if you ask people and it wasn't a partisan situation what do you think about the Allison situation do you what do you believe from her because she's got a more recent allegation she actually brought it to the tension in real time to multiple people people around her have seen evidence of this there's text messages there is a there are medical notes all the evidence that we just talked about there's\nAn infinity amount time as more evidence in the elephant case\nGet only five percent of Democrats believe Allison's accuser we're told over and over again that women are to be believed it only five percent of Democrats believe the allegations against Keith Ellison\nWhy this is really important I'm just like I don't want an abuser on the Supreme Court if if there was the amount of evidence on Kavanaugh that there is on a Keith Ellison I Would not be for Kavanaugh would you\nFive percent of Democrats believe the allegations against Keith Ellison and here's\nWhy this is really important I'm just like I don't want an abuser on the Supreme Court\nIf if there was the amount of evidence on Kavanaugh but there is on a Keith Ellison I Would not be for Kavanaugh would you if there was amount on cabin up I Would yeah I Would if if if the evidence was the same thing\nYeah what we still have a standard here in this country um called innocent until proven guilty and preponderance of evidence is a slower is a lower level than that\nAnd I understand that um my issue here would be\nYou can once there isn't the legal standard because people will say well this is just a job interview or this is just that this isn't a legal proceeding once you have the absence of a legal standard you have to choose the standard you apply\nI Choose to apply a very high standard because people who are in relationships many many times when he relationships and breakup or someone feels jolted say things that are not true\nI mean all that I agree with all the way you know in this case\nI'm Keith Ellison should have the right to defend himself\nAnd he should we should assume his innocence unless I agree point and which are he is and if especially with the case like this where it's very recent\nThat should just go through the legal system and when he comes out and he's guilty then he should get thrown out of that job and you can factor that in in your vote if you wish\nBut I don't think he should lose any job because of this at this point he needs to you need to be able to see whether this case goes through and and claims are proven someone had said they have video we need to see the video we see everyone or ... in investigated we need to see an actual police\nAre investigation go through and and and the weather the evidence leads us to a belief that he actually committed these acts if we do not get that\nYou do not ruin people's lives over it I mean think about the amount of times of evidence that there is a whiskey dealt in overall you more which everyone I mean even as a lot of people on the right we're like look ... really looks like he did these things his answers are really bad\n... you know there's much more evidence for heat though we're not too long ago was much more there's people you can interview right now yeah children who went through traumatic moments where they had to read about their mom being abused or you know sure her telling other friends at the time\nThat being said however you didn't you you went through this process with the presumption of innocence agree\nSo but what I Know about she fell assumes the evidence against him mhm okay\nAssuming this was not current day and it was thirty five years ago if for ... would come with that evidence\nI have letters I have a photo of the bruises on my arm I have um uh I can tell you where it happened I told my friends and here they are they verify that I told them after the party ... would you not\nWould you not go okay I think that's good yeah I mean I think that would be enough and it was the only way we can judge this situation wrecked right correct here it is with Alison and again this is why it's important\nJust like I don't want to have a Supreme Court justice that is an abuser or a liar or whatever I also think it's extraordinarily dangerous to have a guy who\nMay have beaten his girlfriend may have mentally abused his girlfriend assuming the evidence is real and checks out you can't have him as the as the the the chief law enforcement of the state\nRight and does anybody care no this shows you that nobody in the media cares at an iota for this woman and her story they don't care if she was abused and they don't care about any of it what they care about is stopping Brett Kavanaugh\nIf they care they would be just as passionate as a guy let's not just throwing out the Minnesota attorney general this is a guy who was second in charge of the ... what the the DNC ... this is not a a a ... a peripheral figure in politics he's one of the most powerful Democrats in America and it's now going to be a chief law enforcement officer first state\nAnd you could say oh well it's all you're what you're doing is what about is um\nNo no it's not it's not what about us and I apply the same standard to Allison that I applied to Kavanaugh you weren't doing this to Canada I Would still be saying this about I'm I'm a about Alice yeah I mean look at\nGoing back to the white bronco why was Brock Obama president\nRight brought up was president because he won a presidential election in two thousand eight previously he made a heck of a speech and what two thousand four\nAnd a two thousand four ... election he won a Senate seat a Senate seat that would have been incredibly close if he was going against not Alan Keyes who they flew in the last week so just started a campaign but it was a Jack Jack Ryan but it might be thinking of junk residency at this point um I think too many Amazon commercials\nBut a Ryan was his last name and he was a legitimate challenger\nTo rock Obama in that Senate race it was a close election and he may have won it\nAs a Republican in Illinois wow and what they did is they went through his divorce is the oldest divorced or um hearings and ... and paper work out at it to the public and in there there were accusations by his wife the actress who said they went to swingers clubs and all this sort of shady stuff\nDo we know if that was true can added horse proceeding divorce proceeding people make all sorts of yelling and that's why you don't just believe them that's why there ... because they went and got them on the field in a democratic state\nAnd they they they ... Ryan eventually dropped out there was no real opposition for Rocco bomb and you've got eight years of him\nThat sort of thing should be always viewed skeptically every claim of a crime should be viewed skeptically by people on that side you're supposed to give the presumption of innocence and posters start with skepticism of a claim on any side on any side on any side of all people who are accused\nAnd here we are in a situation where Democrats overwhelmingly believe the accusations against capital with almost no evidence\nAnd they only five percent of them believe the woman who is a Democrat who does not want someone up a ideologically opposed to ... to Keith Ellison to have that job she's a Democrat and only five percent of people believe her\nThe the platitudes you hear from the media and the left mean nothing on the story they do not care about whether Ford was abused or not they don't [noise]\n\nAnd this shows you how fast that standard is applied and how [noise] and how your life could be destroyed you are on the wrong side of an issue and by the way I think you've seen the issues to change\nAnd up positions what's politically correct changes and if you don't abide one hundred percent and you're not on the right side will destroy your life [noise]\nWhile they let somebody else be fine this is why we\nHave an issue and by the way I I think you've seen the issues to change\nAnd a positions what's politically correct changes and if you don't abide one hundred percent and you're not on the right side will destroy your life [noise]\nWhile they let somebody else be fine this is why we must have a standard we must have a standard getting dangerous to be an American that's the frightening thing to say [noise]\nGlad that\nYou know that the only city has a ton of programs you can watch on demand\nHas a police dot com slash TV you can watch every episode of for the record and to watch exclusive documentary one of those buildings will drop houses for terrorists coming out of the action packed shooting competitions to laugh at comedy like a wonderful world too\nConservative or they can learn what they're talking about", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Vernal", "day": "06"}
