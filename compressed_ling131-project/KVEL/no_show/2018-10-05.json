Republicans holding the Senate aren't necessarily and the Democrats winning the house but was thirty or thirty bucks\nWow that's a huge production for the Democrats um I don't think there's any scenario that I could just count thirty two days out of this election I think anything can happen and I hope the American people see what they were electing and Nancy Pelosi Maxine Waters and Chuck Schumer that's my of my biggest Pope John McLaughlin\nI think you're right and uh uh in terms of its just four weeks up over four weeks ago a lot can happen but I Will tell you that the key thing is Donald Trump is putting the Republicans on his shoulders and bringing them across the finish line in that he's bringing his votes to bear\nBut it is voters are coming back out but the key thing is\nIt's too real opponents right now or Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer he needs to take them on they're going to be a nightmare if they get control either house\nA for next year so we've got to do is look you know with national survey had fifty five percent unfavorable rating I mean fifty five percent will be a landslide for the Republicans and they could they could hold the house so right now we're headed to gain seats in the Senate but it's too early on the house\nAnd and prior to cabinet looked like we're going to lose the house but uh uh with that kind of a negative on policy\nFor her to be the leader to oppose Donald Trump every day for the next two years to his reelection he needs to take on every day about them wanting to raise taxes on the economy have open borders having having a back to the elites where the swamp runs the country again\nSo uh if he does that over the next four weeks the Republicans could hold the house and they'll definitely pick up Senate seats\n...

is the base of the Democratic party that is\nThat is who people like Nancy Pelosi are appealing to Chuck Schumer is appealing to Maxine Waters is appealing to and of course Michael ... the new face of

election and so uh for more information on that people can go to\nJesse leap Peterson a dot com justly Peterson dot com but we're going to be talking with Democrats and Republicans and independents about this uh upcoming election because a lot of people were really really upset\nAt what happened with just a cabinet are even people who at one time thought that they were going to be voting for the Democrats started to rethink their position and I have to tell you Sean I grew up on a ... down in Alabama\nI grew up I was born there I grew up under the Jim Crow laws I remember black and white size only when I voted at Eighteen I voted for the Democratic party all those three are\nGrowing up on that plantation living under Jim Crow laws that I was actually a Democrat Democrats are right\nFor you to help free thought they don't lie for you to take care of yourself they lie to you about the Republican Party editing specially the straight white conservative Christian Bale they're always calling a racist and they use those words to brainwash you in order to as slaves you and the beauty of all\nIf there is it a beauty and death about what's happening with the judge and a hatred and anger and the accusations false allegation without proof that we have seen over the last couple of weeks or months or so even longer than that or even a lot of black people started to think about the Democratic party\nAnd they're starting to realize especially in the Christian they're starting to realize maybe they are involved with the wrong party\nAnd that the party the Democratic party is not like the party that they join many many years ago and I think a lot of folks have been affected by this\nYou know see O'Brian I remember correctly where are you part of the N. double ACP for a number of years\nSean I'm a two term president at the end of the stock Garland, Texas\nAnd the way you might not know what I'm I'm a life member I became a life member I was not an event in Atlanta and I it just so happens I said please the next time take politics out of a man like Clarence Thomas\nIs in advancing and is exceeding at the highest level please please support him I said that when I when I pay I pay my membership fee I have the cardio somewhere\nAbsolutely right Sean and what we're seeing now\nOr the fake activists who are hitting the street I remember when I was president ah there and I'm going to disclose this that there were times when we would look load up scan buses full of activists by simply giving him ten dollars in a tuna fish sandwich and a drink to get on the bus to go protest something that they\nHad no clue what it was that they were going to protest and that's what you're saying on the streets now and that\nIs fake it is something that will not stop freedomworks the organization that I Am with what you have grass roots activist who are in the capital right now who are checking on their congressmen and senators\nTo make certain that they ride herd on this particular vote we want cabin ought to come through last week\nFreedomworks we had two thousand people on the Capitol Grounds pushing through not only Jim Jordan who I can be the next speaker of the house but also we wanted those elected officials who should be responsible\nTo the American people for the opposite they old to make sure that they go and do the job that we sent them to do it's a long way from when I was president of the N. double ACP twenty seven years ago\nTo where I Am now and that plantation that ... Peterson was talking about the jets the lead was talking about by the way Jesse leaves in my movie runaway slave or just we\nWant why am I not in your movie what's up with a ... do you and I have to make the next film together Sean we have to make the next and I don't know I'm just\nWondering why you picked Jesse you didn't pick your friends Sean Hannity\nYou're good buddy you got to come on the show real so what's that plantation was real I grew up during that same Jim Crow era it's very real but many of us have run away from it\nAnd we encourage many more at this point in time in America and the president is giving us all the caliber that's necessary to run away from that type of sleep but that this nation that falls under\nYou know to attitude at the beauty of what President Trump has died in that because he lacked\nHere he's put country first he's not afraid to really deal with these people is not afraid to use social media to put the truth out there and just try to encourage it a lot of men and women especially those are good to stand up and speak up fight for their country fight for what is right and when they saw this attack on judge\nKavanaugh his wife\nHis daughters while they're saying that they care about women they care about children we're to love and compassion for the judge and his wife his children or God I have to deal with these allegations\nOf this whole thing has to now we've got to get through the vote tomorrow and\nFight for what is right and when they saw this attack on judge Kavanaugh his wife his daughters while they're saying that they care about women care about children we love compassion for the judge and his wife his children are going to have to deal with these allegations\nThis whole thing has to now we've got to get through the vote tomorrow and am cautiously optimistic that judge Kavanaugh gets to be on the court that he deserves to be on what if we don't deal with the these tactics\nThe willingness to tear down bludgeon destroy men families kids are obviously impacted by it if if they can't even have the the most simple as the civility on these issues\nYou know the American people need to see you know it\nGet it understand it embrace what they would be voting for it's horrible you know destroying people it's horrible how many more people have to go through a Clarence Thomas judge Kavanaugh Robert

mansion next maybe he wins reelection here in and he goes and an end up with what you're saying but uh so I was mentioning\nIn the previous segment that there's the potential that we could be an inflection point in American history one in which the norms don't apply\nDonald Trump being president of the United states not your typical president and the movement that he was on twenty sixteen not your typical movement which has happened with Brett Kavanaugh\nThat could certainly aid the argument that we're in this inflection point that things are different this is not your typical midterm election cycle to provide a a little more\nFuel for that fire if you want to embrace it\nSomebody and I've never seen and again I'm a student of history and I'm a student of information and the point

in presidential elections it was the number three is you an election day there were three issue an election day twenty sixteen\nIs number one number one right now\nAccording to the Pew Research center Seventy six percent of Americans say that the Supreme Court will be on their mind\nWhen they go to vote however their impassioned do vote now\nWe are still just over a month away from election day\nPeople are fickle things can change Kavanaugh gets confirmed tomorrow maybe the level of priority comes down because it's been taken off the table I guess we can say or maybe people are still that motivated by because hey we have other Supreme Court justices that come up your over the next couple of years right\nThat remains to be seen\nBut we are seeing right now and some of the internal data that's available\nWhat's driving us that's different than ever before you have the Supreme Court mentioned and then it goes to health care OK so after that which by the way does that change the dynamic at all\nSo we're in this window of time that is different and anytime that politics that people are different the outcomes absolutely at the potential to be too so as we are now just over a month away from election day\nYou take a look at how many elections are out there\nThat could have the outcomes changed by seven percent seven percent\nAnd that is the potential for what could happen if there were a red wave that came out of this\nRight now if you had seven percent that moved because of President Trump because of the economy because of the progress or maybe because they are tired of what's going on in this country because of backlash about break capital you'll wind seven percent\nAnd the first hour I mentioned that in this entire Kavanaugh process entire process from the day after he was nominated until today\nSeven percent movement top to bottom in terms of public opinion on whether or not we should confirm Brett Kavanaugh that that is really what we're looking at here those are the people that are persuadable but seven percent\nEncompasses a bunch of elections across this country usually voter enthusiasm is exaggerated because only sixty four percent of eligible adults or even registered to vote in the first place and when you take a mid term elections well I mean typically have around forty percent they actually show up to vote\nWe do tend to often bake a bit too much into butter enthusiasm this and that but it absolutely has the potential in this type of environment to make the difference which is why it's absolutely critical you want to make a difference you get your butt out there and vote like you find those seven percent\nYou use this potential inflection point in American history and you get out there and you're trying to make a difference because we do have a different landscape it's not all they are in the polling in the in the top level numbers that are discussed yet\nBut it has the potential to be and we're a little more than a month away so that is what you are in store for you get out there make a difference if you're inclined unlike those\nAngry people that were paid and and shouting that Joe mansion it's going to win the hearts and minds at least I don't think it's going to winning hearts and minds there is this window of opportunity a moment in time potential inflection point issues that matter more than never met her before in mid term election cycles so what are you going to do with it\nAnd the other way want to give you a heads up on something that uh you definitely definitely should go ahead and ... on your DVR\nIf you don't already have in life liberty and lived in San eastern Fox News channel Sunday night\nGoing to talk about the media and one of my all time face best in the business my opinion Mollie Hemingway from the federal is just going to be one of the guests on the show I wherever they lived in Sunday night cynical like Easter and Fox News channel\nAre coming up we're going to continue this conversation get some of your thoughts as well as as an inflection point I blame on and for the great one Merkel them when you\nTake one atom of nitrogen and bond with one atom of oxygen boom you're just created nitric oxide a miracle molecule your own body makes that feels your cardiovascular health keeping you vibrant but as we all age our bodies need help generating more natural

speech today than it first I was I was stunned I was amazed I was impressed and ... her speech I started going\nThis is damage control and I started going wow I mean the American public and importantly to the Democrats the independents are getting angry and they need to lessen the damage and then you do run damage control David lessen the damage to them\nThat's what I saw I think that actually her ... her speech was scripted she did not speak like the her tax was written\nSome I don't I don't think that that was genuine I I think that they were really running damage control and trying to you know take the anger directed that they write just we have towards them and less than\n... where I I Can't necessarily get along with that ... the level of detail starting from the very moment\nOr that she depicted what happened at the time of the nomination\n... detailed and chronicled at every everything that she thought ran afoul and I don't know that she would have\nHad that level of detail if she were just trying to rally here in the eleventh hour to try to save face for the moderates in the Senate\nI got the sense that what took place today was truly principal and and really was something that she was that series about every step of the way in in throughout the process\nIncluding as you pointed out with all of her other previous votes so I I hear what you're saying but I'm just not in on the conspiracy thought process that Susan Collins it was not on the up and up I I really I got the sense that ah she was sincere and genuine throughout her speech let's go to Raj Raj is in Virginia Welcome to the show\nHello thank you so much I Do appreciate\nYour very strong emphasis on than fiction points I Believe the on that point but not just in the political lady now given the financially you know even the heck is he now\nHeads of state of change the culture is increasing and those are all the trends and I'm looking at a strong forbid wave or the other point you mentioned to vote on doing more to put up with it ...\nIt has to do with what's happening locally in D.C who people know that the two large seats\nAre to be headed by two opposing party so both have to be the public and and that's why that's not to seat in the D.C called collections or sway important so thank you very much for all that you said for an agency called how to live with you\nI'm guessing the year as big of a door because I Am are you an analyst\n[laughter] I have been an engineer or my life\nOkay I had a feeling that it was somebody who was a of a a similar type a thought process anyway I Am not an engineer though not that long shot I Can't even change a tire effectively just asked my doubt about that one [laughter]\nThat that was one of the moments where I ... my background is in financial analysis in in business outside of radio I've been doing this Twenty one years love when I Do uh but uh but the yeah you kind of want spiritual paths that way and uh when I ended ended up doing is taking Financial Analytics in various different algorithms and in formulas\nAnd figuring out that hey we have history we have information we can do a lot of different things in in life with them or beyond just a financial markets for example so anyway ah good stuff pretty she had rushed\nLet's go to Phil Phil is in Vegas welcome to the show\nGood afternoon you know the two things that that I took away from that when I was watching everything this whole whole process with my wife\nThe first thing when we saw the doctor giving her testimony we felt sorry for we really felt that she was emotionally disturbed and there we thought that was probably a whole plethora of reasons for that you know obviously saw sexual molestation but that one\nBut that we can tell kitty we didn't show anger I have no animals towards the woman but I think the biggest takeaway on this was the\nDebauchery that to the Democrats ex expose themselves to the process that they would go to to prevent something that was normal\nWithin you know the process of the government and there should be some Rican parents from these attorneys who were directed to her by Dianne Feinstein who had animals towards President Trump\nAnd hid things from her like her being able to be interviewed in California or wherever she wanted\nThis is the thing that needs to change within the Judiciary Committee procedures and the penalties\nNot necessarily innocent victims like Dr ... who I really think she is but the people who are behind that and directing it and in corrupting our government and I'm angry because I don't see anything on any news show talking about how the wrong people are going to be punished\nI'm going to agree with all agree with Seventy five percent of your point you're I I Do want to ask you specifically you say that you're not angry at at Christine forward here\nDo you feel that ah you see anything wrong by going under oath and and involving herself in this process saying that she was one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her\nWell here's what we don't know we don't know what was said in her\nUm sessions her therapy sessions I don't know that some therapist or some lawyer may have taught her into it you know when when you're that exposed and you're that vulnerable memories can be created all over the place I've been reading all kinds of articles about that so I\nI don't know enough about the woman to be angry what I Know enough is that I can see that she was used by people who didn't know enough I mean if it was really that big of a problem Dianne Feinstein whether brought it out they want\nShe knew that that wasn't provable in court and she knew that the longer she waited the bigger political bang she was going to get out of it and putting the attorneys who hated to begin with and in charge of it she knew that was another lose situation\n... well ... what did she calculate wrong\nIt's interesting now you bring up a lot of compelling an interesting point I still can't get there in in terms of having necessarily been ... into this mindset remember she's a professional in the field\nI mean after all I mean as part of her credibility she was telling us about how uh you know emotions are are stored in and memories are stored in the hippocampus was that they only won by the way when she pulled that out that went seriously this is how you're attempting to establish your credibility as a witness it was one of those moments where it's like okay [laughter]\nYou see what part of her tactic is near a ... but anyway on you know I still feel she's kind of ... you go under oath you're you're involved in this process you say you're ...\nBecause these are on their own way and get them all the food goes hires
