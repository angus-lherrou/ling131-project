five to eight six six four three five\nTwo to five to let me give you an example how crazy it is this is the executive director of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party forced to resign because he posted on social media\nI stand for the flag I Neal for the cross I'm not making this a\nSalvadoran that's the hard way south wasn't simply a loyal Democrat he was the head of Allegheny county Pennsylvania Democratic Party also a military veteran you think he'd be allowed to stick up for America once in a while but now he made the mistake of writing this in a Facebook post quote I stand for the flag and yell at the cross\nAnd I'm not so long ago most Democrats would have nodded in agreement that today is hate speech and he lost his job but tonight their losses are gaining Marsalis joins us now what I saw for coming on the show\nI'm the mistake that I mean did you have to leave your job running the county's Republican rather Democratic Party because of those words on Facebook\nAnd again also a military that I stand for the flag or knew what the cross loses his job\nWhile I was the executive director of the county party um and yes basically that's exactly what happened because of that post which reminds me it was over a year ago that I wrote to that or I was asked to resign yes\nSo you're a veteran you say you stand for the flag and you were denounced as a racist for that\nCorrect the people who brought this polite tried to tie it to the NFL players taking a knee\nSo I I look I'm confused I I'm not a democratic voter never have been but you know I've been here a long time know a lot of decent patriotic Democrats doesn't seem like that long ago it wouldn't have been weird for the head of a Pennsylvania democratic county party to say I stand for the flag and the before the cross what it had been five\nEven remember this was the the party DNC that blew the inclusion of God in their platform remember that\nAgo a crazy thing to say absolutely not and\nAnd and you say you stand for the flag and you were denounced as a racist for that\nCorrect the people who brought this to light tried to tie it to the NFL players taking a knee\nSo I I look I'm confused I I'm not a democratic voter never have been but you know I've been here a long time not a lot of nice and patriotic Democrats doesn't seem like that long ago\nIt wouldn't have been weird for the head of a Pennsylvania democratic county party to say I stand for the flag and you know before the cross what it had been five even\nJust remember this is the the party and see that the inclusion of God in their platform remember that years ago a crazy thing to say\nAbsolutely not and and I can tell you that even just last year when the Pittsburgh Steelers decided to stay in the locker room instead of come out for the national anthem\nA one player villain a waiver who's an Army Ranger came out and stood by himself with his hand over his heart and he was not considered a racist so that's even as much as a year ago it would not have been unheard of to hear somebody a leader in the party defend the flag\nSo what I mean you're the executive ... were the executive director of the party you obviously know a lot of Democrats in your county traditionally democratic county what if what if you're if you're a former coworker said to you since this happened\nI haven't heard from any of them I understand the party line is is a personal matter and I can respect that however those that are elected officials or party members who are not tied with my direct sort of chain of command if you will I've not heard from any of them\nThat's a shocking what does this say to you about how the parties change\nWell it makes me wonder if there is room for moderate Democrats and the Democratic party nowadays\nUm there were some elected officials who said that they acknowledge that they've known me and I'm not a racist however it wasn't sensitive and unfortunately if my patriotism and standing up for family friends has become insensitive\nOr that I think we as Democrats need to stop and reevaluate exactly what we stand for\nStanding up for the flag is considered a racist than what happens to the country do you think going forward\nStarted working forty five seconds left CNN's also reporting that uh the mother investigation is winding up in there could be more indictments what have you heard\nA I heard I followed the fact of the building down the team at least three or four\nOf the prosecutors team have been this jobs in the last three weeks I think we can expect there to find are these are all going to cost us for the million dollar ... and because they need to and that was no collusion and they will find no evidence of clues\nDr ... thank you for taking the time really do

other down the expressway to get to the campsite\nOkay we're going to Canada and at the beach that's all ... up to the mountains will go fishing it's going to be a care of that it's terrific have you seen these pictures have you seen the video of the they all have\nBy the way everyone in this uh this migration this this is the invasion\nThis reprehensible international crisis that make no mistake is absolutely organized these things don't spontaneously happen it's impossible and if you if you go to your favorite search engine and type in Honduran\nCaravan organizers they'll give you the list of several names couple of them just got arrested in Guatemala the Guatemalan government arrested them and send them back to Honduras but there's still people organizing this of course that have you noticed that that all the people in this they all have brand new backpacks\nWeird\nIsn't that odd they all have brand new backpacks full of all their personal belongings and they're all waving the flag of their nation El Salvador Guatemala and Honduras and they're demanding entry into Mexico and they are saying to whatever reporter will talk to them we are going to the United states of America and you can't stop\nUs\nAnd if you listen to most of our elected officials guess what their rights we can't stop them\nWhat are we going to do\nYou know the Democrats and sadly many Republicans on Capitol Hill\nDon't hesitate to criticize President Trump for his policy of securing our border enforcing immigration laws as they are written prosecuting criminals who break our immigration laws deporting criminals in this country for violating our immigration laws\nIt's a very clear cut policy by the way one that believe it or not used to be embraced by Democrats too\nAnd Republicans\nUntil they figured out that they could get votes and or campaign donations respectively\nFor being an international is for being all about open borders for being compassionate uh you know what's compassionate compassionate does not enabling people to continue to follow the same\nBroken destructive patterns that they have year after year after decade after decade\nYou know what's compassionate wanting the Honduran people to be empowered to alter and change the Honduran government or the Mexican\nGovernment you're terrified for your life in Honduras I get it gets what we were terrified for our lives hundreds of years ago here in America we made a change\n... remember when we all love the Arab Spring where we have people rise up against their governments across the middle east\nAnd or campaign donations respectively\nFor being an international is for being all about open borders for being compassionate uh you know what's compassionate compassionate does not enabling people to continue to follow the same broken destructive\nPatterns that they have year after year after decade after decade you know what's compassionate\nWanting the Honduran people to be empowered to alter and change the Honduran government or the Mexican government\nYou're terrified for your life in Honduras I get it gets what we were terrified for our lives hundreds of years ago here in America we made a change\nBut\nThat will remember when we all love the Arab Spring where we have people rise up against their governments across the middle east\nBecause they were set up and they were done I is it time maybe for a Central American spring why is the default obligation for America and for the mainstream media to be all things are awful in these countries come when\nWe got your back\nWhy is that suddenly the definition of compassion why is that suddenly the definition of being a real American oh if you don't open up your borders and allow anyone into this country you're anti American you're not really upholding American ideals are values are you kidding me\nSince when and how many by the way this is a caravan of four thousand if we let them in do you think that'll stop it hasn't for the last five years it hasn't\nThey keep coming why because we left them in\nAnd said earlier today I actually got to speak with a Democrat\nSenator Ben Cardin\nOr he is the senator in Maryland here in the greater Washington area is running for reelection and I asked him that I said you know what what should we do to stop these people from coming into the country led listen 'cause this is very this is very indicative of of how they think and how they talk what should we do to stop that should we stop that\nBut when one of the reasons we've had a program to try to improve the living conditions in Central America oh it's been supportive bipartisan by Democrats or Republicans it's polluted President Trump's budget\nOr we want to improve the living conditions for those of our neighbors who live in Central America\nThey hit and he goes on on this and and think about what she's saying here and this is this is considered\nTo be the the the ah highest level of statesmanship in Washington DC\nWe've got thousands and thousands of people who make no Bones Are secret about the fact that they are a demanding entry into our country because they hate the country they're living in\nAnd the politically correct acceptable ... old man on Capitol Hill response is well how many billions can we get to that government down there to improve conditions\nAnd by the way we've sent billions and billions and billions and billions already and somehow it hasn't solved the problem\nAnd and think about what the basis of this argument is to stop people from invading our borders we must throw billions of dollars to their countries it's extortion\n\n... we're bribing them we're bribing the government's down there\nTo get control of their own citizenship and then you get the Mexican government leadership and for that matter hung during that all of these countries in Central America where their citizenship is leaving in droves to go to another country\nAnd they're angry at us for saying no they can't come in let's say about that for a minute you're an elected official you've been elected by your population in El Salvador in in Guatemala in Mexico you've been elected to represent them\nYou've been elected to run the affairs of the country\nAnd the people who are elected you are fleeing your country\nTo go elsewhere and your response is not gee maybe we're doing something wrong maybe we need to fix our country no your response is how dare you America not allow my citizens to fleet my in Africa corrupt government to come into your country\nThese countries spend more time focusing on our policies then fixing and then you got a Democrat like Ben Carson who enables at\nWho enables that by throwing more money at it so I came\nBack and we went back and forth on this earlier today and if you want you can get the whole interview over at a my radio station to be a male dot com but I I came back around and I said All right lesson I Know you want to throw a bunch of money at this government and you want to do all of these things on the ground to keep them from going but that's not going to stop these four thousand okay there on the way\nAnd frankly whatever money you send down there you've already sent plenty and that hasn't fixed the problem I don't know how much more money you got to spend\nBut let's focus on what's happening right now 'cause you have a lot of criticism for President Trump for saying he's going to send the military down there for saying he's going to cut funding if these countries don't stop their own citizens from playing yeah you have all this criticism of him for actually trying to protect our borders so what would you do your senator for crying out loud\nWhat's the solution how do you stop these people from coming into our country when they reach our border what are we supposed to do\n[noise] but I don't know if I'll agree with you on on that statement I I I've been in bed with the FBI down to Central America I Know how dangerous the numbers are\nBy the way I real fast let me just the ... the the ... I had just said that there's a criminal element that there are dangerous gang members who are coming along with these and we know that to be true he's telling me that it's not true\nYou find you you were you reach your own conclusion I report you decide do you think maybe there was a violent criminal element over the last several years that came along and cross the border\nWith these unaccompanied minors oh no they were all seven year old children really they all had tattoos ... we quibble\nA I have interviewed a gang member who actually came to the United states to set up sister gangs including in Maryland so I I I understand the danger factor as it relates these gang activities\nI think most of the of the families that show up in our border or people who see themselves as desperate they're trying to escape Central America and in some cases they're legitimate fear of their lives should be able to seek asylum\nLet's see themselves as desperate they're trying to escape Central America\nSome cases the Abbott legitimate fear of their lives should be able to seek asylum", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "Vernal", "day": "19"}
