I've got a new voice Alfredo like clip something coming on this week and I wanted to talk to you about this I read widely there's a story in the Fillmore county journal up in Minnesota\nState unemployment rate dropped two point nine percent in Minnesota state unemployment rate is two point nine percent the job creators network must be as happy as it has ever been unemployment has crushed so low around the country\nOh and this is true you know across the country or even in democratic states right unemployment is really no thanks for them of course but on a national basis as we've talked about before new three point seven percent unemployment rate nationally\nThat's the lowest rate in fifty years Nineteen sixty nine right I mean that's meant Neil Armstrong walk the mood that are good at is\nHow you break it down in demographics 'cause I Want people to understand this is amazing Trump boom has reached deep into communities including young people African American people with those who sometimes lack behind the national indicators\nWell ... ... right across every single demographic group these unemployment rates have never been lower these are historic close I mean if we look at Hispanic overall\nUm and that's when I think you know I wrote a small piece on that but you know Hispanic unemployment is that the lowest rate median income has increased that's why I think recently there was a Harvard Harris Poll I Would just that was released a couple of months ago during the summer actually\nAnd it showed that among Hispanics\nAre approval rating for Donald Trump when the ten point\nIt's panics or one of the most entrepreneurial as well and you know we talk about small business a ... a job creators network and in terms of entrepreneurial spirit nothing is more alive\nRight now among Hispanics and ... on their spirit because they're small business owner so they are doing well and they're excited about the policies are put in place that are ... and co opportunity\nAnd I also when the president's approval rating has gone up to forty seven percent Mrs highest in every year and this reflects what is only a could only be called a red hot economy but we're coming up to the elections where are you taking the job creators to make the message plane in the next two weeks\nRight now we're wrapping up by the tourists this week so we are we're in Georgia got a couple more stop the taxes then go down to Florida and then we really are for the between now and ah thankfully November sixth right down the wire there we're going to be taking the campaign

and it's from the ... that that more consequential\nAnd frankly shows the contrast between the Democrats and Republicans\nAre you know more brightly in terms of the different health care on taxes on the economy and national security and he got to remember the Democrats were for abolishing eyes\nThe immigration and Customs Enforcement agency I mean imagine that we've seen pictures over this week at what's happening down and watch them all in Mexico I mean you got a question do we want that for this country\nAnd I and I also watched some of the debate last night between run to Santas and Mr Gillum in\nFlorida Florida is booming except for where it's been busted by the hurricane I cannot imagine that they want to turn away from the job creation policies of Rick Scott and vote democratic there and so I'm Glad you're finishing in Florida because\nA ... a little bit of high ... high but he had a great debate last night but if Florida votes it's economic future they'll vote for the samples\nWell and that's the thing right and and that's what I Want to make sure voters understand that this is a big choice election and it has never been more consequential again when you look at health care in the introduction of Bernie care\nThirty two trillion dollars expected to be spent or ten years is that they can get implement thirty ... taxes need to basically doubled could try to cover click the magic of that and the health care gets worse\nRight because they're going to take it away from the seniors and then they get it spread it around right and so the wait times are going

never talked to a mere mortal nations cultures art civilizations\nThese are mortal in their life is to ours is the life of a net than it is in mortals whom we joke with work with Mary ... immortal horrors are everlasting splinters\nThis does not mean that we are to be perpetually solemn we must play but I'm Miriam it must be a bad time and it is in fact the memories kind\nWhich exists between

that Louis ... first of all it so much of what we're doing in life is consuming in shorter and shorter hot takes right now\nAnd that means we have less and less wisdom I mean there is actually lots of data showing Americans reading significantly less than Thirty years ago if everybody were reading Lewis like that or even lion the witch and the wardrobe or or the weight of glory\nTo be perpetually solemn we must play ... must be a bad time and it is in fact the memories kind which exist between people who are from the outset taken each other's seriously no flip and see the superiority no presumption\nWhen the United states and of course centers that's when the United states was a church going place with if not\nA denominational agreement at least a general agreement on the dignity of

takes right now and that means we have less and less wisdom I mean there is actually lots of data showing Americans are reading significantly less than Thirty years ago\nIf everybody were reading Lewis like that or even land the witch and the wardrobe or or the way the glory and other assets\nThere is so much weight there that starts from that assumption\nOf a modern day so to the Judeo Christian tradition the assumption that people are created in the image of God and they have dignity soul humans soles are immortal and so if you treat people like that it means that even if I differ with somebody on policy and there's lots of legislative\nPriorities and policies that you're going to differ with your neighbors about\nThat doesn't change the fact that they're a human worthy of dignity created in God's image and ... a descendent of a line before that but maybe the parents of line that's coming after them\nAnd if my neighbor for doors down and I completely on this in my view the stupidity of a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and all the economic destruction that will cause that doesn't change the fact that we're going to root for the Oscars together and I'm going to sweep their kid up in my driveway if she skins are neat falling off the bike like\nThat not that go ahead that is the that is the rediscovery of community but now applying for me senator cents to a problem which I've been talking about all morning\nThere were seven thousand human beings marching towards our border they are human beings they are embargo day they they deserve dignity but at the same time our laws cannot be captain to the mob you can't march into America and it's seven thousand people can mix them all be fourteen thousand then I'll be fifty thousand\nHow do you want to frame what we ought to do about this for the public\nYeah so let's go back and and this is not a you know just trying to blame the prior administration because I Want to be clear our immigration problem started decades and they called me\nA huge part of this problem is in twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen when we didn't send the clearer signal and Central America\nThat the assumptions that people and especially bad people I mean they don't have the image of God that we can distinguish it we had more time between the electrical right just as a civil rights as a but human traffickers are in Central America\nTold people they told moms and dads when they were trying to take big payments out of them to say we can get your kids into the U.S they told them that the U.S is catch and release policy in twenty Thirteen fourteen meant that if you got to the border you were basically guaranteed admission and passage into the U.S\nThe U.S has to have borders every nation has to have borders and if you're going to secure your border that means you want to stop the upstream or in this case downstream the goals\nThat are telling people our policies are so dumb that if you can get to the border and turn yourself into a border patrol agent we can't pet process the backlog and sold immediately just release these migrants straight into the U.S and they'll have a six month asked until their trial date and some super majority of them I don't know the current statistics\nBut I asked the percentage of them don't ever show up for their trial that uh for their deportation trial that was stupid and now we have a big problem because these assumptions have been set for so long we need to send a signal\nThat the U.S this border is hard and getting harder and needs to be hard and more and that you won't get in under that dumped catch and release policy\nAnd at the same time we need to make sure that the ways that we communicate that continued articulate the US's grand division of seven and a half billion people being created with dignity that doesn't mean the free passage in the United states of America\nThe fence must be the outward expression of an invisible resolved to both control your border but be a welcoming country let me play for you then as we talked a lot senator during the confirmation of justice cabin up\nChuck Todd on meet the press on friday has been all over the country doing what I'm doing doing meet and greets with voters his conclusion number four\nAnd my travels this week no Democrat would sit on the record amazing how consistent some of them were people running ... some of them are people voting although we're going for the Democrats [noise]\nWashington Democrats messed up some of them went by name name check some of these Democrats and these are Democrats out campaign trail frustrated at the Capitol stopped\nSo Ben Sasse why the Rick oil I think Chuck is right I've heard the same thing it's in the polling there's a window if the Republicans back what is it about those proceedings because America to shutter\n[noise] well I I I'm going to be delicate about this because I think the backdrop is the gender gap in America and I was thirty five no I'm no I'm you know are\nTrying to think ooh my ... my favorite pollster of the moment as ... bowling expert but when you have a gender gap a plus thirty five um historically Republicans usually trial you know for ten point\nAh with women on when you have plus twenty five with women and now for Democrats and now a plus fourteen ... ah for Republicans with men sometimes just fundamentally broken in the country so there's a lot to say that isn't just about the Kavanaugh hearings and but I think in the Kavanaugh hearings\nYou saw an attempt to politicize and hijack the me too movement and bake it something that is owned by partisans in Washington DC I'm I think the beach a movement is incredibly important because I Do think we have a culture of a lot of sexual violence in this country and I think the beaches movement is on that a very good thing\nBut I think you saw it in the cabinet hearing an assumption that politicians can just grab any cultural movement and do what they want with it\nAnd the reality is we have a long\nTradition and the British and American legal tradition of rights not just of the accuser but of the accused\nAnd there were people talking rhetorically around the Kavanaugh hearings like there's no such thing as a right of the accused and I think um you know moms and dads don't want that for their sons they don't want sexual violence for their daughters um but they want a world where um there's a lot more cautious deliberation that was that was happening in that media circus\nAnd very quick I was a senator in my case it says do justice love ... with your God that's kind of internalizing every Christian in America and Jews as well I don't think kindness was on board and justice was certainly not present in that Senate proceed\nNo you're right I mean ... ... the big gap there where politics and politics for instance TV um happens like that for so many people who are the politically addicted class of Washington\nThat is because I think
