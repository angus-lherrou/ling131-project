inside Central America\nReally began to mobilize these groups in Honduras\nUm weeks ago and in fact a week before that they were hearing rumors that something was happening that they believe there was going to be some kind of mobilization but they weren't certain and another thing that I found very interesting was that there were some according to the people that I spoke with now I remember I still have to investigate that\nThere were people within the United states people that belong to NGOs or hate department official that we're very close to have a leftist leaning groups\nThat were also

not she stabilizes our ability and it drives risk\nIn our relationships we saw that they you know the United states government and the Guatemalan government have a very strong relationship\nBut when you have this flow of migration coming across their border and remember they're much more like the European Union a lot of people in the United states don't understand that the Central America\nAllows

two\nAs the president's rhetoric senator who's video looting CNN or\nThe enemy of the American people for example they move I've asked do these violent tendencies at least in some people [noise]\nWhy\nI think that that's obvious I had been concerned about this for a long time I spoke about it like in the Senate started in January about the president's rhetoric\nLet's remember we have a president was talk for a couple of years now about imprisoning his political rival and Hillary Clinton who is encouraged violence against media uh just last week talking about the assault on a reporter by congressman in Montana and saying that they see that he's his kind of guy\nIt's hard to see this outside of the context of the president's hostility hostility towards a towards Mrs Clinton who tried to briefly speak towards unity towards Brock Obama towards George Soros\nThe president and his allies they need to dial down the the political rhetoric and they are making people laugh they they are making journalists let's say and they're making law enforcement officer is less safe\nBut we don't know who did this or we don't know what their motive was\nRight but it's a very obvious thread and maybe it's meant as a ruse but there's an obvious threat the Obamas the Clintons John Brennan CNN um George Soros\nThese are people and organizations that President Trump continually attack demonize is caused by if you look at who they've targeted so far it's almost like they're following Donald Trump's Twitter feed and starting with Debbie Wasserman Schultz\nNot but certainly one question for the president one question for the White House is the rhetoric the intense rhetoric that he has been saying and his supporters have been giving out over these last several weeks leading into mid mid term elections and certainly even before that is that contributing to any of this\nSay I mean there are all people that Donald Trump pay they are all a people that he has used violent ugly incendiary rhetoric against or whether it's journalists like CNN where the John Brennan letter was dressed or Hillary Hillary Clinton you know from the lock her up chants\nAnd you know I was in the ... thing with my former colleagues at CNN and they're scared and one highly former colleagues fat this is what happened when the president called the enemy of the ... plus high\nAnd I thought my gosh you know it's it's the tone and coming from the top and now CNN has become a target journalists that are simply trying to do\nThree hours ago the president was either a very later got up very early tweeted this\nSee [laughter] [noise]\nFunny a lowly rated CNN and others can criticize me will even blaming me for the current spray the bombs in ridiculously comparing\nThis to September eleventh and the Oklahoma City bombing writes the president you know what I criticize them they go wild and scream it's just not presidential but walk a lot of people are claiming Trump and that's silly we don't know who to blame you know we we can buy represent the bombs and we find that out in the FBI with ten or eleven packages are going to have\nIt or if it wasn't so serious it would be like a holiday cornucopia or the FBI lab as they got more leads than than they do points on my airline that mileage\nUm account\nSo there'll be finding and it's either going to be you know a professional\nNo we we can blame him ever since the bombs and we find that out in the FBI with federal Evan packages are going to have it or if it wasn't so serious it would be like a holiday Quantico where the FBI lab as they got more leads and then they do points on my airline that mileage\n'em out\nSo there'll be finding and it's either going to be you know a professional alligator grapple or in

which I pick because the Heller decision is two thousand eight it's the one on the second amendment as you well know and um that the school is called that his masterpiece\nYes that therefore it's the\nIs it was understood at the time of the framing\nRight but where will disagree is that I think that the Heller decision which I pick because the decision is two thousand eight it's the one on the second amendment as you well know and um that the school is\nCalled that his masterpiece yes that therefore it's the the clearest articulation of originalism in the Supreme Court decision though far yes and and so when I look at it and look at the actual\nBehavior and thinking of Madison and the spring of Seventeen eighty nine when he's writing the second amendment and the debate in both the house and then in the Senate\nAnd then the debate in the eleventh states ratified what's going on there has nothing to do with owning a gun it has to do with whether or not a defense of the republic will be in the hands of state militias or a federal army\nAnd their great fear of a federal army as big as a standing army\nNot just a fear of what the British Army representatives that's primary even of the continental army\nYou're absolutely right that is that Justice Stevens descent and I think American dialogue exception expands on her way that he did not know that might persuade young people are undecided on the other hand I I Am persuaded by the general understanding in the states at that time consuming firearms and frontier defense that even beyond the militia people of course\nHad the right to carry weapons in the Stewart discussion instead of what I wanted to get to what I really liked about American dialogue and I want everyone on my team the originals team to go and get\nAs you explain how James Madison came to bitterly for sitting then I'm a resigned himself to and then maybe even a applied equal representation in the Senate as the necessary means of getting to where he wanted to get which was ... he didn't want to get the bill sovereignty\nHe wanted more he's more Hamel Tony and then most people know and you lay it out there was no doubt in anyone's mind at the end that the states with forever have equal representation in the upper body correct\nYes though he regretted it I mean ... but he knew that it was absolutely essential if the constitutional first to pass and then be ratified because it was a gesture towards a state salary is\nAnd that the the the makeup of the convention and then the make up the ratification conventions was are filled with people who were very dubious about\nAny federal government they created a consolidated power structure\nThat was the creation of the British leviathan they thought they were a scraping from and so if he had made that compromise um it would've never passed and he was as I was saying earlier committed to a a a making those kind of compromise decisions\nAnd he later said you know that was the only thing to do and but when he first\nLeft the convention in September of Seventeen eighty seven and he wrote to a Jefferson he said we failed um because the Senate issue that you're describing you is you know still gives the states\nOf a stronger a subset of authority and power than we thought we we we can allow and that that will be a problem for us\nSo it requires a unanimous consent of the states to amend that provision and therefore I don't think it ever will be I have one suggest you read about you know\nI Know I agree that the the big decision they made was Nineteen Thirteen to make the Senate elected not by the state legislatures but but by the people at large and he would have supported that too um but there does come to be a problem in the sense that let's say north and South Dakota have for representatives with the total population that's less\nThan half the size of Los Angeles\nBut if you look at Rhode Island versus Virginia the framing that sort of disparity in Vermont even worse in Vermont have the greatest disparity with Virginia at the ...\nThat's true although Rhode Island didn't count as it did show up\nRip it Vermont did let let me give you a suggestion that hold you

responsible because one of his ... supporters went up there and shot somebody\nBut it's there there is an obsession always blame conservatives for the actions of some of these ... cases and that appears to be the media talking point for the hour for the day here\nUm you know if you expose somebody is being absolutely insane you know it doesn't matter what their politics are managed that we keep America safe\nYou know when I when I go out there and say I'm not going to go ... into the silly ridiculous road is saying well because that guy like Bernie Sanders any shot up Republicans on a ball field the Bernie must support that I said just the opposite is true\nYou know it is beyond reckless and irresponsible for CNN and all of them to ignore the rhetoric of De Niro and Madonna I think an awful lot about blowing up the White House they called the president twenty four seven on that network a liar\nThey'd gone deep into the conspiracy theory of Trump Russia collusion with no evidence but ignore such collusion or we do have evidence as it relates to Hillary they fall into the all the Kavanaugh standard but only because he's a Republican or appointed by Republican\nWe just heard De Niro and what the narrow was saying about the president's our president De Niro saying that he wants the punch the president in the face that they do any research over there you know over a fake news CNN any at all you see a pattern\nBetween the president's attacks on Twitter and and stage being echoed an apple abide by Fox News why Robert Deniro Sean Hannity October ... feet that old segment blasting\nThat he wants to punch the president in the face that they do any research over there you know over and fake news CNN any at all\nYou see a pattern between the president's attacks on Twitter in and stage being echoed an amplified by Fox News why Robert Deniro Sean Hannity October fifteenth that old segment blasting deniro\nOh so that's why he got a package from this lunatic bomber because he must have heard Sean Hannity playing the narrows own words calling the president of punk a dog a pig of calm a BS artist a mutt and saying that he wants to punch him out\nI Want to punch them in the face\nI'm not going to stop calling pointing out the calls for violence against the president that frankly is the right thing to do why didn't he joined me as a question he needs to answer\nAs the ... like just like CNN was the mobs we've been witnessing you can't even say the word mob when you watch women and children being run out of restaurants it's been conservatives that have been saying this ... this has got to stop\nWhen you see people like Ted Cruz getting chased out to restaurants by a mob how you're not going to use the word totally a mob hit is without a doubt that we're not going to put a stop that his mom and dad\nWould have ever had in South Africa to augment we already did that we already said they weren't mobs no it's not my right hand people who are in their hand in the way the ... the way the country's going and the policy of either what if we had before you jump and okay [noise]\n\nThe same deniro who screaming F Trump and the Tony Award seats so blatantly stupid up punk good dog pagan con artist to be I saw it as a mutt\nDestroyed from media completely ignoring what is the lesson file calls for violence on numerous occasions now going on for two years like you know fantasizing about blowing up the White House I Dream an awful lot about blowing it up\nI'm not going to stop calling pointing out calls for violence against the president imagine these words used by any conservative during the Obama years or the Clinton years\nIf you're a person of good will like I Am you deplore violence of any time\nWe can settle our political differences at the ballot box and eleven days and when you call out fake news for what it is that is not in any way so I Need to be clear for stupid people\nThat want to purposely misinterpret words of people when you call them out for having an agenda for being fake and phony and fraudulent that is just telling the truth that they don't wanna hear\nOr when you point out that they spent basically every second of every minute of every hour of every day demonizing a president trying to de legitimize a duly elected president\nWhen people say that they care about the truth first and they say they really want to get to the bottom of Trump Russia collusion and Russia collusion at all Russian influence at all and totally and completely and utterly ignore\nThe candidate of their choice obvious choice buying Russian lives disseminating those lies to the American people in the lead up to an election that that's that's not\nNews that is strong opinion and that is it's not even opinion all it is a propaganda and misinformation you know I don't but with that said\nI'm the one that was saying and the Obama years protect the Obamas protect the president protect the first family protect all politicians\nWe saw what happened in the Kavanaugh hearings I didn't see many Democrats on any of these fake news network saying that\nUh we need to stop spending it senators we need to allow senators to walk the halls freely without being accosted I even said that it might be a good idea that we wait clear the halls of the house and Senate but those things are too hot and I don't want to see anybody hurt or worse\nYou know but when you have fake news people desperate to get any attention any ratings they politicize only those things that they think benefit by benefits their political side\nI guess it would have been easy after Steve school at least we shot and the shooting took place in the softball field for me to say well that guy is a Bernie supporter Bernie Sanders encourage that he's the one responsible\nBut if I did that it would be dishonest as they are you blame the people themselves they're responsible for their own behavior and actions now with that said I'm not telling anybody ever to get in anybody's face\nAnd create a crowd and to you know go after people and get them tell them they're not wanted anywhere anymore with a crowd\nAnd I've been the one thing that what's happening with secretary Nielsen Pam Bondi Sarah Sanders Ted Cruz a Henry Kissinger Mitch McConnell and now Kevin McCarthy has got to end because it's not going to end well if we don't stop this liberal confrontation\nAnd based on the orders of people like Maxine Waters Cory Booker and over the years years gone by even Obama himself\nYou know we've watched all of this happened we've observed it and I've been saying time for everybody to come down Hillary calls for instability oh now she's now she's calling for civility after the shooting after the pipe bombs have been delivered Eric Holder a week ago saying a kick up\nYou know listening to Andrew Cuomo yesterday you would think you know he joins became the pope calling for peace and stability an employer of his own them and the same guy that said if if you're pro life than you believe an assault weapon\nSay there's not enough to the you\nKnow wanted in New York because you're not a real New Yorker now he's talking about\nAnd togetherness want to tell you something because this this it doesn't ... you can explain crazy\nLike the Bernie guy was crazy you can explain whoever this guy is and apparently is the Yahoo News reports saying that he was not\nOn the one hand loving and hating Trump at the same time\nLunatics have no political boundaries you know the I don't hold Al Gore responsible for the Unabomber because he had earth in the balance in is that little ... that he built out in the wilderness or the shooter a steam sleeves blaming Bernie Sanders\nTo suggest any way that honest a vigorous debate and criticism is the motivating force behind one fringe violent individual\nLet me tell you what that is that an intellectual laziness\nAnd cheap attempt frankly to capitalize off a dangerous and serious incident especially in light of the fact while others on TV have been utterly silent their silence has been deafening I have been the ones saying something horrible is going to happen it needs to stop\nYou know these taste CNN sucks or CNN is fake news that is not a cry or an advocate Haitian of violence in any way shape or form it's a feeling people have when they see a ... abusive leap bias news coverage if you're American\nTotally silent their silence has been deafening I've been to one saying something horrible is going to happen it needs to stop\nYou know you say CNN sucks or CNN is fake news that is not a cry or an advocate of violence in any way shape matter for it's a feeling people have when they see a few abusive Len Bias news coverage\nIf you're American with us sold a shit transcend politics\nI deplore all violence of any kind but legitimate fair criticism of me that's fair game media criticism is fair game\nCalling out networks that have political agendas that's fair game when networks spend every second minute an hour of the day hating on Donald Trump of Donald Trump cured cancer they still hate him well I'm allowed to call that out that's not hate\nUs there's any hate their it's their hatred of the president that they can't seem to get over you know the bottom line is\nYou're watching people trying to make an attempt to its Floyd and politicize the actions of one unhinged lunatic and conflated with fair and wanted criticism and that for them as they're putting politics above all else and that's wrong for the country\nAnd anybody that has intimidated into stopping what they do because of this predictable attack I put it all up on Hannity dot com\nAnd it's called the less new low Hannity slams the media's total failure to report liberal calls for violence yeah we've got it all chronicled with all we we put the tape and everything you need to one place\nAnd we're going to tweet that out we're going to send that out to everybody where Lebanon days away from election day and there's a lot at stake\nRight now Republicans you know what they're behind I think in Florida that means Rick Scott's behind that means to Kansas is behind there's a lot at stake in Florida those two Gillum in terms of governing the state of Florida it will be a disaster that's my prediction\nIt doesn't help that many have been displaced in the panhandle a very conservative part of Florida and I hope those people able to get back and unable to vote before the election but I can tell you Marsha Blackburn can and should win in Tennessee if everybody goes out and vote\nAnd I think the Missouri can be flipped easily now that we know that Claire McCaskill just like Phil Bredesen in Tennessee has been lying through a teeth about who she really is she's talking about you know crazy Democrats ... votes left on everything so I guess she's counting herself in that group\nPrestige cleaning your blood and water damage specialists I'm mad hair of on news
