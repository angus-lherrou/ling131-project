was still being wiretapped by any government intelligence agency now you would think the answer is Oh absolutely not but that's not the answer his answer was not exactly\nReassuring now the FBI Director Chris Wray declined to actually answer that question as to whether or not the FBI the national Security Agency is currently collecting phone conversations with President Trump\nAnd during a Senate committee hearing on national security issues Senator Paul asked do you think it's possible that the president's conversations with international leaders remember when he was first in office\nThey were leaking conversations with the president of Mexico the prime minister of Australia I mean that's never happened before\nAnyway was asking whether it was possible to ... the president's conversations with international leaders are\nYou know in the foreign intelligence surveillance a Surveillance Act database and raise response was well I'm not sure there's anything I can speak to in this Saturday\nWell then Senator Paul continued do you think it's possible that Congress members of Congress or in the ... database of we talked to international leaders\nAnd then re deflected again is that well senator I'm quite confident that we're conducting ourselves in a manner consistent with the law in the constitution a that's a subject to extend some oversight\nI don't know that I can speak to every hypothetical about whether there have been such situations and then Rand Paul asked director re whether journalists conversations were being possibly scooped up by the intelligence community vast spying apparatus simply because they write stories about people with\nSay a terrorist name in them and re declined the answer again I Can't speak to specific hypothetical\nOr that point Rand Paul cut the FBI Director off and said the answer is yes\nAnd as this time with ray was drawing to a close he spoke about the potential abuse within the Pfizer system and Rand Paul is absolutely right he said\nYou've had people bringing their\nPolitics to work the concern of us who want more control over what you do and how you look at data is as James Madison said men are not angels that's why we have the constitution that's why we asked you to get a warrant\nThe information you gathered in foreign database is not\nConstitutional and the sense that had gathered\nWith no bar there is no war it there's no constitutional matter to that data and yet you're going to use it on a domestic crime that has been our complaint for years and years and years and I got to admit after nine eleven I thought it was a great idea\nNever having any any belief that it was possible as naive as I guess I was that we would have government officials at the top upper echelons within the intel community the FBI and the D.

the information was bought and paid for by one political candidate to use against another candidate and that it was never verified that corroborate but still present it to a ... court and they purposely don't tell the Pfizer court judges\nThat the other candidate paid for this and that they never verified it my swearing you know we'll get into this you know with chairman Mark Meadows of Freedom Caucus and Jim Jordan later I mean think about that\nThis is what we do we have a constitution for a reason there's a reason why you need a warrant there's a reason why you have to present

that that doesn't\nThat's just the beginning\nOf the just the fact is that the president and the Senate majority leader of work together to move\nAlmost one out of every four federal judges towards a more constitutional more conservative more American interpretation of the ... of of of the law\nAnd this is a remarkable achievement\nIf the Democrats would let us just why shouldn't really back home\nHim not coming tomorrow indicate a that there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to take the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a deal Jake two on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is I let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measure I tell you who's not measure\nYou got to people on the phone today Jim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein who you are not and bring 'em in and put them under oath\nYeah I mean and this is why that should happen and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoenaed than McCain memos and the kitten was or what the New York times\nCited that said there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who set by the time was talking about recording the presence of the United states so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council Jim Baker saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting\nThat Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country and we have the Cape memos that reinforce that we've subpoenas it became memos and we've asked Mr burgers time\nYou come in and answer our questions neither one of those things that happen\nSo that that you know Mr rather than it is leading that you played shot he he talked about shrimp he he talked about facts and and the\nHere and it is and how our our our ... our justice system works well one of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency show what the documents give us the Cape memos and more importantly comments or questions that's what bothers both of us\nWell why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I could tell you that your committee has shown weak leadership and I've I've I hate to criticize anybody a but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house the majority leader of the house\nA Jim Jordan and I with chairman Goodlatte in the room and and two or three other staffers we all agree that what we would do is move expeditiously to have him come into a transcribe interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in\nA that we would subpoena ham and compel him to do that and I can tell you that ah it's it's more excuses on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of\nSo we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and could\nLiterally force him to come and testify under oath an answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme of planned now you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe and now James Baker all saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states\nIn the hopes that it would provide materials that they could invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment\nHe says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it on a set of sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm in that\nAnd they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... the guy who was in effect running Justice Department should not be joking with support it's about recording the commander in chief of the United states\nThat ... that even if it's a joke that's not something you do that particularly at the time that this was happening remember on this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on late night the president fires gym called me on the seventeenth Rod Rosenstein they Bob Mueller the special counsel\n... there's one other thing to happen in between there remember Lisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was a media leaks\nStrategy so that when they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of ... reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was a page and struck we're talking about and it seems we've got our answer now\nWell you're right I think not only were they came in arid of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this you know we're we've got actually\nA memos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there are a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet they knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media\nCould not be substantiated\nI I Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead and\nI'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein read the five application many side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony is chilling the amount of documents that they failed to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well did\nThey fail to read them do we know they failed to read the more they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here\nI'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed that out that the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warns that that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated\nThey never verified they'd never corroborated any of the steel ... of this is Christopher ... deals\nYou know ... and as a result was used as the bulk of information to attain the warrants and the problem is not even steal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they ... that's correct that not even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given the British or but here's the other problem\nIs is even Bruce or knew that some of the things that he was writing there were not accurate and and yet somehow they get put in a three oh two and they get used as a justification to actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sick\nThing it truly is sick me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and douty demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow under oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously you know taping the president of the United states for the purposes\nOf of ... the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a term it gets to do the educated that he would do that so now with your time obviously to get that done and that sure Mr Rosenstein gets in there to answer these\nImportant questions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may ninth and may seventeenth of twenty Seventeen or he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a\n... individual who's coming forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look we've got a subpoena we've got to bring him in so we can ask the question\nI Will take a quick break more with congressman Mark

that's why I always tell people just just listening to authorities I Know people have said because I'm I'm looking and seeing online and and various media sites social sites people are literally live streaming the hurricane and there's some of them are even on the beach for crying out loud meaning that they're ...\nThey're showing that probably live streaming away from the center because I don't think anybody's live streaming where this this thing's a bulldozer about twenty miles wide bulldozers wherever it's coming in\nDirectly it looks like Panama City was on the west side of the wall and you know I guess this port say porch saint Joe it's got the you know I I fear for that area and there\nIt is harder perfectly said Panama City was ground zero it was and you also talked about the direction that the storm would hit you are right about that which as you predicted yesterday and and the day before and ever since Sunday that the angle at which this storm was coming in and made it that much more devastating\nYeah again it's different from a different from Florence Florence did not come in at her peak this came in all guns blazing as far as intensity goes\nAnd it's one of these cases where everything came together but you could see it coming together even back on Saturday and Sunday ... as you do I do do you know a sudden that email out so you could play in the show and see

last one of the season a lasting\nImpact storm on our coast yes I Believe\nYou know why it's so important that we put you on and you have this incredible encyclopedic knowledge of every hurricane that's ever hit the United states for crying out loud but\nMore importantly with the knowledge that you have you can import that knowledge to our audience and you can save people's lives because you know think about you know the years before media we had meteorologist and the ability satellite imaging for example\nAnd the ability to actually track and follow these storms and all of a sudden people will wake up and they're in a category four or five hurricane and they had no idea where it came from um ...\nThirty eight hurricane you know you looked at Long Island is legendary their those people had no idea what was coming in\nWhite Joan I'm old but I'm not that old I wasn't there for the thirty eight hurricane in Long Island in here\nIt's legendary out there and you can do it

whether it be the DNC Hillary Mrs for if not for a criminal part but for the civil part and the cost of the wild goose chase is they were sent on\nUh trying to investigate these things from ties and and so on and so forth and then strengthen the laws against false accusations 'cause they ruin people's lives\nOh I you know I I never said this but you really think about it\nAll of that information was disseminated to the American people\nTo lie to the American people to feed them propaganda misinformation so that they voted a certain way but more importantly then after the election that they lost in spite of all of these efforts all of the lying that kind of always takes place\nWhen and that's what the Democratic party does every two and four years\nIn spite of all that then they use this phony information again and again and again I have a media elite strategy feeding information from one source to multiple sources to seem like it's a real story when it was a concocted story\nOf a scam if you will and that creates an atmosphere where everybody calls for a special counsel and now we're discovering that people were talking about\nWell to some and the FBI now admitting that they had no evidence of Russian collusion at all that's why they disseminated the information that's why they leaked it to their friends and the media that we're willing\nYou know accomplices and all of this and then they talk about on doing a presidential election surreptitiously going out and recording the president unbeknownst to him so that they get and then in both the twenty Fifth Amendment and then I guess the whole insurance policies in place done and finished\nI mean that's what happened here\nYes sir and all these things are again being being paid for by the tax payer and we're basically

Rosenstein does not wanna testify have the information recorded or do it under oath because he knows he's up to his eyeballs and every aspect of all this\nAnd yet he's the guy that has all the power I

Competitive Enterprise Institute who wrote a report on the NYU center said the fellowships come with specific strings attached quoting him now the AG offices must agree to use prosecutors to advance progressive clean energy climate change and environmental legal positions Horner said\nDavid Hey is the center's executive director did not respond to multiple requests for comment I'm sure he didn't because we\nGot it we got 'em dead the rights we got um red handed\nBloomberg throws millions of dollars at this and why you program\nThe NYU then fires attorneys hired guns places them in the offices of the attorney general the attorney general doesn't come out of his budget doesn't come out of the state budget they answer to the attorney general the you know who's bidding they're doing they're
