example\nWhat happened to the women who claims that Roy Moore proposition them if the shopping mall all those years ago when they were all under age where they go what happened to that short\nDoctor

upcoming election I Do have to vote party in order to perpetuate\nAny semblance of conservative ideas that are left in the Republican Party because and also as a general rule Republican Party is letting me down year after year after year after year that's only because we have President Trump\nWho is who is crazy was the only Democrat his whole life but he's acting more conservative than anybody and so it's a strange world we live in but I just want to remind people that you vote ideas you don't vote people anybody who votes person as opposed to voting ideas as misguided in school\nWell here's the very ... they're going to be leaving that don't take the time so here's the big\nPicture ID or you you can't get bogged down I appreciate what you're saying I think you and I agree this year you better vote Republican there is not a Democrat\nIt'd be all set to make sure that there was no misunderstanding on\nWell it's person as opposed to voting ideas as misguided in school\nWell here's the thing in the area we can do anything they don't take a tiny so here's the big picture\nIdea you you can't get bogged down I appreciate what you're saying I think you and I agree this year you better vote Republican there is not a democratic\nMe out to make sure that there is no misunderstanding I'm going to vote party\nYou have to vote party you must vote party this year at the end of the day if you don't we're doomed if the Democrats will take the house in the Senate We're in big trouble that means we would all will have won the battle in October and then lost the war\nIn November and again I hate to put it in these terms one thing I keep coming back to what I'm going to say it I'm going to say it probably to my detriment\nThere are people genuinely anguished people who have been sexually assaulted people who were convinced because of all the activism and the media hype and all the stuff they don't even know the facts they don't even recognize\nThe the exhaustive lifetime of FBI investigations that Kavanaugh was subjected to and the bottom line no cooperation but there are people\nWho are deeply deeply anguished over judge Kavanaugh becoming a Supreme Court justice\nAnd those people should not be mocked or ignored or marginalized or or or talk to their or whatever\nThis is a messy messy business making an accusation this thirty six years old\nIt's measured because a cat cooperated in this case and beat somebody got smeared very badly the Democrats handled this horrifically at everybody\nKnows there's a lot of bad actors who got involved in this I don't know the Christie blossom Christine Blasey Ford is necessarily a bad actor Susan Collins said on sixty minutes last night she believes that should that uh Christians lousy Ford\nWas sexually attacked she just said I Can't accept that\nHe did it because there's no corroboration and she said frankly I Believe that she was attacked but I don't believe she was attacked by Kavanaugh ... senator Collins walked away with the conclusion that it was somebody else\nWill never know we'll never know\nWhat I like is\nThe acknowledgement that the me too movement that has insisted that women are to be believed and that's the end of that\nThat's changed there is a there's a counter narrative did that and it comes from no no lesser person\nThan to want to work the founder of the me too movement for many years ago remember the me too movement was sort of re ignited after the Harvey Weinstein affair there was two water Burke on NBC's\nMeet the press yesterday and this was very important what she said about women being believe because\nA lot of activists\nThey take that literally and they say that's the end of that women are to be believed and that's the end of that you're ruined the man at some of these instead if some men get ruined if their lives get ruined that's the price that has to be paid well that's\nBaloney that's nonsense\nHere's what to want to break the founder of the me too movement said yesterday morning to Chuck Todd on NBC's Meet the press\nWhen we say believe survivor not believe them without investigations and leave them without interrogation\nWe have had a ... in the country I'm not leaving us up thinking that women in particular are lying when they come forth with his allocate sense when people come forward Alex and so that's the mindset believe survivor about can we start with the premise that people do not\nOften lie about the tone and atomic clocks so violent if we start with that kind of pet me believe that is to vent and you can have an investigation we can have an inherent case and have the back and that kind of thing that they believe people blanket Adele in ... and don't do any uh anything else but I

of the things Democrats were saying back then was essentially that they were treating it as um\nWell hey the Republicans you know I've been trying to take down Bill Clinton since he became president you know Hillary Clinton had that term vast right wing conspiracy and they tried with whitewater and and ah ... it became a star and Monica Lewinsky and indeed this is just the latest\nIn a line of sort of increasingly desperate things Democrat Republicans have resorted to to try to take a Bill Clinton it was viewed in that context and and it's it's it's language I I've seen on the other side in relation to the Ford and cabinet and there's no last week\nNo yeah it's it it will resonate with everyone on every level but let's dig into the nineties I think probably the seminal moment is not the election of Bill Clinton do that is for history but for politics it's\nThe counter revolution in Nineteen Ninety four I Would live on PBS in LA I hosted the local PBS show with Patt Morrison kind of medics when we went live on Nineteen Ninety four I can remember clues about if there was a fight they stop it it was such a traumatic event\nFor the Democrats fifty two house seats lost nine Senate seats you know that Richard Shelby switch parties immediately after\nWhat made the carnage even worse I don't know that twenty ten or twenty fourteen whereas traumatic to the political system is Nineteen Ninety four what do you think's the current acting\nI completely agree and one of the reasons twenty ten and twenty fourteen weren't as traumatic was because we'd been through Nineteen Ninety four and and I had to put it in perspective for folks who who who weren't following it back then or maybe a forgotten a little bit I mean it had been forty years\nIn Nineteen Ninety four since Republicans had control the house and they hadn't even been close\nYou know we've got to mid term coming up right now we're Democrats are again of twenty three seats away it's it it may it may not happen but it's doable for them and and it seems like every election we go into these days it's it's conceivable that control the house could switch um it was inconceivable for\nDecades in American politics from the fifties in the Nineteen nineties the Republicans who control the house it was known as a permanent Democratic Congress\nThe speaker's gavel was was handed down almost like a hereditary tool um from one democratic speaker to another or Republicans were you know eighty Ninety a hundred seats buried in the majority are in the minority\nIn American politics from the fifties in the Nineteen nineties the Republicans who control the house it was known as a permanent Democratic Congress the speaker's gavel was was handed down almost like a hereditary tool\nUm from one democratic speaker to another or Republicans were you know eighty Ninety a hundred seats buried in the majority in the minority excuse me\nAnd it was an expectation heading into Nineteen Ninety four that it would be a good year for Republicans you know the Clinton presidency had been very rocky his approval rating was pretty low but the thought going into election night Ninety four with a a good night Republicans\nWill pick up the Senate and make a dent in the house um when they return started coming in I mean things started happening that night like a speaker of the house Tom Foley\nLost re election in his home district that hadn't happened since the civil war or Dan Rostenkowski this just sort of old bowl chair of the ways and Means Committee he'd been um he was later you know prosecuted but I'm\nDan Rostenkowski lost his seat in Chicago I mean\nIs this is like this is a district that was like forty points democratic and Dan Rostenkowski loses his seat there Mario Cuomo who is the\nThe ... most famous uh in Bolivia liberals in the country in Nineteen eighty four loses in New York state I'm just happening all over the map and and to go back and and relive the the the way this was regarded in the moment and Newt Gingrich of course become speaker of the house this was this was also unsinkable in politics\nBecause he'd been a a ... into his own party even an irritant just a few years earlier um but it was they were serious discussions of in the media\nIn the wake of that election that not only was Bill Clinton finished that was taken as a given but that the Democratic party and liberalism itself where we're headed for in immediate extinction\nIt was also the first media shock now I have often tell people if the media had a concussion protocol we'd all still be in it after twenty sixteen you and I were together on election night twenty sixteen but the shock of Nineteen Ninety four was as great it was like Nineteen\nEighty and it doesn't occur very often and you read describe it for our millennials out they're going to be fascinated by the way the ... that in the red and blue people who are still on the front page like Nancy Pelosi\nAre playing very large rules I Want to cook\nFor page three sixty nine where a speaker\nOf former Speaker Pelosi at that time just a leading Democrat was commenting on Monica Lewinsky uh I don't think it happened but if it did it comes to the big surprise I don't think for one moment there's an atmosphere of sexual harassment and the White House I read that because you're not easy on anyone you're just telling\nThe story you because I Want my conservative audience understand the connective plays this right down the middle and the red and blue you're not this is not an advocacy book\nThis is a narrative of a a multi decade\nI that exist thank you were saying that because that's exactly what I Would I aim to do here I'm In I'm just trying to explain how we ended up the goal with the book\nUm is to use as sort of the endpoint election night two thousand\nAnd it's the closest thing to a perfect time we've ever seen\nIn a presidential election in this country comes down to those five hundred and thirty seven votes in Florida the Supreme Court ruling the recount and all of that and I think that division that map that just almost perfect split down the middle of the country I I think it's the product of of all of the political battles and political wars of the Nineteen nineties that that just\nTook Americans and and made them choose sides Democrat or Republican I'm In and I think each party and its own way contributed to it the way it the way it responded to the other party the way it played off the other party the way it unintentionally reinforced with their party was trying to do um you know I write about\nA one aspect I write about here is sort of the rise of Newt Gingrich and his style of politics in the house which of course culminated in his his grandest our that that night in Nineteen Ninety four when he become speaker and\nOne of the things you see I I think that I that I Hope people see at least in reading this is in that long rise of Newt Gingrich in the house um he is absolutely changing a lot of the norms and traditions and blowing them up and embracing a much more combative style but\nThe Democrats who the prominent Democratic majority as it was known back at that time they played right into his hand and they ended up pushing a through the way is particularly house speaker Jim Wright says the guy from the late Nineteen eighty particularly the way he ran the house\nIt pushed Republican moderates into Newt Gingrich's camp and it left the moderate thing you know what we're getting nowhere with the leadership we've been following for three decades let's give this guy new to try\nBob Michel a great gentleman but not a change agent like new I Love the fact quote the first thing they did was stick at the Harvard on page tonight or tomorrow you
