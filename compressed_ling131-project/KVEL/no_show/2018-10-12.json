liberal oh my goodness and for embracing Donald Trump what a racist what a sell out we talking about that in just a few minutes\nNow I'm just received our latest alliance defending freedom totals and

Philips the owner of masterpiece cake job I had the privilege of meeting and interviewing him\nAnd I asked jak if it weren't for alive for freedom what would have happened given that the human rights commission in Colorado rule that he was\nIn violation of the law by refusing to bake a cake for a gay wedding he said I probably would have shut down my shop I wouldn't have able to afford the legal

Brown\nAnd the reporters were all there because Kanye West is a star and jump around a star otherwise it wouldn't be given a rip\nAnd Kanye West ended up speaking almost ten minutes kind of a stream of consciousness sometimes it'd make a whole lot of sense but most of it had to do with the U.S believe that black people needs to rethink their assumptions\nAnd that the police have a job to do a and he did not like the idea of this knee jerk\nPulling out the race card and he's being hammered been called a sellout being called an Uncle Tom\n\nSo real meat is President Trump is a bigger piece of racist because that's why people are he invites Jim Brown and Kanye West into the White House he's ... he's racist and he's a bigot doesn't like black people so it doesn't matter\n\nI look at this a reaction to what kind of you with that and I'm going to talk to you about what they said on CNN about him with Don limited calling him a token negro one of the commentators called him a token negro another one said\nThis is what happens when negroes don't read now calling a black person in equal in the year twenty Eighteen as a slur and I guess these black commentators believe they can get away with it because a lot of white people don't realize calling a black person the negro in twenty Eighteen is a result is offensive\nIt's something that you say when you want to put somebody down so that's what they're doing the getting away with bigotry left wing bigotry\nAnd Kanye West says he grow up without a father and told a President Trump today in the oval office how much that bothered him and it is far and away the number one problem in this country the number one problem in the black community the large number of kids growing up without fathers\nForeign away nothing else it even close all the other stuff people talk about all this other nonsense far and away and you have somebody calling us you can call them uneducated you can call him\nA not terribly literate calling what you want at least he gets the big picture he also understands that there's a connection between the welfare state in the demise of the family my friend Walter Williams and Thomas all have written about the\nBlack family after slavery a black kid was more likely during slavery to be raised under\nYou get the big picture you also understand that there's a connection between the welfare state and the demise of the family my friend Walter Williams and Thomas all had written about the black family after slavery\nA black kid was more likely during slavery to be raised under a roof with his biological mother and biological father then today\nAnd after slavery because for years it was illegal for slaves to marry it was a huge uptick in Mary\nAnd if you look at census reports Eighteen Ninety Nineteen hundred Nineteen ten a black child was slightly more likely to be brought into the world where they biological mother and a biological dad under the same group than a white kid more likely than along comes the welfare state\nAnd dependency and the LA Times\n... for people to non poor people questions about welfare and about dependency they asked the question to Nineteen eighty five they asked him again\nOr in twenty sixteen do you believe\nWelfare creates dependency or do you believe it is a stepping stone to get you on your own two feet and they asked for people in non poor people those questions forty one percent of people living below the level of poverty responded welfare creates dependency and forty one percent so they gave us stepping stone\nOr to go on your own two feet so as many poor people felt that welfare which harmful as so that it was helpful so don't you think maybe just maybe\nThat's worth looking at that's a topic worthy of discussion as many poor people think that welfare is bad\nOr ethnic it's good and about eight percent or so have no idea do I have an opinion one way or the other that is a boatload of people on welfare who believe that it's created dependency\nAnd that's what Kanye West was talking about you don't think it's worth having the conversation of course you don't know if you're on the left because you look into the mirror and say oh my goodness what have I done to be stabilized families the change values change incentives\n... by little desk or put that child at the kitchen table watch them do their homework close quote\nWe also need families to raise our children we need fathers to realize that possibly doesn't just ended conception that doesn't make you a father\nWhat makes you a man is not the ability to have a child I Know the toll it took on me and not having a father and how that's Obama not Kanye West\n\nRush tax resolution is the only tax resolution from that I back if you receive a letter or a

registered by the DMV or the DMV insist that no illegal or legal immigrants of of uh gotten them but it looks like some potentially some non citizens have\nGotten these these ballots and then the the LA Times look at a software that there may have been Seventy seven thousand voter records that were misreported\nSeventies that was always use me Seventy seven thousand\nSeventy seven thousand that were misreported to the DMV in some cases allowing duplicate valid in other cases um the envy seems to inexplicably have changed the party registration of some voters\nSo we've just we've just got a total mess and ah you know it's become it's a big scandal that even the Democratic controlled California's somewhat of a scandal that uh you know again the DMV insist that uh you know a legal residents have voted or whatever but\nYou know it's really hard to uh it's really hard to trust trust what they're doing and this comes against the backdrop of you know with the ... id law which is\nThe federal law mandating you know new driver's licenses that where people provide a you know our information so that the security going airplanes\nWe've got these enormous backlogs and the DMV he's had these huge commercial license backlog so the drivers would go through school they get they get a job and then it would take months for them to get a commercial license just because the DMV process so how do you allow these folks\nTo be in control of a voter records\nAnd then the law when it was passed in two thousand and Fifteen one of the big problems with um you know it had some amendments to it um where you're not a lot we're really limited the ability of the secretary of state to check out the ah the immigration status of the of the person\nUh you know who who is being registered and in the last set of a person as as quote if a person who is eligible to vote becomes registered to vote by operation of the California New voter motor voter program\nThat person's registration shall be presumed to have been affected with official authorization and not the fault of that person so if you accidentally get\nRegistered and you're not eligible to be registered to vote it's presumed that it's not your fault so it's just we're just looking for trouble right\nSteven Greenhouse gases article surprise DMV may have registered non citizen voters Steven I was not in favor of illegal aliens getting driver's licenses and I was called a racist you are in favor of illegal aliens getting driver's licenses and you're called a racist so I'm not quite sure what the right on yeah that\nExactly the libertarian ... and I'm not you know my views on on immigration are really quite you know quite a courts I lean towards bloody as many people and that's that's possible\nUh provided they follow the rules so I'm not exactly you know some kind of immigration restriction as them yeah I I you know I get it to we all get it right\nNow uh again if somebody who's an illegal alien inadvertently get registered to vote and he or she votes what happens to that person\nWell according to the law nothing nothing zoom that a ... and less and less I guess you'd have to prove that they get so we'll forty\nUh but you know ... basically when I pass the motor voter laws and I am against those in general because uh like if you can't go through the trouble of of the minor process of registering\n\nThat with this new Democratic Party [noise]\nGot\nWith this new democratic warning about crowded hell or the Democrats\nReally that's what the new Democratic Party is all about the same

things that I have noticed the over many years together why I Believe there will be violence from the left especially if they lose in\nRussia and all the luncheon although it's possible even if they win that will further the problem\nAnd that is the connection between high self esteem which the left has more than the writer I don't mean every single individual what went with\nSelf esteem is I Am better I better not my ideas I Am better than all those I differ with and I am a I Am better in that and\nThis is more important than normal middle class Sybil are the rules do not apply to me\nThen that will that inevitably leads to violence\nAnd it already has led to just a awful behavior you know cutting off relations with parents not going to the homes of friends of twenty Thirty years voted

free please go to ... for Hillsdale dot com [noise]\nAll right my friends this is my theory or read to you from the the psychological journal and it's all over the place higher self esteem\nBetween two groups of high self esteem and less self esteem to hire self esteem it'd be more violent these are all psychologist in a in a serious academic journal you can find that also where as well and makes perfect sense how can you hurt somebody unless you think\nYou're better than them you don't hurt people you think your worst than right the murderer thinks you know who are you or me I can murder you who are you on me I can rape you who are you I can you know you're nothing\nThat's why they're there are very offended when they're arrested there just offended\nI Can't believe who the hell are you to arrest me\n\nAll right now Julie Julie are you in Alaska\nNo I'm an art\nAh right so we got to teach our screener that eight K. is Alaska a are is Arkansas okay\nAll right well I learned to say All right no no no no don't\nBe sorry it's a it's a tough call whether the screener deserve the living martyr does not think uh she deserved to see in this case I don't know it was great yeah we we are truly egalitarian and whom we punish okay go ahead I'm Sorry Julie\nJulie are you there [laughter] almost like a ... what happened maybe she was offended that never happened Julie\nWhen you hear me yeah oh what happened okay I don't know right go ahead\nI'm Sorry I I I guess I'm having trouble with the wording in South of fame because where how we caught our children to has\nSelf esteem means that that you are comfortable any lard in fact that like something I said almost every day to them remember he made all the different things meaning you're a child a God and you are part of the family\nSo um I guess we have very high self esteem\nAnd I always have and so some of this agreement or yelling at me or not agreeing with me if it's truly something that I ...\nI wasn't really bother me now I never thought of myself as violent in any way that I can guarantee you I have a lot of self esteem so I guess\nI Want to let me show you know it's an important subject what do you think of giving trophies to kids run losing teams\nIt's ridiculous\nOkay so you okay so I have two theories about your notion of self esteem which would be hard with mine one is\nThat there is when you said I Want you to know your child of God I couldn't agree with you more\nThat's not the self esteem to the psychologist to talking about with regard to rapists and murderers and the like not that they they don't walk around\nThinking I Am a child of God I promise you know okay so I agree with you in that we are all in God's image this gives us a certain ... that is unique to every one of us I\nI I learned that as a child in my religious school and I believe it\nThe self esteem they're talking about is I Am terrific I don't think you told your children you are terrific and be you know okay you're even laughing now that so that that proves my point\nSo they're at the other is you believe I I'll I won't put any words in your mouth I'll tell you say I Believe I Believe in er in self esteem I totally believe if you have done well and you have done good\nThen you should think a highly uh or or well a viewer cheap and that's a very that's a totally healthy thing yeah okay so I think we're on board on that\nThe self esteem movement wanted you to feel good about yourself\nNo matter how you behave\nIrrespective of religion vast can sell us grew up Catholic got very angry

the president here is more of our conversation\nAnd you note in your mind or the response of this president to any Iranian backed terrorism on the United states territory or against American ships are\nBlacks you know I think he's been very clear on this not because we want hostilities with Iran but the opposite we want to be very clear about what our redlines are and I think the president's done that over and over again\nSpeaking of red lines a Chinese ship came with a hundred and thirty five feet an American warship these are American sailors if we're threatened while our sailors fire on Chinese ships\nLook at the rules of engagement for US Navy vessels worldwide but particularly and potentially dangerous areas like the south China Sea are clear the commanders have the authority we need we will not tolerate threats\nTo American service members were determined to keep a international sea lanes open this is something the Chinese need to understand their ... behavior has been unnecessarily provocative for far too long they got away with\nA an awful lot under the Obama administration I Would say China is one of the new bills coming due that Obama ignored or mishandled badly\nPressures now and President Trump he's responding in a way that has the Chinese confused they'd never seen an American president this tough before a I think their behavior or needs to be adjusted in the trade area and the international military and political areas in a whole range of areas\nPerhaps we'll see at the G ... meeting in Argentina next month\n... willing to come to talk

international pressure would make trying to conform to these\nRules and norms of behavior they've done the opposite they've gotten worse they steal our intellectual property so they're able to compete with us without the investment that's required and research and development they forced technology transfer from American and European companies they discriminate against us in terms of their domestic policies\nAre and and because of the economic growth that they've sustain\nNot only by abandoning their Marxist principles but basically by violating or the international norms we expected them to comply with they've gained substantial economic strength and on the basis of that economic strength they built military strikes I think what the president's doing because of his business background\nAre you among other things he's challenging on the economic grounds and if they're put back in the proper place they would be if they weren't allowed to steal our technology or their military capabilities would be substantially reduced at a lot of the tensions we see caused by China would be reduced\nThey have a lot of business partners in the United states shouldn't Google should

enemy of the United states\nAre we just had a within the past months the arrest of two Iranian agents in the United states uh scoping out Jewish and Israeli targets for possible attack\nUh we've seen France and other European countries arresting a agents of the Iranian intelligence service for planning an attack on a rally of dissident Iranians in Paris this summer we've seen transfer example now impose sanctions\nAgainst Iran because of this behavior so we see Iran or not\nA conforming to western norms\nBecause of the Iran nuclear deal they've not done anything to try to modify are concerned about their continued support for terrorism around the world they are accelerating this this regime is a threat that's why the president\nOr got us out of the Iran nuclear deal that's why the economic

their currency has gone through the floor unrest is spreading across the country\nEven countries like China or reducing their imports of oil from Iran because they don't want to tangle with the United states\nUh this is something that we should be concerned about because Iran remains what it has been since Nineteen Seventy nine it's the world is leading state sponsor of terror at a press has its own citizens and it continues to pursue programs\nOf weapons of mass destruction nuclear chemical and biological this is a dangerous stayed in the region and a dangerous state worldwide\nIn your mind or the response of this president into any Iranian backed terrorism on the United states territory or against Americans shift sort of flash it\nNow I think he's been very clear on this not because we want hostilities with Iran but the opposite we want to be very clear about what our red lines are and I think the president's done that over and over again\nSpeaking of red lines a Chinese ship came with a hundred and thirty five feet of an American warship these are American sailors if we're threatened well our sailors fire on Chinese ships\nLook at the rules of engagement for US Navy vessels worldwide but particularly in potentially dangerous areas like the south China Sea are clear ah the commanders have the authority we need we will not tolerate threats to American service members were determined to keep a international sea lanes open this is\nSomething the Chinese need to understand their ... behavior has been unnecessarily provocative for far too long\nThey got away with an awful lot under the Obama administration I Would say China is one of the new bills coming due that Obama ignored or mishandled badly pressures now and President Trump\nIs responded in a way that has the Chinese confused they'd never seen an American president this tough before a I think their behavior or needs to be adjusted in the trade area in the international military and political areas and a whole range of areas\nPerhaps we'll see at the G ... meeting in Argentina next month the Asian paying willing to come to talk turkey on some of these issues\nAre but the president feels very strongly that China's taking advantage of the international order for far too long not enough Americans have stood up to it now's the time to do and\nChina fears of weaponized the export of commercial technology in recent reports were Bloomberg and elsewhere was there an arms race of which we were completely unaware of non participating\nWe were being taken to the cleaners for decades ever since China came into the world Trade Organization\nOr they have pursued American to list the economic policy and what should be a free trade environment and they've gone well beyond that they've violated rule after rule after rule and they've they've defied the production of those who advocate admitting shine to the WTO that if they came in international pressure\nWould make China conform to these rules and norms of behavior they've done the opposite they've gotten worse\nThey steal our intellectual property so they're able to compete with us without the investments that is required and research and development they forced technology transfer is from American and European companies they discriminate against us in terms of their domestic policies are and and because of the economic growth that they've sustain\nNot only by abandoning their Marxist principles but basically by violating the international norms we expected them to comply with they've gained substantial economic strength and on the basis of that economic strength they built military strikes I think what the president's doing because of his business background\nA among other things she's challenging on the economic grounds\nAnd if they're put back in the proper place they would be if they weren't allowed to steal our technology or their military capabilities would be substantially reduced and a lot of

a letter and she's troubled and she thinks she remembers something and she can't remember the sales and she didn't she didn't try to trust this thing for other people got hold of it and they did\nAnd I think they're blaming it will because as I say about that how you gonna are you gonna run the country if\nSomebody a stage allegations and you know I said there's no proof available well it's a little worse than that right because if you read that thing by the by the council for this to me that interviewed her the details of her story\nAre inconsistent and you know so there are some things that are verifiable\nThat are not as she said and she said more than one thing about things and some of ... that are actually lose it well don't blame her for that these are old memories about

astonished me about this is that so many people through and so quickly with the idea that an accusation without contemporaneous corroborating evidence can be vetted in public without damage not just to be accused put to the process\nI mean it is it is nowhere in our tradition in the common law or to allow someone to convict the accusation I mean that goes back before the country was founded\nIf and see just a contest a little bit right this is not a trial he's not nobody has brought charges against him this is a political event\nAnd it's certainly true that is right it's fine to raise charges against him and it's even find to rage wild ones but\nThe one hopes that won't be affected but look what happened here he goes through a a a set of exhaustive\nHearing is investigated he interviews privately with every senator who was willing to talk to him and then the other thing is he has a long career as a has a paper trail and he's not so young guy just out of the blocks right he's he's been\nSo there's a huge amount of material and it's obvious that they're getting ready to vote for him\nAnd then this stuff is brought up\nAnd that is not the air or a good political

whatever the majority of the Senate wants to do the\nSenate can do and spent the election\nAnd there's a mission soon right and so if they do anything that people don't like the people can punish them right now and that's what keeps the sun is you're right about that right and\nAnd if you are if a well look look what McConnell is done and he's proud of himself right because the election\nWho would have predicted it All right the presidential election when they win and that Harry Reid changed that rule I wished by the way that\nThey would restore the filibuster generally two is nineteenth

recently Medicare for all now last week we're talking about the\nHonesty that the president put on Christine for its comments without ... that he did during the rally what he pointed out specifically how she seem to remember nothing except that it was Brett Kavanaugh and she had one beer\nNothing he said was false oh but you can't say those things sure you can because she was in the process of committing perjury oh by the way\nBut there is something else that he's been doing on Medicare for all and that is a a piece that he ended up a pending op ed in the u._s._a. today couple of days ago called\nDams Medicare for all playing threatens our seniors and hey it is\nBrian mud yourself for the friend I Do a morning show at W. J. you know in West Palm Beach I mid morning show W. I. O. D. in Miami and always in and honor and pleasure to be filled in for the great one more call then by the way you can catch me on Twitter at Brian ... radio now\nHere's an excerpt from the president's base\nThroughout the year we've seen Democrats across the country uniting around a new legislative proposal that would end Medicare as we noted takeaway benefits that seniors have paid for their entire lives\nCalled Medicare for all the Democratic proposal would establish a government run single payer health care system better lemonade all private employer based health care plans that would cost an astonishing thirty two point six trillion during its first ten years\nOh by the way\nAs a candidate I promise that we would protect coverage for patients with preexisting conditions and create new healthcare insurance options that will lower premiums\nI've kept that promise and we're now seeing health insurance premiums coming down I've also made a solemn promise to our great seniors to protect Medicare that's why I'm fighting so hard against the Democrats plan that would of visceral right Medicare\nDemocrats have already harm seniors by slashing Medicare by more than eight hundred billion dollars over ten years to pay for Obamacare likewise Democrats would cut Medicare with their plan government takeover of American healthcare alright end of the extra there for the president let me\nPut something in very clear terms\nThe president could not be more right the omission and the media on this one beyond the USA Today piece is pretty incredible but what the president is doing

can speak for me and he told me was like a smart cookie smart he gets it I Love this guy writer and let me get this data [noise]\nOh there you go I mean God coming soon Sarah Huckabee Sanders meets Kanye West\nTalking about the entertaining exchanges you heard the president said he could talk for many time what do you want to bet that there is a certain amount of empowerment the gun you feel I mean like ... as the president said he is smart cookie [laughter]\nYou can also see him going you know what the president said I can speak for many time\nThat that could be entertaining and has a book Asians we'll see where that story in\nNow a a story that I\nCan't believe it is still being discussed one that has been long perpetuated as a fraud not as significant as the Medicare fraud the Medicare for all idea that we're just talking about but the minimum wage\nThe the greatest fraud perpetuated over decades of time has been the need for the minimum wage to be maintained by your federal government now recently we had the Amazon dot com increased to Fifteen dollars per hour which in it of itself and don't get me wrong\nAmazon they built a better mouse trap but I mean the ... or so you want to talk about the ... the on the left and it was no bells remember a once upon a time\nWal Mart was the greatest the pool and the country because they were coming to your neighborhood and and killing ... they were taking them out there taking their businesses and then they were up putting a bunch of people on minimum wage right a plus at Walmart\nThere from uh from\nRepublican place aren't they yeah they do is be so I mean for all those reasons I mean Wal Mart which is a evil\nBut here you go you've got a you've got to Amazon dot com they happen to be greater than three times the size of Wal Mart yes yes the Amazon is three hundred percent\nRepublican place aren't they yeah they do is be so I mean for all those reasons I mean Wal Mart which is a evil\nBut here you go you've got a you've got Amazon dot com they happen to be greater than three times the size of Wal Mart yes yes the Amazon is three hundred percent these eyes and market capitalization of Walmart and loved by the left\nBut again you know I I began begrudge them nothing happened to be a capitalist they built the better mouse trap but anyway I digress so Amazon goes to Fifteen dollars per hour and then you hear the post go everybody should take Amazon's model now I Will point out some of the obvious here for people watch understand economics there are\nMany other businesses that operate in retail which happens to be a low margin business they were getting crushed by Amazon ironically enough are going to have a harder time increasing wages because Amazon at their size scale and ability to deliver the way they're delivering that they are killing to profit or take a look at any number of your retail companies that you grew up with that\nAre dead and dying as we speak now than I was standing\nThe number of people that actually earn minimum wage I went back and actually checked my research on this and ironically enough the last time it was a really big issue it kinda like coming off the Occupy crowd\nAnd the twenty fourteen midterm elections I happen to be about four years ago that we had the the big minimum wage conversation and hey you know what all the folks in the country had a point the economy did kind of thought\nYou know for eight years of Obama we average one point eight percent economic growth\nWe never even got close to an average US Economy so yeah okay but\nEven then what percentage of people on\nMinimum wage yeah number in your head\nHow many people back in twenty four team you think earned minimum wage ready one point eight percent even at ... Obama's the God I mean it was only one point eight percent what's more as the average age of somebody who earned minimum wage happened to be twenty two an avid it'd be working part time\nJob I mean you know that the people that were heads of households that work you know trying to raise a family and uh you know they needed a living wage right\nBut that was them and we got the best economy in a generation we've got the lowest unemployment rate in forty nine years weve got record low unemployment rates for everybody but pretty much why the white people\nAnd how many people actually earned the minimum wage\nYou're ready according to the bureau of Labor Statistics point six percent point six percent\nThat zero zero point six percent now what's more is that Ninety nine percent\nOf those people the point six percent are under the age of twenty five and what happened as soon as Amazon raise those wages we add the minimum wage conversation come up again\nOh one of the great rods perpetuated that's out there is a living wage is funny what actually happened a good economy economics Amazon dot com props prospering and they had the financial wherewithal to be able to increase wages\nJust like what we're seeing because here's another little factoids oh by the way\nWhen you take a look at the average amount of money that a person's making not only are we finally\nJust about a three percent towards a wage growth by the time you Adam bonus just goes over that by the time you add in your tax cuts turns out to be about another Eighteen hundred bucks for the average person working this year is what\nThe average net take home pay now a six point seven percent year over year you have to go back thirty two years to find the last time your income growth\nThat good so the living wage\nFunny what happens we actually have a good economy you out a living wage and the minimum wage\nAnd I was just a bunch of BS kind of like Medicare for all\n\nSuicides histories one side of the facts will continue to do a lot more of the factual stuff right here I Am ... and for the great one mark a little bit [noise]\nEvery time you go on line your Internet provider an advertising companies can track what you do and sell your personal information so how can you protect yourself computer experts recommend using a VP and the software I use called express VPN\nMakes it super easy for anyone to stay private online these days I don't use the Internet without express VPN express VPN secures and makes anonymous your Internet through data encryption and hiding your IP address\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading ... uh upgrading equipment and five percent have increased evidence so all in the combination of sheer bat buybacks in dividend payouts twenty percent that's it\nAnd even then you probably benefit because once again something that is not perpetuated information only by our friends and media generally\nFifty two percent of Americans own stocks and by the way despite the volatility of the past few days way with the greatest wealth creation machine the history of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary because you\nThe employee but ...\nYou know I I guess conveniently that that message has just been missed I Am sure that any day now it's going to be a big story that will be reported on\nAnd again CNBC they're the ones with that story interesting how even NBC what other news outlets hasn't decided to actually run with their own story from their own CFO council\nOne of these days I'm sure it's just oversight All right let's go to Ross in South Dakota Russ go\nProbably doing all good well\nI see it as kind of a two part problem really I mean you get a single payer healthcare system and you're going to\nBasically just keep these big hospitals in business for smaller ones they're not going to survive you know they're not going to make the money that these bigger wants to make it I'll be because they can't cut the cost that the government wants to cut them down to you for a lot of this stuff\nThat's the first part I see\nThe second part I see is we need to adjust something in the hospitals you know what it costs the manufacture of one thousand feet of sea bag of IV fluids\nI Would think not much I'm guessing you know\nA dollar I I did the research for my call just to make sure I had the numbers right and you know what they charge you for it in the hospital and a lot more memory hundred dollars\nWell and and so Ross and I appreciate the call and you have a ... a good point by a couple of things in it that we should discuss when we're talking about insurance generally\nThe biggest problem and affordability and healthcare is health insurance\nThe problem is we have been raised the idea that health insurance equals healthcare\nThat's not the case one of the more remarkable statistics in the wake of Obamacare\nHas been the lack of people that can afford health care with health insurance is was according to the Kaiser Family foundation hardly a conservative organization they still to this day are proponents of Obamacare I mean after all the kind of have a vested interest\nBut here's what they found in their research there are forty two million Americans forty two million have health insurance they can't afford healthcare you think about that for a moment\nThe average health insurance plan eighty five hundred dollars now if you don't pay all that it might be because your employer sponsoring it but that's the only an average cost of health insurance right now\nSo would you be better off\nIf you had eighty five hundred dollars you could use on health care\nOr would you be better off if eighty five hundred dollars went for health insurance and then after that you got to see how much you had to pay out of pocket before you hit the deductible which often happens to be a high deductible plans which then you can't hit which is why people can't afford health care\nThat's all part of the financial fraud\nSo the number one way to get to more affordable health care is to break the back of the insurance first model have embraced it was the first thing that we did that was a big time mistake\nOnce you do that you are going to get to the crux of what you were talking about there which is consumer price transparency the most back crap crazy thing I've ever seen in my life\nIs walking into a medical facility being handed a piece of paper that says in so many words that whatever happens in that facility\nOnce you have no clue and generally yet what that's going to be in whatever it happens to cost which they generally can't even tell you\nAnd whatever your insurance company doesn't pay for which they also can tell you you'll pay for how crazy\nIs that you will Magid walking into a store\nFill in a car with stuff not having a clue what any of it costs and signing a piece of paper that says some point later we're going to tell you how much you're going to pay us for this [laughter] I mean that is bad crap crazy but that's what we have with our insurance first model right now\nSo you break the back of it we get to a way the way we used insurance for everything else in our life how was that well what do we do if we have no mechanical problem with our car well we we do pay and habits next\nIf we get in a big time accident we found this year in school and we're already at the point with health insurance to where it's essentially catastrophic care for tens of millions of Americans right can't afford to use health care the rest of the time\nOkay so why don't we go to that place to where we use health insurance as a catastrophic plan which by the way is what the president's new plans the ones that are called skinny and bad plans and that the Democrats are are sitting there you know what I'm saying is the worst thing that's essentially what they are is catastrophic care\nWhich is cheaper and better for people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to use the other more expensive policies anyway\nBut at that point you're able to do what you're able to be a consumer we are incredibly good consumers when we have an opportunity to shop oh we got to find the best you on the world on MTV or whatever else that is will sit there and we'll take a look at best deal boom done\nBut with health care we never have a shot we never have a shot at doing it one of the things I Do somewhat routinely I'll take a look at any time we have research that will show the cost of a procedure from one place to the next\nUm I had a I had a minor surgery years ago that had I gone through my insurance would have cost a thousand bucks\nDecided to shop around\nPaid cash and it was five hundred dollars come to the point there\nWe never know because we sign pieces of paper those eh something's gonna happen here and we'll pay you for whatever the insurance company doesn't so they'd be if you really want to get to the crux of it not only is Medicare for all financial fraud but frankly the\nBiggest lie of Obamacare is not the you know ... it's going to be cheaper and you can keep your doctor and all that\nWe find pieces of paper those that something's gonna happen here and we'll pay you for whatever the insurance company doesn't so the the if you really want to get to the crux of it not only is Medicare for all financial fraud but frankly the\nBiggest lie of Obamacare is not the you know it's going to be cheaper and you can keep your doctor and all that it's an insurance equals healthcare insurance doesn't equal healthcare insurance is being hit this up healthier for tens of millions of Americans\nWill continue the conversation coming up next I'm by mud and for the great one\nMonth over him [laughter]\n\nAsk any a Mac remember what they like most about belonging to the conservative
