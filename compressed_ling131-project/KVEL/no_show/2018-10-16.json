[noise] my goal is just to\nBe an advocate for school an advocate for the kids and just positive it's all about positive for me\nTo tell us about your qualifications ... qualifications you have a to serve on on the board I think in addition to those just thirty nine years of teaching\nI have learned you know a load of crap alone during during those thirty nine years on I had had some opportunities that have been really great um during the last five years of\nMy teaching I was on the personnel policy committee and what that committee did it was a district level committee and there were six of us a couple of nefarious couple of teachers board member um district staff and what we did is we went over current policy and made sure that it's aligned with state law [noise]\nI learned so\nMuch and that is what the school board does they review policy and what we did in that committee is we reviewed it and we fixed at\n... ... did the changes that had to happen to a line was say law before the school board side um I learned I we went through in those five years we went through tons of policies we went through\nThe ones that had to be changed immediately because when state law changes\nFor school districts are part of the state government family and they have to be changed immediately and we made some changes because they had been request that I'm One of the policies we made the biggest change too was a teacher evaluation policy\nBecause in three years the state changed it three times\nAnd um it gave me just a huge understanding of district policy\nAnd that is one of the three main job through the school board is to do with ours at three mile jobs as the school board in your opinion well not in my opinion by state law I'm\nPolicy ... ... I mean it's to make sure policy aligns with um the state the second thing is to approve of the budget and the third thing is to hire this\nPolicy and that is one of the three main jobs and the school board is to do with ours are turning jobs as a school board in your opinion well not in my opinion by state law on policy ... ... I mean it's to make sure policy aligns with um the said the second thing is to approve the budget\nAnd the third thing is to hire the superintendent businessmen straighter those are the three main by law rolls of of the school board\nOr what are the top three most important issues to you\nI'm Janine you'd be facing a school that the main the biggest thing and the thing that I Want to focus on the most is\nRecruiting and retaining quality teachers it's a problem that our district has this problem that the state has its problems in many other parts of the nation [noise] um [noise] and one of his ways that we can deal with that problem um last year's Ford\nDid get a lot of work on they um improve the salary\nOf ... of incoming teachers which helps with recruitment you can't you know it's hard when you've got um these new teachers and they they get to choose especially in the state of Utah they can choose any where they want to teach\nSo do you agree with with the new pay scale um those issues to to to to teachers I mean some of them some of them haven't been happy with us for example the former one brought you in as as a lower rate which which was the lowest in the states\nUh reading about thirty thirty five so ... thirty six thousand dollars annually and then and then you had to kind of a sharp increase um after years six of two years um twelve sixteen and then it was just flat line\nRight um so you probably had your career during the ... one period\nRight well the the way that the old the way that the old policy well the way the old\nSalary schedule worked their stepson winds\nAnd it's complicated staff they don't need to get into the horses [laughter] oh no I mean [laughter] 'cause I yeah that that is on it made it so that at the very end of your career when you're kind of at the top you genuinely are taught doubt\nUm and the only way you get a raise is if it's on the base the new the new things I Know that these their teachers in the middle there who did not get\nIn the race but [noise] it's so important that we could those new teachers and because of that difference in the old schedule in the new schedule ... ... teachers got an option that they can stay on the old schedule\nSo you'd support since Vietnam on all three new buildings yes okay [noise]\nAh it's my understanding that the certified tax rate is a formula proposed by the state\nTo ensure public municipalities operating in part on property taxes to maintain that consistent income from taxes during and during the cyclical economy than we experience here is that true understanding as well [noise]\nYes I haven't delved into defeat that I I Do understand that it's so that the school districts have the same amount of money to operate on a regardless of what\nA property taxes ... ... ... your property values do oh okay um [noise] the\nThese this summer the UN a county school board voted to adopt the state recommended certified tax rates keeping the same amount of income as the previous year you support says yes the\nProperty values of declining you win a county because of the recent recession or do you feel the district has a responsibility to better manage district finances to reduce this burden on you in a county taxpayers\nI feel like the district of course has a responsibility to manage finance as well\nBut I don't think that the district can deal with ups and downs every year you can't hire a teacher and then say oh but hey you know property taxes on down and so we're going to lower your salary or when we don't need you the following year there has to be consistency there\nThere has to be the ability to plan\nWhat's gonna happen next year and and surprise um nobody expected it that are shooting population is up to share you in a high school is um almost two thousand kids\nAre okay or is that is that about a like a to point to speaking with a district administrator for this this district business manager Derek Anderson I said there was about a two and two point five or to point three percent increase this year\nIn in our enrollment that's a good strong economic indicator ways that are economy is recovering\nIt's a good thing but if we if we had\nTo be seen with a district administrator for this this history business manager Derek Anderson I said there was about a two and two point five to forty three percent increase this year are you in are in Rome if that's a good strong economic indicator batteries that are economy is recovering\nIt's a good thing but if we if we had lower taxes last spring and then it's like oh my gosh here we've got these extra fifty kids that you went to high school and we don't have\nThe ability to hire any additional teachers [noise] you know it just it just needs to be some plot level so that so that there can be planning and there can be management\nYou know opponents of the philosophy would argue that we have money in surplus and several budget several years and that there's a there's approximately twenty five million dollars sitting and various ...\nTheir their ears money sitting in various accounts that I'm not all of those counts are ours to use 'em an example Sisi funding career in technical education so cash and all of 'em is federal funding um [noise]\nWe do best earmarked for that specific purpose yes it can't be touched special ed\nHas its on Sunday we can that federal funding we cannot touch that special ed how central\nDirectly Tabasco directly that move it into capital or you can move it into the teacher salary\nYou know and a lot of that money is that way um and as they look at that in general budget on that she said I looked at that I'm sure Darren ... show Q. um it shows that there's all this money\nBut some of that money is also in club accounts at the high school so if your child um isn't the band and that band is planning a big trip to Hawaii and they'd been raising money because last time they get it they raise money for three years prior to that [noise] um yeah there's money there but\nIt's not our money it's the bans money it's at that saves money it's the football team's money ... money it's a cheerleaders money and that's money that they are counting as many that sitting an account it would be like rotting kids picketing\nWould you would you agree with the with the phrase that I'm a perception is reality\nPerception is certainly reality to some people for some people if\nIf I had a ... roof I perceive something to be one way oh yeah that would be my reality especially if that's all you've got so so can you see the public um is maybe feeling that there's not a lot of friends parents with the board\nI think I think that um [noise] that it may seem that way and I and I doubt that they are very many people in the general public who want to spend the time to understand all this stuff [noise] um [noise] it's a lot well well reliably your head around here's\nHere's here's what they do the public has learned about a four million dollars recently spent on are you in a high baseball complex at the same time the vote the board voted to adopt the certified tax rate\nThere there's there's reason was that was done with us or perception um should do you feel it should be more public discussion on capital projects we only have just a few minutes remain\nOn a ... I think that discussion on capital projects is a good thing but I also think that um [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise] that [noise] needs to be more understanding and because we hear about the baseball complex baseball complex it isn't just the baseball complex it's the whole new auditorium which was not ADA compliant it now and it's a brand new building where I was an idiot complain it's not\nThat part and the baseball field were cut\nOff from the improvements of the school because there wasn't enough money to do it then ... and so this is making up for stuff that hasn't wasn't done that was caught\nAnd and at the end of this project the auditorium will be new to it will have an elevator which will make an eighty eight compliant um the ramps were to see\n'em and sell it couldn't be used in and we keep hearing about baseball baseball\nBut they're so much more to this project ... than than that they saw softball soccer um I had been to several soccer games where I Would put my purse over a whole by the bleachers so that people wouldn't sprained her ankle debris need astro turf\nIn um according to you know I was not part of that decision I don't know the ins and outs of it but it

Kanye West the little dog the little husky\nChained to a rock and he doesn't care much like President Trump doesn't care what you think of him\nFeels that way he feels but how dare Kanye how dare Kanye be allowed to express support\nFor Donald Trump Michael good with the a Pulitzer Prize winning columnist over the New York post said in the beginning it was safe to ignore kind da and his romance with President Trump after Raul west as a performer it's easy to discount his political talk but recent events demand attention\nFirst came as Saturday Night live appearance where he wrapped in his red make America great again hat and praised Trump then there was the meeting in the oval office Goodman calls it a spectacle\nOnce again his stream of consciousness commentary veered from nonsense the common sense no denying the events were intriguing it entertaining\nMichael good was dead I still didn't regard any of it is politically significant\nUntil the left wing media went absolutely bonkers on it they're extraordinary venomous and personal attacks on west reminded me of the left's unhinged smears of Brett Kavanaugh and Trump some sunk deciding west documented mental health issues\nMany invoked his race input Jordan terms making them especially outrageous a black a black guy anchor on CNN accused Conyers you put it on a minstrel show a black pundit on the same panel called him and attention a horror\nAnd the token negro of the Trump Administration another chipped in with Kanye West is what happens what negroes don't read a black New York Times columnist said the White House scene was quote white supremacy by vent\nDrilling quiz\nAnd a white MSNBC anchor called it quote an assault on our White House Michael good ones says woe Nelly what nerve did he touch the first thing you notice of the double standards if a if conservatives criticized a black liberal in those terms\nThe liberal would let loose a chorus of racism in demand that every Republican denounced the commentators but this time it was the liberal media itself\nMay can be offensive comments Michael Goodman says\nMy conclusion is that the outpouring of ras suggests the answer to wet if Kanye West is important enough to be targeted by so many in the media for character assassination he must also be dangerous\nIf he's dangerous it's in the same way the conservative speakers are dangerous to college snowflakes and he just said from the ruling coercive liberalism might be contagious and therefore must be silence diversity of thought cannot be permitted he writes so we can assume that the left\nYou shouldn't you must also be dangerous\nIf he's dangerous it's in the same way the conservative speakers are dangerous to college snowflakes and he just said from the ruling coercive liberalism might be contagious and therefore must be silent diversity of thought cannot be permitted he writes\nSo we can assume that the left fears Kanye West could be a leading indicator that Trump's appeal to the working and middle classes is cutting across racial barriers\nParadigm has shifted\nPolls show Trump gaining support among black voters his approval rating has been as high as thirty six percent\nIn Rasmussen\nOthers including Gallup show he has gained\nMichael Goodman says we will know more after the midterms but I generally believe the willingness of individual voters to buck historic group trends is a hopeful sign fundamentally America is a nation of free individuals' none of tribes or groups\nAnd are Republicans healthier when both parties are forced to compete for every vote any vote taken for granted is a vote not earned and leaves politicians free to break their promises without suffered any consequences surely\nWe've all had enough of that Michael good one I Love his points I Love what he says about Kanye being this existential threat\nTo the liberal mindset and they're afraid of them they have to be why else would you attack a guy\nWith the kind of viciousness we saw when Kanye West\nAppeared at the White House oh he did was go to Trump and say I want to help with the inner cities I Want to help with father was this in the black community let's

billions more\nAnd you get far in theory or care because it never really was about the patient really was always about redistribution of wealth and\nYou know I can go over like I did yesterday all the ... we already have redistribution of wealth than American the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income one percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners pay Ninety seven percent\nSo what they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young\nAnd generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan when they would have been better off paying for one check up a year right out of their own pocket\nAnd also getting a catastrophic plan if God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or at a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr amber\nYep this is a one size fits all model um it's too expensive for young healthy people and

you Ninety pills for ten dollars is highway robbery\nWe knew cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases the fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is can compete on quality\nAnd and lower their price just like your Fifteen minutes we'll say Fifteen Percent on car insurance we need to get back to a competitive model for the patients are in control and cares affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nAnd we're at you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able

themselves and that's exactly what this loop and the movement does is it eliminates\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our ...\nYeah well look I Hope that these people in

out so either he's still in there somewhere or that um that's really the only explanation for it and there was a video of him and leaving the facility I think common sense tells you the Saudis would have produced in who did it how they did and I think we have to assume the worst and we'll see\nThey are pretty straightforward Marco Rubio kind of laying it out [noise] so ah where's Waldo Waldo or a friend formerly known as a jumble cause soggy alright so as the situation plays out I laid the groundwork by saying\nProbably the greatest accomplishment of all of the Trump Administration is actually the one we think about the least day to day because we're not dealing with the problems you every day we see the benefit of the economy we got in front of us\nBut we kind of forget that yeah you know what we used to have all those domestic radicalized terrorists all the time we haven't had this problem simply by the way I'm not superstitious I'm not trying to jinx anybody here but that's what that does that mean that they don't happen around the world\nDealing with the problems you every day we see the benefit of the economy we got in front of us\nBut we kind of forget that yeah you know what we used to have all those domestic radicalized terrorists all the time we haven't had this problem supplied\nBy the way I'm not superstitious do much run a jinx anybody here but that's what that does that mean that they don't happen around the world referenced ... we've got some problems here there was a real education that I undertook\nAfter we went into Iraq so I ah\nI went along with the narrative that hey you know uh yeah I mean Afghanistan's to target the outcome of bin Laden but\nHey we we know that uh\nWe know that we've got problems there Saddam Hussein bad dude if he goes down I mean yeah that that that makes sense and the people that could be free they are gonna want to be free not understanding all the complications\nSo once things didn't work out exactly the way that we all hope to and we're kind of led to believe that they would I decided I was going to go straight to the stores and read the Koran\nStarts out by the way and they'll give you the Reader's Digest if you're not familiar\nStarts out kinda like sunshine law Bob sitting by the end it's kinda like hey if you don't see the world the way we do or you die and by whatever\nMeans necessary the groundwork ultimately the groundwork ... now you have is our practice obviously many different sects some of which are positive\nBut she has no ... in all forms is evil\nAnd by the way if you want to argue that three laws not evil again I I guess you can but then you have to make the case that women are subservient to demand that if a woman has rights for example she should still be stoned to death because she had sex with the right but\nI mean just details you know that if you're homosexual as well as like about the left are you going to come out during understand Israel for for you lucky\nIf you are a homosexual just what you get stone because they're um sexual or you know these days they they they just got a sometimes they don't get the whole formal stoning thing together they they just all show buildings or whatever it was a part of the problem\nIn us being somewhat immune from the realities of Islamic terror\nWe can take for granted the safety that we have day to day that is not present elsewhere in the world a little detail for you that you probably were not aware of how many Islamic terror attack do you think of happened that have been documented around the world so far in twenty eight teams say about ... got number\nOkay try one thousand five hundred and eighty nine [laughter] probably a little bit higher than what you thought they just today for example and Molly you had a terror attack a woman writing her donkey blown\nIslamic terrorists earlier today in Afghanistan you at ... ... citizens that were bombs by Taliban\nYou probably didn't need to know that yesterday in France you had a man attack somebody with a chisel raise you know probably didn't know about that see\nEven sometimes in countries like France it doesn't get reported over here there's a lot more to that story three is that the root of it and guess what\nThey're still sending stuff that in Saudi Arabia toward the situation becomes that much more complicated\nWill continue the conversation still just getting going on in my head for the great one Marco there [noise]\n\nListen to what David ask from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk\nAnd how much time and I have throughout the day and I was able to get a lot more work done ... absolutely right I truly love my ex chair

E. V. I. N. dot com\nTo actually put themselves make themselves look like oh we're wondering we're under you guys just to try to get sympathy from anybody and anybody who who actually cares\nHow long have you on a ... how long have you been here ...\nI've been here since I was about eight years old\nOkay and uh how old you know or ...\nRight now I'm thirty three\nOkay so your view of the United states as a child and an adolescent to to today what what's changed in in what's your perspective\nYou know what I'm like in any any like any race there are good people there are bad people I've had good experiences and really bad wants to but overall ... ... people have in this country if it's like oh let me let me just say this uh\nThe the privileges the ... everything that people have in this country are a lot a lot of the most a lot if not\nEverybody in the Democratic party picks up for grabs her you know I ... it it just to me it's frustrating because what I what\nI remember when we first of all the trouble of our for president all everybody all the celebrities saying oh we're going to leave this country now find never do they always say and\nThey never do it so does\nThe law I Would love to take my recovery has power ... or ... or what's his name ... every every so often happy I'd love to try to spark\nWell Colin Kaepernick is white making way too much money being the role the the victim who who sacrificed everything making what but asked me to a hundred million dollars oh just a little bit more they would have made as a backup quarterback in the NFL so yeah I mean he he fully has a capitalized on his victim status and uh\nI'd like to try to spark\nWell colon ... making way too much money being a the role the the victim who who sacrificed everything making what about asked me to a hundred million dollars oh just a little bit more they would've made as a backup quarterback in the NFL so yeah I mean he he fully has a capitalized on his victims status\nAnd a Isaac I appreciate the call into perspective you know it's interesting\nI'm Aaron ... filling in for more calls in by the way and in in South Florida\nHispanic means about thirty different things\nAnd people always over simplify it in part of the reason why the way you have a lot of folks that get Florida elections wrong because you'll have some of these uh pollsters oriental is out there who will say you know hey nationally Hispanics break X percent for Democrats and they see that hey we have a very large\nHispanic contingent in Florida\nAnd they go all those people are going to pray for Democrats at this present\nWell hold on hold on\nFor just a minute [laughter] you have to figure out all the different interests than all the various different groups that are here all the Caribbean islands that are represented Mexico yes you do have south and Central America but it's also represented one of the things that I found to be most interesting kind of like a Isaac was\nIndicating there you're on DACA\nFor many on the right there are stereotypes and assumptions for example if someone's ear on DACA you they probably are and Obama type a Democrat and they don't like Donald Trump ...\nWell not not necessarily a big misconception that white kind of like hey you know X number of Hispanics will break this way regardless of where they're from or what their interests are you've got to get to know the people\nAnd I found more and more often than not\nThat people who really sought out the United states through immigrants they'll wanted a better life overwhelmingly overwhelmingly are more conservative than not certainly socially more conservative than that the Democrats have been in a very long time\nBut even in terms of economics I mentioned earlier this hour\nYou have a lot of the younger folks you have millennials for example are starting to have their eyes open to what this economy can do what the United States economy is capable of\nThey didn't know before because they became adults during the recession and then the Obama economy so now they're just starting to go wow you know things can be different\nI've seen it even around radio you were with some folks that have been here over the years like wow you know really can't get better yeah can you can\nSame deal with a lot of\nHispanics a lot of different backgrounds\nMight have folks that want a better life if they can obtain that they're going to want more of that and so what we've actually been seen increasingly ... is a trend towards them\nTwo of the most watched districts in the country did a a BBC special on the mid term elections they wanted to highlight six different regions of the country and the tops of elections\nAs the case may be in South Florida here we have the two most heavily democratic districts currently represented by Republicans in the United States House their districts twenty six and twenty seven in Florida\nIn district twenty six\nYou had Hillary Clinton win in that district in twenty sixteen my sixteen points\nBut you had Carlos Curbelo the current representative who's a Republican win by five or six points\nYou go how does that happen that one happened in other parts of the country right\nI mean the the there are too many people it's just both the ticket if you're a piece for Hillary Clinton how close you vote for any Republican\nCongressionally again what I was just mentioning\nNot as a conventional as the not so ... a conventional wisdom or or why use thought ... would have you think there's a lot more to the store and we start talking about Hispanics and immigrants do want a better life\nAnd death for twenty seven you have Hillary Clinton having won that district by twenty points when he points and you had the retiring Ileana Ross late in ... in that district by ten\n... the difference here and that's why it's important to break the odds with these stereotypes\nTo really understand some of the dynamics many folks do not support the left and what they've been doing from the immigration stance or in in many folks that are here on DACA rather disproportionate number in in South Florida I've talked to a lot of them over the years\nThey might surprise you politically so anyway you just a little food for thought as we're three weeks away from election day let's go to Ryan who wants to take me the task Brian in San Francisco go\nHey uh hey you you mentioned that you know ...\nPeople who smoke pot or all the um whatever or not or are not educated or not\nWanting to be kind of\nCame across that I made a stereotype about it yes but you're you're here to tell me that's not the case you and your ball are are are on the right there\nI I work my ass off I actually got a good um you know I got\nMy crumbs back from there [laughter]\n[laughter] are they are the land and then the boys are yeah\n... exactly right and I'm going to vote read\nUp and down ticket\nAmen brother I'm actually going to look\nInto all my city council people now and me and asked them because I only got Twenty one days left so I got to get going\nGod Bless you brother and a duly noted duly noted I did make it kind of a a nasty stereotypes developed that do smoke and folks and and maybe ah how they would vote so I have\nThis is a really interesting show we're having here because managers have a twenty two year old biology student last hour from Washington DC which by the way Ninety One percent\nOf Washington DC votes for Democrats and and he is a thoughtful pragmatic conservative and now we've got someone who is a you know and the ball from San Francisco and he's a conservative I mean you know moving mountains\nAnd is your your Donald Trump Republican Party it's a kind of interesting chemical alright I'm by mud in for the great
