about the lack of climate credibility at the United nations now\nShared with you really well done um piece from the specter that put in context how wall United Nations says bad on the climate prediction every single year for years\nYet for some reason they retain credibility for some reason we subsidize this nonsense for some reason and we know what the reasons are all political it's embraced by those on the list now\nI think any honest a decent person you are wrong if you are way the heck wrong for your entire professional career somewhere along the way you'd have a sense of you know maybe I should do something else\nBut if you are part of the left his climate science crowd\nYou're gonna keep on keep it on and they're gonna keep on peddling your your nonsense and that's exactly what we've seen it's fascinating as you take a look at the entire way this thing came full circle you go back to the Nineteen seventies what was that it was the big global cooling and the ice age right\nSo I uh actually pulled earlier this week and the un report came out in the June twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy four times article that was based on this climate science called another ice age\nAnd then on April twenty eight Nineteen Seventy five Newsweek they published a story that cooling world because that's what was going on\nMan made global cooling\nAnd then somewhere along the way it's like oh crap\nThat's not working out so then it became what in the eighties and nineties you'll remember what it was remember how every aerosol can every little buffer that hairspray for that big eighties there that was another chunk out of his own lawyer oh yeah the elimination of the ozone layer\nAnd then somewhere on the way are like oh you know what\nIs actually has something to do with the ozone layer and guess what if we actually dedicated the entire effort in this world towards eliminating it would probably couldn't because we're probably not going to be highly effective at taking out this done oh and by the way some of those are holes [laughter] funny thing is sunspots you know ha\nSo that went away and then what did it become well as global warming and we got global warming for many years Frank and then ...\nNot buying it so we go from global cooling we go from the ozone layer\nTo global warming to something that actually Israel\nDoes something that's actually real to climate change\nAnd that is how they completed the corrupt circle because climate change Israel always has been always will be funny things happen we've had ice ages we've had periods of extreme heat\nWe've had a minimum of three mass extinction events oh remarkably enough before we were even on this planet\nIt must have been on like the the dinosaur watch one you know you know like a cow farts they actually are more political than than like a you know cars so if you just had if you think about it is it the Peter crowds to really think about this for a moment you know if we don't eat meat\nI I mean what happens you care more about the the cow or do you care about or you know your your climate change there because he got you know we're more cows so it's going to happen\nThis is a real moral dilemma you should consider this\nAnyway apparently or what happened was a bunch of die no flatulence and I dunno flatulence ended up leading to a mass to extinction events ... it'll be

of the most powerful people um international politics and former prime minister of Canada is on the line Steven Harper was a major fan of during those two years I looked to\nI have Canada envy it wasn't for me and it was actually real I I did I remember at the time when when we had our left wing president and they had this very thoughtful\nFormer prime minister of Canada is on the line Steven Harper was major fan of during those years\nI looked to Canada I Canada envy it wasn't for you to you and it was actually real I I did remember at the time when when we had our left wing president and they had this very thoughtful intelligent conservative prime minister so\nA prime minister Harper by the way I just want to know what I call you prime minister Harper is that an American thing only and Canada though when you interviewed or you called Mr Harper or prime minister\nUm well the ... there's a long answer that question Dennis and I'll keep it short which is in Canada officially we do not keep the titles are we do not keep the title prime minister but it is actually quite common for people to call me that nevertheless\nRight on so I tried to sue ... I think it's more of an American idiosyncrasies I think it's nice but I was just curious well\nOne of the reasons we love the Americans\nYou know [laughter] exactly [laughter] if you're ever feeling down just school one of the barricade radio station that exactly [laughter]\nThe prime minister has written a book out this week right here right now he's one of the more storms full of people as I said in international politics so were you surprised that Donald Trump won why don't you feel on election day twenty sixteen us election day\nSo I tell people I was surprised I was less surprise than most I had included mostly through what I had been told anecdotally by a large number of Canadians who have been going back and forth to us than my own experiences going back and forth that\nA lot of Canadians had been down there and the final weeks had told me they thought Donald Trump was going to win so I gave him a a low but nevertheless a ... chance of winning\nUh so I was I I must admit I Would still a surprise but I was not shocked a as a shock to some observers not only were but still clearly are\nSo back to Canada is there a chance to conservatives can come back to power\nOh I think absolutely we've got a chance um you know we've been uh at the polls go back and forth we'd been in a you know within the margin of error and a lot of them um the the uh our fundraising is far exceeds the government\nI think the issues are on our side of the bay area we paid in Canada Dennis I don't mind telling you is that um you know we have very little in the way of conventional conservative media television every network is MSNBC in Canada\nUm is really amazing when you look at places like Ontario and Quebec and you were to see the election coverage especially in the province Ontario\nYou would not imagine that concern a party is going to get any votes at all\nAnd yet they won the election and won it handily so I'm a I'm optimistic but a book I leave a I leave the day to day have Canadian politics the my successor whose name is Andrew share and go I think will make a great and thoughtful and intelligent informed prime minister which really badly need\nI Want to underscore from our listeners what you just said because whenever I speak to consider a conservatives in Europe this comes up and sometimes they say\nIf only we have the talk radio in Europe ... why isn't there in Canada I think I Know the answer but I'd rather have you explain why isn't there something like talk radio in Canada\nWill talk radio does exist in\n... well I mean conservative talk radio forgive me okay\nYeah no no it's ... ... talk radio does exist a dentist and conservative talk radio does exist it's just much smaller and unfortunately a lot of our best conservative talk radio hosts not all of them but a lot of our best ones\nAre have been kind of at the stage where they're retiring in recent years but look it's an area where there really is a deficiency generally and what's interesting Dennis about that is generally a conservative talk radio hosts will do well\nIn terms of audience likewise conservative media to the extent that exists generally find that audience because there's a lot of\nMeeting conservatives who are craving outlets but the fact is that the dying media continues to cater to all cater to a left wing audience\nThere was a powerful ... you said earlier I did not pass over the line at all all of our behavior MSNBC\nI Hope my little sister school up that one that I look a I'm well aware of that so now there is however and I frequently read at the national post\nYeah yeah the national post um was founded as a Twenty years ago\nAs a more distinctly conservative newspaper and it has maintained a fairly conservative editorial line unfortunately a lot of the day to day reporting and columnists are simply not that bad and in terms of federal\nFederal politics cup which I I Would not today consider the national posed the conservative paper\nIn terms of its day to day coverage of federal politics but its editorial reliant line remains relatively concern the more conservative papers are actually what's called the sun chain their tabloids but they are quite um quite consistently conservative\nSo where what an American goal for thoughtful Canadian conservative news coverage nowhere\nTo hide it tough yeah you have you know a while you have you have\nTo you have to look um you have to really find individual journalists um\nUm and and I would also say that you know that there's a huge market and particularly the phenomenon you have in the United states will pod cast\nUm you know I think there's a big market candidate for that kinda thing to take off what as I said there is a you know thirty percent of Canadians will always vote right of center at least thirty percent bottom it's kind of the the the low number\nAnd so that that audience is in my judgment if I were an entrepreneur and the media business I'd be trying to figure out how to get to that audience which for the most part has very little in the way of of outlet servicing them\nWhat about young people or let me put it let me actually before we get to the young people you said something that's very important to me that is the polarization in the United states left and right doesn't exist in Canada is that the caller lean to the same thing\nRight so it was but but on the issues they differ is just as clearly as the left white differ in the United states so is it because the Canadian temperament is just more subdued wow why isn't there is that polarization\nI I think it's the fact that you know I I ... I hate the generalization about our country but it's a fact that Canadians have the more civil public discourse than always have um it it's also the case that\nA larger percentage of Canadians are not idiot logically committed the you know the number of people who would be hard core conservative or hurt or left liberal would be much smaller and the percentage of the population that would float between parties\nAlways have um it it's also the case that\nA larger percentage of Canadians are not idiot logically committed the you know the number of people who would be hard core conservative or heart or left liberal\nWould be much smaller and the percentage of the population that would float between parties significantly bigger and Canada plot that I think the other factor that often for God when people can they can uh when people compare Canadian American politics as we have more than two party\nAnd that really changes the dynamic significantly I always say well you know the strictly to party you know it ... had candidate B. he can bring candidate the down in a\n\nI don't think I don't I don't of course I don't he wouldn't agree with me that that's the reason for it but I have is the

one that John Solomon I Want you to weigh in on this and I'm sure I missed some details here but I I'm given the best summary I can it sounds complicated but it's not\nIt's really not complicated and Greg does such a good job of cutting through all the bluster and BS in Washington and get right down to the point the FBI and the Justice Department were misuse for a political opposition research project to a stop Donald Trump from becoming president and when that failed\nBase was saying I'm investigation that was designed to hand for his early presidency and that's what the overwhelming evidence now chosen and there's another important part\nBaker developed in the middle of my story but I Want to fight the south because many times I've heard you and I've heard Greg say the media has been complicit in this well sky a\nFake or gave us an unbelievable anecdote of complicity in November right after the election right after Trump with the reporter David Corn of Mother Jones\nGives a new version of a ... copy it's different from the one the FBI has from steel\nAnd gives it to Baker and then Baker turns it on to the uh counterintelligence people why is that important first off it's not a job a reporter getting evidence the FBI where we're supposed to report facts not become snitches but more importantly the timing of it is so important\nThe FBI just fired Christopher Steele for leaking uh uh the existence of the investigation and all that dirty hat on Trump just before the election he gets fired they televise the court they're no longer using them and here it becomes a backdoor a journalist becomes a backdoor to continue to receive information for Christopher Steele\nIs just not how the price of process is supposed to work and I think it's another key revelation I mean I I think ... give us several key revelations or one of the challenges the credibility of the the one that shows the media\nUh uh being complicit in in the effort to unseat Trump and three that's a direct involvement of the Democratic National Committee lawyer in turning on evidence pressuring the FBI\nThink of what happened in that time from\nChristopher ... fields a life of twenty sixteen walks into the FBI and you're you get turned down they don't act on 'em right away they they ... they're not excited about it a few days later he goes to Bruce or the number four official in the Justice Department\nBruce or put pressure on the FBI department by reaching out and doing it a month later you've got a the DNC lawyer coming into the FBI again putting pressure\nOn to the system there was an enormous amount of political pressure to get the FBI to find something on Trump before election day and I think when we look back at this we should all be alarmed take Donald Trump out of this\nAny candidate any American who had been treated this way it really raises civil liberty concerns that really raises abuse of power concerns and we should all be concerned by the body of evidence that our firms were raped or it is written in his book\nIt is so scary that when you put it all together and now the pieces seemed to be ... literally at ... ... ... but those are put puzzles together usually start on the outside and you get all the square parts on the outside and then you start filling in the pieces of the puzzle then the next thing you have a tree then you have the grass and you have the sun\nAnd slowly but surely it seems like we now understand a lot more and that is\nThat we had a group of people that\nLiterally set up an entire phony Russia investigation the very people that exonerated Hillary long before they investigated her\nThe very people that literally signed off on warrants that are based on information she had provided by committing fraud to buys accords and the very same people that after they lost had an insurance policy and now we know what the insurance policy is by any means necessary\nWe're going to get Donald Trump in the way we've got to do it is a we're going to eat secretly record them\nAnd we're going to surreptitiously get him to say something that we think we could use against them on top of a pony investigation that they've\nThey initiated through a media release strategy\nAgain of the ... you know one of the things that really ticked me off if there was a plot\nTo frame Donald Trump again the title of my book is I went through meticulously the FBI guidelines and the department of justice regulations on winning how you can launch a counterintelligence investigation of an American citizen\nAnd what I discovered is that the FBI violated every single solitary provision of their own guidelines they had no credible evidence of crimes no plausible intelligence to justify a counter intelligence probe importantly\nThey had no probable cause\nAnd yet on July thirty first two thousand and sixteen they officially a launch this investigation Peters struck signed the papers he had just finished meeting

times and it's I'm immediately rang bells with me it's a the headline is America needs a war on waste and do we ever\nAnd Adam ... has put together together with Dr Tom Coburn who's\nBeen a friend of the show in the past when he was a senator from Oklahoma\nOr a list of some of the most outrageous federal government wastes and and it's tough to know where to begin a Adam do you have a personal favorite of all these wasted government programs wasteful government programs would you of spotlight as\nWell Michael thank you very much for our interests that are in our work and open the books dot com I think my favorite is that they're literally is a federal grant for everybody in this country in fact every single year the federal government doled out six hundred billion dollars worth of grants\nAnd if you're a prostitute and California one point four million dollars funded sex education for California prostitutes who could probably teach the class\nOf you know which which way which department of government or handles the a sex ed for California prostitutes\nThat's health and Human Services [laughter] they said they have a difference for demolition of Human Services [laughter] right\nUm so what what is the point how do they justify how much money for sex ed for the prostitutes\n[noise] well it's probably a pilot study 'cause it was only one point four million dollar only now overall\nEvery year ha just Dole's out about four hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of grants to put that in perspective US military every year at the department of defense or total budget is six hundred billion dollars\nWow wow a at ... ... it in terms of what you were talking about with open the books dot com\nYou have a a basic approach which is the transparency is the only way to solve this is letting people know what's going on and President Trump doesn't have to get this through Congress he can do it on his own right\nWell that's that's the plan of the strategy that we outline first that the wall Street Journal than at USA Today and it's a three pronged attack and as the commander in chief at this moment that our nation's history when we feel that spending is a crisis\nThe president can take this three pronged approach and he should lead by example he should posts all White House expenditures and then step to cut the federal agency waste and step three and this is my favorite part Michel he should report to the American people show\nUs how he's defending the American taxpayer by cutting waste fraud and taxpayer abuse and we believe that he should do Twitter to do the reporting\nI think it's a great idea and by the way you also suggest here that there should be an across the board cut in every federal department beginning with the White House and this is something I wrote a book about the White House staff years ago\nAnd man is there a lot of waste and ridiculous in us in terms of the Fifteen hundred people who work in the White House staff\nOr President Roosevelt one world war two\nWith a hundred and six White House aides total and what is it that we need Fifteen times that number for today\nI don't I don't give that at all what what about can you give us some background on the um the two hundred thousand six hundred one dollars that our government spends on a new condom design with a additional lubrication why why does the federal government spend on that\nYou know the condom industry it's a very competitive industry\nBut I'm a two hundred thousand dollars flowed into a Boston, Massachusetts is a private company for a new condom design this is just one of the grants now they're obviously a small company we did identify Michael\nThat the fortune one hundred these are our most successful companies in the entire world

Paul Krugman\nAlso that same year two thousand six\nA democratic senator said the following when I see Mexican flags waved at pro immigration demonstrations I sometimes feel a flush of patriotic resentment when I'm forced to use a translator to communicate with the guy picks me my car I feel a certain frustration quote unquote you\nKnow said that senator Brooke Obama anybody says today is considered to be racist two thousand and eight the Democratic party platform said this\nWhile referring to undocumented immigrants if our neighbors the platform also said this and I'm quoting\nWe cannot continue to allow people to enter the United states undetected undocumented and unchecked those who enter our country's borders illegally and those who employ them disrespect the rule of law and of course\nThat was the Democratic party platform two thousand eight two thousand sixteen that language\nWas gone\nNo reference whatsoever to people in the country illegally reference to those who employ them a reference to the disrespecting the rule of law which was in the Democratic platform just eight years earlier\nIn his two thousand a platform\nWhat was the Democratic party platform two thousand eight two thousand sixteen that language what's called no reference whatsoever to people in the country illegally reference to those who employ them a reference to the disrespecting the rule of law which was in the Democratic platform just eight years earlier\nAnd it's two thousand eight platform you refer to people entering the country as\nIllegal\nImmigration section and twenty sixteen do not use the word illegal or any variation of it at all\nBut it's the\nRepublicans who are racist because white men feel like a changing country and therefore that's why they voted for Trump\nWhen the two thousand eight Democratic Party platform also talked about the problem with illegal immigration as did Senator Obama two thousand six\nCan you can you help me out how all of a sudden same words in the mouth of a Republican racist those words and about the bronco by about two thousand six not a problem hearing ... not a problem you know Clinton not a problem with today you're racist check out this punted\nThe thing about making a deal with the devil is that the devil backs up his bargain alright the devil does not slump has delivered for these people on the things that they care about most he has delivered racism for these people he\n\nHe's delivered races\n\nSeven hundred counties in this country voted for Barack Obama two thousand and eight and two thousand twelve of the seven hundred counties that voted for Obama to Seventy two thousand twelve two hundred switched to voting for Republican in two thousand sixty when did their racism kicking\nDelivered massage any for these people and now he's delivered the Supreme Court for these people which is something that they've been trying to get for a generation\nSo then the question now becomes not so much like oh we'll stick for the Republicans I think it will all Republicans this is what they want the question is what are the Democrats going to do democratic turnout does it needs to be high for Mitt terms it needs to be high for a presidential election\nAll right and that for about the the we're going to see if that\nIf this way that they now have control\nOver all three branches of government we're going to see if that's Wayne last for three days or two years in your life because of how that is what these people have themselves up for and it's simply a question of whether or not the Democrats are going to win the battle and meet them apple\nThat his name is the lead missed all the M y S T L he's managing editor of something called above the law ran an editor at large of something called breaking\nTrump is delivered on his promises of racism and massage you name it might be creating a thousand year right\n\nWhat do you say something like that minimizing\nNazi Germany I suggested Donald Trump is trying to deliver a thousand year right cares about that right delivered on his promises of racism how do you explain the pole in double ACP showing the black support for Donald Trump Twenty one percent\nFour times the percentage that he got a twenty sixteen how to explain that Howard Dean\nYeah I don't think it will be the core issue I'd give it a lot of thinking that this uh because we're in such a bad way in this country you know the real issue is that you have a bunch of Eighteen year olds running the Judiciary Committee old ... very old white men\nAnd what does Howard Dean calls him so is it remarkable how many other Democrats who decry old white men or in fact old white man\nAnd that is that what the electorate looks like I think you're going to see it finally a surge of young people going out and voting and I think it's going to make a big difference is this is their country that these eighty year old white Republicans are ruining and I you know they're not they're not going to like this now they're going to the more they they're more respectful of each other\nOr I think they're smarter about public policy so I think what you're going to see a as a result of this and this is Kevin ... is not going to cause this but it's going to exacerbate I think I think there's a a big turnout of young people if you don't\nThe country fail so this is our country and their vote is at stake\nNow called racist\nAll that and more trouble late nights have been one is a GE and what happened to Democrats on immigration why are the very same words used by
