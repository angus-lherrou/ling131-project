one at them station\nJust bizarre were really motivated anecdotally looked\nWhile I'm Glad to hear about the motivation on here's what I Would say in response to your your production is that the blue wave is is just a made up media creation\nUm the reality of the situation is that historically the party that is not in power in the White House does gain a significant number of seats often times as many as twenty twenty five thirty seats in the next midterm election it has happened that way historically throughout you know a recent ... you know American uh uh uh elections mid term elections\nSo the idea that the Democrats are going to pick up a bunch of seats is not a math based on history is in fact they are\nThe question is will it be enough to actually take the house back\nTo take over control that is not absolutely not guaranteed\nUm and and I'm not suggesting that it's guaranteed that the Republicans are going to hold on to it but I look at all of these campaigns you nobody does it's better than you and I say this not to uh you know just a you know stuck up to the second the show but but nobody is on top of these national races and where the battleground races are\nAnd which ones are the toss ups better than he does and it is you know you see that generic\nDemocrat lead over Republicans and the generic ballot of would you prefer a Democrat to leader ... ah and it's around plus seven to plus nine Democrats right now which would indicate holy cow the GOP is in trouble or give the gavel back to the Nancy and let her a letter get ready because they're going to win\nBut that's when you count all of the very decidedly blue areas and again I'm I'm I'm learning from the professor Hugh on this the decidedly blue areas you know in in New York and California and other places those\nWere all added in but when you narrow it down to the sixty or Seventy closest races the ones that are toss ups it is literally a toss up it is literally a toss up between\nThe red in this little candidate and it is absolutely imperative that the Democrats want to win that they when the vast majority of those to overtake the Republicans in the house and I'm confident he can hold

Stephanie rule to the program now Stephanie of course the MSNBC Live anchor coming up at the top of the hour Seventy good morning\nIt's MORNING to you\nThank you for joining us okay so the story of the day seems to have more from the caravan at least for the time being anyway to what it means to be a nationalist the president of course declare to Houston rally\nThat he is not a global is the is a nationalist and he was instantly seized upon as being a white Knight well ask any way by Jim Acosta don't you mean white nationalist is it possible to just be a nationalist meaning I care about Americans before I care about the concerns of the globe\nHere's the thing is is just a necessary or a great way to articulate that you're a patriot a patriot someone who defends our nation or the value of our nation above all others in a perfect world to say well that could mean a nationalist to let a perfect world you could\nBut we both know and we've heard from the likes of extraordinary leaders like John McCain that's not a word we need to use it as a dog whistle at a time where we are seeing racism and seen a phobia on the rise let's simply be better and not use that word\nWhy why why why you're if we're going to see if it is anonymous with patriot which I agree patriotism nationalism\nI said in a perfect but we're not living in a perfect\nWorld why don't we strive for world instead of playing to the fears and the and again the racist the allegations of of people for political ... partisanship why don't we make our property world\nBecause it's not like we're saying it's not like we're hearing from someone that has a high standing gets word who's dries up for a perfect world it's just a president who took him time after time and time again as we did a speaker saying that he you know David give\nThe president has already said in the last week up there are good people from the middle east on that caravan you and I both know eaten dog whistling straight out of the gate since he came down the elevator at Trump Tower wait\nWait wait a minute wait a minute this this is this the president said after he pulled out of the Paris climate accord I was elected by the people of Pittsburgh not the people of terrorists is that a dog whistle or an acknowledgement that my first duty and obligation is to the people of our country that's not a dog whistle that is that I Know of loyalty to the to the people who elected them\nThat's not a dog whistle so I'm not saying\nAs they're not saying everything is on a nationalist the health care about our people before the people of Paris are the people around the globe\nI'm not saying that what he said specifically about the Paris climate accord was a dog whistle but many many other things including many sides speaking about Charlottesville work dog whistle\nBut the president's Stephanie the president very clearly in Houston very clearly defined what he means by comparing nationalism to globalism\nNot comparing whites to blacks not comparing white America to to minority America he said global is think about the globe burst in our country second\nA national is think about our country first and the globe second I'm a nationalist he made it very clear that this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nAnd we're going to agree to disagree\nGiven the president's history on racial issues giving his professional history given his father's professional history I prefer if he was extra careful in his word choices especially as we go into an election where he is capitalizing on the ... so we're going to agree to get one more eastern\nWell yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know what is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you you can't put words in people's miles and I feel like that I'm not caused it sounds so now what you're doing stuff and\nI'm not putting anywhere in his mouth what I Will be able to do is look back on many many things president has said over the years and it's why it make someone like me feel uncomfortable\nOkay what what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes you feel so uncomfortable has been you know your your expertise is is largely in economics you're you're you know Bloomberg TV a editors while you're a former anyway\nYou you know you so given all of your economic history the president is largely talking about global or ah nationalism in globalism in were you know members of trade you know he has often said look we're gonna stop other countries and taking advantage of the United states if I have to use tariffs\nIf I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better take a lot of the market is that not not not economic nationalism but is that not economic nationalism\nIs my question not if you look at the way the president is conducting themselves to give you the truth that cat an impact he would engage and things like the PC to point out and partner with our allies that have been happy\nTo say Seventy rural thank you

vehicle\nYeah I completely agree sheriff Sharon Thomas Hodgson is our guest from Brazil county Massachusetts by the way you're you know the numbers recording I think our sadly I dated a you know two days ago was up to seven thousand Mexican news agencies were monitoring the that massive a caravan through their country are estimating the crowd now at fourteen thousand so\n... and they're still weeks away from ... thousand miles me I'm not going to get to our border it could be twenty you could be twenty five by then so here's what I Want to know from a law enforcement perspective share\nWhat do you and other law enforcement officers going to do when these people get here because they are coming in Congress where you're writing Congress will not do anything they're busy campaigning back in their districts they're not even at work or in the capital now\nSo they're not going to change anything which means when thousands and thousands of people come to our border\nAnd start claiming asylum as you well know we cannot detain them we don't have the facilities to detain them at the border plus it's been decided that that's inhumane\nAh and we can't turn them away so they are going to be released with a promise that they'll come back\nAh ah ... we know that eighty to Ninety percent of them don't so this this crowd I I'm sadly just accepting the fact of now fourteen thousand which could be more\nIs coming and they're going to come to Massachusetts are going to come to where I sit in Ohio there going to come all over this country and spread themselves out never to be seen again until of course uh sometimes it's too late then we see them for the wrong reasons\nWell yeah and and the thing that that is important to point out too is that and and I'll just at that point just a second but it's also important to know that you've ... you've a county right now Colorado live releasing a hundred two hundred and fifty family units per day back into the community you're taking the bus stops\nThe greyhound bus terminals ended up putting them on buses and not because ice wants to win but by law they can only hold it for twenty days once that happens they have to give them their court paper when they have to return\nThe court dates for example in Massachusetts for some of the arrested today on immigration charge\nAnd it's told the come back to court the court they start coming up to twenty twenty four where do you think they're going to be twenty twenty four and how we're going to find them that's one that you know I'm Talking one person to think about the thousands that are coming in never mind the fourteen thousand right now that are supposed to be coming across\nEach trying to come into our country so yeah we have to do some this is why this is this is an urgent situation and this is why can't believe Congress\nSits on their hands and it's more interested in their politics than they are taking care of the the public safety of the people in our communities\nAnd our national security with this is this is as bad as it gets in for Congress to to not see this is a fundamental responsibility they have is to protect the citizens of our nation that's what governments fundamental responsibility so I've been talking to the sheriff's Rob across the country and we're talking I've been on the phone with western shirts\nAnd talking about what are we what can we do I mean we're we've as you know we started that crowd funding aids funding for the wall dot com I think we're over a hundred and thirty thousand right now we're getting ready we're working on a presentation to\nAh to um [noise] I ... I mean to a VHS or ... the first installment and then and then we hope that at that point when that happens we'll see\nThe activity pick up across the country I actually had Bob a guy like staff game in my before I went to Washington last week and said look you've got to get to read this letter it was from a gentleman in\nOntario, Oregon I opened it up\nIt was a five dollar bill five one dollar bills with a note attached to it said please build a wall between the United states and Mexico\nAnd I see Iraq's the envelope in the five bills and the five dollar bill and I sent it to all these sheriff's around the country that went with us to Washington from the thirty five states said listen\nThis gentleman represents the best of America and he's maybe of modest means but he believes in some way that he can help you know joined with the sheriff's across this nation and fight to get this wall built which we've been asking for for Twenty years\nAnd um protect our neighborhoods because he sees as most Americans do our communities are getting worse and worse when it comes to the\nVictimization by criminal illegal aliens\nAnd um and I said you know this not only does he represent the best of America that this represents why we a sheriff's now have to take over for what Congress has refused to do are elected by the exact same people that Congress are it's\nMost Americans do our communities are getting worse and worse when it comes to the victimization by criminal illegal aliens\nAnd um and I should you know this not only does he represent the best of America that this represents why we as sheriff's now have to take over for what Congress has refused to do or elected by the exact same people that Congress are\nBut it's it's our time in history now to step up stand with our people and let's get this border security let's you know fulfill our obligation and are almost of the people in spite of what Congress has to work against\nWhile it is extraordinarily important I'm so glad to see people like you taking a leadership position because again we you know we we're gonna have to accept this I think the president's no intentions of the best absolutely I think he you know his promise to put military at the border is is a great thing although it's nothing but show because they're not going to fire on people they're not going to physically\nYou you know a stop people with tanks and ... they're going to just be there for show as a backdrop a but at the end of the day if they come up and use the right coded language the code words that they've been coached to say when they get there as far as claiming asylum they're going to get a they're going to be given a you know a summons to come back and have that case are but it's going to take many months and as we know they're going to be here they're going to be\nWell I don't know if you ... you saw this but it's important again for people to really understand what's going on behind this we believe I'm obviously there are people in this country or courage and get a right before the midterms absolute part but if you look at the two thousand five you're showing it to the two thousand five\nTape on Obama he said we cannot allow people just to come into this country uh and and violate our laws\nAnd the president writes way out the president retweeted that yesterday and said I agree

recall when Steve school eastern others the shooting took place on the ball field\nAnd I actually I remember saying and I asked my staff to go back and find out what did I say when we found out that the gunman or the person responsible for the shooting the nearly killed Steve ... was a Bernie Sanders supporters is what I said\nNow I I'm not going to do with the left does here\nBernie Sanders is not responsible for what one of his stupid supporters have to say but this most Bernie Sanders supporters are not violent and not out there trying to kill Republicans and Bernie Sanders was sick and by the entire\nYou know anti GOP massacre here All right and I believe him so it's Ryan McCarthy and ...\nRight and this individual this assailant that we're now getting the information on that you just shared by his own and Bernie Sanders took to the floor of the Senate to condemn it because he was a Sanders supporters suppose one thing\nI Want but you know what that may do it I I don't blame Bernie Sanders of course not they would say would blame us yes of course I feel like I Want to say you know Rush Limbaugh and the and Oklahoma City bombing and you know they've got their ... and ...\nWell it's just because these guys are convinced the left that by ratcheting up their rhetoric that they can get away with it and they get a free pass nobody doesn't matter if they do it\nSo here's what you have today right here in Washington DC but attempted assassination I Hope it's not and I'm praying that you know he's in as we know Shawn he isn't very serious very very critical reported earlier that he was upgraded a critical condition upgraded from critical to good but he's been critical it's worth\nTheir while he was in stable yeah stable condition\nYou get the point of what I did back ... you can't blame Bernie for that\n\nNor can you blame any conservative but we don't know what the motivation is just it's all conjecture and now it's being used as a political weapon to bludgeon\nTalk radio Fox and Trump\nIt's just outrageous 'cause that's\nNot who we are ... what did I say yesterday about George Soros I won't play it again now but I said\nHey not this has to stop George Soros spends millions of dollars paying groups to get me off the air\nWe that's not how we settled political differences you know when the sun is out there apparently blaming Donald Trump Donald Trump is not responsible for packages that might have bombs in the anthrax or\nRice and then it it's ridiculous\nYou don't see why you know let me play Hillary Clinton today and Hillary Clinton just what a week ago plus just compare\nIt to her not to several with political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about her only from the Republican whom to recognize and respect strength and it's an time a\nDeep divisions and we have to have to do everything we everything we can bring our country to get together\nBut we weren't supposed to be several ... a week later unless it an Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York you know we must be simple where Americans All right that's not what he was saying in a while back when he talked about conservatives that live in New York people like me listen\nTo hip hop and just not me at the end of it stems cell or the streaming service right\nWhere it is that there are closer to the extreme conservative stations so this was not New Yorkers\nAnd at the end of the day we may have political differences but this is one country we're all Americans e pluribus unum out of many one and keeping the debate and the dialogue civil law is very very important and for elected leaders\nWho in many ways set the tone is especially important\nOh they're not New Yorkers\nThere's no place in the state of the New York if you're pro life pro Second Amendment I happen to be libertarian on issues involving sexuality so it's not my issue\nYou know I just very different tone isn't it will tell you a little story so I had this ... and and\nLived through this and when the you know we're still very great friends with police who worked for me for a long time and she went on to bigger and better things and we're really proud of her and happy for her and she was a friend of our program we just saw her Washington when we were last there right yep we just saw um it was like nine hours when we had what we thought\nYeah a little story so I have this and and window lived through this and when the you know we're still very great friends with the lease\nWho worked for me for a long time and she went on to bigger and better things and we're really proud of her and happy for her and she was a friend of our program we just saw her Washington when we were last there right yep we just saw um it was like nine hours when we had what we thought was potentially anthrax into my office the Fox right\nUh yeah it was it was actually a little bit more between how long they held her over\nAnd the sad thing is and she was an isolation she was alone we couldn't talk to her even it was just horrible for her\nEditors cordoned off we went to the hospital they wouldn't let us than we couldn't see her because they didn't know if it was anthrax right than what was that if it was ...\nI mean as with all my heart I Can't stand CNN is reporting I think it's fake news but I I feel sorry for the people over CNN Today I've lived through this\nAnd I and Linda on a scale of one to ten the anthrax instead of being a one how many tens of we had in the course of my career that you know about\nI mean you know we got ten death threats today via letter yeah\nBut I mean and it's just a horrible thing there was one particular person at another network I won't say who\nWho's going through a very bad time and going through a lot of threats I picked up the phone don't agree with this person at all and I explained everything that I've been through and tried to give my best advice\nI mean this person was upset had to leave their house they had young kids this person you know how to family and you know it's it's hard\nIt's unfortunately part of the environment we live in and that's why I don't understand why there's been so much silence about chasing people\nAt a restaurant and attacking people in restaurants you know somebody bangs on your table in a restaurant that's an assault that guy should have been arrested\nOr shows up at your house or spent on you or threaten you or follow you know\nI have had all the above\nAnd it is very very very difficult and how many times if I said keep Obama said when he was president we got to keep our our politicians say whoever did this is not a conservative in the sense that maybe they think they are but they're not anybody I Want anything to do with her any conservative once anything to do it\nBut this rush to judgment we don't know one thing yet who's responsible\nBy immediate that trying to exploit it for political gain when it is a serious significant threat as I said well the president says fake news oh they are fake news no truth is ... words are very different than actions just like\nBernie Sanders says incendiary things to that ... that was

leave her alone if secretary Nielsen has them eating a private dinner and groups of people are running them out of the restaurant I don't want that either\nI don't want a secretary McConnell and his wife some guy banging part or based on the table throwing his food out either or Ted Cruz being run out with his wife at a restaurant I don't think democratic candidates ought to be talking about kicking and instability\nUm I don't think we should be hearing about creating crowds and getting in their face and telling people they don't want anybody anywhere anymore\nAnd his wife some guy banging part order this on this table throwing his food out either or Ted Cruz being run out with his wife out of a restaurant I don't think democratic candidates ought to be talking about kicking and instability\nUm I don't think we should be hearing about creating crowds and getting in their face and telling people they don't want anybody anywhere anymore either I'm sure you agree with me right\nLet me\nAsk you do you agree with that\nWas simple question\nHe goes no answer because he hung up to harder question Craig you have thirty seconds Greg\nGo ahead\nBy the rhetoric of people like Maxine you know Spartacus Booker Hillary you can't be civil with them Eric Holder kicked them and even Brock Obama back as\nThey are is that Mr Burgess out the terror Sean Hannity up getting if they're in their face this this is their rhetoric now interesting when the shooting happened to the ball field in ... Steve skull least nearly lost his life\nUm and it was a Bernie Sanders supporters it turned out to be I went out of my way to say I don't blame Bernie Sanders because one not that supports him you know decided to become violence\nIs outrageous what they do they do this every time they've been dares silence has been deafening\nIn recent months and days\nUh anyways Sean Spicer ... is with us senior advisors spokesmen for American first action\nAnd also former White House press secretary and the author of the book the briefing politics the press the president Kris Kobach is back with us\nAnd uh he has penned a piece on them migrant caravan he is the elected secretary of state of Kansas an expert in immigration and ah by the way he's been very successful and what he's doing and uh and uh I\nFully support your your victory there in Kansas was a big win that you're pulled out in the primary and I hope the people of Kansas are smart enough to put you in that position I Know you've been a great governor\nUm look I I don't know if we're going to get to this point this caravans growing Mexico seems incapacitated unwilling to do the job of securing their own borders which they usually doing pretty good job of they either put people in jail or throw them out immediately\nUm but if they in four weeks or whatever and make it to our southern border\nUm and if anybody is to cross that border or if they rush as across that border as in as one we don't have any problem with a choice we will have to arrest them\nThat will be a crisis precipitated by people not respecting our laws I don't want anybody to get hurt if we had a wall up right now Kris Kobach we wouldn't have a problem\nWe wouldn't have a problem and also if we had more states denying welfare benefits to illegal aliens so we give a hundred and thirty four billion dollars a year most of those are state public benefits to illegal aliens you know meanwhile you've got governors\nOr like a Governor Brown out in California giving more so if if the federal and state response or the feds have to build the wall and they have to stop panning out the goodies\nWhich gives the illegal aliens assurance that if they can get in that it can come in and start getting welfare benefits so while they're looking for a job\nSean Spicer a U.S quite a lot of incendiary rhetoric thrown in your direction we'll get to that in a minute but let's talk about what the options are here I Would think that is the role of the Mexican government that they should be turning these this caravan back they seem unwilling aren't capable of doing so\nUh what should America's response be\nWell I think America's response that with the president has talked about what she's making sure that we protect our borders our sovereignty and our citizens and that means ensuring that we know who's coming into our country\nWhy they're coming in a and that they not coming in with either nefarious reasons or to either harm us or they say you know but there's a writing in the bottom line is the number one job of any\nPresident of any elected elected official is to protect his people in the president's made very clear and the one thing I said that the other day that so much on I Want to be clear your agree with me I Know critical agrees well\nDon't temp Donald Trump don't temp temp because\nHe's warned the Mexican government is Warner Guatemala he's told them that this is unacceptable they need to do their job stop this from happening um and I I just I I think that if anything people have seen over the last year when he gives you a warning he means that there will be action afterwards if you don't reverse\nCourse let me let me be very clear I I'm just going to assume I really believe that probably Ninety nine percent of the people in this\nThat don't have a lot of opportunity and their own communities countries they want a better life for themselves and their families I Believe a lot of the eight we give to many many countries is abused and it doesn't get to the people as it should\nUm with that said we have a legal process of doing so but on the other hand let's say it's only a small fraction of the many that are coming\nOf opportunity and their own communities countries they want a better life for themselves and their families I Believe a lot of the age we give to many many countries is abused and it doesn't get to the people as it should\nUm with that said we have a legal process of doing so but on the other hand let's say it's only a small fraction of the many that are coming\nThat have the various intentions for this country we don't know there's not one person that can vouch for anybody in that care of him\nNobody can vouch for anybody and it would be unfair and a massive risk to the American people\nTo allow people in on vetted no idea what their their point of view a worldview happens to be whether or not they have good or bad intentions for the United states and they say that Kris Kobach assuming Ninety nine percent of of the people coming just want a better life\nWell and that's that's a very good point you know it'd be there's\nAbundant evidence of terrorists using the traffic flow of illegal immigration across our southern border to get into the United states going all the way back to before nine eleven ah people from countries where al ... was active now country where I suspect active have used this this flow this Margaret close to blend in\nThere's no question that that will be the case again you know the other thing Sean that I I wanted to point out is I think the Democrats have lost their grip on reality here there and the third stage of open borders psychosis just follow this for a moment in the nineties\nThe Democrats were pro enforcement Bill Clinton signed the immigration reform act of ... of Nineteen Ninety six and they agreed with Republicans that we need to deport those here illegally then in the two thousands they became pro amnesty and they no longer want it to deport they want to grant amnesty eleven million a year\nNow they're taking the position that we were there cheering for illegal aliens before they even get here they want them to come in and be part of the American society it's it's gotten ridiculous ... people before they're even here to become unlawfully present to the United states\nAnd when you play what I played earlier it's amazing how all these politicians leaders of the Democratic party not not that long ago sounded a lot like Donald Trump\nYeah let me let me switch gears to these packages the president said um he spoke out about these despicable acts of terror\nHe said no expense will be spared whoever's responsible for sending these packages it appears in some cases pipe bombs and powder\nThat they will be tracked down and the and the full force of the government will be coming down upon them which is the right thing to say and do 'em both before that Shawn we've seen a lot leading up to this\nAnd wondering what have we seen we've been witnessing Syria if\nOne quick like apart and they cause I think you're making an excellent point that one last thing it only takes one and that that leads into what we're talking about today you you can have Ninety nine point nine percent B. B. B. doing the right thing but it only takes one to do the wrong thing\nAnd I think that's what we need to remember it to this whole process and we saw that today one person or however many we don't know it now frightening and terrorizing thousands and thousands of people [noise]\nUm and and you know I'm not making any cash but while I'm at the point that I'm making it it doesn't mean you can get Ninety nine point nine percent of the people through or safely but if we don't protect ... get a hundred percent right people can be threatened or hurt and that's the thing that we have to make sure that we're clear on\nI Will tell you what when when the quake quake on this will come back on the other side and talk about the president's comments he they will hunt down those people that have been sending these suspicious packages\nAnd powder and potential pipe bombs are two very politicians want to CNN or this is not new I've lived through this myself\nOut of one of my assistance at the time

about these states we've already have them we're getting a little bit more we still have undercover\nWe don't go after women and children in restaurants\nOr like we've been witnessing when we don't

Administration\nWrote the book Darryl election dereliction of duty a welcome both W brand and tell me your story what made you decide you worry I guess pretty left or\nA Democrat and you started this campaign in this whole thing for you is gone absolutely viral what happened\n[laughter] so um it's great to be our son thank you um so I you know my whole life I consider myself a liberal and my whole adult life I considered myself but I was the Democratic party voter I always voted Democrat\nUm and that was true even in two thousand sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and I was one of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the\nMedia has been telling me for months and months that\nDonald Trump didn't have more than a three percent chance of winning and they also had been telling me for months and months that he was a racist at a bigot and humble pope and a monster and basically the second coming of Hitler at that his followers were no better and you know they I think that the liberal media did\nFor me as they get for millions of others are very effective job scaring people are really making people believed the stories in this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media\nRanting you know screaming sometimes crying you know saying you know I'll never understand how people could vote for for this monster and on one particular day I posted about um you know I I'll never be able to understand how people can vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd and mocked her reporters disability\nAnd it was on that day in January of two thousand Seventeen that somebody\nReached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen\nI'm just asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking that Trump mocked the disabled reporter and for anybody who haven't seen this as a compilation of footage\nPretty and it was on that day in January of two thousand Seventeen but somebody reached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen\nI'm just asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking that Trump mocked the disabled reporter\nAnd for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back ten years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter\nBut what's clear when you watch the compilation\nThat this is a voice in a fit that Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who is caught in a lie or doing something shady or\nGrumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid now ... but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really realized that the media was capable of creating a completely false narrative\nAnd then isolating a moment out of contact to push that merits if it had nothing to do is news or is the truth brand\nAnd let me ask you something now once your eyes open and once you become aware of their bias and it's like you you you ask yourself but I've been experienced it myself but it's even worse than it's ever been how did you not see it before you ever say that the yourself\n... yeah yeah it's absolutely the kind of thing that once you see it you can't see it and what you just said is actually kind of the next part of the story because then I went back to the beginning of the campaign and revisit all of those other moments like Trump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women\nYou know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same thing time and again that's not what happened that is not what happened\nBut they made a decision after he won that primary or it was clear that he was going to win the Republican primary that it wasn't funny anymore that he was running suddenly it was scary and that they had to turn this man into the the scariest candidate that the world it ever seen so\nLet me ask you this when I when I tell my audience\nTo expect and I showed a lot of the ads that are out last night and I've been I've been showing these instances people that are in the public eye that are conservative or support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants and I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I give it your best shot\nYou know I noticed that it either happens to a guy with his wife or or an older person or women\nYou know what when there are a bunch of cowards the when they do that because I'd never treat anybody that way\nBut you know this is a narrative every two and four years in elections in America that Republicans are racist\nOr sexist massage in is that there are homophobic\nDina phobic Islamic phobic that they weren't dirty air and water Obama use those actual words\nThat they want children to die and they'll have some commercial with the Paul Ryan look alike throwing granting over the cliff because they want to kill your grandmother that's what they do that to their play book we're watching it unfold today even Thirteen Days out of the election um do you see now that all of that is not true there's not one thing\nThat's true about that look at the stakes for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce um the lowest unemployment levels ever recorded for these demographics ever\nYeah no absolutely seeing that now and in fact I think a lot of others are starting to see it as well which is resulting in what you just said that even I think that most\nAh these minority groups in particular that I think the Democratic party for so long has taken for granted that this oh these are just automatic vote well that's not the case anymore I mean people really are starting to wake up and they're starting to walk away because they're seeing so\nLet me on how many people have joined your movement\nSo the movement began on Facebook and in that are rich in that first initial Facebook group we now have over two hundred and five thousand poverty on President or something like ... yeah all social media platforms we have about four hundred thousand\nIt to be clear for anyone who doesn't know this is a testimonial campaign so these are just people who are going on social media and clicking follower clicking like\nThey are telling their stories about why they are walking away so I mean they're they're making videos they're writing these stories down I mean people are there is this is for me like a network of support and people are leaving are walking away from the left\nOf uh let me bring in bus Patterson as we've been around the block of time or to a new around the Clintons a lot a Hillary queen we can't be civil with with people we disagree with something like okay you know if you don't want to be\nYou know I ran into what's that ... the senator from that we ran into Linda when we were in Washington\nBlumenthal I ran into him on the streets right when I was going to do my show one night than when you know and this was right in the middle of the Kavanaugh hearings and he was being a lunatic and I ... I was\n... and how are you what's going on man because um I have no what am I going to confront him on the street and didn't scream adamant that I mean I don't get this behavior I don't it's not affect him I said if you'd like to come on my show one day here's my number that's it why are people acting that way\nYeah well you know my story Shaun I I yeah I went up to the White House or as the air force\nBlacks lake in LA and get the nuclear football\nFor ... for two years after I lost that position you I Love the White House office of the bedroom and travel lynching that are worth they were with the world and after last night I also walked away so I mean I'm not quite the transformation that Brandon is but\nI I went in as a military officer proud to serve like less\nResulted in election in ... and then ... and I have a cap on social media so I mean I'm going to be at age ... can be a great ... checking your thousands and thousands of people to be walking away instrument testimonials and I can't wait I mean it's going to be fun and it's also going to be an ethics handed him a signal to the rest of the country get gimmick quite\nParty stands for knocking get substantial gay they get their face\nA license and talked about getting mainstream media status lies thank God for you Sean and what you do um but it's time for people to wake up whether you\nKnow I'll tell you one thing I don't like being lied about um you know I was twenty I I don't I'm not a\nRacist than I Do want to be called one I'm not a sexist or massage units or a homophobic Dina ... I Want clean water not dirty water clean air not dirty air I Love all children they're all children have gone\nAnd I I Believe that you know what we got to take care of the elderly whether they can afford it or not we're country rich enough to be able to do that\nThese lies that they tell really pissed me off because that is not any conservative Brandon that I Know but conservative policies

released so we'll bring them back to talk a bit of a Dan former Secret Service former NYPD nobody better to talk about this than anybody else you've been watching the coverage what do you make of this\nOr mark it seems like a very amateurish operation I mean just look at some of the hallmarks of these devices that were sent I mean number one is the obvious one Mark I'm none of them thank God I'm actually detonated in and and exploded again thank the lord that happened\nUm but certainly not the hallmarks of of of someone with experience in this in this space but\nOther things as Well Mark which seemed to indicate one of only two possible options it was either a really amateurish operation or someone seemingly wanted to get caught on outside of the not detonating also when you look at the photographs we've seen of the devices mark\nYou see just hallmarks of of of of just a rookie type behavior like excessive postage which is all I mean it's all over the front of you see the the pronounce hype\nOn the on the label you know if you're trying to secrete a device into a mail system to God Forbid detonate in front of a male hands or the target\nYou don't use hype that's going to draw attention to the package you see the um one other thing mark they had uh one of the packages was addressed the John Brennan CNN well\nI mean John Brennan doesn't work at CNN that's quite obvious a basic Internet search would have produced that information you worked at NBC which I mean this is ... it's really a there's something not right here it's a very suspicious operation very amateurish right now\nLet me ask you this question is it possible he has such a a devious minded worked at somebody wanted to look so amateur\nWell it's certainly possible I said there's only one or two scenarios here I mean either somebody wanted to get caught um for some reason or it's so amateurish that it it it it speaks to some kind of a motive we haven't yet it's just bizarre\nAnd in the selection of the of the target of you know of course there's people want to you know I just people all over the media right now given out these ... especially if you're going through these other networks who are desperate to prescribe a motive that we have no idea\nWhat I Would encourage all of them take this very very slow or because I when I when I see mark in my experience in the space especially with the secret service and all of this mail processing system is people who are Syrians who have these Savage animal minds want to do this kind of stuff\nThey are very tactically efficient way to do it and none of the hallmarks of tactically efficient of planning where in orange ... this is a highly highly suspicious or operation I mean none of them even detonated again thank God but that is that\nCertainly doesn't speak to some expertise in this in this space\nHere investigator and you're looking at this\nI Would think you would make no a imagines a scenario so that you would just try and get the evidence and follow the evidence and try and figure it out that way rather than while this motives that motive and the other mode and you're really you're you're just getting down to the forensics\nYeah and that's what guys like you and I do uh we're always hesitant to jump to a boat or before we actually have the facts and the data there I mean this is with comments that reasonable people do but of course when you know with the with the current environment and and the media hysteria they immediately want to prescribe them a motive remembered mark\nThe most important of all the W. using this right the who what when where why and how\nThe most important thing obviously it's who did who the actual person we know we have zero clues right now at least publicly as to who that person that I suspect\nKnowing how these investigations go and the availability of\nThe initiate or in these devices which usually leads the signature that they're going to get someone relatively quickly but you have no idea who it is and when you don't have to who you have no idea what the motive is and I got to tell you it's grotesquely\nNo we have euro close right now at least publicly after who that person that I ... back\nKnowing how these investigations go and the availability of the initiate or in these devices which usually leads the signature\nThat they're going to

out there already or absolutely convinced\nThat that they know exactly why this happened it's just it's just that it\nLets you also find it a really gut wrenching sickening that every time there's something a terrible that takes place in this country they trained tight that Donald Trump now rose Donald Trump\nYesterday was compared to Hitler multiple times on cable TV he was said to be a racist
