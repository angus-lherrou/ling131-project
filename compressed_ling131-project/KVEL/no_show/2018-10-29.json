that Americans are going to resent\nThe heck out of people are going to be angry at that\nThat's disgusting it's vile it's it's you're responsible gets reckless and ultimately it will be a losing

rocketing why has the cost of the top medications increased over a hundred percent since two thousand and eleven\nWhat is the whole system fuel rig well there's an answer the big drug makers spend a lot of money to lobby to protect their profit over a hundred and Seventy one million dollars to be exact\nBut there is a bigger lobby in America are politicians must answer to we the people we want solutions to prescription drug affordability we want them now\nTrying to hold the drug makers accountable and put patients that had a profit they had their lobbyists and there are hundreds of millions

Democrats are that's how hard their fight we gotta\nWe gotta fight harder Shane you're on the bike out of your show how you doing shame\nHey like a last time we thought we disagree but with this topic I'm I'm a I'm with you on this one because uh I'm Glad you brought up the civility issue\nA there was something happened last night I wanted to share with you might help things a little bit I I found myself in a restaurant with my wife and kids and to date with over ... the woman who's running for state representative and my state of Indiana\nOh wow accountable if we knew each other over there like she saw a child at I saw her stickers I later she was with my wife suggested hey why don't you go ask her if you can take your picture with her and um put it on Facebook and show everybody that we can get low\nI thought about it and I went over there and I and I asked her and she said as soon as I saw you I was thinking the same thing and we actually had a conversation for about Fifteen minutes and it it kind of ended with me telling her that I think she's a wonderful person I Wish she wasn't a Democrat\nBut because of what they did the cabin all I just can't vote for it she said was that she thought that Trump was lucky to have a supporter like me and we both came to the conclusion that this kind of has a style with adequate ripping each other's throats out I mean we're still humans and it just because we disagreed on and we have to hate each other all the time\nAnd I wish that people could start talking to each other instead of looking at each other as saying that the Democrat I hate the word that is a Republican I hate them I Can't take it anymore it's driving me crazy and and I just wanted to share that because I\nI I and I also believe and I appreciate your sharing that because frankly I you're you're reflecting the way I think millions and millions of people feel uh it's it's getting out of hand and it's got it's got to stop it's got to it's got we got we got to take a breath we got to stop it I mean this is what Trump is saying the president is right\nWe've got to say I watched a video last night in my hotel room here in Chicago\nAnd there was a young black man with a a red make America great again hat on and there was a white guy with a football Jersey on kind of a big hole\nDean of\nReason I call them in an oath is because he got this black kids face and his challenging this this kid why do you have a ... hat on\nMan with a red make America great again hat on and there was a white guy with a football Jersey on kind of a big hole in\nOh the reason I call them an oath is because he got in this black kids face and his challenging this this kid why do you have a mock a hat on take that handle and the young\nThe young man was very composed with the mock ahead on he was talking on I think it I I couldn't see it real well the video is a little blurry but I thought he had his cell phone up to his ear\nHe said why do I take my hat off I I support President Trump and this guy was custody of it in his face and you take that how often how dare you wear that had in this place\nAnd the guy said I'm not taking the hat off so the big bulky dumb old sort of a human being knocked the hat off this guy\nJust knocked it right off his head his crime was wearing a red baseball cap that this that this jerk didn't agree with you know something this is ... you want to pick up on a tone CNN\nHow 'bout Maxine Waters tone I'm so fed up with listening to people lecture Americans about a tone\nLike it's all Donald Trump's term what about the max you listed the guy with the football Jersey let's see if we could find that video cheap laughs pat Lena somebody you can find this video make sure we bleep out the curse words if they're already in there as I recall there were\nOh let's just telling me it's a hoax [laughter]\nAll right never mind apparently it's a hoax but let's let's let's acknowledge that has happened we did see the

it's being ginned up isn't it I again I'll tell you the Democrats are desperate they thought they had a blue wave they don't have a blue wave\nThey thought that the bomber what helped them it hasn't helped them they thought that um or they could somehow make the president responsible for Pittsburgh that didn't work\nNothing is working for them because people don't want Nancy Pelosi back as speaker\nAnd they are voting to increase Mitch McConnell's majorities in the Senate\nAnd therefore it's just bottom of the barrel time and smearing Kevin McCarthy as an anti Semite is the lowest of

Bloomberg and Tom Steyer we're trying to buy the election which in fact they're trying to do and ah that's fine that's our constitutional rights but he was accused of anti Semitism for noting that\nI guess because those three men are Jewish and you know Kevin McCarthy I Know Kevin McCarthy armed bastard or to Germany rip Cornell came on earlier he knows Kevin McCarthy what do you make up the charge of anti Semitism with regards to our friend Kevin McCarthy\nWell so both of us know Kevin McCarthy for many decades but what I didn't know and I bet Kevin McCarthy didn't know is it those three guys are all Jews\n[laughter] I bet you didn't [laughter] I bet you didn't you know\nReally 'cause I I think in particular those three guys you know like I I didn't know George Soros was a Jew\nBut ... and everybody everybody knows about him right he's is big liberal guy gives all this money read it but the truth is if you were going to insult them because they were Jews you would need to be

McCarthy and\nThe mayor of anti Semitism is a deep one I mean it it's along with being anti black and racism any sort of an anti Semitism is the ancient evil it's been denounce specifically but my

but it is used as a cudgel does it work Larry aren't\nWell uh you know the ... I I Want to say something about the depth of it is they think about the Jews that was a giggle when you said that Walker per se quoi which I had not heard before isn't that wonderful that\nThey get the Jews are unique in history and their unique because it's the first ancient people whose God did not disappear when the polity was defeated\nAnd they kept their God you're there X. files and this got claims to be the one God and the creator of all and then this God\nClaims to have a concern for everybody on earth and the covenant with Abraham is a covenant and this should be a blessing to all the people on the face of the year\nNow you won't find anything like that in the ancient religions have which Judaism is one right three thousand NBC or before\nAnd so that's the first thing but the second thing is\nBecause they uh they didn't they didn't this band when their country was overcome the promised land was overcome\nOvercome then what they had been is an exile people for a long long time incredibly stubborn and keeping their identity\nAnd so that that places them in lots of other countries and that means the oldest opportunity for resentment of of of strangers in our midst of that you\nAnd you know it's just another great fact that\nAbout the United states of America that George Washington and Seventeen Ninety eight to the Hebrew congregation in Newport Rhode Island\nThat it is now no more that we speak of religious toleration as if it were by the indulgence of some that others enjoy their inherent natural rights\nAnd that is probably the first letter written by chief executive of any country except ancient Israel to some Jews addressing them is equal citizens that's the American heritage\nAnd there's no reason to believe that Kevin McCarthy does not does not feel

what do you think about Dr Larry aren't\nA that was good or I might have said about those Trump rallies which I you know I don't watch them I Confess but I read them from time to time about them and you know the ones that I watch they're usually pretty good\nI mean even very good but isn't Trump point isn't the point toward which he's fighting that what we Americans have in common is our citizenship\nAnd that divides us in the following way we Americans agree that a human being has rights and our country is founded to defend those rights\nAnd to be a citizen of America is the practices and belief that stem from that and it's got nothing to do with color\nNow I think that's what Donald Trump has to say to the world and says it a lot and has been saying that I looked it up before the election\nBack for decades and so if you say that your enemies are acting bad in the end and you know he says that hard right one of the reasons the political or the political debate is so intense\nIs it now it's a real fight and Trump does fight like like in the sense that he denounces people really clearly but I don't think you know racist way\nAnd he does not call for violence ... for his victory that he really wants to win the Senate he really wanted to win Brett Kavanaugh he really wanted the tax cuts he really wants to where like you said you'll get sick of winning\nBut he doesn't call for violence in the intimation that he does the idea that chance or somehow car chases are hurling insults are like hurling rocks\nThat is a vanity or the left and the media can see that

made the point that there'd been some lynchings and they weren't all black people and uh although there were so\nAnd so he he makes the point that if you stream out into the street and act like that

he's a citizen of this country and if the president wants to come here please God he was not objecting at all to the president's it which I appreciate and when we still don't get thing on the blame game which is what we do especially the the let media\nNow then we lose sight of what really happened to you know what really happened is as we just got an anti Semite killed ... that was his goal those were the words that were true unspoken from him he wanted to kill Jews but we also had\nPittsburgh Police who are amazing I Love these guys I Know so many of them they went rushing towards the gunfire while everyone else it courses rushing away we had a doctor a banner ...\nWho went to care for a gunshot victim and he became a victim himself rabbi Myers made every effort to save as many lives that they could and he regretted that he couldn't save more these are the real stories and this is the truth these were not acts of the nation divided that's what the ones that could lead the media wants to believe\nThat we're a nation divided but we're not we're a nation or a community like this one\nLike any other when we're faced with adversity when we come face to face with a madman we roll up our sleeves we face that evil with courage and the sacrifice and and and that is who we are as Americans and when they play the blame game on the media it makes me sick because we missed what the true story is what the truth is and rabbi Myers I Love what you said\nHe said the bullet holes are too numerous to count but we will rebuild because we're tree of life we've been here one hundred

we get out the vote or going to deal with that all the other issues of the day threats against Republicans that the media just outright ignores and the mob mentality continues will have full chronicling of all of this\nYeah that's right and and Sean ... are it by the people right now certainly have a ... thousands of volunteers that are out there and knock on doors and distributing voter education literature through our organization is ignored the polls ignore the press ignore the pundits do your job get the ...\nEverybody ... me you know I make a living for people not ignoring\nYour except it okay but I think you're right though\nBecause the polls are so often so wrong I mean let's go back two years Donald Trump lost every state according to the exit polls five Fifteen on election day\nWell that's exactly right and I mean look when I was state party chairman in Georgia where we elected the first Republican governor that stayed in a hundred and thirty four years\nThe last published poll in a midterm election showed him trailing by third chain he won by five they were only off by a team points and particularly in a midterm election worked turnout is everything it's all a matter of who does a better job of getting their voters to the polls and Sean\nI talked to a friend of mine who's helping to run independent expenditures and every targeted than in the house race in the country\nHe told me that in some of these house races dirt down to his view is twenty three hundred a undecided voters in an entire congressional district everybody's got their uniforms on everybody's blocking and tackling and everybody's going to the polls and the good news is\nWe've got the ability to identify twenty six million voters as either evangelical are pro life Catholics we have phone numbers on forty five percent of them we've got emails on about half of them uh we\nWe have the ability to get directly to them and we know nightly whether they voted or not that we can follow up with more phone or email us more tax and worked or not\nWhere do you see because I'm looking at six races believe it or not in Southern California that matter for the house there's\nThose races in New York house races that could turn tip the balance of power and New Jersey can tip the balance of power and\nMinnesota has house races that can tip the balance of power but then I say that and I'm thinking well there were four hundred and thirty five races going on a in a daze in any one of them can tip the balance of power and while you use the poles and it's somewhat helpful it's much harder to decide and get a feel for how the house is going to go\nLook right now we really see the houses on the bus or we think it's plus or minus five or ten feet and we think when you're dealing with probably right now\nA hundred seats in play and probably half of those are tied again it's all about turnout and and look you remembered the special election in Georgia sex when they had us off or you know two three four five and he lost by four\nIt's all a matter of who does the best job at the ground game and the good news Sean is the power brokers and the media and no longer get to control who wins or who loses we've got the ability to communicate to voters\nDirectly on line on their cell phone at their doors wherever they work play and live and if we do our job and get our bowed out we're going to have the potential to have a shocking and election night to the to the dominant media as we had two years ago\nI mean that's what I keep reminding people you can shock the world again we can go against history nobody thought Trump would win I mean the networks were literally when I read the exit polls the five Fifteen I was doing radio at the time and and the at that moment reading the exit polls trumpet lost Florida he lost North Carolina he lost Pennsylvania\nHe lost Ohio he lost Michigan he lost Wisconsin He lost at all\nI Need barely won the state according to the exit polls the same thing happened in two thousand and for the exit polls at five Fifteen election day show John Kerry was president so you're right and they have to pay attention to the polls but more importantly\nHow do you get all these people involved that they're really spending the time making phone calls getting on you know getting the vote out and sending out these emails and letters and tax what are you doing\nI I have to be honest with these Sean I got to give credit where the credit is due first of all a to President Trump for providing the banner of the positions on the issues that it's got these people so excited and secondly to the Democrats for during the cabinet nominations trying to air and destroy a good man and his family\nAnd we saw a noticeable inflection point in this cycle when they tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh it's a reminder of why people turned out in sixteen\nThe banner of the positions on the issues but it's got these people so excited and secondly to the Democrats sport during the Kavanaugh nomination trying to air and destroy a good man and his family\nAnd we saw a noticeable inflection point in this cycle when they tried to destroy Brett Kavanaugh it's a reminder of why people turned out in sixteen and we've got thirty nine field offices and Nineteen states we have a team's operating in every state in the country there overseeing walking teams that are going neighborhood to neighborhood\nWe had a woman the other day that was\nVerbally accosted a guy got in his car and followed her all the way down the block screaming obscenity at her she sent me an email later and said not only am I not hurt that I'm now going to walk every neighborhood in my town and knock on every door it's that kind of intensity that kind of commitment to our country\nYou know at at times like this Sean when people wonder you know if that kind of decency and character still alive in this country the answer is a really valid thing yeah it is it's in the heartland of the country it's at the grassroots it's alive and well\nWell I think grassroots politics works grassroots works and I think it works from the beginning one of the thing is though I think Obama lead the way but Trump and the Republicans did some catch up and we saw the benefit of their working twenty sixteen and that is the use of social media I don't think anybody has more powerful platform on social media than President Trump\nI think that's right I think ah you know a rock Obama was the first\nSocial media Internet president in the same way that FDR was the first radio president in the same way that John F. Kennedy was the first president to master television but if Obama was the pioneer I assure you Trump has mastered\nIt or not only in his use of social media platforms but also the thing is that his campaign dead in twenty sixteen\nTo catch up with what the Obama campaign did and we for example a Sean when we took our Christian voter file and matched\nIt up against social media platforms\nSeventy two percent of the voters were seeking to contact her on Twitter or Facebook or another social media platform and we're broadcasting out thirty two million videos get out the vote messages and other targeted messages directly to those people and again I Want to stress the minute they vote\nThey get dropped out of the turnout universe and all the videos we've been pushing their social media count then begin to go elsewhere\nNow I agree look anything's possible I ... I don't take things for granted I'm I was one of the few that really believe that Donald Trump could when I saw something happening but it was I was out on the road\nI also see it happening this time anecdotally\nYou know I can see it in ratings every single night it's a you know Fox's audiences enthusiastic 'em and you can see CNN fake news and\nAnd that mess that they're just desperate then they're like not doing well they seem almost the audience seems depressed but there were three virtual outcomes here one is we shock the world Republicans picked up Senate seats hold the house that would be the best case scenario then there's the split a situation\nWhere Republicans good seats in the Senate ... become speaker and then there's a worst case scenario you wake up you know ten nine days from now when you find out as speaker elect below sea and Senate majority elects Schumer and\nIt's really up to the people which decision which outcome they want but this will get the government we deserve you stay home well that's a half of Oprah below sea and Schumer if you don't vote for the Republican you're basically voting for below sea ensure\nYeah and I and I really believe showing that the intensity gap in the enthusiasm gap\nThat wants to separate the two sides has closed significantly since the Kavanaugh nomination you know you see different polls would Democrats with a high enthusiasm maybe Seventy two percent of them Republicans maybe sixty eight to Seventy percent but anecdotally I'm telling you I'm seeing stuff out there that I saw on twenty sixteen\nI was in Des Moines Iowa last week at an event with the vice president we have a very strong organization out there we have over a hundred and fifty people walking door to door just in Des Moines neighborhoods and\nThis one gentleman who was volunteering told me he was at the president's rally the previous a friday and Cedar Rapids they filled an arena\nThere were over two thousand people who couldn't get in they stood in the driving range for two hours and watch it on the jumbotron\nThey stayed there to show their support you simply cannot quantity of quantify that with a poll or within analysis it's

think we'd lose the house by about five seats where\nIf the election were held with the Senate today where we would hold Tennessee we pick up Missouri we pick up Arizona we barely hold Nevada I think we have a if people don't vote libertarian in Indiana will win Indiana\nAnd we'll win North Dakota Florida too close to call Montana too close to call West Virginia lean Democrat although the secretary of state there is now up to in the latest poll Menendez is a long shot to be beaten in New Jersey but he can be beaten\nThat's that's where my head of that today and uh well I'm trying to warn people that this was real that you know here we have history running against us so there's only going to be one of three results\nOn the morning after the night before and it's either going to be while the Republicans picked up seats in hold the Senate Republicans while they held on to the house and that's going to be the best case scenario or it's going to be a split decision they pick up seats in the Senate but lose the house\nOr it's going to be a disaster and that you know speaker elect Nancy Pelosi Senate majority elect Chuck Schumer\nVery Frank I knew I can see any one of those three scenarios unfolding with the third one the least likely\nSo you know I'd rather go vote for the gusto and win at all what are the big problems for the Republicans ... they've had forty five retirement\nThat's forty five unknowns on the ballot and the Democrats you know they're getting all of this money poured into these house races because they've given up a lot on the Senate races there going all in the get the house\nAnd to really try to get in people's minds and make them understand that for the Trump agenda to continue we really do need both houses because Nancy Pelosi as speaker and Maxine Waters of the\nOne of the best the best case of Hitler and wanting the worst case of Trump won and yet Donald\nTrump still wants now we have a president wherever the president is has a record Hillary's true colors have come out contrast after two thousand eight where it was best case Obama and then look what happened to two thousand tend to mid term stink about that the voters corrected their mistake Obama last sixty three house seats and what's there to correct now\nWhat part of the Trump success story to the voters want to change\nGive the crumbs back increase to regulate watched jobs go back overseas see now that's that's a difference my opponent has talked about that they're hiding behind a bunch of smoke and mirrors and not running for really are but I think the ... the voters are a lot smarter than that right now and we're going to some some people in November six\nI noticed that former New York city Mayor Bloomberg is you know putting tens of millions of dollars apparently into a lot of these house races are you seeing the effects of his money and others\nI'm not seeing Bloomberg's money in in this race but I'll tell you one thing closest Pakistan a million dollars on hitting me right here in my home district ... million dollar San Francisco money being spent right here in the valley of Pennsylvania attacking me\nBy the way I say this to everybody I said they're foreign or thirty five members running for Congress and if you vote for any Democrat make no mistake about it you're voting for ... they're just not saying that\nThey're not saying it but that's the absolute truth\nWhat are the polls latest numbers show uh in the district\nTwo points back where the latest poll shows that were to back\nTo back well within the margin of error and where and we're gaining momentum uh we we debate at several times every debate she will not agree to any additional debates are we caught her actually wasn't as we caught her in the debates talking about supporting open borders then she correct herself and say no no no I support a strong southern border twice\nShe said that in the last debate which completely makes sense because during the primary she was running on about\nEyes open borders but now we're getting the general election they're trying to pivot and we're going to and we're going to expose her for what she really is\nWell this is a really important race a now Marty no Stein is running for the seventh district\nOf Pennsylvania this Lehigh Valley district\nLehigh Valley county in Pennsylvania\nA it's a dead even race it's all going to come down a turnout Democrats are spending a fortune Republicans sadly of not spent as much and they should be meeting these guys dollar for dollar but I Hope people in the seventh district I Know we have a lot of listeners there are paying attention and and get out and vote early voting goes on in Pennsylvania right so people can vote soon\nYes and then we're seeing and talking to our election or you know there's so many presidential election is what they told me what the amount of absentee ballot requests and what is being turned it so people are really really engage the really engaged\nAnd he's getting any feedback as to you know what's coming back Republican versus Democrat\nI haven't been getting any any feedback but I can just tell you that people who have been meeting and the people who aren't going to be here to vote have been asking for absentee ballots and they're making sure they're getting their votes in I have a good sense that there's going to be a lot of people showing up at the polls and to be alive and there's going to be a lot of people supporting Trump's agenda\nYou know we're in the middle of the great American comeback last too\nBut I haven't been getting any any feedback but I can just tell you that people who I've been reading and the people who aren't going to be here to vote have been asking for absentee ballots and they're making sure they're getting their votes in I have a good sense that there's going to be a lot of people showing up at the polls and it'd be alive and there's going to be a lot of people supporting Trump's agenda [noise]\nYou know we're in the middle of the great American comeback last two years have given a lot of people hope in this country\nMore jobs lower taxes safer communities or do they want to uh uh have Nancy Pelosi take charge and have more welfare higher taxes open borders and sanctuary cities the voters are smarter than that Sean they want opposite when freedom and liberty they went opportunity that's what we want as\nWhat we have and we must continue it\nOr we wish you the best Marty all the best thing I Know you bring that great training as an athlete to the hard work you do for the seventh district of\nPennsylvania and Lehigh County or will be following the race ... a week from tomorrow and uh I Hope you're able to sneak this out\nYes sir thank you thank you for having me on the show\nEight hundred nine four one ... listen you gotta understand this is now well how close it is it's all coming down to get getting out the vote\nIt's one point here two points there it makes all the difference there are enough people in his audience that if everybody just made a commitment wherever you live on six hundred stations now and you made a decision that you're going to get out and you're going to vote\nAnd you're not going to stay home and you're going to put in the effort and you're not going to give a half a vote to below zero half a vote to Schumer it could be you know shocked the world again kind of night is happy you stay home than it's you know maybe we splits but the baby in the sense that you know it's\nOkay we said we saved the Senate and get extra seats there but we lose the house it'd be a lot easier and better for the country if you want to continue progress to win both houses as of today eight days out I can see any one of those scenarios unfolding any one of them All right let's go to our busy telephones or let's say Hi to Katherine\nIs in palm bay Florida next on the Sean Hannity show\nHey Sean I Can't I'm telling you enough how much my husband and I just absolutely I think you are the greatest not because of just what you inform us because of your courage\nAnd the hearts and prayers\nGo out to the people in Pittsburgh it is devastating I Can't believe Americans have forgotten the history and the genocide that went on during ... during the Holocaust I don't understand it but with that sad or hearts and prayers are with them I have a point to make about courage and by the way you are right up there with President Trump\nAnd his entire family and those that stand by and I want the conservatives in this country to take part in some shared risk and stand up not in a violent way not in the vulgar way like maintain your credibility by being several stand up\nTo all these bullies and oppression and and the violence and the hatred that they're skewing the lie they're telling about our gear presidents I'm comparing him to Hitler and style and which are just atrocities I Can't stand to listen to\nBut the problem is that a lot of a lot of very frightened people I think President Trump as the most famous whistle blower in the nation because he's he's taken the curtain back and all the corruption in Washington and then something\nI'm I'm a whistle blower myself unemployed nurse practitioner laugh at heart a surge in five years ago and I'm Still fighting today that's that's fine\nBut I just wanted to say if if the conservatives have some shared risk and stick together and consolidated\nYou gotta let me tell you why we are now I mean we're now at a point where there's a there's a group of so called conservatives never Trump or conservatives again that they're just angry they've been so wrong Ben Sasse was one of the bill Kristol is another one of them\nJennifer Rubin another one of them you know the if there's if Trump cured cancer they would be mad because oh it was Donald Trump that did it you know it doesn't matter that he's transformed the economy all things that they say that they use conservatives would ever want in terms of cap tax cuts deregulation\nA energy independence a peace through strength trust but verify\nSecuring America's borders all of these things it doesn't they hate it all because Trump is doing that which they've advocated for but they wanted somebody to do it in a way that that that said everything the way they wanted to say it but the problem is the old establishment way of doing things gets nothing\nDone you know I agree he can be incendiary he breaks things he throws dishes and breaks them in Washington and he exposes the swamp but he fights hard\nBut we're getting the results in the benefit of that hard fight you know ... they're the type of Republicans the basically want to just sit in power in the corner and\nAnd act like they can be friends with people that are saying publicly to kick you and that don't want to be civil\nThat are running you out of restaurants and screaming at the top of their lungs that you\nSo I you know it's it is what it is I the only thing I really want at this point I Want results\nI Want the forgotten men and women to be taking care of I Want as much prosperity as we could ever create for every American and I want to take care of Americans first and then we'll work on helping the rest of the world develop the same system in paradigm that we built that\nHas benefited our population and then I Want security or in a world full of radical Islam is and people that that want to wipe America off the map and chant death to America\nI Want to make sure that we have the meanest toughest that US military and we can handle any threat to the world throws at us\nAnd we can do if necessary we can protect the world against evil when evil you know raises its ugly head for this has happened before and it's gonna happen again history has proven in the meanwhile it's you know basically you know temper tantrum politics\nOf never Trump or is there there are still mad they got it wrong and we wouldn't have to Supreme Court justices that are conservative had they had their way we wouldn't have had the tax cuts we wouldn't have the regulations to roll back we wouldn't have America on a path towards energy independence\nWe wouldn't have had you know all the record numbers of jobs we currently have or the big GDP Growth we have or consumer confidence that we have\nThat's why in eight days when people go out and vote this fall matters the major question people have to ask is or you're better off than you were two years ago in terms of the economy\nPeace and prosperity Dr elections and if you want this prosperity this growth to continue if you want America to remain the leader on the world stage if you're not afraid to have a president\nThat is willing to be a tough negotiator on your behalf be a trade or NATO or Kim Jong un we didn't give anything to Kim Jong un nothing and look at what we've gotten back\nA shot at peace and denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula you know

Amendment Fourth Amendment but hopefully your law enforcement authorities can figure out a way within your in laws and constitutional rights that Americans have to figure out a way to monitor this so they can see one sort of this kind of hate pops up\nAnd then be able to take action before the crime takes place that's what we have in Israel um and it's been very effective at preventing a lot of these types of attacks I mean I Would love to believe that this was going to be the last attack but I think given that these all these haters are communicating with each other\nI think it's important for your forties to see what they can do to prevent the next attack\nAnd uses armed guards that many of your some of that\nStory that's a reality that unfortunately Jews face around the world if you

protection is\nIt's sad but unfortunately at least for the foreseeable future it might it might be necessary not only to protect the population a but to give them a sense of security one thing that's important is for political leaders to speak out very very strongly against that I was very pleased to hear from President Trump I thought he had\nYou know what the strongest combinations frankly I've ever heard I've never heard of non Israeli non Jewish leader say those are those who try to destroy the Jews we will destroy them I've never heard that far from any leader\nAnd not only was it that that uh that was I heartened to hear the president of United States say that but I was heartened to hear the applause he got from the people who were at that rally in Illinois when he fit that\nUh and it's important for people on the right to spit out the extremists among them to David Dukes it's important for people on the left to spit out the extremist like Louis Farrakhan and others and to say that there's no place for this type of hatred in the United states\nYou know mainstream conservatives have never consider themselves for writer embrace David do we were ... people like that but we do have a growing bbs movement in this country it's growing or college campuses quite frankly it's growing in the left and there's haters everywhere every breed of every stripe and so forth and so on\nBut in some ways it's getting more and more mainstream the the UN is rabidly anti Semitic the bbs movement which is\nIn mainstream did many with many corporations and many organizations and in political organizations in Europe and even some of it in the United states this again this is this is intended as an anti Semitic Jew anti Israel movement do you see this growing to\nNo question about it I mean for many years to the un has been ground zero France Semitism and holding Israel up to standard holds no other nation on earth when you have you know two thirds of the John recently channel was simply U.N General assembly resolutions against Israel\nThat's got to tell you something when you have more resolutions passed against Israel and the un human rights council that all the countries of the world combined um\nThat's got to tell you something and this is a deep problem people thought it was a thing of the past it's not a it's very serious and it's growing and that's why it's so important you know there there's a an old saying that you know it starts with the Jews but it never ends with the ... we have always been seen as the canary of the ... in the coal mine\nIn of civilization so when you have those noxious fumes that are directed at the Jews\nUm it's not going to end there it's going to spread and that's why it's very important for people to frankly mark put all the politics aside and stand together whether you're on the right of conservative or liberal whether you're a Republican or Democrat and and\nThey noticed kind of hate and and lead by showing that this type of bigotry this type of hatred will have no sanctions and the United states of America\nYou know I agree completely putting politics aside but I've been watching this I'm sure you have in the United states tier media and its politics first second and third it's politics morning noon and night it's politics trumped responsible for this Trump this Trump business Trump this\nAnd this killer this mass murder this this Jew hater he hated Trump he didn't like Trump decided to many Jews around now you have in President Donald Trump may in my view the the greatest supporter of Israel any American president\nHe's the knowledge that Jerusalem is the capital the president did that before he's moved our embassy to Jerusalem they all promised they never did it before he took this Iran deal which was passed by Congress\nIn the prior administration which gave tens of billions of dollars to this terrorist regime which has the United states in Israel and its sights he said no more to that\nI mean from my perspective as an American as a conservative who's who's been watching this stuff for a long long time this president has been the best friend of the Jewish state certainly during my lifetime\n[noise] yeah I mean I I said this uh before uh we've never had a strong supporter of Israel than President Trump a and frankly it it hasn't even been close\nIn terms of what he's done I mean you're lifting some of those things that he's gone you have a Nikki Haley ambassador Haley at the un pushing back against all this anti Israel sentiment obviously the gruesome and the case the
