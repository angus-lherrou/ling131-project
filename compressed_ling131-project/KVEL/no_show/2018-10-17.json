get to know you a little bit better ... can you tell us who Marge Caldwell is what's your what's your what's your personal experience has been here in the UN a base and I think you're a lifelong resident aren't you\nPretty close I was born hair um grew up here moved away for a while and moved away I went to school at the University of Utah got my MBA or worked in Salt lake for a while and then I moved to California for a while\nA I got tired of the crowds there and uh decided this was a place for me and my wife and I and our two boys moved back here\nYou had two other children when we moved back here\nAnd uh we spent the rest of my wife here and we love it what about your professional background mark a\nWhile is I'm a CPA I've ah worked for I worked for the largest caring for him in the world uh Arthur Andersen in San Francisco I worked there for five years had a variety of clients are international clients a national clients um supervised work uh throughout the country and and the international we also\nIs short a standard of couple of months uh over in Eastern Europe so I've got a pretty wide variety of experience there moved back to burn all end of a managed to couples are companies here um did some acquisitions of other companies ... and grew the company in\nA last Fifteen Years I've had my own private investment company\nWhat qualifications I mentioned accounting background comes in handy what qualifications to you have to serve on the un school board\nOf I've been serving there for eight years so so I think that experience was very valuable [noise] um I Know how to district works um I've got to carry a background so I Know how budgets work a minor how taxing system works so I think all of that I bring a I bring to the board\nOkay um\nWhat are the top three issues that you think are are are important my priority facing the district today\nWell\nLet me just a couple of my priorities um\nStart off with the question to to you and to our listeners Kay um do you want to be able to vote on how your tax dollars are spent and do you want greater transparency on your tax dollars are spent if you're like me the answers\nWell\nLet me just a couple of my priorities um\nStart off with a question to to you and to our listeners Kay\nUm do you want to be able to vote on higher tax dollars are spent and do you want greater transparency on your tax dollars are spent if you're like me the answer is yes I Want\nGreater transparency and I want to be able to vote on how my tax dollars are spent now I'm not going to be on the board forever so I really want to get things change before I'm off the board so that so that's the case uh continues when I'm off of ...\nUm to do that we need to change the way that the district by these taxes currently they might be the capital taxes about twelve million dollars a year\nAnd they they have about five million dollars of leftover and they put that into the bank account and then that just adds up and so when they need a new building they don't have to come in asking you buddy if they want to if we want that building they just have the money already and can do it\nYou don't have any public hearings\nOr have any public input and so I Would like to change the way they might be the taxes\nBut to give that five million dollars extra back to the taxpayers set up to the um just the ... the districts discretion to do that that's totally after the districts discretion that's that's up to the boards discretion and so the board can decide to do that um this year I put forth a ... idea um\nI made a motion at our board meeting when we were doing the budget to cat that by five million and it was second didn't we debated it two of us supported for that and three voted to remain taxing twelve million dollars\nFight so if you reduce that capital tax what happens then the district doesn't fit accumulating your money and they have to come and ask you if they want to build something then you're going to want to know what they want to build and are going to have for public meetings and people were going to have to be able to give input and ... and it's going to be more transparent on how the money's being spent\nOkay the other the other issues budget and how how ... how how how the Lebanese are or how our financed yes ah is one ... one of the other two issues\nOr so is the other one um teachers wages so there's a shortage of teachers throughout throughout Utah and a teacher's wages is a is a real hot button we need to raise our teachers wages in my opinion\nOn the way the district budgets currently they they are very conservative and they're budgeting so that wonder estimates it revenues and or and overestimate their expenses so that at the end of the year\n... good forecasting from from an accounting perspective I if I'm building a performer statement for a bank for alone I Would want to I wouldn't want to\nDo you do you support on building a new building for the central co pre school\nLike I can tell you if I supported it or not at this time I think that uh we're way to um women are in the in the discussion I think that before we make that decision we need to have a have public hearings and we need to see how the public feels about it\nUm if there's a need or the buildings old um but I think that the public needs to weigh in before before them at that stage and\nIs there a health concern with keeping that building asbestos\nWell not not that I'm aware of if there is I Would like somebody to bring that to to the board and bring it to our attention but you know it's the same way with the district office were told that the that it's leaking Scott mold and that\nBut no one's ever and I've said if that's the case bring it to us because we don't want our employees working where there's no let's let through media than due to taking care of\n... ah what about the transportation building to building in it is now I sixty years old something addict getting up there and uh many are arguing that it needs to be replaced\nYeah I I Would probably be one of those that argues that it does need to be replaced by you know that's I have been down there haven't been down there recently but within the last couple of years\nAnd it's probably time for in a new building for the Transportation Department but once again I think that we need that we need to have a public process and we don't I don't think we want just to have a plan presented without any input you know we want\nWe want a discussion on what that really is going to look like and how much we should spend you know we shouldn't be going through the architects outrage in saying you know what's this going to cost when we haven't even talked about what we want to work like\nYour feelings on the district administration building I'm remodeling construction either one what are your feelings there at this point\nI I think that we're fine with what we have I think that uh um if there's if there's a moral issue if there's leaking issues I think we ... we need to maintain that building um it said that the building is forty years old you know um if we're torn down every building it was forty years old in this town\nWe have probably half half the buildings in town or now but uh if we give with we maintain it properly it'll be fine mothers homes lord and ...\nThere's if there's a moral issue if there's waking issues I think we ... we need to maintain that building um it said that the building is forty years old you know I'm\nTorn down every building it was forty years old in this town we have probably half half the buildings in town torn down but uh if we give with we maintain are properly it'll be fine mothers homes lord and forty years old and it's it's still find condition\n... okay I'm moving on to our taxes which you know something about\nAh it's my understanding or that the certified tax rate is a formula proposed by the state to ensure public municipalities operating in part on property taxes are able to maintain a consistent income from property taxes during this cyclical\nEconomy were home values and property values are are searching and then and then depressing ... is that your understanding of it as well\nYeah that's part partially my understanding what the other understanding is that set\nSo the taxing unity don't um if they want to collect more taxes than they did the year before they have to go for truth from taxation hearing if they want to charge above certify tax rate okay All right but it does provide a constant\nThey can collect what they collected the year before without having to go through truth in taxation that right mate fluctuate based on what property values are doing\nBut um this summer the UN is county school the school board voted to adopt a state recommended certified tax rate\nOr you were part of that discussion on keeping the same amount of income as the previous year do you support this decision [noise] so you have done it differently if you had your way how did you vote on it\nSo I'm I propose a different a option I made a motion to um to ... to pass a certified or a tax rate over than certified right and it was second don't buy miss Bartlett and um the two of us will report and yeah three born ... voted against it [noise]\nThe reason we did that as the certified rate is senator rights that allow you to collect what you collected the year before but it also has an increased built into it\nBecause it it gives you any growth that you've had in your community so that's that's an added so there was about four hundred thousand dollars of growth money coming in our proposal was let's just keep what what's who's collect what we did the year before so we want to knock that certified right down\nTo two so we just collect what we did the year before we we felt that that's what the community needed at this time\n[noise] property values on the same subject property values have declined in you win a county because of uh the recent recession or do you feel the school district has a responsibility to better manage its finances or a to reduce the burden on human accounting taxpayers where should the tax payers pay the difference\nOh I I'm all about saving money I think that the school district just of any organization is trying to run a paper form of the need to um they need to watch their expenses and by no means who I think to the taxpayers and the addict to carry that burden on their back\nRight on the public's perception I is\nMany many are are are concerned about uh uh they they reached they've they've learned about a four million dollars recently spent on the you went to high school baseball complex\nOr at the same time and in addition I think there was an additional one point for one point five something million on the auditorium a upgrades for the auditorium on the new building that we are\nI'm In the same time the board voted to adopt a certified tax rate\nUm and I think you've already answered this question but I'll ask it again because I've asked is it the other candidates do you feel there should be more public discussion on capital projects\nI think that that is the wrong time for the public to find out is when the project is already in in motion and they're taking grass off the officers do that's that's why I think that a changing the way the district Web these taxes and you know they have to come and ask before they can build\nSays collecting at putting in the bank and then they can just go and build it whenever they want\nI I definitely think that the public needs to be made aware of it before ...\n... do you have any parting comments or any thoughts that you'd like to like give before we\nClosed the interview well just a one thing I'd I'd like to bring up Steve is uh I've heard some rumors that are that are out there that I'd like to address there's a rumor that if a myself and Mr shivers and Mr Wilkins are elected that we plan on firing a bunch of teachers\nAnd and I want to assure everyone that that can got could not be farther from the truth uh we need all of our teachers and and that that would never happen um it's similar to ... to uh some of the business of\nAcquisitions I've I've been involved in the last thing you do is buy or the new the employees of the company require their valuable and you've got to have them to keep to keep a in business and\nSo I just want to put that rumor to rest that that that's completely false alright I\nAppreciate you coming in a market says it's been a good business and I think it gives a the the voting public a clear understanding of what your position is on this issues and or your your opponent is coming in right after round Robin McClellan will have an opportunity to visit with her about the same issues\nAnd will do that or when we come back right here on a new stock came the L\nAre you stress by raising home an auto insurance

I don't know what I meant by that I met I mean I think there needs to be more better communication okay how how would you proposed we do though\nI think um [noise]\nThat I mean transparency obviously and I know my opponent has talked about that but I think we need to I don't know if it's through\nI don't know what is social media is a great thing but I'm not a huge social media fan but I don't know website there's needs to be better PR there needs to be better communication what's going on at the district if people are that interested obviously they can come to the meetings because they're open\nUm but I just think we need to help bridge that gap a number that you\nMentioned another another subject is qualified teachers um\nHow how do you propose and very qualified teachers in a forceful you feel the teachers are adequately compensated\nI'm ... I Believe that the figures are from two thousand sixteen two thousand Seventeen before the the the the new proposed pay schedule a we were three point six percent lower than the average so that where you went to school district\nHad number twenty nine out of forty one district yeah our ... is that if instead of a figure that we should be proud of\n[laughter] of course not adequately compensated and and another figure he taught salaries are the six lowest in the nation and the student to teacher ratio is the third highest\nJust it said we have a ... student teacher ratio problem and he went to school is a little bit well all of Utah we have very big families so you're going to always have that that's always going to be an issue in Utah\nAnd um we just\nNeed to understand that we live are living in a highly competitive environment there is a teacher shortage there's large families in Utah we can you you went account you're competing against the wall sets friend an olive Utah Wyoming have credible salary than any teacher listen to that ends\nAnd the whole country so we have big class sizes and so that that was less attention to you know they have less time to be with all the students so it's a great question so how do we find a compensation increase\nI think you first have to understand that public schools are a government entity they're funded by three main sources twelve percent comes from federal sixty four percent comes from state tax and\nThat's less attention to you know they have less time to be with all the students so it's a great question so how do we finally compensation increase\nI think you first have to understand that public schools are a government entity they're funded by three main sources twelve percent comes from federal sixty four percent comes from state tax and twenty four ... percent comes from local taxes um so you have options so we have defined neither new new revenue streams\nUm other sources we can cut programs we can close schools which I'm not in favor of but the the other options you've got minimal on the table as you can have a vote of local tax levy just to go for teachers' salaries we're one of three districts that don't have that so\nOr a book about voted local tax I mean I don't know that they just go for\nUm salaries but we're only one of three um I'd like to look at every option how creative can we be to solve this what other options are available\nHoping that the federal or state like usually prop one we can find solutions that would not affect us locally but at the end of the day we have to ask what do we value I value education\nRight thank you um [noise] the is also on the subject of teacher pay a\nThere's a new pay structure introduced to the to the school district right teachers and um it was a little bit controversial when it first when she said do you support this and why\nSo why or why not there's two versions that came out the first version on there was a lot of feedback from the teachers so\nUm I think the let me let me go back and then I'll answer your question southern base may increase is a good start um it has a steady inclined from starting salary of forty two thousand\nAnd I I like to point out that the district business administrators accounting office office worked on this and ... and the school board for two years at a community also that had teachers on it\nSo when they first rolled it out there was pushback from the educators version one because I felt like the middle people once that had been in the district\nYou know the cat is a seven seven years for those of you can't see the grass and um it's\nA it starts out it starts out with the with with with the with a year one\nUh where we used to start our teachers out of thirty seven thousand interact rap roughly ... and then we bumped him up to forty to forty two ... and so that that that gave you the ability to uh\nTo solicit a new teachers and retain right he's treated all it's all about attracting new teachers we've had we've had trouble if we had trouble doing that in the past\nWe have I mean it's been ... depending on the gross we want we want to get the best teachers here and yes there's there were teachers leaving and there's teachers not wanting to come here and then there's a gradual\nIncrease with a new proposal schedule up to your thirty five where we're a teacher would peek out at sixty thousand dollars under the old one\nOr we would start start 'em out at thirty four thousand and then you'd you'd make came after the first three years and then you'd have a fairly sharp increase up through to your twelve and then they would put them up into the fifty three fifty four\nThousand dollar category and then it would flat line with us as much as a teacher could make [noise] yes so which which program do you support\nSo I like the second version that they came back with a compromise which I think fantastic\nAnd um it was more equitable and any teacher can could choose to stay on the old one or they could there's no deadline now to even to go to the new one if they would like to so\nI really don't understand why anyone would be unhappy I mean it's a great start for attracting new teachers in and retaining we got [noise]\nYou know when you make that investment in those teachers and they leave the first five years it's it's detrimental to the whole system relies\nYou as you mentioned um all of the candidates won yeah to pay for for for our teachers the question is how to do it that's right I'm changing subjects last year there was a uh when I actually know last year in two thousand sixteen\nUh there was an effort to buy the board to remove you win a school district superintendent mark docket mhm you have worked with Mr doc and I have your career or do you support Mr ... employment with the district\nSo see this one I've worked with him on a teacher who's an administrator and now he's superintendent this is a no brainer for me\nYou have someone who's been in our district you basically homegrown he's been a successful educator who was well respected amongst altogether superintendent in the state he had a Ninety four percent approval rating from educators\nAfter eight years of being the superintendent that's kind of unheard of\nUnder his leadership graduation rate rates have risen from fifty five in two thousand eight to sixty nine ... I'm Sorry that and the state average was sixty nine percent of that time but it's risen from fifty five to eighty six percent in two thousand Seventeen that's thirty one percent increase in nine years\nUm [noise] and that is now equal to the state graduation rate which is eighty six percent document has supported teachers principals continuity is great you know that for any program\nMorale is up he's in the schools every week he has great leadership style he's smart he's savvy he\nHas been great for our district it boggles my mind that some in our community want it to replace him with absolutely no explanation as to why\nThey never gave one reason our tax dollars were used in waste to hire an attorney or investigator not within the proper procedure of the school board or district policies and never was [noise]\nUm and never had that report may been made public or even shared with two of the board members Gilroy ... no reason was or to this day ever has been um never been given leads me to conclude that there's a personal agenda there's been a witch hunt\nFor just understanding purses\nSay you went to county needs to generate a million dollars to operate covered costs that would mean that it would take ten residences with home values of a hundred thousand to generate one million so if you look at Utah County there's tons of growth right now new houses we businesses\nUm so the tax rates are going to go down but the revenue will go up ... exactly the same way so you when a cat and we've been pretty flat gross property values have been to um have declined slightly sort tax rate goes up to generate the same amount\nOf revenue so I Know him explain ... you don't know but\nIf you go back to I just think when we're talking about taxes um [noise] oh never mind [laughter]\nNo that's okay to certify tax rate is is it's a little bit complicated but it's just so I you know a brief brief a description of it is my ... the certified tax rate this is my understanding is a formula proposed by the state\nTo ensure public municipalities like the school district right or operate in that operate in part on property taxes which we do\nA to maintain a consistent income from property taxes uh with with the with the ebbs and flows of property values are so that they can they can be consistent with their income and is that your understanding briefly\nYes and it provides for like ... if you if you know that you're going to have the same amount of students the same amount of teachers it ensures that revenue to be able to make to make make it all work what would you supported that right and so I mean one thing you said though it's the proposed rate so that's the suggestion rate that some things that they\nIt's it's entirely up to six to ... Russian of you know they adopted or not or hall of it are part of it when a county road trip to part of it right okay [noise]\nUm are there any parting thoughts what you'd like to like to share with the with the community did you want me to talk about whatever you want I can I take I Want to talk about I Want to talk about your dog before we go\nThere because you're you're my neighbor and and you buy with the with your little dog on the campaign sweatshirt on it was kind of cute yeah\nHe's been my there's a lot of dogs in for Neal can I just say more dog lovers than cat lovers that have been out canvassing and we love our dog I just wanted one more thing about money and then I won't say one other thing is just I Believe we really must budget wisely use our taxes like fish efficiently and responsibly and\nSustainably um [noise]\nYou know we we do have to tighten budget to make some sacrifices but it's a board members burden to properly find that balance but it's it's really not a zero sum till we got to work together efficiently and effectively I'm\nOne of the if you just want to talk about\nLast thing I Love kids but I was just kind of hard for us to talk about but I just I Am diametrically different from my opponent and an interest our philosophy of how we would approach a school board\nSo um I think I heard him say that the superintendent is\nHas well you know three rows of the school board which our policy their policy making and advising one minute um they also hires and are in charge of the superintendent and the business administrator\nAnd then they okay budgets right but one of the things that talked about [noise]\nI'm In the policy of the school board is the board will govern lawfully on behalf of students\nWith an emphasis on strategic leadership for the future and you're going to school district\nThat's my that's something I Know how to do strategic leadership onward vision outward vision with um with no personal agenda encouragement of diversity of viewpoints strategic leadership more than administrative detail so\nYou're not administrator and you're not micromanaging you're hiring the best people and you're letting them do their jobs and you're you're asking hard questions you're asking for accountability but you're not overreaching there's a clear distinction of the board and superintendents roles you collect it rather than individual decisions future thinking rather than past or present\nGoverning proactively rather than reactive Lee so thank you thank you\nThank you thank you for for coming in uh I you know I I've never seen anyone more organized than you or I or you're going to I guess I guess yes you do your to your home\nAnd she can I just say one last thing yes absolutely absolutely love the the districts core values

then then what can we look for in health care in the event that these guys these guys are talking about Democrats take control of the house in November\nOh my God well that try to put in Medicare for all and that's scary because they have a hundred and sixty three progressive Democrats that said that's what they want to do and that would be a disaster it may sound good but it would be a total disaster\nI understand I think it was a Bloomberg estimated the cost of this is something like thirty two trillion dollars over the course of the decade\nAnd so you could make it clear that was trillion trillion right but thirty trillion and that would get a national debt and into oblivion a national debt would be so big it'll bankrupt us the horrible horrible thing\nBut Dan Obamacare solve all our problems remember when Joe Biden said yeah it's a big deal I I thought it solve all our problems\nWell I'll tell you what Obama said you can keep your doctor if you want to and that was a lie this one here\nYou can't keep Medicare Bernays plan replaces Medicare itself\nWith Medicare for all the different kind of policy\nNot only that is twenty two million Americans people who have Medicare Advantage plans which are run by private companies and he would eliminate all of them that would be an increase for seniors this would hurt seniors especially and that's why a Mac is against Medicare for all\nWhen when you want to get say a left wing persons Jonah tightened Dan Weber asked him or her who's going to pay for it who's going to pay for who's going to pay for thirty two trillion

twenty two weeks that's how long it takes for a major surgery and Canada\nAfter they examined you may take months but you have been examined and now after they say yes you need this major surgery twenty two weeks average wait a lot of those people over the border and they get their operations in America\nThen wherever is my guest founder and CEO of a Mac ... association of mature American citizen now Dana probably mangled this guy's name but I Know the father of the Canadian health care system in Canada is named Claude Gaston way or something like that and he won that sounded a in Quebec and all the other promises ultimately adopted it\nHe still lives are as far as I Know in his nineties and he's come out and recently said that I was wrong we should have had more competition I should not have outlawed private care and he pronounced the healthcare system uh Internet in Canada pretty much a failure\nYeah yeah and well we just got to look at all socialize looking at a cute but they don't even have\nA aspirin available in the local drugstores look at Venezuela they socialize the medical care thinking doctors running too much and now the poor people literally dying and it's a shame socialism doesn't work because the socialism the individual means nothing\nAnd I'm often asked people this question whenever I have a discussion about the Canada Great Britain they have a socialized medicine Canada has a what I think Obama wants to have which is a single payer in Great Britain has something very similar but when you take polls the majority of citizens in both Canada and Great Britain seem to like their system why is that\nBecause if they get a sniffle they can go into a local clinic than they wait in line a long time but that go to the local climate gotta get

I mean while he was a country to prosper and he's he's black Americans no less white Americans you know the Asian American at one of the great American ... for when you look at Trump's approval ratings I mean I'm actually a little done because\nUm I think that black people look at some point they realized that a lot of racist bone in this guy's body\nIs outspoken and he actually leave while he was a country to prosper and he's he's black American no less white Americans Latino Asian American as part of the great American ... fall when you look at Trump's approval ratings I mean I'm actually a little done because\nRepublicans in general it's been that subtle breaking unprecedented in recent years and profit ... thirty\nMhm um what is your prediction didn't ask about the mid term first tell me about the house\nWell I'm not a not so much of it I wouldn't bet the ranch on this one my thought is that the the papal ... wave is going to Peter out\nOr that the Republicans will now likely ... public and well narrowly hold the house will make gains in the Senate an older man does you know re hope that the Democrats would pop all the Republicans and yeah we talked with a lot of opportunity I think that blown it\nI think didn't ask if that happens a twenty sixteen uh I don't think anything could could could match the devastation and uh as far as less is concerned about the election of Donald Trump's but this will be close if the Democrats don't get the house it's going to be close to election night back in twenty sixteen\nYet that isn't it only will raise the stakes are or the twenty twenty but they may very well made that jump safely get at least one more Supreme Court appointment\nI mean that would bring caught in the baggage that around but Larry we have not had the Supreme Court in our lifetime it the carrier fleet balance not to have a narrow five or ... or a completely different for to have six or eight\nMhm or the house the Senate\nAnd the Senate I think a number of races that looked to be very low for hanging in the balance of not fit for the rights and people who seemed at one point to be winning Democrat or an hour and the trouble of all I think that this is actually looking pretty good or Republican there's no reason to be over confident of court\nAnd the main thing of course for a while because we're like the important ... I think if the Republican turnout it's going to be a very good November\nMy guess is the ... death of a nation available right now and digital HD didn't ask this may sound like a bizarre question a Donald Trump has called people all sorts of names he's called a Robert De Niro low IQ Maxine Waters low IQ\nLion Ted or Pocahontas and on and on and on why hasn't the left come up with a name for him\nI think well they have and I think part of the problem with calling him name is that they think the ... awful and I mean I think what the left came up with Stormy Daniels they thought they had a they thought they had it because they thought here from he's a Republican\nThe Republican base is never going to put up with anything like that the Republicans are thought out and you're trying to modernize wiping their own and they were very confident that what happens is up with them the more they threw out strong for me the idea of like what else got\nA ... you have thirty of this madness then you're locked or word in the face of the kind of impact that would normally that Republican occurring for cover it puts them in a category of his own\nBut ... I Would have thought that Democrats would have gotten a bunch of consultants together and figured out a label a word a name a moniker they could put on Trump and because he does that for everybody else I'm just shocked they haven't done it\nA little bit fried I mean they were the orange heritage writer into their family if that can make fun of his kid they cite the factor late though the price

was the man that's the gator involved with this investigation\nAnd just to your listeners know our investigation McCaskill campaign showed\nMultiple staffers saying that uh that her and McCaskill on about his policies\nAre the same but quote people just can't know that uh other staffers talking about banning semi automatic rifles and the capital herself was caught on camera in the office talking to someone she thought worked for her\nSaying that there would be a gun than the sum type so the capital now just respond on local news in Missouri are claiming that the Republican candidate had something to do with this which he did not\nAnd um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nJames O'Keefe I looked at the video not only the the staffer talk about banning semi automatic rifles\nSome type so the capitals now just respond on local news in Missouri are claiming that the Republican Senate candidate had something to do with this which he did not and um but she's definitely on defense if you look at the uh a response that you just put out\nJames O'Keefe I looked at the video not only the the staff or talk about banning semi automatic rifles he talks about banning semi automatic firearms\nThat's right they're talking about handguns\nClara herself talks about um when she gets into the Senate will vote with so called Chuck Schumer

for the McCaskill campaign when asked if moderates will be upset once they do a bait and switch and they impeached Trump\nWhat the staffer says his quote get over it on club he's saying the moderate we'll just have to get over being lied to very devastating very powerful I mean maybe the most powerful undercover investigation we have ever done because it involves a sitting\nUS Senator has now responded to all of her staffers calling or wire\nHere is Claire McCaskill's response teams will do\nWell in some startling that Josh how I Would be part of fraudulently in betting somebody in my campaign\nUm he's the attorney general of the state of Missouri he's supposed to be going after fraud not participating in it and\nSo um there was nothing there I've been very upfront about all my

you just got to tell the people on the doors it is what it is\nI've made no secret that I think we can support the second amendment and universal background checks and banning bump stocks my gun record is out in the open for everyone to see what's really telling about this is how how far they're willing to go to ... somebody in my campaign\nUm that startling I've never seen that in a U.S

do with our investigative journalism I've never met him\nFor her to come out and say that he is part of Raj slowly and betting somebody that its walls and treated lie on local TV in Missouri second of all you saw her waffling and bumbling stumbling around through about guns her staff that she supports a semi automatic rifle but\nShe told her that she supports a ban on a ours those are her words so she's on defense you know and and it's a really amazing thing to see\nHer beyond defense and lie about me and I'm I'm ... I'm certain Larry what's gonna happen next to this this other Senate candidate John always going to say that he had nothing to do with it you can ever respond to that so I think were were cheating or goal of holding people accountable\nAnd I think that she's in a lose lose situation because it's not just one step which are workers paid campaign\nStaff saying that you are\nJosh Hawley is her Republican opponent a winner the whole thing right now and you know whether or not your video is getting the ... early\n... I'm not a pollster but I Believe it's tied I think it's forty five forty five and I think the ultimate measure of success is local media coverage that that is what if you are purchasing ads all this

that information to our enemies very very serious issue Sean\nWhat do you think Dr Gorka less work\nWe need to find that in America a lady justice do with a blindfold or Las Vegas and you've got to a committee of it really it\nReally is a double standard just reeks die having hum anyway congrats by the way of his brand new book why we buy debating America's enemies with no apologies\nUh I'd say that's something we really need to remember as a country um thank you both for being with us when we come back to the moon each Anthony Scaramucci we'll check in with us James O'Keefe his latest undercover video\nThe day after the midterm elections and you got the Minnesota Republican Party chairman\nYou know saying the ... not enough cope with the media were firing here you have one state representative Sarah Anderson is her name and Plymouth, Minnesota campaigning Sunday saw man kicking heard yard signs a daunting her and one thing other GOP candidates and she said please stop\nHe refused things an anarchist could do whatever they want the politician did what every red blooded American would do she tried to catch the incident on video\nAnd then the assailant was having none of that cursing gather backing or into the street and tell her to go kill yourself then walk to a nearby BP presumably to stop stock up on\nYou know whatever she does a mountain dew whatever it happens to be\nThe go to source or whatever but Anderson gave chase in her car the man in charge there to her again leaning through the window punching her\nYou know\nI I mean it's unbelievable\nAnd that's fine incident came two days after another House Republican candidate Shane neck one was punched in the face\nIn St George township northeast saying wow it's just campaigning in a bar in a restaurant with a larger guy approaches them described the conversation as Amy a bowl and so the guy literally and invoke the hallowed name of the middle class the man we can only assume didn't wish to hear another politician talking about whatever\nThe only punches the Republican in the face\nOh getting their faces oh a grade a crowd you know follow them\nInto a grocery stores gas stations department stores restaurants they're not wanted anywhere anymore\nAnthony Scaramucci is with us by the way next week he's got a great book I've been reading it I got an early copy but nominal and it's called the Trump the blue collar president uh I Know it's too early to talk about the book but you tell some amazing stories about who's really Donald Trump is where he came from and\nAnd his background and you know a whole story that the media is never told about him and I learned a lot reading it how are you my front\nUm you know Sean I'm doing great but you know your your your match you know a lot of very interesting things and one thing or you remember that the president he may hit hardest Sean a buddy always hit second and he often it's last I've never seen him unilaterally come after anyway it's\nNever told about him and I learned a lot reading it how are you my front\nUm you know Sean I'm doing great but you know you're you're you're mentioning a lot of very interesting things and one thing I always remember that the president he may hit hardest Sean a buddy always hits second and he often hits last I've never seen him unilaterally come after anybody\nIt's only after the attack him that he doubles down and starts to counter punch you know so\nElizabeth Warren attacking him he's ignoring her and then bam Pocahontas\nOr a Republican candidate in the primary Jackie and then he fires off the nickname you know so the the point being is that like he is actually a very civil guy until you start shooting at him then once you start shooting at him he's going to hit you with the full force and just sort of gives a very important distinction between what's going on between the Democrats\nAnd let me tell you you know I mean it's so funny because I remember a conversation once I had with the president and and\nYou were at the White House for a pretty short period of time and he he talked about you which is very interesting to me and he talked about well this Harvard Anthony and then there's the kids in the street and he and a and I know both I mean\nYou know he yelled at me he yelled at me after the cursing gotta remember like\nThe the guy Ryan Lizz have legs are total wire he basically\nSaid to me there's a call but then he's asking me to do a profile\nWith them and then that's when I responded with the exploit it but you know what that is what it is ... ... what the the president yelled at me he said hey man I Need less street Anthony I Need more Harvard Anthony but you know what ... what makes you great on the radio and and uh and the reason why we're so close to that we both have a little bit of that and I don't like when you were busing\n... when I was washing dishes bussing tables I was a cook yeah that's right but you know something a little bit and I wouldn't trade that experience in life for anything or the years I spent in construction which was two decades of my life and I don't know I mean I I think a lot of us it that\nAre blessed and lucky and successful I met too many people that forget what they come from and I'm not going to forget where I came from and I'm just style and so it's not in ...\nWell that's the point though that's the point in the books on I really do try to explain\nThat your story or my story is a classical American story or a where we were in these aspirational working class families in our parents wanted us to do better and they were fully bought into as where our grandparents into the American dream\nAnd so uh what the president is trying to do what you try to do every day what I tried to do in my small way to see if we can make that happen for people\nThat were similarly situated or currently ... similarly situated the way we were in the Nineteen sixties and seventies growing up and so that's one of the reasons why\nDespite getting far from the White House I never broke ranks are never broke my oil from the president because I really do believe this horse in the right place and I really believe that uh you know she is the right\nBut that was in line the proof is in the party\nI mean when you go to Robin eight years adding Thirteen million more Americans to food stamps eight million more poverty\nYou can't get three the only president never to get three percent GDP Growth the worst recovery since the forties and all of a sudden we got four point two percent for the second quarter the GDP Growth projections are way over four percent for the third quarter\nKnow now we have four million more Americans working eight million out of all for food stamps and out of poverty I'm thinking\nOkay finally the forgotten men and women ... the young Scaramucci's in Hannity's are now doing better why why why would we want to stop that\nI you know ... and I agree and it's going to get better because he's continuing to de layer the process of regulation\nOr he's continuing to find ways to incentivize corporations large and small to move their money back on shore of the United states I Know you talk a lot of that uh the re engineered now after the U.S MCA now\nUh Shaun I'm going through that you know I'm trained as an economist and I'm running an eleven and a half million dollar fund that I found it\nA that is going to have monumental positive benefits\nTo middle and lower middle class families\nThe re engineering of that trade agreement because it's just the configuration of the cars just the uh the manufacturing point and the price on labor or that's been agreed to in those agreements is going to mean more disposable income for working class family and by the way you know where was the establishment politicians\nThinking about those people over the twenty five years of NAFTA shock\nWell where where they know where I could break right back will continue more with Anthony Scaramucci\nOn the other side and your calls eight hundred nine four one Sean hey I've got the best home security system to protect your home your family the best the greatest in the industry

Bernie Sanders supporters so you know she really doesn't seem to be able to temper her rhetoric whatsoever and I think if you saw on Monday after the backlash of putting that video out\nA and she got a lot of backlash around the country including Democrats like David Axelrod even as critical or she went on a twenty six I Believe tweet a rant about Donald Trump just obsessed with Donald Trump and

country the Massachusetts is even lower it said three point five percent right now the warring wants to repeal the tax cuts of she does some Seventeen that if given our state's\nMore money as far as new jobs wage increases our states collected over one point two billion dollars in unanticipated revenue because of that she called the crumbs just like\nA Nancy Pelosi and that she if she had her way would undo that and raise your taxes I think she said fifty percent would be the baseline and she's not sure if she had Ninety percent might be too much when she was on a MSNBC\nA few weeks ago Ninety percent maybe too much but at least fifty percent and then of course\nShe wants to make it fully government run health care which as we know has a thirty two point six trillion dollar\nPrice tag attached to it and of course\nThat puts a bureaucrat between you and your doctor a if you like government run health care that you love having a you know to wait for a hip replacement Canadians do or dialysis like uh people\nThat do you think so many Canadians come to the United states when they need heart surgery but does that give better care that they're willing to pay for here that's why\nLike government has to ration health care if they take it over and by the way there is no incentive to drive down costs ones government becomes the guaranteed pay or just like student loans you know it was about foreign complains about the cost of college course she\nCharged three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to each one course at Harvard or like you know the fact is when government becomes the ... of the loans or whether it's\nA student assaults or not doesn't matter those colleges get their money and so they drive the costs that year after year after year when government gets involved and takes the free market out of it was competitiveness then that's when costs become completely out of control for us the average Americans\nWell I Wish you the best in this race and I hope our friends

a lot of people and there's a lot of fun and I think you know the fact that he's talking about positive results and that we're better off than we were two years ago it's a pretty good message why would the media want that when they were in the pockets of people that are slim solidly democratic solidly socialist left\nAbsolutely totally agree with you I think I think that would I think I'm doing that would be would bring people out of the woodwork though you know 'cause people people would watch it if you do to address to the nation just an idea\nWow I think it's a good one I like it

Michael Moore during his weekly general audience to know St Patrick's square now I don't know the pope who doesn't read current events doesn't read newspapers\nMaybe did know Michael Moore was and Michael Moore simply worked his way to the front and huddled with the pope is if he was having a meeting with Michael Moore is the left wing radical extremist he's a a contributor Planned Parenthood that kills about three thousand developing babies every day\nHe's a uh certainly an individual that does not reflect American values hard work perseverance fear of God love of country\nSo if the pope knowingly and winning league met with Michael Moore I got a problem with that because especially as abortion feelings but nonetheless until I find out if the pope knew who he was and it's hard to criticize him and secondly and lastly\nBig fight with a couple of weeks ago with Kevin always largely over\nBut I did some statistical work\nOn what was one with a cabin all Brett Kavanaugh and what lies ahead\nThe problem with that because especially as abortion feelings but nonetheless until I find out if the pope knew who he was and it's hard to criticize and then secondly and lastly big fight with a couple of weeks ago with Kevin always largely over\nBut I did some statistical work on what was one with a cabin all Brett Kavanaugh and what lies ahead the Supreme Court which I've not had the honor yet or repairing before takes about eighty cases a year\nAnd the nation's highest court decides another fifty cases without oral arguments general unanimously and they normally take cases where there's a conflict\nBetween the Thirteen circuits that is if the second circuit as a conflict with sex or the night with the seven they'll take a case to resolve the conflict but just keeping your mind eighty cases a year they take for oral arguments eighty cases here\nBy contrast the U.S circuit court of appeals handled fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two cases in a ... month period fifty one thousand eight hundred and thirty two compared to eighty\nSo if you throw on top of that the millions of cases and the ... district courts you're talking about maybe a million cases below\nThe U.S Supreme Court and the Supreme Court and handles eighty cases\nSo whether it's a hot button issues of immigration or gun control or or crime abortion whatever it might be\nThe the ... Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of those cases are decided at the ... circuit her district court level Ninety nine above nine nine nine nine percent so to break it down even further\nThere's Thirteen U.S Circuit court of appeals of the Thirteen eight are controlled by democratic appointed judges\nOnly four by Republican in one district is split and so the most important one is the U.S court of appeals for the district of Columbia which was the one Brett Kavanaugh came off of the Democratic appointees they're of a seven to three majority\nSeven three one vacancy is now available but that can be one of the stray so it was gonna say seven to three\nSo Ninety nine point nine nine percent of the federal cases\nAre resolved before the Supreme Court level and all those about Seventy percent are controlled by democratically appointed judges\nSo before you get too far it up about Brett Kavanaugh I Want you to hold those figures in your mind Supreme Court takes eighty cases U.S Circuit court of appeals handled fifty two thousand cases\nDistrict courts about a million and so the great majority of the action is well below the U.S Supreme Court even with Brett Kavanaugh they're the only hope we have is normal God fearing Americans\nAs for Trump to be an office another six years and if he stays in office six more years with the Republican Senate for all six years he may get as high as Fifteen Percent\nOf those appointed by Republican judges so that is the mountain ahead of us don't get too high don't get too low\nSo what I'm saying is if Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of the case it never gets U.S Supreme court\nAnd those that do generally deal with the conflicts whether Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch are there or not is certainly a great thing encourage more of it but it would take years and years of Republicans controlling the Senate and Trump controlling\nThe White House or parents after Trump to make any dent and the fact that about Seventy percent of the federal judges or appointed by Democrats and the way about thirty percent bother Republicans and the reason is the last two or three years of Bush forty three Chuck Schumer refused to do anything in the Senate he shut down completely\nAnd should two weeks from Tuesday\nThe Democrats when the U.S Senate which appears to be a pill at this point but should that happen he's going to shut it down again and they won't be any appointments for the last two years\nOf Trump's first term in office I said first term but let's continue with more fun becomes available away a few lines open to be a call now eight seven seven three one two three one one eight seven seven three one two three eight one one\nBill Cunningham the great American in for the great one Mars living [noise]\nListen to what David ask from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk\nAnd how much time and I have throughout the day and I was able to get a lot more work done ... absolutely right I truly love my ... and I know you will to trust me once you feel how much support the ex chair provide\nYou'll never want to sit in an ugly uncomfortable office chair again and your business owners ex chairs or the perfect investment that take the productivity of your entire team to the next level ... chairs on selling out for a one hundred dollars off go to ... dot com now that's extra L.

because they're they're the member grow that when you cannot live what you're saying what your own eyes and my final point\nFor you to hold on Cape assuming those things happen and and I certainly except they're true is not not nearly as bad as a few hundred Americans killed every year by illegal aliens how come we're focusing on that awful murder and not what's happening inside of our own country\nBecause reason why we're focusing on it because President Trump which I voted for planet down he's trying to change the narrative\nThe course\nOf course I asked that when I'm buying jets land parched Jeff came out that the Saudis fighter that deposit on dollars worth of weapons that they bought it from that\nAnd that's great that put a lot of people to work at Cape\n... there's ten thousand Americans killed every year inside of America do care about any of them went to investigate cage timely let's investigate about seven hundred murders in the south side of Chicago not so how about investigating those murders but they don't fit the political diatribe against Trump right\nNow I'm tall I'm telling you that that's the corruption other media women from wearing that's against some but not just like some officers that just got killed about an hour ago and Kurdish hiking on ice if we're not require that in the U.S when it's on top one percent on your side we get me to get\nLet's investigate that how come the murder of Assad citizen in Turkey is such a big deal here why\nBecause way complicit with\nThem or not ... we're not complicit were crap we're not complicit with anything come on man come on and we're not to see you are you one\nOf those characters whatever bad happens in the world America's complicit what does that mean complacent what does that mean while still but was it for the sides to kill them in that fashion almost on videotape that was stupid that was real stupid and I hope we're not stupid but even if it happened the way we think it happened\nFrankly my dear I don't give a damn compared to what's happening in this country every year\nHow many times are killed two hundred cubs are murdering every year in this country that CNN go into the murder of police officers and why that's a horrible thing how can CNN when I covered the murder comes but they're covering some sun citizen in Turkey why\nI totally agree with you just like we have three hundred and Seventy five thousand abortions every year I'll tell you I'm totally rich\nNo big deal and what they're just using this as a country will there be trumping the head with his if we care and I don't care compared to the murder of cobs\nThe murder of the innocence ten thousand murders cage timely hundreds of Americans killed by illegal aliens rapes in robberies how 'bout investigating and those things that make sense\nIt makes perfect sense that the way while still investigating the Saudis are blowing up innocent children and that's when it gets a bath with us made weapons said wouldn't have done that so complex that\nYou you mean in Yemen bucks just got killed just got by weapons with Saudi Arabia so\nWait a minute he said you're saying we're complicit in that too because we sold a weapon as somebody Smith in West complicit in one of their weapons kills somebody\nWhile they're coming under\nFire bombing of course country in the middle east with weapons\nComplex than in any of that in his parental complicit have one of their weapons is used to wrongfully killed somebody is Peretti complicit\nFor a lot of money is the root of all evil\nKeith you're out of here thanks for your call\nHope the Dodgers lose this afternoon but let's continue with more we're going to go to Chris in Atlanta Georgia Chris in Atlanta Welcome to the ... show and Chris please go ahead Chris how are you I'm doing well are you a great day to be an American please go ahead\nAmen to that so just a quick question you mentioned earlier about um [noise] I don't I Can't paraphrase what you said about the pope specifically about him being a crisis or what have you on earth I have a problem with that meeting with Michael or hell yeah\nOkay well I mean just just out of curiosity I mean I'm just playing devil's advocate for this so I'm I have an issue with it too but um if if we believe because I'm I'm Catholic so I Believe in the price just to Christ man with with centers um what what is your what is your what's your\nHow I agree with that to Chris but it didn't go I don't think Michael\nMoore went there to get the pope on video talking to him as if he was a center wanting to be confessing to and receiving grades from the pope I think Michael Moore went there and it's a huge to capture the pope in a moment that he could use for his own political purposes\nAgainst Trump and Michael Moore has had some ... sources like pulling the road do a Damascus and said okay I've seen the era my waves I've seen the damage caused the police officers in American Soldiers\nI see the damages caused by three thousand innocent babies killed every day in this country and I'm going to the pope for forgiveness for what I've done I'm with you but I think Michael Moore probably went there with the pope today in order to get a photo op to use politically against him that's what I think\nI I I agree wholeheartedly with you with that now it just out of curiosity you not feel that um maybe he already knows the Michael Moore is maybe no personal agenda is background um\nWell you know Chris the pope is given interviews in which he says he does not read newspapers\nIs not watch TV and he came from Argentina now in the room and we like to think in America we're the only country that matters but I guess if you spend your life and Argentina Brazil in Central America South America now your living room you probably don't read newspapers or watch TV\nHow ... how would you know Michael Morris and so I you know I guess I could work my way to the front of the line and get a picture with the pope but I Would like to think that Michael Moore is not one of those characters the pope would be familiar with and if he was I Would hope Michael Moore was able to convince the confessed as many sins\nI'm absolutely I I think the pope knows more about people then maybe we can give him credit for that um I just 'cause I I there there's a little bit about him that strikes me as odd and um you know I like to be supportive of the uh\nIt was I Would hope Michael Moore was able to convince to confess as many sense\nSure absolutely\nI think about people maybe give him credit or just a little bit about him that strikes me as\nYou know I like to be supportive there's there are there are a lot of things that really strikes me odd to me it's not it's not surprising when\nIt's\nReally hard to know question he is not the last pope no he's not Benedict he's Francis and he's a socialist he's left wing er and er\nAnd its whole a priest lake scandal was something that I Hope it's not up to his eyeballs in it from uh South America and I hope he's clean but do what he did with Medicare and what he did with the world doesn't excite me too much and um\nAnd I just hope there is no there there are what Chris we gotta go thanks for your call let's continue now calls from Texas Virginia New York coming up and about forty five minutes I spent some
