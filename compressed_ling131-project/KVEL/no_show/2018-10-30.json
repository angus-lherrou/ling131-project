but I Do know politics and government and I do know that we keep jumping over our guard rails which what the left and the Democrats and the media do when you find someone guilty without corroborating witnesses\nOr you go back to high school to examine teenage ...\nOr ... people you disagree with their free speech\nOr when our press leaves their objectivity behind and adopts the agenda one of the parties they agree with\nSo I Want to follow up with what I began with when I filled in on the Larry Elder show on friday\nWe started with comments about the would be bomber's arrest I don't want to use his name to give them any publicity but how the media have used that to pile on President Trump held a along with the Democrats and the left all all the same thing these days\nTo claim that President Trump has created the atmosphere if not worse to encourage acts like it would be bomber\nNone of them like to see what Michael Moore suggested this last weekend as a quote the threat of right wing violence against figures on the American left is not new is not an aberration is not a violation of norms it is the norm watches river and Murdoch's Fox News channel and right wing radio there we are\nHave preyed upon those who've seen their American Dream go up and smoke\nAnd they have helped to create a generation of angry that's what you guys are angry and violin conspiracy theorists who believe any live is perpetuated on those airwaves these angry right wing manned oh ... really focusing [laughter] have been openly\nOr hopefully encouraged to act on those lies I guess he met openly encourage people to act on those lives even as late as this very morning when Trump was tweeting his doubts that the bombs were real\nSo that's just one example that the president tweeted the bombs may not be real\nSince no one was killed I gotta admit for thought crossed my mind too that maybe you know the bomber didn't want to kill anybody who knows the bombs may have been threatening but it's not an outrageous says he wants to make it and why what's he gonna while conspiracies on the right\nName some real ones of course not they never named him and how the left wing conspiracy that dawned on me perpetuated by left wing channels what about that nine eleven never happened and that George Bush created it\nOr this this is one you may be familiar with that President Trump polluted with the Russians you've spent two years and that one and as far as I Know it's still cold\nAnd President Trump was guilty of inciting the pipe bomber right that's the reason one or yeah as we said I Believe it or not in the horrific attack on the Jewish temple\nAnd their unchallenged even on right wing Fox so here he's picking on Fox not that I Want to defend them was former Obama official claim yeah that's what I looted to the President Trump's rhetorical helped lead to an environment in which the temple murder operate I think he was an assistant sectors said I wasn't anybody famous\nOf course the president create an anti Semite or encourage them to create a tax or violence even though his grandchildren are Orthodox Jews and the murder made it clear he was anti Trump\nThe media will never give up on their agenda to blame him for everything bad that occurs and that the president's attacks on the media would not only fostering such a climate where unjustified see at Fox News hosts like Shepard Smith well you know what side he's on and even Chris Wallace in some ways joining that course\nAnd what some of them site is proof\nThe chance of lock her up the phrase fake media Oregon worse for them the enemy of the people so let me address these issues by by the way to count me in the crowd that crop first\nBecause it's a legitimate conversation to decide whether or not Hillary Clinton is above the law and should be charged and tried for the crimes she committed in fact when I suggested on another national show whereas I was filling in for the week\nThat I'd be willing to give her a pass I felt this way I'll give her a pass on jail if she in the bill would agree to go away and leave us alone\nWhich obviously they would never do that [laughter] I was being facetious I wouldn't be willing so to speak to let sleeping dogs live so one called challenge for me and said I I Can't believe you mark I agree with everything you're saying as usually you often get that\nBut you're suggesting that Hillary's above the law and she should get away with her crimes and I have to admit his challenge was more than fair and I couldn't really answer me except for what I kind of thought of afterwards it might be good\nFor the sake of the country not to put everyone through such a trial\nCan you imagine the outcry and the further divisiveness if that's even possible mature that might bring to the country but that doesn't change the fact that it's a ... legitimate discussion to have about whether she should be tried for crimes especially since you got a free pass\nAnd we've now found out through the corruption at the highest levels of the state department and the FBI\nSo she really was never held accountable for her actions and the price to lock her up represent the Irish people feel that she was given a pass and appears to be above the law\nNot unlike her husband who didn't go to jail for lying under oath of course the press doesn't do that they made it into you know he had this affair with an intern so because of sex that's why people want them to go to jail no he lied under oath you don't have a system in in court if you can get away with lying under oath\nAnd the idea of EPA's one set of rules for the Clintons and another set for the rest of us so lock her up he's not by any means and incitement to violence\nThe other charge that President Trump calls the media the fake media and they get especially in order to what the charge that they are the enemy that people there'd be on the media is beyond outrage they really get on their high horse for that one and there are beyond offended\nBut it's also legitimate\nThe press not infrequently comes out with stories that are not true the latest example here this one NBC was hiding spoke authority evidence in reference to the charges by Julie sweat Nick and her sleazy porn lawyer\nThat's Tucker Carlson is named for him and it's it's a cute one is a good one\nIt seems NBC

possible to have an armed guard in a synagogue\n... what do you mean it's not possible to have an armed guard in a in a in a synagogue\nAnd of course normal people know if you have an armed guard in a synagogue the people in the synagogue have a fighting chance against a madman who walks in with guns blazing\nThis isn't even an argument the president said it cut number eight he went to his rally in ah\nOr was he he was in uh Illinois Campaign rally in Illinois and he talked about a very common sense response to this kind of evil cut number eight from a audio from NBC and gravy and\nThis is a case where they had an armed guard inside they might have been able to stop him immediately so this would be a case for if there was an armed guard inside several\nThey would have been able to stop it

order to do that you gotta work constructively what the Trump Administration because a lot of that state federal partnership I'll be able to do that you'll I'm wants to impeach track so I don't know

ends up getting indicted I've never seen anything like it in my life\nSo corrupt Sean each side so corrupt\nThat these calls and I'm looking at the times website or live Pauline I don't think that it ... I think that it's cute based on who's you know answering the phone don't want it to Pennsylvania one on my computer right now on the extreme than going in a district first focus on just on there\nWas no one answer is no one else as all skewed towards down close to Philadelphia I put ... ... [noise] I\nI'm not sure exactly what you say explain that again do you think the ... or an accurate I agree OK\nYeah and I think it's just based on results are 'cause a lot of the stripper parts of the first is a most Republican voters in the northern stuck or such right\nOn the border whether you are right\nRight I Want to answer the phone after it's all students towards the bottom towards Philadelphia\nOh that's a big mistake I think on the Pennsylvania Republican parties part um we had a congressman on earlier this week from Lehigh Valley and\nYou know look at every ... here's the bottom line it doesn't matter where you live I we are putting some importance on some of these New York races Minnesota raises California races but the bottom line is all four hundred and thirty five members of Congress are up for reelection\nWell we need a majority but it doesn't have to be a big majority but if you can win the majority and pick up the Senate seats I think we can pick up hold the Senate seats that need to be held then it could be a very good night one week from now\nBut I Am telling everybody if in my opinion right now Republicans plus three for the Senate they add three senators but I also would say that in the house I'd say it's probably on paper looking if poll paper and I'm hesitant to say this but\nIt was analyzing the races analyzing all of the new candidates you know forty five retirements in this time um I Would say it's ... it's it's probably plus five maybe ten Democrat with a toss up because\nRight now the Democrats have two hundred and five locked in races for the house the Republicans two hundred and now the problem is the toss ups are almost all Republicans so you're gonna have to run the table on those we put all that information the most important in the top thirty that we picked then identified it's easily you know\nYou can find it easily and Hannity dot com\nSo I don't know I'm looking at it I made like a toss up right now my computer I'm a toss up that I I have it with a toss up on three look eat one Ninety two but a lot of seats Shawn\nFrom ... in the most important the top thirty that we've picked then identified as easily you know you can find it easily have Hannity dot com\nYeah so I don't know I'm looking at it I made like a toss up right now Michael I'm a toss up that I think I was a toss up on and you look in one way but a lot of fun\nYeah look let me give me one anecdotal piece of evidence we know one twenty sixteen at the exit polls show and all the polls leading up to the election show Donald Trump wasn't gonna win\nAnd the exit polls came out of five Fifteen and it said he lost everything Florida gone North Carolina gone Ohio Pennsylvania and Michigan or Wisconsin gone and the same thing happened to two thousand and four five Fifteen the media was ready to declare John Kerry the next president thank God that didn't happen\nOr in a midterm if we go back remember twenty fourteen it was for cast as a close Senate race but the GOP one nine Senate seat\nI mean they were wrong so I'm I say this with caution caution you know probably the best thing people can do is realize\nThat if you don't want Nancy Pelosi speaker if you don't want Chuck Schumer to be the Senate majority leader then just go vote and do all you can do and your power at the end of the day will deal with whatever mess if we get one that we're gonna have to deal with\nYou know there are three outcomes on Tuesday night one week from today one of those Republicans gained seats in the Senate hold the house that's the best case scenario one is a split decision\nThey gain seats in the Senate they lose the house Nancy Pelosi speaker the worst case scenario it's Speaker Pelosi Senate majority leader Schumer so you know we have the power to make that not happen\nRight now the ... it all matters whether or not you're going to motivate your friends whether you're going to get to the polls whether you like the progress\nDo you think you're better off than you or two years ago all the important issues we talk about you know what it matters or going to have two years of endless investigations possible impeachment we're going to the rescinding of our tax cuts by the Democrats\nAre we going to have open borders sanctuary cities eliminate ice a and keep Obamacare every everybody as I mentioned earlier is running against running on healthcare on the Democratic side I'm like you're the same people that ruin the health care system with three big wise keep your doctor keep your plan and pay less\nSo my advice is you know let's go out there and everybody fight hard if everybody does their part\nIf everybody listening to my voice goes out and vote and if you understand the vote for any House Democrats to vote for polo see any Democratic Senate voters a boat for sure that we should have a pretty good night a week from now\nBut the best part is that we live in a country where you get to decide that where every American now has the power to decide\nAnyway um I Hope that's helpful eight hundred nine four one Sean toll free telephone number you want to be a part of the program we're going to get a

talked to I went to Arizona and I talked to snow or I knocked on the door and\nAt the microphone out in the open and and and not talk to me for thirty seconds and said that what she said was glib but she stands by her comments so ... these senators are now lying about\nNot not only they lying about what they have to do to collect it but they're lying after they're caught denying these people even work for them it it's it's just crazy the reactions of these people that are going to govern us\nIt really is it's absolutely nuts uh All right the next big question I always ask is there more to come\n[noise] yeah yeah there is in tomorrow actually um so\nAre we always Sean we're going from state to state here it's it's it's pretty easy pickings actually when there's such a huge a difference between who you project yourself and ... who you actually are and how you intend to govern so we're we're going to release another one tomorrow\nIs it have to do with the U.S Senate again\nWhat is what has to do with the Senate and the governor's race and uh and as that may weren't going to Florida [laughter] you know after you have to find out tomorrow\nYou are you laughing because I'm right or you're laughing because I mean who would have been smart\nYou you're you're you're maybe or maybe all of the above\nMaybe maybe all the above a well listen I think these are having a big impact clearly the local markets now picking up and all these cases um and would you think of suing when there is a libel made against you\nI said to decision to my lawyers are are talking about because this is getting out of control fraud I'm a criminal ah when if you look at history people have done this everywhere all the\nTime and won Pulitzer is and and it's done by everyone over the last hundred years I I have to figure out what I'm going to do here I think at some point there is going to be a change people are getting used to these techniques and we're going to live in a society where it's more\nAnd Donald Trump's even though the guy that shot up the synagogue is hated Donald Trump\nFor being so supportive of Israel let's not let facts\nGet in a way of a good propaganda lie in an election year well anyway Republicans now are beginning to listen and not only are they listening to the fact that repeal has to happen but also direct primary care or what I call concierge care for every American that that this is now gaining momentum\nAnd I've had conversations with numerous members of Congress in the Senate as we move forward and there are a couple of plans that are percolating one would be block granting money to states so that they can become\nYou know the fifty outlets of of new innovative\nMedicine and they'll turn over every penny because their political futures will be dependent on it which would be a good thing Gavin Newsom wants universal free care for everyone gets X number of dollars good luck with that but in states red states would smart governors or it can be a lot different\nAnd a lot better you know we we often go to the case of health care savings accounts and that it would be your only count you manage every year and set of eyes yearly checkup and your younger years you're building up money it's your money\nBut when you get older you really get sick that money that account is built up a fortune and you couple that with catastrophic hair fairly inexpensive\nDepending on what your doctor bowl is you know you could pay as low as a hundred bucks a year and get a great catastrophic plan if you have a heart attack cancer or have a bad accident but anyway the health care cooperatives of Dr Josh ... has been a pet project on this program of ours now for years\nAnd he joined us atlas MD Wichita, Kansas he joins us with Dr Lee as gross and he's the president for doctors for patient care foundation a thank you both for being with us Dr Robert just to remind people I I Lived in Wichita\nI could walk into your office pay you fifty bucks a month I get unlimited care twenty four seven I get a Ninety five percent reduction in all of my prescription medicine costs and my kids get unlimited care for ten bucks a month is that true\nThat's very uh every American could have ... level direct care just like you know how important people like Sean Hannity um yeah I don't think people under stand just how important this election is um we see how divisive DC as we see how much infighting there is ... and we don't want those people managing our health care\nEvery American deserves Affordable Care and the director model says\nManager for a penny a pill labs for two or three dollars unlimited visits no copay brief procedures we can fix is we can um work with employers and redesign insurance plans to decrease savings their premiums by thirty to sixty percent we can do that but we need Republicans in office\nAllowing the free market to function because if we go back towards a and Affordable Care act style Medicare for all it would decrease our ability to really you know innovate in a way that is meaningful for patient and more importantly\nShot you know we're looking at a vision right now we have two completely different visions on healthcare future one is a completely government controlled socialized medicine or you're gonna inserts that government between patients and their doctors\nOr you think of the cabin out here you know that's how the ... at the same government that's going to control your health care or you have another position that his health care for each of the freedom of choice between you and your physician\nAre worth your decisions are not being made\nBy by the government and so you know while direct primary care is is not a partisan solution it is a solution that has been embraced by most Republicans that are running including or just saying this is running for governor in the state of Florida he is a race this weekend which has put this in his you know to direct\nPrimary care and his platform or so this is definitely a platform that Republicans are supporting so if you want freedom this is definitely the visual for him\nI mean the thing is it's almost mind numbing to me and you know what you're right Dr Josh I have friends of mine that are doctors and because it's not because I pay them to be on it but I could pay them I mean I I Do pay them in other ways and thanked them when they do favors for me but\nUm I I Will tell you that I can make a call at three o'clock in the morning any day and get a doctor's care and get a doctor's recommendation\nAnd then and you know what if every American white a white only a few Americans deserve that or they ended up going to the stock\nIn the box places and I'm not now playing them like I'm sure they play a vital role in certain towns and communities but I don't think it's ideal because I think most people pick a doctor because they like and trust that individual and know that that person knows who they are and knows their medical background that's important to\nYou and everybody should be able to choose that and I think that goes back to what Dr gross is saying about this is a referendum on freedom and we want freedom in our schools in our homes and all that kind of important decisions we make but then we we've been you're missing that level of freedom when it comes to the most important decisions in health care\nSo this really is a crucial step in history where we can say look the free market can do this better than the government's been doing it people aren't happy with health care system now and the Mets are ten dollars a pill we we want freedom and health care we want choice the direct care model\nAllows you know every man woman and child preexisting conditions or not to get incredibly high quality care in an affordable way\nI'm Sean ... are you know it shouldn't be of course\nI ... you know in our practice we have not raised our prices in eight years we've heard sixty dollars a month for eight years for unlimited primary care services are X rays are twenty five dollars are MRI's or two hundred and twenty dollars these are all affordable\nTen dollars a pill ... we we want freedom and health care we want choice do direct care model allows you know every man woman and child preexisting conditions or not to get incredibly high quality care in an affordable way I'm Sean ... the cars you know it shouldn't be of\nCourse I ... you know in our practice we have not raised our prices and eight years we've turned sixty dollars a month for eight years for unlimited primary care services\nAre X rays are twenty five dollars are in our eyes are two hundred and twenty dollars these are all affordable so pre existing no pre existing condition the question is can you actually\nAfford to get the care unique by the doctor you need when you need a and these direct care solutions getting the government out of the middle of this relationship can actually do that so you need to embrace of the people that are running for office that support for freedom in health care\nYou know it seems that you know it's so simple and so basic and so fundamental and this is where I got frustrated with Republicans 'cause they've promised repeal replace\nAnd they weren't ready for the moment there's no doubt about it now to the president's credit\nHe got rid of the individual mandate but that's only a first step in if every Democrat is going to go out there and say well we're gonna have we're gonna have better health care options for the American people but\nIn many cases that the very same people that gave us the failure of Obamacare when you're offering a health care cooperative model you've duplicated down how many practices across the country doctor remember\nWe've helped over five hundred and fifty practices get launched because over a thousand growing every day I'm you know we had a twenty practices started last month alone that's a new practice every business day\nOr the other hand you have any direct access that every individual twenty four seven direct access to a doctor there are no pre existing condition prejudice at all these practices exactly have you can afford a cell phone you can afford direct patient care primary care\nThere is no insurance except you probably would want a couple the direct care with like a catastrophic plan which is fairly inexpensive owners\nHave car insurance for the big stuff but I think you know appointed goes unmentioned is the fact that these insurance premiums are going up twenty thirty percent every year when Dr Lee and I never raised her prices is is killing the economy it's killing jobs it's taking\nGood I'm not trying to be known as the but are you making at fifty bucks a patient I'm I I I make a monthly you making any money\n[laughter] that's what we're going to be married and has been acquired yeah yeah I mean this has\nNot been acquired by the big boxes you know we're able to keep the practices afloat or able to drive interest in primary care were able to treat people in the rural communities these practices are in inner city there are critical access hospital are critical access communities in suburban and urban setting a and it's\nWorse than what they say poor people in America people we defined as poor or lower income they can pay fifty bucks a month and they can get a hold are you twenty four seven and if they needed Z pack they're going to walk out with a Z pack and pay above the Z pack\n... yet they should be able to get I think about it the poor and ... the more you need a model like this\nMIT did a study on Oregon's Medicaid system in only twenty cents on the dollar cut to the recipient don't believe either have a a functioning current car insurance gas money to get to the doctor if you're poor you can texture doctor you can email you can call them you don't have to leave the house necessarily because the doctors\nAre and how many patients you have a we have about six to seven hundred per doctor\nOkay so what what we had ... and I was just like those practices and probably most of your patients like me I really don't want to see you unless I really need you\nUnless I'm saying hello or you know saying let's go fishing together hum because most people will drive but there's probably at least ten patients of every practice when they're calling me every day I'm assuming\nWe we have our high utilizes and our last year\nWe had her high we have our high utilize there's a we have a few pains and they asked that never stop you know we factor that and I'm On the part\nOf the program we have doctors coming from a three hundred and fifty doctors from forty one states descending on our land do this weekend to attend the conference to learn how to set up their practices after that so you know with over a thousand practices nationwide already practicing the director model\nOur looking increase that just by thirty percent with one conference alone or the interest as massive will keep growing and as long as we put policies in place at the state and federal level they continue to allow these practices to grow and blossom or you'll see this moving moving all across the country are getting better access better care for their cost\nOf a sudden I got to tell you any Democrat that is telling you anything about health care that's out now is they're talking point we're offering health care a ... and Republicans will take you take care of preexisting conditions that

seven three one free a one one I Want to [noise] first described to you\n\nThe extent to which Jim Acosta is not a news man\nFor the heck not a news man but I\nKnow he tweeted out and I paraphrase that the president United States is well aware that he cannot change the fourteenth amendment of the constitution a hundred and fifty years of interpretation\nBy executive order and he's doing this\nFor political reasons to divide the country and blah blah blah first of all the president didn't bring this up\nThe reporters interviewing him brought it up let me repeat this is an important factor Jim Acosta ignores intentionally the president didn't bring it up\nThe reporters interviewing him brought it up number one number two it has not been\nThe interpretation of the fourteenth amendment for a hundred and fifty years\n\nIt had never been the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment\n\nIt hasn't been interpreted that way yet by the United States Supreme court the fact of the matter is the bureaucracy disparate parts of the bureaucracy and then the bureaucracy generally began interpreting that way in the Nineteen sixties there's no statutory\nBasis for this there is no\nConstitutional basis for this we know what the author of the amendments said it's a black and white we know what the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee said it's a black and white I read it I reported on it I'd written about it\n\nHad nothing to do with this subject as a matter of fact the author of the amendment that man who drafted it\n\nAnd the supporters of the civil rights act the time made it clear they didn't exempted foreigners and aliens and so forth which is rational so when you're preparing the constitution people's like rocket attacks look what it said you look at the tax the context of what the people who wrote it meant that certain originalist\n\nNow for the left they could care less they pour everything they wanted the fourteenth amendment so they don't matter but the media which of course is on the left but it's not supposed to be to be showing\nA highly trained technicians Hannah courteous\nHelpful staff to get your insurance paperwork rude to project its dance body shop in ... if you've been in an accident calls than seven eight nine sixty seven eight feet [noise]\nHave you ever thought about the word education will it means to lead forth the word fourth raises another question which way is fourth\nHow do you know you're going in the right direction the easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go well my friend Dr Larry on President of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that\nAnd that they've been taught to say that but you and I both know that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College\nAnd his fourth how do you know you're going in the right direction easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go well my friend Dr Larry on President of Hillsdale College says young people almost always saying that\nAnd that they've been taught to say that but you and I both know that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College\nAnd Hillsdale they understand the true education means pursuing the highest answer to that question which way is force Hillsdale students are challenged to discover the right way for my reading the greatest books by the greatest minds in history\nAnd they learn the meaning of the three ultimate and related things the good the true and the beautiful and I encourage all of you all of my listeners to learn more about this remarkable institution ... for Hillsdale dot com that's L. E. V. I. N. for Hillsdale dot com\nAnd used for something completely different [laughter] his own review [noise]\nIt's a pleasure to have John games on the program is the Republican nominee for the United States Senate\nIn Michigan or the election is next Tuesday a week from now but I just uh Mr james it's an honor to have you on the program thank you\nFor having me on that side of Twitter um is there early voting in Michigan\nUh we have absentee ballot him but ah but no early voting that would make you know in other states\nAll right so it's a very important that people get out on election day in Michigan tell us about your race but the key issues are in your opponent to\nOf course well out the key thing about this race we have the opportunity to boot ... forward I'm a combat veteran a wire veteran West Point graduate or who served in Iraq and Operation Iraqi freedom of seven ... seven hundred and fifty hours combat\nOr over there and I came back to grow my family's business I'm fro thirty five million a hundred and thirty seven million but most importantly created a hundred jobs in Michigan and around the country I Believe that having experienced a in combat helped me to understand national security\nI'm In a way that my opponent can't and understand veterans' issues in a way that my opponent has failed to but also a business standpoint understanding how to grow our economy but also create economic opportunity for people who have been fail for decades\nMy opponent is a forty year career politician who spent Twenty years in Washington in Eighteen years as a senator and in that Eighteen years she's only accomplish getting five her co sponsored bills into law three of which actually named buildings I I truly believe that we have folks in Washington or legislating regulator teachers are not going to be a part of\nAnd this will not change until until we stand up and take our government back\nThat's amazing how long has she been in the Senate she's been in the center for Eighteen years and she's been in state government forever to right\nYes she was actually I'm a first elected a forty three years ago in Nineteen Seventy five one nasty year the year ... officially ended yet a number of weeks ago she stood in front of a veteran service organization\nAnd said that she was unaware of veterans issues that they weren't all her radar screen we have been at war for over a decade and a half and we still haven't welcome to Vietnam veterans back properly and this didn't make it on her priority list that's unacceptable\nI get to Washington I'm going to make sure that we prioritize our veterans that we prioritize healthcare would prioritize education to make sure that everybody has access to the American dream\nNow your website is John James for Senate dot com so if people want to contribute to your campaign all over the country and people in Michigan want to get involved in the last week the campaign they go to John James for Senate dot com correct\nThat's right they can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter at jobs and and I mean let me tell you I'm\nThis racism play with my candidacy out when we first started out we were twenty three points out and as of last by six points down but as we all know the liberals have done a wonderful job\nOf shaming people or bullying people and to not expressing their opinions and so given the fact that straight ticket voting is not no longer allowed in Michigan and the fact that conservatives don't poll we vote I Believe that we even closer than that um the last quarter we always gotta be Stabenow\nThree point six million are three point six million to her one point eight\nOf ... up there and between October first\nAnd October seventeenth because of uh of your listeners in some very staple grassroots army um folks were on the state and around the country we raised two million dollars to her a four hundred and Seventy one thousand we have the momentum and his race and uh by your help and assistance that we're going to win this thing under six\nTelling me yeah tell me about the the two or three or four issues that you think are paramount\nUh well I I mentioned them a veterans' issues I Believe there are veterans are facing\nAnd let me let me let me address it this way economically the president seems to be doing the the right thing your your opponent opposed the tax cuts I assume you would have supported them\nAbsolutely your opponent\nSupports a massive bureaucracy with massive regulations without a legislative authority from Congress that that affects Democrats or Republicans and every kind of business whether it's car manufacturing or small businesses I assume you support the the direction in which the administration is going\nAbsolutely and this is part of the problem of right now or you have people in Washington like Debbie Stabenow who are trying to legislate a ... legislate industries they never run a business before and right now the over burdensome regulation the over taxation\nIs creating a environments that are actually shipping jobs off\nOr to to places like China and Mexico and turkey a and then selling those goods into compete with us or that they're going to be a that that the that the administration is now correcting I Believe that by supporting a pro business environment it helps to ... bring all ship stuff\nAnd the folks like Senator stabbed now not only failed to vote for the tax cuts in jobs that that also created opportunities owns a in rural and urban areas around the country but she's also voted to raise our taxes\nHundreds of times over the past Eighteen years she's not a a friend of business she's not afraid of economic growth\nAnd I'll tell you a she supports the socialist\nI'm a agenda that will bankrupt our children's future\nAnd you and she goes back to Michigan\nAnd she tries to appeal to Republicans independence blue collar workers by by doing this I'm a moderate centrist I can work with the other side but she's hardcore left than she votes for Schumer to be ah the leader of the Democrats and she votes against Kavanaugh she basically is a reliable left wing vote correct\nA marker is even worse than that uh according to them is now a ... happened now despite all of her ah some bipartisanship is a buzzword is the sixty ninth most bipartisan senator in the United States Senate that puts her more liberal than Elizabeth Warren\nDebbie Stabenow is more liberal than Elizabeth Warren and she supports things that are that many people in the state a state that Donald Trump won\nAbsolutely find reprehensible a lot of cases as soon as that but I was not bipartisan in fact she posts construction one Ninety five percent of the time and Hillary Clinton Ninety three percent of the time and that's a solid a as a New York's ... that's a failure in leadership she does not represent Michigan She presents\nAs she supports the that that that many people in the state a state that Donald Trump won\nAbsolutely find reprehensible a lot of cases are stepping out not bipartisan in fact she goes construction or Ninety five for the time and Hillary Clinton Ninety percent of the time and effort solid isn't New York's ... leadership she does not represent Michigan She represents New York and that needs to change and the ...\nHave you been interviewed much by big media by\nNBC ABC CBS have you been interviewed much by CNN or MSNBC\nNo um I've uh I've been interviewed by a by Fox and the and a bunch of local area of a local station here um but um but I bet that's kind of indicative of the situation with them about\nThe eight rooms and Andrew Gillum are talking about their first but uh when you talk about the uh the first a Republican or the first ... the first African Americans that are in the state of Michigan in order to hurt the sixties\nUm you you hear cricket I'm from ah from the uh the the liberal or progressive media\nUh we we really are just praying hard and working hard getting or out there and as I mentioned uh our fundraising and our uh our polling numbers up have this race and play I think we're going to shock a lot of people on the books that I Want all the\nPeople listening to this program all over and we're all over the state of Michigan while you're living I sat there please go to John James for Senate dot com and get what you can give to

terrific I Wish you all the best ... and God Bless you to come on folks come on Michigan let's do it\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a capsule\nI spent years studying how to make this the best I didn't make this because I wanted to make a company other companies are starting to catch on to this than I buy every single other product that comes out so I can look at it and see it in tested and I fear that people will buy some some counterfeit\nAnd take it for a couple of months and go as much crap doesn't work don't be fooled this is the real stuff we have absolutely the best process and I can say that because we purchase every single one and check them out\nThis is once again another illustration of how low\nThe media have become in this country in the aggregate what their group thing\n\nThe rabbi of the synagogue where the slaughter occurred had to push back on our son counter rada on CNN who was begging him to trash Trump another congregants congregate from the synagogue had a\nPushback against saying dream metro MSNBC begging him to trash truck\nI'd never seen such just pick 'em up conduct in my life these people these so called journalists\nHave ice water and their veins\nIf they gave a damn about the current events that took place they wouldn't get themselves this way\nAnd their political opportunists\nOnce something not who likes Bernie Sanders a shooting at Republicans critically wanting one nobody blames Bernie Sanders in the media wasn't rice in is being sent that Trump Trump's kids\n\nThat people in this administration to Republican senators we don't want to hear all that's why the town from about the Democrats from the media when I hear it\n\nAnd yet here we have a man is slaughtered eleven human beings\nWho hate Jews and hatred and you know that\nThe media Jim Acosta Andrea Mitchell Alison camaraderie Chris Cuomo Don Lemon and all the rest of them Jake Tapper you know that they were gonna turn the blame\nOn Trump it's the tone of Trump you say because before Trump everything was really great the nation was United Obama talked and prose of wisdom mine was the nicest guy in the world we never had the Bork hearings the the uh Clarence Thomas hearings we never had the attacks on Reagan when I when I read any of that stuff\n\nAnd it was so much peace in our politics before Trump wasn't there of course there was a pay gap plate antifa they dare not speak black black lives matter and as far as ... concerned embraced by the Democrats with a wink and nod\n\nTen days ago I call a fused termites he got barely know

Scarborough or that clown makeup or ... or ... or this guy or another jerk Rick Wilson they're all out there oh twelve I'm swallow\n\nAnd MSNBC and CNN and the rats like to tell you oh these are Republicans are former Republicans\nYou know and even they hate Trump yeah well Ninety percent of the Republican support\nBut I Want to show you how ...
