them for example uh taking away the filibuster and things like that but I think we ought to continue to get rid of some of his legacy your rules\nFor example why her Dianne Feinstein or five senator

report who specializes in Texas and one of the reporters in the New York times who co wrote the article that we're talking about Trump engaging\nSuspect tax games as he reached Richard from his father

University of Southern California please welcome back to the program Reid should read thank you so much for taking the time I appreciate it\nThanks fiery it's always an honor to be on your show\nRead you read the New York times article very very long article fourteen thousand words did Trump or his father or other members of the family engage in something illegal\n[noise] [noise] well you know what I'm I Can't tell a you know I haven't looked at the water hundred thousand pages of documents that they seemed to provide 'em you know there's there are a few things in here which is proven to be true that was probably beyond the pale of the law\nUm what what what bothered me about the uh the article is the ... the authors obviously showed their bias in several places I'm One of which were they say that uh the rich never really pay their full freight\nUm and ah there's a couple of places where they're under explanation allows them to make some rather crucial accusations which if I knew all the facts I might be able to disapprove so I'll give you an example if you if I may sure\nUm suppose that I buy a house for half a million dollars I put twenty percent down and I borrow with a mortgage the remaining four hundred thousand dollars or the purchase price now what is that worth to me\nWhat is that included in my network if I if I gave it away at that point what would the value of the gift be well the value of the gift will be a hundred thousand dollars because it would be subject to that mortgage and\nSo now let's say there's a downturn like there was in the Nineteen nineties or two thousand three or two thousand eight when everybody lost\nValue in the real estate and now my real estate is worth only four hundred and twenty thousand dollars and like a lot of clients of mine decided when the downturn game that was a good time to give away real estate to their children\nSo now it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars I give it to my children what's the gift that I report on my gift tax return watch four hundred and twenty thousand dollars minus a four hundred thousand dollar mortgage twenty thousand dollars left that would be the value of the gift now\nWhen the downturn game that was a good time to give away real estate to their children so now it's with four hundred and twenty thousand dollars I give it to my children what's the gift that I report on my gift tax return what four hundred and twenty thousand dollars minus eight four hundred thousand dollar mortgage twenty thousand dollars left that would be the value of the gift\nNow a decade later there's been\nImprovements all around the neighborhood knew Tony retailers development of of of various sizes\nAnd I sell or my children sell that house for several hundred thousand dollars or have to pay off the mortgage so they keep three hundred thousand dollars\nI'm not even going to talk about taxes at that point but they kept three hundred thousand dollars and then one could say that they got Fifteen times the valuation of the year\nBut you see that was perfectly legal they did but the article doesn't explain leverage of real estate\nSo as a result I mean you can easily said my gosh how could that ever happened how could you ever invest in something\nAnd then sell it ten years later for Fifteen times what the value was when it was given\n... recharge it might get these attacks in the state planning lawyer or read you said there were a couple of things that that jumped out at you and it's that they could be proven to be true it would be problematic what what's the most serious one\n[noise] ah well the one that I really found to be a very serious is there's there's a there's a statement that when Donald Trump's a casino was in very bad shape but you know just drowning in debt that apparently his father\nA sent an emissary to buy three million dollars worth of ship\nRe before you came on I talked about the uh uh Joseph a peach unity generation skipping trust\nAnd I wonder whether or not if the New York times or six a bunch of reporters on that I Would they be able to to write an equally bombshell article about the uh the Kennedy family what they've done to shield their income read before you answer that that we're going to take a break so please don't don't go away\nI guess it's reached that we're talking about the New York times article Trump engaged in suspect tax games as he reached richest from his father and I'm Wondering whether or not the Kennedy family would be able to withstand this kind of scrutiny all of that are on the other side will hear from reach out about that\nAnd from Oklahoma City said this about relief factor\nIt has changed my life and the only thing I can say been exercising for years my shoulder\nIsn't

asking you whether or not you would think that the JFK family\nWould would hold up under the kind of scrutiny that the Trump family just underwent by these reporters at the New York times\nWell you know I'm not that familiar with the with the Kennedy family except that I Do know that they have a labyrinth of trust 'em in which they're family wealth is spread over\nI think it's fourteen or Fifteen family in the ... now but the most important thing is those trusts were created before much of the tax laws that Fred and Mary trust marry a Trump were subject to\nA were passed so for example the the Kennedys die before the uh Nineteen eighty six a\nGeneration skipping tax was introduced so they could pass wealth down to their grandchildren without a an extra level of a state tax at every generation\nBut I'm sure that they had some into Joe Kennedy was not exactly the cleanest or a living person alive and I'm sure that there are there were problems or ways but he skirted the tax laws um I just don't know\nNow the article the New York times ... says that ah the statute of limitations has run on many of these transactions but there is no statute of limitations for fines for civil fraud that is ... is the president or in in jeopardy\nWell I mean the IRS has been scrutinizing the Trump family for many decades I I just I just can't imagine that suddenly they're going to say oh look what we found and now they're civil penalties there is one thing that you should know though and that's if\nIf something if some gift was made and no gift tax return was filed to report it in any way there's no statute of limitations on the assessment of tax on that gift\nMhm are you uh went to war and you got a degree in economics ... were you there around the same time you know who was

and I didn't start there until the fall of sixty nine so we did we were not contemporary\nMhm now read when you read the New York times article did anything occur to you they gave you an idea of what to do or what not to do it did anything pop up when you say wow I never thought of that or it well that's a bad idea\nNo I mean ... the the article does talk about the most important part of their\nA movement of wealth downstream was to uh do things to the value the gifts because our gift in a state taxes are what we used to call in Latin class at the lower them they're based upon the value at the gate of death or in the ... and get it on a date of the gift\nAnd so there are techniques which are used to diminish the value of the of the gifts so for example\nIf I were to give you\nA twenty

going on in my mind\nI Wish you were a candidate for both actually can you run for two things anyway for senator\nStranger things have been done right\nBut it's certainly true a senator of course in Minnesota\nAnd uh tell me what\nI have so much to ask you are I mean I've been to Minnesota so many times I Love the state I live in a state of confusion I understand California where I live I don't understand Minnesota Minnesotans are known for niceness then they vote for a mean party\n[laughter] [noise] right right we we I mean it sounds are really really nice people and they like they like balance and they like people that treat others with three back and we are we are a strain state where we we cross salad\nWell we don't vote we don't stay in our lane we we cross over to Democrat Republican and we like to vote for big names here we've had Jesse Ventura as governor a leader of Al Franken as us\nEditor so ... and and I even in the same year they voted the most conservative US Senator ride grant at the same time they go to the most liberal a senator and Paul Wellstone so we do we we vote on some some different things are different from from all of those across the country that I I I think I feel even worse for you in California you got it\nOr you should [laughter]\nI mean you have you ever real chance now your opponent is campaigning with Keith Ellison\nKeith Ellison is uh is is this far left as we have in American politics and Keith Ellison of course as serious charges against him with regard to abuse of a woman and I'm not saying they're true I'm not saying they're not true but they're they're they're not from high school they're\nNot one incident how does that play\nOut and write a I'm and I'm running actually board that has to take me to Al Franken the so there's a lot of responsibility in this seat and who represents\nAnd the uh uh unsubstantiated allegations against a judge Kavanaugh uh see any for under oath that he didn't do it and she's calling festival FBI in investigation and she's also set that Kavanaugh had committed sexual assault she said that in the video\nAnd and what ever happened to be innocent before proven guilty it's now August and the proof is on those that are accused and that's it that's the bad road that the Democrats have gone down it's going to discourage a lot of people from running profit and for voting for them because this is one issue\nThat it had it popped up that has really got a Republican and independents extremely extremely angry at the hypocrisy and the double standard that the Democrats are are selling right now\nOkay so that's a double standard issue what about the issue\nI have to believe that most Minnesotans on Americans who are anti Kavanaugh on on the grounds of sexual assault not forgetting they're against them because they would be against any Republican nominee to the Supreme Court\nDon't they have husbands brothers fathers sons whom they love I mean why use all the identification visas the the the alleged victim\nAnd I was just talking to a group of hockey mom the other day and that's exactly what they were saying and and they fear for their husbands and their sons and their fathers that anybody can\nMake an accusation it becomes the uh\nThe land a front page headlines and there are are guilty by a public accusation and not having a fair hearing and not having any sort of private process to go through and and the Democrats will do anything they can to\nUh have an issue come out and attack Republicans and the the regular person out there Dennis I'm telling you it absolutely appalled\nThat something like this uh comes up and and can be their son or their brother or their father and it's it's so deeply saddening opposite that the route that they've gone down\nSo it is is the hill you have to climb that Minnesota is simply now more or less liberal slash left\n\n[noise] uh no no no absolutely to the hill that Tina Smith has declined it she's such a metro area liberal elite that uh this is not a DSL party Democrat farm labor here in Minnesota\nThat of my mother and father's area era it was mostly Democrat back in the day and it has the Democrat Party has left the Democrat\nOr in the last ten years and it has become the far less extreme liberal socialist party of Minneapolis St Paul and that it not to\nMinnesota Democrats are so they are leaving\nThe party in the eighth district up on the iron range protests all historically always voted\nDemocrat we are going to have a Republican Congress and they're not they're down in southern Minnesota always voted Democrat that's going to be Republican so Minnesota is not a Democrat as it used to be and we what we are seeing a real red wave here uh because they've gotten so far the lap and they've left the people and that's not who we are here in Minnesota\nI I I just wanted to tell you what I see that every Republican candidate for Senate for house governor\nThat you're not only running I mean this is an unsolicited advice and I I humbly acknowledge that fact you every Republican is not only running against their opponent they're running against the destructive\nLeft wing party as you just noted and I I I salute\nYou for doing that I think people have to understand as nice as and and I don't know your opponent but as nice as any Democrat individually might be they represent a destructive force in America the Democratic party\nAnd they really do and it and it is a a responsibility a on us as Republicans to make sure that the people know what\nBut that's the

completely different that's all I can hinted right now\nI I Can't let go by without asking you about the middle east will start taking phone calls and winding up your for you what's your take cynically on what's going to happen in the middle east with Syria and Iran and this whole situation\n[noise] well it's unfortunately with all the things we've been talking about specifically since twenty fourteen when I alerted yuan coast to coast and everybody about how we are now in Cold War two point Oh yes\nAnd how it follows the prophetic a place where the flashpoint as the middle east I mean one of the one of the ten predictions I made and ten predictions for this year was how we'd come much closer to a a war with Iran that's happening [noise] um Syria\nIs an ally of Iran and it is always long story short the\nThe not Saddam is prophecies that are quite clear about this is a look to eagle kings of the north get pulled in this as a Russian double eagle and the American bald eagle ... countries get pulled in because of their allies their vows holes\nWhich are described in and out a gram as Arab vessels\nBob ... in in French at that that kind of our ... rebel against their their their masters and drag Russian America into a war\nAnd that can happen with the issue of Iran even last few twenty four hours it there we've rescinded a a peace treaty that we've had with Iran since Nineteen fifty five of course it was with the dictator the Shaw after we overthrew their government two years earlier that was democratically elected\nThat doesn't get told you in the u._s. press\nBy

and we need to take a look at how we kind of gotten here comic ally\nNow so so we have a situation with ... which really got me concerned in August where it's the last province where fifty thousand al ... affiliates who we've been supporting\n... city in Syria\nSyria yeah we're going to make their last stand against the Syrian Arab Army and the Russian air force and the Turks were also involved what happened in eleventh hour just before it started is\nUm ... organ of turkey the president of turkey and the ladder in food and got together and made a pact\nTo not do the offensive to create a

twenty Eighteen or twenty Nineteen\nUm their strategy kind of points to and some of the deadlines Nostradamus gave to along in the short deadline if if we kind of move up what may be the official start of the Cold War\nWhen the Russians announce they achieved a parity in March first this year they delayed they're putting the delayed his address to the nation of Russia and any so he could see what what the military changes the rules of engagement was going to happen with the Americans\nHe I I actually quoted a lot of the speech and it shows it's very interesting look at how we've been an arms race again with Russia because we pulled out of the ab a missile treaty\nAnd which was a seriously destabilizing move to unilaterally do it a long story short they had to create a new system of of weapons that could be a deterrent to was surrounding Russia's steadily with a anti ballistic missile batteries\nTo basically be able to shoot down their missiles so they couldn't defend themselves are very very destabilizing move a Harley reported so the Russians declared in March first that\nPretty much we're in this Cold War and they have now made a parity you know interestingly enough fruit and drops ten billion dollars off the eighty billion dollar budget of the Russian defense the same time Trump adds another thirty seven billion to something that's\nPast seven hundred billion if you add the other side to it were really spending one point one trillion dollars [noise]\nUh on defense spending in our military ironically it's half of what\nThe u._s. people produce monetary lead GDP every year which is exactly what happened at the same time when the Soviet Union collapsed it was paying half of its money into its big military and they collapsed we're doing the same thing\nSo uh it's it reminds me of prophecies of ... through the spirit was channeled by stereo hunts and ... who is considered the Swedish Edgar Casey Nineteen eighties [noise]\nAnd um because he channeled similarly and trance\nAnd he ... he would say things like that you'll see the one side of the Cold War over there and Russia have become more free in America would become more like the Soviet Union and at least in this economic sense [noise]\nThat's true uh with more censorship it's happening to alternative voices you know the that's also a ...

in the true sense because he wasn't buying into easy a rationales of belief he was really questioning thing and of course seeing the world like he was he was seeing the darker sides of it as well\nAnd

just have one more area to talk with John about and he's writing a book about the lead celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and boy you sparked my interest John because it sounds like you had a very a similar situation what happened\nI did it's really a a tale of two suicides a and both of us committed suicide and the reason I Am speaking to you is because my experience with\nSuicide was a spiritual suicide rather than the usual what I call mundane suicide most people\nEncounter um basically in the mundane suicide I contend that you end up with your pain destroying the body mind that you're that you're mystery of Seoul is living in\nBut in the suicide that happened to me rather than the one that I was indeed mundane league going to do [noise]\nI saw my misery and my pain commit suicide and I remained\nAnd so this is one of my most intimate autobiographical tales of a whole other dimensions of my life from\nAll these years I've never known this way I was I was I was walking\nThrough a golf course in San Pedro California I just come back from India and I was still in the tender opening kind of broke out of my shell of\nMany lives being with my my teacher in India for the first time and when I came back in the world the world it\nWas not a place that supported this kind of individual flowering and I was having a very bad day and so I was walking down this beautiful beautiful a golf course adjacent to the trailer park because I Lived in a overlooking Santa Catalina island in San Pedro cliff and that's what\nI was walking it just dawned on me as as I could just keep walking\nA beyond these cliffs and plummet down three hundred feet into the rocks and\nI was going to do it because suddenly\nI had this amazing unexpected experience of life and death suddenly being very tangible and clear out to see how they're really one there really\nThere are plenty of complementary or in our fear they're a play of terror and opposites but what was happening to me the feeling was that try to describe it but it's beyond words really beyond belief\nIndeed it was like um\nIt was descending on me faster\nThan myself and I thought okay this is happening because I have made the decision to throw myself walk over this cliff if I turn away from this I'm going to lose this amazing experiences overtaking me this mystery of life meeting death so I saw this little eucalyptus tree and I sat\nUp against and I said okay for throwing myself over I just wanted to feel this\nAnd take this with me over the edge and so I sat there just going inside and feeling it at some point I felt this electrical energy just rise above the ground through the roots of the tree and throw me forward face down into the crab grass or I just began sobbing sobbing and suddenly\nAll of that thank God all of that yes all of that otherwise I wouldn't be killing the you know not at all\nAnd uh and and there was this moment after I cried it all out I turned and there was a little old eucalyptus trees and it was just shivering it's leaving the Santa Ana wind and it was just this moment where I realized the sky the earth tree existence love me\nExistence sees\nEverything that's created out of it as a phenomenal creation rising and falling as something absolutely integral significant and I had this feeling that so much of what society does to make us feel insignificant when you go in\nEven at that moment of life meeting that\nInsignificant becomes in significant\nI it's so the story is really an ... it's it's they jumped from what I usually right about the whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did the ... has a book back in Nineteen Ninety nine sometimes my\nThese books you see I I don't write these books they right\nThey use me to write themselves and I had no idea until Anthony Bourdain died\nHow deeply he his\nHis suicide how much he was loved and how many many people were shocked in the story I talk about the moment that inspired me to write this book\nI'm In a cashiers line and there's this old lady and she's doing something looks like she's never done before she pulled actually a magazine out of Iraq and looks at it and the people magazine of an seaboard Dane and I watched how she touched his cheek\nOn the picture the way she did it was so\nIntimate and beautiful\nI understand what he was going through he was not a man to believe or in fairy tales and imaginary stuff and that Santa Claus is going to save him from his ...\nAnd all that it's really pretty ... and and and and people like that when they die and I always feel\nThere's a person that has the potential to become a an awakening one and I as I have been in my private life which I'm sharing more and more now in this period especially now when there's so much turmoil when there's so much um\nHangst and polarity my inner life now as a meditate or is now coming more and more into my work because it is still ...\nPoint this center of silence and peace in the cycle of life that's becoming stronger and stronger that is what I can share with all of you in meditation the science of self observation is is what\nWhat more and more I always thought my my work with evil more and more and\nIt's still prophetic but it's going to have more of my own authority through my own experiences\nYou know take some calls here in the ... minutes we got left Thomas in Iran with John Hope Tom\nHi George thank you for taking my call and John while [laughter] it's hard to follow your sharing of your experience on that but my question John yes\nFor a person to walk in the world to be a participant in the world how can they develop their own centered ness so to speak such that they are not enough for dead\nOn a fact dead on touch my personal and planetary astrology\nWell what I can only suggests and\nI think only anyone who's honest and heart to heart with anybody is all I can suggest is my own experiences the meditation techniques that I've been using since Nineteen eighty [noise] and uh so my answer to that is\nIf any of you listening to this resonate with what I've been saying\nEspecially with the issue of suicide in life meeting to um\nI Am on a path where I can say there is a way to look beyond and not be touched you can be passionate and deeply into life but you're not overwhelmed jury you can be a Buddha and the marketplace but not\nOf the marketplace of the world and that was what my teacher talk show and that is what I've live since Nineteen eighty since I went to India to see him for the first time

I mean it's for kids that have nothing going from I even had some kids in my class is\nWell had these terrible Kansas and I would draw for\nThem and they always they wanted us so I Would give them like coloring books in crayon and they would try so hard to keep those those those are ... that the crayons in in the lines are with the numbers\nMore but some of them had says terrible it's your Kansas say they would rule follow in your own coloring they went through their mouth is rule of law was in school you were at\nWell I was just it was ... yeah I mean the special ed teacher had different classes you know and just happened to be in these classes it was it shows in like that okay\nOr whatever we clean it up for them it was nothing to rule because they did that all day long so that they didn't mean anything to them er and er so yeah and if you know they were learning the skills that they were never going to use a you know there was no real cure for them back to and even today just really no you're so as a special ed teacher had a lot of time in my\nHand and the kids need to two hours for lunch with the teacher said would help feed them or there's no papers to correct the bigger kids have had in the ...\nIn the room used to move box as long as I enrolled is you know when you see a tractor trailer pull up to a warehouse and they put out to assign roles and you put the boxes on him to shut them down and\nYou know there's a lot of them don't you\nYeah so this gives me this school supply\nI enrolled isn't my class sideline up the kids I take until it can get a box put it on the island world he would slide down to the next kid they because they would open it up a slight advantage ... put something in and slide down to the next just tape it you know so that's what they did so I had plenty of time so George I know how to\nWatching so I said Boston to the nightclubs and I believe this is a real prerequisite of what why this thing that came to this house\nWhen you do want to jobs John\nYeah I mean it is that thing especially that they didn't take up much of my time at a two hour lines I didn't have papers to correct you know so I decided you know it gets going to do this too so um yeah so uh uh ... you know people at night out and look at all I Know a lot of\n... and the people but there was a certain percent of people out in the dark side of things these people are like little wicked have looking\nFor a cause to alcohol or drugs or commit adultery looking for anything they can get their hands on and a good portion of these people were atheists or they went to the coast a little bit\nMake sure I can get along with anybody I can relate to anybody and this type of behavior didn't even bother me back there but she was over the years I noticed that a lot of these people die from accidents like car accidents overdoses suicide Kansas\nAnd ... and I find it with these people in the end and I knew them you know up and I felt that these people like ships in the night without a runner any way they\nWould take him to go with a ... or the wind was blowing that was fine with them and they died in the state that I thought nobody should\nDie they were the last rings unusually high\nYeah unbelievable and so um you know I just didn't think they\nFavors those who are resisting the establishment um because you run into horses in the fall and the ... in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in\nThe leash she puts out in the dark side of things these people are like little wicked have looking for a cause\n... alcohol or drugs or commit adultery ... anything they can get their hands on and a good portion of these people were atheists they went to the cost a little bit\nMake sure I can get along with anybody I can relate to anybody and this type of behavior didn't even bought me back there but you went over the years I noticed that a lot of these\nPeople die from accidents like car accidents overdoses suicide cancers and ... and I bought it with these people in ... and I knew them you know up and I felt that these people like ships in the night without a runner any way than\nI Would take a million ... or the wind was blowing that was fine with them and they died in the state that I thought nobody should die\nThen we're the last race unusually high\nYeah unbelievable\nAnd so um you know I just didn't think they knew how to live I mean that's another thing is focused on the teacher had us if you get a nose I self you know knows I mean is it\nOr not trying to be somebody else knowing their self means do you the truth about you you are what they do look at what you do analyze what you do then analyze what you believe about yourself you may find it completely different person here\nI mean I had one friend I tried to get through this quick because I Know we want to get into his name is Chris he was the boss and he worked right alongside and he was an atheist than there\nUsed to make fun of God used to make fun of Jesus is to make fun of the Virgin Mary I smoke and drank every night seven nights a week\nHe didn't feel well they went to visit a doctor and he\nFound you're already had four states can't oh so he couldn't work anymore so I tried to visit in between my you know going from school my school job and my night job [noise] ah we work together I mean it was like a friend you know I Know you had all these problems but\nYou didn't know what\nI Know he had this for about forty years in a in a few months and he died within a few months but I'd like to visit him and they were trying to talk to him about God but he wasn't interested at all and he was even more bitten out George because if a diagnosis she had died he died in such a terrible state\nHe died in a state no one should die and ah I I felt like helpless form now in my relationships were told that people fall into hell like snowflakes from the sky specific there's no one to pray for them so I started praying for him\nAnd all these other people that I knew and bonded with and they felt they were friends of mine and I would ask God you know don't send these cells to hell that unless you go to hell until I finished praying for them\nNo matter how long ago it gives me on this planet no matter how many grains of sand they still got left and then our class that's what I was going to do\nAnd I believe now that was the prerequisite of why this human creature ... my house and a buildup mosaic fill your piece by piece right down there every single detail\nKnow do what we can really will let me ask you this little John ... this demon follow you to the house basically or was it already there\nAbsolutely not you know the only absolutely not I've never had like a and I've never you know I never had ... and invited to speak to here I never had to say on I never use\nA week he poured more and I never use\nTerror card I mean I I Believe that opens the door for a creature like this to come in and then also just anybody does that because I now I think if you allowed to speak to come in here through you harm I think if I met him to do is worse\nWhen you're the only other time it had\nNo there's no doubt if you if you invited in each call me\nYeah that's what I Believe now but you do in the morning which is\nAbsolutely not I've learned a lot from it I learned that it is and has a methodology will discuss that too but the only other really other time [noise] ah well you know I thought that I worked at night so that's why I wrote that book anyhow that at best selling book and then if you're interested in any of that do have some funny stories about the rapid Chris\nBrown and that's that's the topic we don't touch that we do and what we we don't we don't get into that topic\nOh okay [laughter] so anyway\nPeople probably want you to was basically what you've seen on the outside but go ahead\nYeah okay so the only other time that I ever\nKnew about a person who encountered the demon that I Believe was because my brother or for the fall he we had just a rare or a blood disease that runs in the family and my my dad was unfortunate to get it and it kills them very early in the sixties had a heart attack and died the\nSame day I'd rather it was unfortunate for you to get it\nAre you OK gets it scares me are you are right yeah what was the ... disease\nOh I haven't I I've been checked with that yeah oh yeah a doctor who well let me tell you what happened to fall in I'll tell you\nSo poorly wakes up and he has the same symptoms my dad had chest than say dollars nine one one they can they come and they take him to the hospital and at the hospital he dies on hospital bed and when I went to visit them later on he says to me Johnny you know\nAnd I heard that he died on hospital bed that's what the doctors told me said Johnny when I died on a hospital bed I left my body\nHe said I left my body and I watched that doctors frantically\nAnd and they're ... trying to get me back to life again if they'd be late and not on comedy and\nYeah and uh alarms going off and said I can I talk about that fifth\nFifth dimension that spiritual dimension he stepped into that for him and he was still so he's still thought he was in a hospital room he because he could see what was going on with his body they said in the hospital\nHe said to me ... ... and it and then there was a dark side of that room he said and demons came from a small team is not like\nBig when factory for for for toys I came to me and it was grabbed me and was starting to pull me into that talk area of the room which I which I say is to because they have they overlap some type and I believe that's where we overlap\nHim at fifth dimension and ah they were dragging him into that talks romance and they finally got back to life she was able to get back into his body and he said to me Johnny\nWhy didn't demons come yeah I'm not really that fate of a person who said you know and understand ... why would even come to me and I was like boy I really\nDon't know uh I don't know if anybody but no I Know that you know all of us are\nRaised the same way like I said you know we're all kind of religion confirmed and our religion he was too but he dropped out and now okay I have to go to church anymore okay he met a woman he didn't really marry just live what okay again I tell them you know\nEven use their ... guide to find out what hundreds of other repairing improvement project cars in your area I think everybody should use them either in fact I tell everybody geez only minor measures they total solution to any type of war you would ever want to do around your house and best of all\nHe's completely free so to buy their dot com or download free\n[noise]\n\nAnd we'll come back to coast to coast George ... with you is the devil has approached you were going to ... you can join let's pick up the story about your brother you you'll brother at the time what happened\nYeah so I'm just to recap uh I mean this is probably the only other time I've ever had an encounter with a devil that I Believe that you know\nI Know my brother wouldn't lie to me about it and he wasn't really a\nBad person I mean okay he left his religion like we talked and then he he lived with the woman who didn't get married to an any racist 'cause they didn't have a religion so uh you know I felt that may be but he said you know to me ... you know when I Do not hospitals that I left my body I watched the doctors frantically trying to\nGet me back to life again with the ... the latest and the nurses running back and forth sticking things that my aunt and they could hear the alarms going off or what\nBut he wasn't that like that they mentioned that overlapping dimension I guess and he said there was like a duck part of that room with probably never was there when he was in the hospital but when he was in that overlapping to mention there he said demons came for him and he actually ... demons ... man I was like for [laughter] I really don't know why\nWhy you know I just don't know how to explain that either I I never had this problem I never had a problem like this before uh before I had to say I've ever seen in my house but um\nI Wonder about it a lot of heat to elect he's completely one hundred and eighty degrees turn man he's a very religious man now\nThis experience scared the heck on moving a can of\nIt but it believe it I mean to actually\nBe dying dying and then\nYou know leave your body that's something you know she's going to remember you're still young guys only like forty years always got a lot of life ahead of him but he now has a very religious person\nBut uh he\nEncountered this statement but the one that I can see with a very different like I tell you the answer\nIs you know what was the first episode for huge on this demon showed up what\nThey all K so uh let me explain to I live in New Jersey like the middle of New Jersey right Nicole from that area I have a house that sounded like an acre\nProperty farm how Hoboken argue\n[laughter] although very far from that's a good hour or so are you from ...\nI'm sure not sure what to do [laughter]\nOh yeah well I was born in Brooklyn I far from home\nBut now I live in New Jersey so oh yeah so I just wanted to say because I had a best selling book I was able to retire\nAnd I didn't have to work with those I Love those kids believe me\nBut I ... I I stopped working but may not have to work at ... I guess you just stop and I stopped or something at night and I love about ending at night but er and that but I stopped but I still know about those people they still pray for those people and that's a big ... big prerequisite of why I had to separate but now I'm In New Jersey now\nSo I'm doing fine I have a very uh elaborate for life uh I I retired from my by my job as a special ed teacher I retired at not working at night and I miss those people a lot too\nAnd I have this nice house and it's on ...\nOkay about a hundred and fifty feet from the street it's on a hill you come in to the house and the the garages are under the house and you fill your car into the left and you go into the garage is in the back door does it come into the garage\nAnd then between the garage doors and the basement is this big indoor\nAnd other ... I had three boys here growing up and I think a little bit bigger they want to a little more room so I had the basement finish and er I cut it in half and I had an apartment building down there so my first wife that's all that he wants to more space that he moved down there yeah you have your own entrance\nYou pull your own family come and go as you want to say yeah\nYeah so it's nice so then he goes to college anymore without ... apartment and so he takes it he goes to college and moved out my third boy he wants out of farm inhaling a voice in there he he was here this whole time so he uh when I had\nThe he was the smart one free rent\n[laughter] yeah well I didn't mind your believe we have this big house and then like when he ... he went to college he moved out but he got a job and then he said you know can I moved back home I just want to start my own business as they come back home because I mean we got it's a big house and my wife has this empty nest syndrome sure you know what I mean\nSo I I like having a a company to somebody to come upstairs and have dinner with you once in a while and when you tell me wasn't home that much but he's moved out since then he got a great often focused but anyway he's here the whole time so that stuff\nThere and so in the basement you come in that that I endorse this step that go up to the kitchen\nBut if it gets in the okay if you're in that case and you can almost hear that or an enclosed and the next to the kitchen is living and that's why it most of the time George and\nUh that's what I like I I go to the gym in the morning to meditate and afternoon I meditating at night and meditate so I have a pretty long for a life that I took I did get back to my artwork because I Am good at that as a small little town that God gave me you know\nSo uh I'm doing that and everything's fine to it for years and I've been praying for the last so that I felt well last those every day\nFor years and I was like I said I'm going to do that until whatever time I have left here so everything's fine\nOh and then a bang yeah\nSo that yeah I think I'm sitting in the liver and that I endorse downstairs by myself and I hear that I enjoy like slam lucky you normally wouldn't even hear it\nFrom in the in the living room right here it's like it never was lamb before and I'm thinking to myself\nAnd you know somebody's open\nAbsolutely you in a house that forty five years you know every noise in the house you know so I'm thinking I said what was I think of it I think my wife could even if you came\nAnd I hear that I enjoy like slam lucky you normally wouldn't even hear it\nFrom in the in the living room but I hear it slammed like it never was lamb before and I'm thinking to myself\nAnd you know somebody's open\nOh absolutely you in the house the twenty five years you know every noise in the house you know\nSo I'm thinking to myself what was it was I don't think my wife could even if he came home and sleep that like I don't even think that getting slammed that do it that hard and maybe my son can I don't know why he would do that without a car accident or with a girlfriend broke up with them or something like that so I'm thinking what is that I get up\nI go to the kitchen I look downstairs usually when somebody comes in down near the puts up with in a lifetime still talk to you so I go into\n... and I have a a surveillance system here right they look into the cameras and they roll back the cameras and Fifteen twenty minutes I said nobody was on the property I look at the cameras that face the garage doors nobody nobody open those garage doors I look at the camera the faces that store in the back nobody wants to be that fact door\n... and or what you would you distinctly heard it all\nOh absolutely slam no like slant\nI didn't know at at the time does that we're going to discuss this this creature was using his methodology on me and had a method it wasn't it was telling me that wasn't here for social call that wasn't passenger with now explain that in a minute so I go I look in the cameras nobody was on a property in the basement I got\nI got bars on the windows but you can get out as a you know if there was a fire in the house he just on lock them and jumped out do so I Know he couldn't get anybody if somebody was trespassing I couldn't see them so I'd go say turn the lights on in the basement and I go down to the basement\nAnd it's not looking everywhere\nYou you're pretty convinced you think somebody's in the house don't you\nOh absolutely absolutely\nBut I the only problem is but when I'm looking around I feel like I've been in the past twenty five years I feel this menacing sinister I'm In is like the only word to describe this like evil like an evil\nJust the name ...\nYeah I'm looking everywhere I look down the steps and like any where somebody could squeeze himself into behind a washer and dryer in my son's room under the bed in his closet you know and the furnace who am I look I look at my frantic to look and I still have this horrible feeling [noise] so I'm thinking well\nI I Know I looked at some satisfy looking to the cameras nobody came and nobody broke in but I still have this\nReally menacing finished the feeling that come upstairs and I sit down\nAnd I'm thinking about it and then I you know and then all of a sudden I hear\nThis wedding steps between the basement and and and and the kitchen and here's something I really heavy because like I can hear when\nMy wife comes up to ... hundred and twenty pounds my son comes up to ... hundred and Seventy pounds I Know what those steps down\nWhere you get something very silly crossing a step and thinking to myself I just shut down here you know nothing was here\nWhen somebody's coming up to snuff [noise]\nYeah I feel something very heavy slowly coming up the steps I get up again I go over that I look there's nobody there\nSo I'm thinking we were you armed her own armed and this time I I have I have a a registered gun you know you do okay [laughter] yeah\nBut I but I didn't see anything so you know what I mean I looked in the cameras that look through the cat was if I were to fill us something then I I I didn't feel like a you know\nBut I don't think I I kinda was wondering if that had that feeling of something very menacing sinister and I think it is but could this possibly save it and I try to shake it off us because he like I'm just a guy I don't think that's you know just\nGoing to add one point you on where you convinced that there was this creature demon in the house\nOr when it actually I actually\nHad the ... but I Want to try to build up to that before actually tell\nMe we're running out of the time so we get to really yeah oh I think we have another hour though yeah we're ... we're\nOkay so okay so my wife comes home\nHe said is this the first thing he says to me she comes in is like a a a you know it's everything All right with you I mean everything right where they have to feel something really weird in this house and it's like yeah I Do too low you know but I don't know how to explain it\n\n\n[noise]\nSince our around

take that Hollywood and every single whom I say in the name of Jesus Christ that commanded um leads to south immediately and go through every single\nRoom and I'd be I'd be dumping buckets of water all day long [laughter]\nI got through every single rule I got to even go in the attic and furnished from everywhere I think closets why go into the last rooms George I'm saying that in the classroom and I feel I'm swish the curtains and the blind swish and seal it leave\nAnd or I felt the ... that evil presidents\n[laughter] you know I got through everything overall I got to even go in the attic and furnished from everywhere I think ... that's what I go into the last rooms yours or I'm saying that in the last room and I feel I've swish the curtains and the blind Swiss and I feel it leaves\nAnd ah I I felt that ... that evil presidents left so I felt it was gone that this was like a year and into it I haven't even heard a bump in the night since since\nThat food that say thank God\nSo Oh thank God it's right but I mean I think came the thing was ... it was powerful enough to uh uh to manipulate a dimension or was powerful and intelligent enough to ah ah tell me what it has ... would have wanted to tell me and I I don't know if you know like I say I have many many\nIn Bush to forest joined those three messages you said that this creature this into Detroit do reports on you what what were they\n\nNot use them as long as you said they had three messages that one of the\nMethods no more of us with the first message to me no more okay\nNo more than I thought what does that mean that they're okay now I think I Know what I mean I'm a prank for these cells the cells coming to him it and\nThe other message was the other thing it said message that said when I was looking at that blue raising flame and he said only my spirit with the the effects of this fire and that made a lot of sense to me too because that was\nYou know that was my wasn't the spirit\nThat I didn't ... affect me but I guess that fast I mean it was God's burning ... percent so that was the message that I understood from it and then of course I said I Am Mandy and met him a wicked deny so it\nHelped me a message of there's as many of these creatures there but I mean you know when you're reading the Bible you know like I said I'm skeptical myself I Do read the Bible at thirty in the street is is the powerful ones like this one topic convince all these other about a third of the angels the break\nRank off they probably didn't want to be with God and he wanted to break off on their own ... and it convinced the thirties angels to follow them for this and\nMany yeah big mistake to follow them let's take some classes and where they in March first time caller in Phoenix, Arizona you Ron with us go ahead mark\nHey guards either I've had I've had that experience with what he's going to fifth dimension twice in my life that are\nThe only difference is is my experience was I met face to face with your with God and not not it's not a demon or a devil\nYou were the lucky ones [laughter] well that are just out of curiosity they got that say anything to you but\nYeah well I Would go into some tough times in my life and I I was basically praying for the return of Christ you were praying for so old I was just turning praying for the return of Christ\nOr you know and uh\nYou basically encouraged me in and uh went through a whole series of whether I had faced to believe this could happen to that could happen and anyway that's that's part of the story but but in the end\nAnd he said well if I gave you the power to you know have Chrysler turned right now would you do it and as soon as he asked me that I started thinking about all the laws that I I just I just said no I Can't there's too many people that needs to be saved yet\nThat's what I'm saying I mean yeah you know we we love price you want to see 'em but once he comes that's it right at the end they I mean [laughter]\nYou ever do ration yourself drawn and just ask yourself why is this demon visiting me\nI'm not a bad guy I'm not evil what what's the one with me\nSo I knew what he wanted with me I knew that he wanted me to stop praying and I know they didn't want me to pray for these cells I give them a second chance you know because they didn't have it here and I felt I bonded with these people are befriended the people I knew them I didn't hang out with them because they were kind of like I said live wicked in their ways but I still can relate I can relate to anybody\nAnd I can relate to these things I can laugh at them and you know I have to talk with him and stuff like that so I felt like I I Know that these people but I just couldn't just I felt helpless for them when they when I heard that they die from accidents and overdoses and and and I just felt terrible for them and they felt like they're going to be\n... you know in this in this fifth dimension a and heading towards the ... and ... and I was just saying you know God you know if you can pray for the cells and can you do whatever you can for them over there maybe talk to them or something like that or I teach them you know what that there are there because he has this kind of think his\nLove and have like the book says well between love and hate in this universe here and you want to go with his love but if you're if you're a person who like like I said has has harvest hate and your heart and intense and better than you so you're not going to these people can forgive the navy can forgive if\nFamily can forgive people from race religion nationality yeah going that way you don't even want to go that way that's the thing about this you gotta go with this creature because he's got to teach you how to use that hatred to leave he ate all your pain you know what I mean you're going to have an almost want to go the hell that stepped\nOn oh no not me not me [laughter] Dave in Cleveland go ahead David

us between loving hate is talking about the double our final segment of goals you on Long Island New York soon to say Joe go ahead\nYeah Hi John ah that sounds like the description of the devil you are that great issue a ... is almost similar to something in the book of revelation but I Want to a rope eight proverbs chapter seven to this uh\nIt's it's really using it's talking about two women in proverbs chapter seven it's talking about a ... woman uh it says make wisdom York tens woman and understanding wisdom and understanding and white\nThe wisdom on the tablet of your haul marked the wisdom on the top of your heart now to me this is the anecdote for the mark of the devil and\nThe book of revelation or the beef you know the six six six the anecdote for this is the wisdom of the lord\nA and it goes on to describe a strange woman now the strange woman is not really a strange woman it's just a metaphor for temptation and the devil and it talks about this woman said to sing man in the night\nWhile her husband is away and uh and pricing them and then forcing them what flattering lip so I think this is the vice a ... of the devil where\nIn this show lore is\nLike an enticement the devil is not gonna is gonna address the thing up as where it's not obvious that it's the devil and that as you get lord then it changes to force play you're kind of in the jaw stuck\nYeah yeah so only later on this the devil revealed that true intentions what's going to really happen and forces that upon it so if you look at the\nBook of proverbs that directly were late for I think what you're saying and I wonder John if your previous work in the bars somehow you picked up\nSome of these demonic entities\nWell that's an interesting possibility could that have happened to your other ... your job as a bartender\nThat's possible I mean who who who really knows I mean that's part of it that was good advice to keep the heat that was with them in your heart you know what I mean they keep the first thing in your mind\nOr what but what you were talking about and that yeah that that that's good advice and and uh who knows if this thing came out of it could be there I mean that could exist there and you know and like I said there are ... wicked people there and that some of them went to the cold light of ... and uh hey who knows\nThem into the air John where do you get your book between love and hate\nYeah love and hate you go to John ... is a key a in that time\nA three hundred and fifty paid a a book I pressed the few buttons that we get it ah you know as the is it you'll

many things in this book if you if you really want to know now that I felt that he had to know that I felt that many of the spiritual stories in this book that it will say cry when they read them\nWell I'm just glad you got rid of that\nSo many so many things but if you really want to know now that I had to know how many other spiritual story ... ... ...\nWell I'm just glad you got rid of

never wrong me he had never given me insults for his goals I had no desire I think it was his uh yes it was this he had the eye of a vulture\nA pale blue eye with the film over it\nWhenever it fell

Men no nothing\nBut you should have seen me you should have seen how wisely I proceeded with what caution with what foresight with what the simulation I went to work I was never kinder to the old man during the week before I killed him at every night about midnight\nI turn the ... of his door and opened it owes so gently and then when I had made an opening sufficient for my head I put in a dark lantern all close\nClose step no light show now and then I rushed in my head or you would have left to see how continually ice rested in I moved slowly very very slowly so that I might not disturb the old man sleep\nIt took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he\nLay upon his bed off with a madman events so why is this and then when my head was well in the room I ended the lantern cautiously oh so cautiously cautiously for the hinges creek I and did it just so much that a\nSingle in the race fell upon the vulture by and this I did for seven long nights every night just at midnight but I found the ... always closed and so it was impossible to do the work\nFor was not the old man who ... me but he is evil lie and every morning when did they broke I went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him calling him by name and a hearty zone and inquiring how he has passed the night\nSo you see he would have been a very profound old man indeed to suspect that every night just at twelve\nI looked in upon him why we slept\nUpon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious and opening the door a watches minute hand moves more

that I drew back with no is room was this black is pitch with the the darkness for the shutters were close fastened through fear of robbers\nAnd so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door and I kept pushing it on steadily steadily I had my head in and was about to open that lantern when my phone's slipped upon the tin fascinating and the old man's spring up in bed crying out who's there\nI kept quite still and said nothing for a whole hour I did not move all muscle and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down\nHe was still sitting up in the bed listening just as I have done night after night harkening to the death watches and the wall presently\nI heard a slight grown and I knew it was the grownup mortals her it was not a grown the pain or of grief it was the low stifled
