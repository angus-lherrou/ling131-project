so they can pay and it's been really a long time very intense [noise]\nThat was presidents from this morning in a actually it was a very reassuring\nA press availability and anyone who believes that there was some kind of secret the Trump desire to unseat Nikki Haley or whether she's planning to run against him she's not a as a matter of fact she made that extremely we're\nA ... is she a presidential possibility for the future of course he is is she just about the strongest Republican nominee one good thing goes for ... for two thousand twenty four\nOr for two thousand and twenty for that matter\nYeah I think she is oh she was a terrific governor of South Carolina we enjoyed having her on the show or she is a natural when it comes to politics and she handled the un job with so much dignity in class even when she had to work with Rex Tillerson\nWho wasn't an ideal partner for her as secretary of state\nThe um uh she did a comment about\nThis rumor that she's going to be challenging Trump for the nomination in two thousand twenty of course that's ridiculous you won't and here is Nikki Haley\nMaking that about as close as clear as she possibly could\n\nThe south was enough to know when you set aside and allow someone else to do the job so nice enough for me in our\nAnd I will say\nThis on our own here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI can promise you what are we doing campaigning for that point so I look forward to supporting the president and the next license over like as\nA President Trump said that so good and uh of course it is and it's appropriate look this doesn't mean that a Nikki Haley didn't have some disagreements with people in the Trump Administration she did a but she managed to\nWork with the president and apparently the president deserves all credit according to all observers for allowing Nikki Haley to do or job\nAnd it's very unusual for a un representative because look you're talking about such a corrupt organization but she stood up for the country\nAnd did it with class and eloquence\nHere's President Trump this morning and and again this was a press availability where they both look comfortable and happy and like they genuinely liked each other or they were sitting in bright yellow chairs in the oval office and er here is what President Trump said about the first\nInkling he had that Nikki Haley would be leaving her job\nShe told me probably six months ago she said you know she said maybe at the end of the year the other two year period but the other day I Want to take a little time off a little but she's been a very successful you know governor of South Carolina [noise] for eight years\nAnd she uh she did this and this is possibly even more in tune with what's going on in the world very dangerous and lots of things [noise]\nBut she's ... has a job and we've done a fantastic job together we've solved a lot of problems or one of the process of solving the problems of sort of gear just wanted to tell you that we will miss you will be speaking all the time but we will miss your number to listen to the job but I Want to say\nOkay and uh then Nikki Haley talk about\nSome of her sense of accomplishment she's completing her first\nTwo years ah her two years as UN ambassador and she's going to get any working there until January it's unclear which is going to be doing after that there are some rumors we will get to those but here is a Nikki Haley talking about\nThe achievements that she sees in American foreign policy in the last two years\nWon't that what has happened in two years with the United states on foreign policy now the United states does recess countries may not like\nI said that's what we know that if we think we are going to do something we fall for when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO saying that other countries have to pay their share I mean whether the trade deals were given a major thing they get\nNow the United states different\nCountries may not like\nWhat we see now that if we think we're going to do something we fall when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO saying that other countries have to pay their share I mean whether China India forgive and amazing\nIt depends I mean that's all it really that if you look at things you hear is that the\nOne point three billion in the UN we made it made it more in\nThe south and we got an arms embargo which was a long time coming green\nNorth Korean sanctions um packages which was on line and generation down in a way that we didn't really work for the new colorizing North Korea and the Iran deal bringing attention to the world that every country need ... you can't overlook\nAnd fall of the things that they want to do harm to see them for the threat that they are\nI think you look at the anti Israel violence and the strike\nEncourage the president Saturday in moving the embassy and selling the rest of the world we are and things where we want to buy our and [noise]\nYou know all of those things have made a huge difference and the U.S than I can tell me that um [noise] he wants is wrong again any strong in a way to make some very proud\nAnd this is I'm about as as strong case and you can make and not know what she said can you argue it it's all the truth and yes she was part of it but all of this did happen under President Donald Trump\nAnd this is one of the reasons I suppose that on the CNN poll a despite the fact that there has been so much hysteria on the left about\nHaving on and the the various powers that are alleged to have been perpetrated by old white males led by Donald Trump\nThe President Trump actually saw his approval rating rising look as far as Nikki Haley is concerned there's a lot of talk about her replacement and some of the talk that is most inflammatory is the idea that the president is going to a plane his daughter Yvonne\nWhy would that make any sense evil guy has traveled\nAround the world as she speaks very well she has dynamics you certainly would have the president's confidence\nThat she will also be a terrible choice because it would be very easy for the rest of the world to see a look uh America is becoming like a banana republic or like a dictatorship or let's talk or see where\nThis family

honestly I think most of the coverage that I saw on NBC and very much on CNN which is deliberately misleading they made it sound\nAs if a justice Kavanaugh spoke and spoke with dignity and then Trump spoke afterward and then ruined everything the justice but it wasn't like that because President Trump spoke first\nAnd he welcome people introduced every they all walked in together and then the

and\nJustice Kavanaugh that's a process was unusual and not admirable\nLou in Cherry Hill New Jersey Lou you're on the Michael Mann that show\nYour high high Iran right yeah um I mean I I don't know when I look at what what he did he said he was completely um yup proven to be innocent um he didn't he didn't investigate\nAll the people who were actual witnesses that we're likely\nWitness that would have more information it was not a thorough process so for him to go around and do that slap it in our face okay the the lawyers they voted in two thousand twelve for Obama didn't get Merrick Garland any slap it in our face and say he's proven innocent didn't even have a really the only investigation\nThat way when you say when you say phony investigation what do you mean who who are the witnesses or that\nThere were several there were several witnesses that the Ramirez woman\nI I understand they decide they made a decision they made it up because that was not their job what they were asked to do was to investigate Dr Ford and as far as Deborah Ramirez concern I mean\nCome on come on\nIt's it's the idea but in other words what they didn't do the FBI and I think we're right not to do it was go through a whole investigation of I'm Brett Kavanaugh is drinking habits when he was a freshman at\nYale or when he was a senior in high school\nBecause it was irrelevant the question was if if Deborah Ramirez has some magic witness that could could have for the fact which she even said by the way Deborah mayor as you said I was too drunk to really remember this is what you saw it happen\nDrinking habits when he was a freshman at Yale\nOr when he was a senior in high school why because it was irrelevant\nThe question was if if Deborah Ramirez had some magic witness that you

fact\nAnd this is the headache what relevance does it have to his qualifications to be on the Supreme Court low\nSo my feeling is he was treated and times better than Obama but and then Merrick Garland was\nOkay I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I guarantee you that Merrick Garland would prefer what happened with him which was great respect no one spoke harshly about and no one smearing him no one came up

as well it it was wrong for him given the fact that he's on the Supreme Court now to be so political to specifically blame the Clintons by name\nAnd there's another reason for that only ... the Clintons had much to do with it frankly I think that it was Dianne Feinstein and the people on the committee and the the whole thing was set up\nBut um I I I think he he made and and inappropriate

said\nNo we're talking about the highest court in Atlanta and even among knowledge meant there is problematic because forever now than they can raise real question and the rule on you\nKnow it ... let me give you an example I I've talked before on the show but not not enough length\nAbout the longest serving Supreme Court justice in history who was a big hero to liberals you know who it is right William oh Douglas from yeah come on Washington and justice Douglas or for thirty six years on the Supreme Court he wrote some of the most important legal decisions some of which are kind of nutty\nBut they're very important and justice Douglas had so many ethical problems and just named one of them he\nActually because he had so many alimony payments he had three ex wives\nAnd he he had to write little articles to help meet the expenses 'cause he wasn't generating enough money and he wrote articles for a guy who happen to be a pornographer who had a case before the courts\nAnd he later than pay the money back but he was caught with that and and that she also wrote articles that had appeared in like a magazines that were some justices thought were pornography he didn't\nAnd just that plus the fact that he got involved with a Twenty one year old would have been assigned to do a term paper and her college about justice Douglas he was married at the time he got involved with her it could be construed as sexual harassment and today's terms it didn't ruin his judgeship\nA and by the way there were attempts to impeach him and they were foolish and I oppose those

if it I just need to do the ... tree treatment at the is that the only thing I Need to do or how can I get rid of these ants\nWell tell me a little bit about what they're doing what what do you see these ants doing like cutting leaves and taken him to of ah their nest underground or anything like that by any chance for you there's a human the trees\nTheir their\nTheir hollowing out the hollowing out the inside of the tree I had no for an example I I'll tell you about the cedar tree the top started dying in it and it was out in the mail my past year and it was kinda in the way anyway so I just wouldn't cut it down and when I cut that top top that true yeah it would just hollowed out in there and ask 'em born out\nAnd and what country was it was a cedar tree\nWith evergreen okay alright heres Ruth in a rare with maybe the uh no I'm Talking about here aunts do not hurt a tree in any way except for one species that we would have in this call is why I ask you about it you see in bits of leaves being\nCaravan back to a hole in the ground and take an underground those the Texas leave ... they will\nDamage St ... when you see an inside lock your ... you saw something else calls the damage to the tree there just opportunistic and they go in there and\nAnd they'll do work on the dead in the ... part of the tree they did not the day was still living to issue so that you can\nKill me easily you can kill 'em with orange oil to houses of orange oil per gallon of water\nOr if you mix it into the gear or juice or works even better like we were talking about there but uh with ... you know whatever kind of pesticide you're using but uh you don't really need a it's a kill 'em you can scratch your head and wonder what causes it could have been\nA lightning strike it could have been of\nAn animal that you know I used to treat it because it was in stress or whatever and if that any of those things is is the case or the case is\nUh the sick applying the sick free treatment would definitely help other countries\nBecause if their interests are going to get an insect attack is going to get of bores I could have been one set it up in the beginning but you know something that will do damage to the tree can be prevented on the trees by the sick treat treatment\nOkay now the orange or you're talking about that's just a strike contact if I see the ant spraying it on them that way that they\nWill kill among contact but also functions as a repellent especially if they're a carpenter in which they probably are in your case\nOr it red and black\nYeah they're probably carpenter rents and the people that have had great luck using them in the house and killing them there or you know doing some damage in the house and a ... also discovered throughout all that process was the orange also sets up\nI was selling quality that keeps them away a long time it was okay\nBut six or eight minutes there and stresses of is needed the gym or anything else on put you on hold if

November let's go to let us go all the tax cuts work dot com\nAnd I'm Dennis ... this is the ultimate issues are where the third of our um Tuesday's so my question is do people prefer liberty where there'd be taken care of\n\nEverything in life is a value is is one of the revelations of the second half of my life I did not know this was a kid so many things that I just assumed were given like love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage that assumes that love and marriage\nOr she'll somewhat or automatic you you were you horse and carriage are pretty much are automatic the horse without the carriage nobody goes in the cards and character up the horse it doesn't move so they go together and so do love\nAnd marriage but it's not true marriage is a choice marriages valley even a value and we have enough talk these values and the and liberty is a value this is the one that shocked me this I I I\nFigured out the one on marriage but this one really surprise me liberty is not a year ending liberty is a value\nThat's correct that is correct\nSome of you may know the greatest ... a project of my life I've been engaged and now it's thirty year project and first of all you will be coming out next April commentary on the first five books in the Bible\nThe first one of them coming out with this book of exodus and it's fascinating how the Israel lights or liberated from Egypt and then constantly complain\nOh brings us back to Egypt at least we ate better there or imagined that the better there what is the slave mentality the slave mentality is\nHey\nI got taken care of I got three square meals they they took care of me medically I had no liberty but I was taking care of that is what the sleep mentality is that not all slaves were treated decently to say the least obvious but if you were decently treated\n\nYou weren't murdered you weren't weren't with if you did you work\nYou got fed\nLifers ... no I didn't have to worry about anything no one does she live on your part was necessary\nThat's that's not all that bad for the human the human human nature is not\nGeared toward yearning for freedom believe it or not\nIt's not you may think it is but it isn't\nThat's why that book is so powerful\nMaybe it's\nNot such a great idea to leave slavery habits you know they're all forms of slavery addiction as a form of slavery and ... they're not being poetic interest that you're you're a slave to whatever it is you're addicted to\n\nBut the the choice before Americans and before Europeans and before others is\nAre you prepared to give up liberty for the sake of being taken care of the answer is almost always yes and the more that you aren't given the more less freedom you really want\n\nIs the great experiment of the United states the great experiment\nHere to give up liberty for the sake of being taken care of the answer is almost always yes and the more that you or given the ... west freedom you really want\n\nThis is the great experiment of the United states the great experiment is liberty liberty in God we trust me ... more like cold Americans rented the book on the American troops still the best\n\nPeople are not necessarily in sync with us\n\nTake care of people take care of my you take care of me\nTake care of my children\nWhy people were home schooled their children are looked at very often negatively but a lot of other parents the states should teach your children who the hell are you to educate your own children\n\nSo this has been a revelation in my life is the ultimate issues our because this is an ultimate issue do we do we want to preserve liberty number one or take care of people\nRight take care take being taken care of\nNow obviously there's there's got to be an element of being taken care of we we all understand that but an element is not dominant which is dominant liberty or the other human being taken care of to the point where I don't want you to have the liberty to speak because what you say\nMay offend me is another example of liberty being downgraded on behalf of being taken care of I I don't want to hear anything that may hurt me\n\nOkay uh let's\nGo to a are too doesn't

today on the Supreme Court of the United states there in session it's October they were hearing oral arguments earlier today\nAnd I think justice Kavanaugh and yes now he is justice Kavanaugh not just judge Kavanaugh justice Kavanaugh spoke beautifully last night there was a real object lesson that I learned that I Want to share with everybody and it's a lesson about why some people are so indignant\nAbout fake news\nAnd that's not to say that I'm not big news about um indignant about this it's just that we've had bias in the media for a long long time but sometimes it's particularly egregious and I'll give you an example\nI um\nHad watched the news coverage early this morning about the ceremony last night which I had not seen a lot\nAnd the ceremony last night was in the White House with a President Trump welcoming the whole Kavanaugh family the two daughters who are so proud of their dad and his wife Ashley\nThat said judge Kavanaugh his wife Ashley\nAnd Justice Kennedy was there ... all the judges justices of the Supreme Court were there\nAnd\nWhat I heard about this event was oh it's too bad it was supposed to be such a nice event but Trump ruined dead as he often does because what he said was outrageous and he was so off the rails any ruined this event never before any spoiled that and it's disgusting and horrible\nAs you know what when you watch it that is simply not true\nAnd let me tell you one area where I honestly I think most of the coverage that I saw\nOn NBC and very much on CNN which is deliberately misleading they made it sound\nAs if a justice Kavanaugh spoke and spoke with dignity and then Trump spoke afterward and then ruined everything the justice but it wasn't like that because President Trump spoke first\nAnd he welcome people introduced every they all walked in together and then the president said thank you very much thank you members of Congress members of the cabinet honored yes and fellow Americans uh it's my privilege to address you tonight from the East Room of the White House\nAnd then after a welcoming everybody he said joining us for tonight's ceremony as every sitting Supreme Court justice chief justice\nRoberts thank you Justice Thomas thank you Justice Ginsburg thank you justice prior thank you Justice Alito thank you Justice Sotomayor thank you Justice Kagan thank you and justice Gorsuch

Senate confirmation process tested me as it is tested others it did not change me\nMy approach to judging remains the same a good judge must be an umpire neutral impartial decider who favors no lid again or policy a judge must be independent and must interpret\nThe law not make the law\nA judge must interpret statute says written and a judge must interpret the constitution is written informed by history and tradition and precedence\nOkay that's a judge now justice Brett Kavanaugh and\nMay he enjoy a long and distinguished career\nThe um [noise] ... okay you\nJust heard this now for a little bit of perspective this is what CNN had to say about it I mean you've heard it ... you've experienced yourself I have a whole text in front of me here's what Don Lemon on CNN had to say about this event\nSo this is a time when you might expect a president a president\nTo call for us to be put aside\nTo put aside our differences to call for unity or you might expect any other presidents and do that but not this one\nPresident from his actions and his words so you everything you need to know the president is using division as a weapon and he probably he is proud of every when he and his party yet no matter how much it costs Americans were proof\nRemember his divisive language tonight at justice cabinet swearing in prove that this president is our divider and she\nReally is that is that fair do you think when President Trump including his remarks said um\nIs that the U.S to read decade ourselves to the traditions and wisdom of our founders and a desire to us to renew the bonds

New Jersey Lou you're on the Michael Mann that show\nYour high high Iran right yeah um I mean I I don't you know when I look at what what he did he said he was completely um yeah proven to be innocent um he didn't he didn't investigate\nAll the people who were actual witnesses that we're likely witnesses that would have more information it was not a thorough process so from the Gulf around and\nDo that slap it in our face okay to lawyers they voted in two thousand twelve for Obama didn't get Merrick Garland any slap it in our face and say is proven innocent didn't even have a really the only investigation\nThat way when you say when you say phony investigation what do you mean who who are the witnesses or that\nThere were several there were several witnesses that the Ramirez woman\nI I understand they decide they made a decision they made it\nUp because that was not their job what they were asked to do was to investigate Dr Ford and as far as Deborah Ramirez is concerned I mean\nCome on come on\nIt's it's the idea but in other words what they didn't do the FBI and I think you're right not to do it was ... through a whole investigation of a Brett Kavanaugh's drinking habits when he was a freshman at Yale\nOr when he was a senior in high school\nWhy because it was irrelevant the question was if if Deborah Ramirez has some magic witness that you could put a for a fact which she even said by the way Deborah marriage she said I was too drunk to really remember this is what you saw it happen and it's a recovered memory and it was after the fact\nAnd this is the panic\nWhat relevance does it have to his qualifications to be on the Supreme Court low\nSo my feeling is he was treated and times better than Obama but and then Merrick Garland was\nOkay I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I guarantee you that Merrick Garland would prefer what happened with him which was great respect no one spoke harshly about him no one smearing him no one came up with things about his\nHe
