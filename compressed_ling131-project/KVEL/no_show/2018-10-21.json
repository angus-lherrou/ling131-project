along and there has\nBeen a great deal of good news uh there's more good news when you pick up the brand new book it it literally is just going to be arriving in stores if you ever used doors uh right now it's a book called Trump's ... inside the America First plan to revive our economy\nOf the book is by my friend's Stephen Moore and by professor Arthur Laffer a Steve congratulations on the book and it's very well time\nUh Iraq over like thanks so much for the nice guy words and I'd a lot of fun writing it you know with with my buddy art Laffer it was really just kind of first hand account of when we started working with Donald Trump back in the early ... thousands sixteen\n... them and and I do think a lot of people including me a reading some of your personal descriptions of coming into Trump's office and the way he interacts with people it's reassuring it's it's sort of different portrayal\nThan what you get in mainstream media yesterday everybody in the in the press and you of course have been one of President Trump's economic advisors since the campaign\nBut uh people are fixated on this alleged shouting match between John Bolton and and um and John Kelly the White House chief of staff and are they all these stories of White House chaos that's not what you see at least that's what you indicate in the book\nBut Trump is a person who likes to actually have differing views at the table you know so we used to have arguments all the time I mean I like them I mean I like Donald Trump a lot personally is a is a fun person to be around these actually can very gracious these very charming and\nOur attentive uh he would like to put two or three people on the table and district ... disagreeing positions you know are we do get out and I need\nEach other to make up his mind which I think is a good thing that's what a businessman does\nAh so you know so what if they're shouting at each other you know he wants to have a ... he doesn't want to be surrounded by bus yes not and and I think that's a that's a good thing\nAbout Donald Trump but you know I'll correct you on just one thing is that Michael when you said that I I kind of reached humming along what I did I think you're under stadium is I this is a full fledged boom or on right now\nYou know as you know I was out in Seattle what about a month ago when I was in your studio and I was you know I've gone everywhere from Portland, Oregon Portland Maine in ... in between and everywhere I go I'll I see is you know I saw this in Seattle I thought when I see it San Francisco I see it you know Nashville, Tennessee in Denver, Colorado and\nUh you know Austin, Texas everywhere just a friend's everywhere buildings going up skyscrapers factories warehouses biggest construction boom in history in this country is going on right now everybody's so bullish on America they want to build a lot of it as foreign investment money that's coming in\nTo the United states uh we have what you know every time I Do your show I liked the you know I'm ... another statistic uh first of all we got the\nIndustrial production numbers came out there like the highest ever and that we the the seven point one million you know the statistics seven point one million more jobs that Americans to fill them that's amazing\nAnd that's part of the problem we have right now with all of these people streaming toward the border and that caravan I'd let me let me go to one of the oil and I just interrupt you for sure\nIt's interesting you brought that up I was watching CNN Today and they were saying um that the number of people crossing the border illegally has actually increased in hundred Donald\nTrump ally ally ... and I\nYou know and they they were showing the statistics and by the way the number of people cross the border under Obama what way way way way out but you know why that was right\nYeah just people didn't get jobs exactly there were no traps year yeah so the\nThe real reliable cure to illegal immigration is basically a lousy economy\nExactly you know actually when we had the terrible recession more people left the United states\nYou know the statistics seven point one million more jobs that Americans to fill them that's amazing\nAnd that's part of the problem we have right now with all of these people streaming toward the border and that caravan I'd let me let me\nGo to one of the oil and I just interrupt you for one sure\nIt's interesting you brought that up I was watching CNN Today and they were saying um that the number of people crossing the border illegally has actually increased in under Donald\nTrump ally ally ... and I you know and they they were showing the statistics and by the way\nThe number of people cross the border under Obama went way way way way out but you know why that was right\nYeah because people didn't get jobs exactly there were no helps her yeah so the the real\nReliable cure to illegal immigration is basically a lousy economy\nExactly you know actually when we had the terrible recession more people left the United states that came into the United states so you know this was almost a sign of prosperity that people from around the world want to come here because there's a lot of economic opportunity but they never connected the dots on CNN on that you know uh but they but this a sign that it might incidentally\nYou and I agree on this we need a lot more legal immigrants in this country we need more\nPeople in the farm farm workers and we need more service workers and we knew him read more technology workers and and I used to tell Donald Trump I don't do this you know it and it's in the book\nWe say through build that wall Donald make sure it has the gate so people can come in legally\nAh the book is called Trump's ... inside of the America First plan to revive our economy but you don't believe that President Trump should allow this a ... a caravan from Honduras which is marching forward with Honduran flags by the way that they should allow the caravan into the country do\nYou know I'm actually watching on the on the screen I'm watching CNN as we talk a and I'm I'm watching all these people are you know look no there has to be out there has to be some orderly\nAbsolutely right yeah yeah I mean we we are absolutely agree on that let me let me go back to to one thing that the Democrats have been lying about and they literally lie about this every day and the media never call them on and\nThey claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and help to design that those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues that's just a flat on line isn't it\nYeah revenues are actually out that this year so we passed the biggest tax cuts and three years and we actually have a slight increase rep is not what I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy\nUh continue to grow you you know the best way to get tax revenues headed for people to work at ... businesses profitable businesses back to the United states which is happening uh but yeah the problem is spending and you know people I say oh you're just a robbery Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans\nAnd Democrats this bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for that\nYou like a president's from some idea of ask along every department to five percent yes\nI Love that you know that's where businesses do\nYou know that that's the thing if you're running a business\nAnd you don't have enough money coming in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your agency and this is what businesses did during the recession they talked in their stomach\nThey tighten their belts they got rid of inefficient workers and inefficient services and things they didn't need and they save money and they became profitable again we never do that in government and by the way I Would like to hear one listener\nOf your show Paul endear show and tell me you can't say five cents on the dollar\nThat right it well exactly ... what about the one aspect and you mentioned this in your book Trump ... posted up at our website at Michael ...\nThe one aspect of Trump's America First program that he talked about in the campaign was infrastructure that he's really done pretty much nothing to implement a where's the money going to come from to do the big infrastructure improvements that we need\nWell let me go back to what I was just saying about this construction boom that's going on in this country factories\nAnd warehouses and and apartments and\nThat that isn't for structure really we need pipelines we need a lot of Alan gee terminals we need oil refineries we you know the point I'm making is a lot of that infrastructure and we need in this country you know rebuilding our ports\nWas evil in the last two years I've seen through\nThat as evil in North Korea were American student Otto Warmbier was tortured\nWith evil in the last few years I've seen we have some serious political differences here at home but our opponents are not evil just our apartment\nWe are blessed with the political system that allows us to resolve\nOur differences peacefully in the end we recognize that we are all Americans and we are stronger and healthier

some\nBrain or the bar tiny little heat waves to lose sunrise engineering [noise]\nThrills restroom showers et cetera um and so what ultimately happened is one day ... daughter in the hour go environmental to protect her privacy something the school didn't do here was excuse to go to the restroom\nAnd a boy in her class that identifies as ginger fluid with also excused and while Pashtuns daughter was using the restroom to boy came in\nAgain allowed under this policy and sexually assaulted posh his daughter a ... that evening I learned about her daughter telling her what happened and was shocked as any parent would be the here that this happened to her daughter\nAnd she talks to the school officials and finds out that this happened because the schools transgender policy\nSpecifically allowed this boy to use the girl facilities\nOkay is there a is their policy if the schools just basically any restroom you want to go to that it is it's fairly fairly easy for a boy to go into the girls restroom\nThat's right it all it takes is for students to assert that their gender fluid or identify as the opposite gender and they are allowed by the school to use these facilities a play on sports teams whatever they want to that embraces that gender identity that's different than their biological\nSay okay I assume that when you say that the little girl five years old was molested she was touched was more than just a her feeling uncomfortable\nThat's exactly right that this was a um touching in a private area I won't go into a lot of the ... hills but um and it's something\nThat we would all be involved I of course of the pollen anybody who has children or grandchildren is going to be appalled by that so so what happened Pasha went to the school authorities are looking obviously for some justice and probably looking to correct this policy what the school authorities said or\nYet no justice was given you would think the school with the very least would reconsider this policy um they refused to do so you would think the school might at least say well let's\nTransfer the boy to another classroom because remember they share the same classroom the school refused to do that as well so Pasca was left with no choice but to do with any parent would do take her doubt daughter away from the harmful situation and that's when she reached out to us and and we've been involved in in helping or seek the justice at the school district refused to offer her daughter\nOkay now let me make clear we're not talking about Portland, Oregon or Bennington, Vermont this is Decatur, Georgia wouldn't you think that there would be more upholding of a a traditional commonsense values\nYeah you would think so schools everywhere have a constitutional duty to protect the privacy and safety of their students and it's just common sense that\nGirls go into girls restrooms voice go into a boys and if you've got a student that's struggling with issues you can accommodate that you can allow him to use a teacher's restroom a single use their facility but you never allow them into facilities\nAt the opposite sex and this demonstrates why but this common sense even in places like Georgia is being thrown out the window because of this gender identity ideology being forced on our school kids\nOkay as so Pasha Thomas who by the way as African American not that it matters but uh and it's usually you things that people on the left would have sympathy for an African American mother who is doing a beautiful job trying to raise their children\nUm what what happens next here ... alliance defending freedom you've taken this to the education department is that right\nThat's exactly right so ah the school district was relying on a an old guidance issued under the Obama department of education that it's it's been rescinded and we brought this to the attention of the department of education and they have now launched an investigation that were encouraged by that we're glad to see the federal government taken seriously\nLooking into whether the school district has violated federal law as a result of this dangerous transgender bathroom policy\nOkay as so a ... in the best case\nScenario or what happens next what happens to address the concerns of this brave mother in Decatur, Georgia\nI think first we're hoping the department finds that the school was violated federal law and hold them accountable for that and to the school has to revoke this policy this is not working it is causing harm like what happened to ... daughter there are better solutions\nBut the common sense solution should be never allow a boy into the girls restrooms or vice versa those are supposed to be private intimate places that are reserved for students that designated sex they're better solution than what the ... tape Decatur school district it here\nOkay I'm speaking to match they amassed sharp who is a senior counsel for the

of the things about the name id that is I before I knew how to read and write you know almost three I had learned what's your name\nIs Michael ... and what's that Medford no Michael Melville no it's Medvedev the DVD and you learn when you're a little kid and you have a name that's a little bit more difficult one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is\nOur phone number ... meanwhile they're ah\nThere is continued discussion about Elizabeth Warren but that hasn't touched on the Disney movie Pocahontas we can get to that let me go to Tim in Pasadena Tim you're on the ...\nOf Michael a recall or\nIf you if you don't think I'll go to Eli people for people\nAnd getting their face and restaurants which I think Iraq we led to the shooting of that guy at the baseball field you don't think that evil and the person that said that is an evil\nOkay well you know as a Tim you're totally distorting things obviously the shooting at the at the baseball field was evil Maxine Waters made that comment about getting in people's faces months after that happened and after the matter is that\nThat philosophy all along anyway I don't like building a liberal for years okay you're having to admit it was like OK hardly through admit\nIt you don't know me up on this I have a lot to say that little girl in the bathroom you don't think about what happened that little growing up that comes

the idea of equating one thing and another\nIs is simply wrong and I I Do believe that one of the terrible things have politicians do sometimes they don't take evil seriously enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision\nWhere the Washington state Supreme Court ah basically said that uh they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who had committed murder before the age of Eighteen no it's a life in prison and that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults\nBut for people convicted of murder\nAs adults who are convicted for crimes committed before the\nWell you know now you know guys now as evil that does now is a killer and and he actually went to prison for being a killer look at him the the idea of equating one thing and another\nIs is simply wrong and I I Do believe that one of the terrible things that politicians do sometimes they don't take evils seriously enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision where the Washington state Supreme Court ah basically said\nThat ah they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who had committed murder before the age of Eighteen no it's the life imprisonment that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults but for people convicted of murder\nAs adults who are convicted for crimes committed before they're Eighteen you can't give life imprisonment anymore\nNow that is a manner of coddling evil and then you hear some of the stories of this that I think it's profoundly wrong but see we we lose the battle him if we lose the language\nAnd evil loses all of its meaning if you're talking about silly stupid are irresponsible Maxine Waters\nAnd equating her with are these people in Pakistan who were literally committing murder and wanting to execute a woman because she said that uh Jesus died for the sins of humanity and the profit didn't\nUm okay you get hurt you with her and that's fine but the idea of putting someone in jail and are threatening to execute here and then murdering politicians what a defender that seems to me as a very different matter\nAnd this is also one of the problems that the people hadn't and there were\nPeople of this nature or Stalin was evil Hitler was evil\n[noise] um you know I I it's funny we hear that a lot and obviously there was

and by the way I passed some people this morning they were running sprinkler systems\nOne of the first things I put in this column a about a two wet soil and what to do the first and foremost thing has just turned the sprinkler system off\nFor Pete's sakes people to leave it\nRunning leave it set on a an automatic setting there really\nOught to be some serious serious\nFines for people out there I was talking to Bob Webster on his show in San Antonio yesterday about it and he said that down there they're enforcing it pretty well the the water\nOf cops are out there and they'll take a picture of you run in sprinkler system and you will get a hefty fine I don't the Dallas has the same kind of a\nRules and regulations but I just don't see it being enforced that much at all we have a school down them away from our house in Dallas and Jews and after this for a long time they continue to leaving on automatic and let it run even during periods and we're trying to get something to happen\nThere and so wherever you are you going to help those kinda things with your own property with other people to that'd be that'd be good so um anyway the turf if you look at it and you see great big\nUh blobs of yellow that are ... that are yellow\nCircles or the free forum shaped me shapes and they grow and sometimes the yellow will be stronger on the outside of the ages of those uh spots\nIn the in a little bit better\nColor inside that's brown patch and brown patch this year has been around since the middle of the summer we had some really good\nRain events in the summer that were interspersed in you know between extremely hot periods in that stress the turf quite a bit and the the brown patch started showing up earlier than normal\nUsually it's ... it's a fall kind of a fungal problem but not always\nThe other thing is if you look out and you see the turf just kind of a yellow color kind of fading the green is is fading to a a a lighter color and even trying to get to\nA yellow if you look closely at it a lot of times in that case you'll see these little gray or brown spots on this especially St Augustine grass is going to happen on lawyers you know the grass as well but mostly you see it on St Augustine grass\nThat's called ... leaf spot and ... also both of these or fungal diseases they just happened to\nBe two different species and then the third thing that you can see is a\nA color change in the turf and it's dark dying but there is no pattern to it it's kind of a ... just looks like\nAnd it's tilted in and uh you know pack in from all this rain too so or a answers for all of 'em all talk about I Want to come back basically it's going to be the use hydrogen peroxide and corn meal and some other related\nMeal not calling gluten meal and not

search for Paul robust and tomato comes right up to in fact biker creatures to first first one that comes up on search R O B e yeah so when I Believe that's right\nUh let's see what else do I do not get finished talking about for you there was one other recruiter related saying oh the trees we never got back to the tree health on this\nA range situation wet story a lot of people\nHave I guess the most common question that I've gotten this what about the ... the water that standing in the depression\nOkay\nOkay\nAll right good luck that's a good thing to think about one of the tests that we did a few years ago by the telephone number is eight six six four four four three four seven eight we did newsletters and\nI think that was more news calling a bunch of things some years ago about what's the best way to get to ... to\nA ripe and uh if if you got green tomatoes on the planet and here comes from frost you know a cold weather's coming which will follow them up I mean uh you know good for all of us will mess up those uh those green tomatoes on your on your plants\nAnd so I had a question in my own mind and we threw it out on the air and we got there and people to try and we did it at our office in at home as well we put some of the green tomatoes that we picked just out on the table you know just left exposed\nWe put 'em in left some in some containers ... as well\nOthers we covered with paper and put a lid on it and put 'em in the dark walk a lot of people will recommend\nAnd let's see what else do we do is seems like we did one other tests we did we set them up in several different different situations we brought some of them in the house we left some outside in the garage and in the bar and you know different kinds of conditions\n[laughter] and the bottom line on it I think we made an injury on the uh in the library on their docks dot com about it for sure we did the bottom line on this a little research project that we did was they didn't make a hill of beans no matter what we did they all ripened inside\nThe house after being pigs and some of them ripened the whole outfit will tell you that if you if you take a knife and slice through the tomato and it cuts the seed they're not mature enough to riot but\nBut if you cut through the to my uh and the knife pushes the to the side you know they're the see the somebody that has\nA matured enough to worry will ripe than in a long way away and see that we saw that all of them\nOr turn red to a certain degree plus the fact worst case scenario you just cook fried green tomatoes which are pretty good maker relish do bunch of things so\nJust because a frost is coming if your plants are still loaded with the tomatoes you can end up with some really useful\nOf a fruit from them and if you've got one or the end determinant like we were just talking about the continues to grow tomatoes continue to grow at the top of the cage and\nFall over the place one as you can leave them falling all over the place that's fine I I tend to uh take that condition pretty well I used to know a professional grower that grew him\nIn almost a dry land situation he wanted a little bit but not a lot and he let them just ramble on the ground\nAnd had really good production one of the ah thoughts there is doing that and kind of rough on them up from time to time with the uh you know with a bamboo sticker within a whole a tennis racket or something like that actually helped reduction and I think it does I've seen very strong evidence of it\nAre doing than having them ramble around on the ground works pretty good too except for the fact that if you have turtles around or something some animals around it just makes it a lot easier for them to get to the tomatoes and get 'em before\nOr you can get them but the what was the other thing or the ... out of and\nThis question or his come up the last couple of times I've spoken to the events this question comes up and I wanted to address a dawned on me I haven't really addressed it on the\nAir in a while and that is why organics lot of people are\nAre still recommending chemicals still recommending things I don't recommend the synthetic fertilizers and the\nToxic chemical pesticides like seven and round up and uh or thing into Ford the dies monitors man there's been some conversation lately about the administration our gas or somebody PI or somebody\nBringing a core purify back on the market and I sure hope that's not the case that it's a ... fan\nAnd it needs to stay gone I think you can probably still by news in Niger agricultural situations but from a homeowner standpoint it really should be gone from all those things the the control that the reason that I recommend organics is not\nA\n... the number one thing is not from an environmental standpoint that I'm trying to save the environment save the planet save people uh\nThat's important is very important it's not the main reason I recommend organics and uh I don't recommend or gas because it's you know touchy feely right thing to do the reason I recommend the natural organic program\nThe main reason all these things reasons but the main reason I Do is it works better it works better in every way\nFrom uh uh\nHaving fun standpoint you don't have to uh fertilize and treat pass as often because you don't have fast is often when you have an stressed plants idolize stress plants that reminds me some\nOf it it just it's better you don't have to do things a nearly as often you don't ask subject yourself in worry about being around the chemicals breathing and things and all that of course that's that's part of it but the main thing is it just\nGives you better production without question we've got all kinds of of ah a proof of this one out of them was with pecan experiments down in Hamilton taxes the taste of food is greatly enhanced by the organic program that's not the main reason I recommend it is that's another great reason\nBut it just works better more production if you do it right if you use the kind of a program and technique that we recommend the products that we recommend\nAnd the or the other thing is you just don't have the problem\nA pain relief will be for you to go and buy some of the products for a buck for a dollar and or give it a try I'm very very good pain relief products that are recommend you give a shot and that's a great way to get some for a very low rise\nOr let's say um [noise]\nA couple of people who are talking about the robust into my apparently\nFolks have tried it and it's a really absolutely

you put down the drama last just right now at twenty pounds for one thousand square feet especially since you just getting started with the new property there\nThe it'll really kick the biological

elementary school and cry and I've done this in the past it at home or use any kind of the the galvanized jobs that are too for about two for about ... okay\nAnd uh I just want that briefly tell you what I've done in the past and see if there's anything I Need to do different ...\nUh you know to to avoid filling that much volume with expensive material what I've done in the past just by our house\nAnd put it in the bottom to to raise the level and then you know my my solo mixture above that are about you know ... foot\n... that that sounds reasonable that's an interesting approach that I had never thought of a alfalfa\nHay is expensive I guess is the first thing that goes through my mind and your ... at that I'm ... and those kind of containers you're gonna be having it below\nYou put the high end and then you put how many inches of\nThe of the soil on top of it about a foot yeah yeah and I'll\nSay I'll tell you what made me think of it is a lawyer older books or you remember that side by side comparison I think it was at Mississippi State or that groups and made a straight into\nWell that was actually a a a a harried vantage that they planted as a\nCover crop moderate weather researchers yeah if they find out they planted hairy men edge on the bed and grew it\nFrom the fall through the winter and then in the spring this is probably where you thought it was a mall they simply moded\nAnd left it on the bed as a mulch\nAnd then they planted the tomatoes right into the still their roots of the Harry vantage they didn't steal they didn't fertilizer into anything and they had tremendous reduction in better production then the beds where they killed and put in fertilizer and all that\nKind of strikes what you're talking\nAbout I'm a mall and over in my mind the the problems that could come from it is burying organic material and was alfalfa you got some protein in their you know that's a wonderful organic fertilizer of alfalfa\nAnd it's a wonderful a top dressing most too because the carbon nitrogen balance being so good just as good as ... and I'm In a lot of ways\nIt out I used it in my vegetable bed or march a consistently good results from that\nWhile I'm a little worried about burying it is the is the problem Neal if you bury it twelve inches deep you're gonna have twelve inches of soil on top of it is going to be kinda anaerobic uh there's not going to be made ... down there and I\nI think that it's yeah it it's gonna\nProbably rod but it's gonna run kind of an anaerobic why and when the roots\nOf your food crops hit that there may be some damage I'm not saying it's it's a bad idea because I've never done it it just I'm just trying to think of what the possible uh problems with it might be why don't you don't you do this if you can set it up to do that will set up an experiment here\nWhere you do that in one or more of the beds and then in ... or more the beds\nIn the bottom instead of putting hey let's just put native\nSoil just the combat inexpensive soil\nThat you can buy and then have the twelve inches ten to twelve inches of improved you know a ... type stuff above that and let's see which way works the best\n[noise] uh well the only other thing I'm Wondering about is ah in the past I've just done like the general soil as with all the things that you typically recommend some drama last just a rock powders and\nA compost cow manure and that kind of thing but uh I Wonder is there any kind of a resource where you can go to a sort of figure out how to target your soil next to a particular crop\nI don't think you need to do that with the organic program which got such a nice shotgun effect you don't need to really worry about the issues are good\nBasic compiling sought to begin with a spruce up with the rock minerals and the\nPowders there's there's a company down as a year in Fort Worth the coming down south of Dallas to the has the lava saying that I recommend that they mix with their own compost reaches rice called GW G\nA wood products down there and that would be a real\nGood way to know that you have a high quality starting off\nWith whatever you do just take the party and saw that you use and improve it with uh the rock minerals like lava staying in as them I should be used as part of the mix\nDrama last as like you say in a you know maybe some alfalfa as the of fertilizer even though you're going to have alfalfa and the base of some of those things I think you will have a real good experiment I'm going\nOkay All right uh that all sounds good\nTo appreciate too thanks okay thank you let's go\nTo Steve in holding a long time in a album Texas Hi Steve\nHello how I was going on\nAh well I'm ... and a lot of my hope is that they can neither\nOkay she's put down here that you're an alibi Texas here in Athens, Texas yeah okay All right yeah we had a great\nTime and Mother Earth and ah that reminds me of one little story I Need to tell when a when you and I get through about one thing I ran into there\nOkay what kind of leave for a class I got a question own cops come and it ... a comment and question about garlic smoker\nOr a lot of light is brand to wander phone now and she said next time\nI got a chance to talk to ask you a could do like off the page of cops come home and put it in water I really like to do that\nOr any of the amaranth as was just on ... ... is really pretty easily so I'd say yeah if you do the stadium you couldn't just break off of flower these but if you\nDid a show them now you know I think it would really pretty easily it for you yeah\nWonderful a while and now you mentioned and garlic far far a pat down the times the little guy like food and that's the man I'm mad ... mhm\nNo um we always give our dog part of what we eat and I use a lot of garlic lightly I got that out of watching his ... and ... are getting down let's let some of our garlic powder\nAnd over the next few hours I'd see him come up to the top all week and groggy\nI'm I'm just curious as that says you don't live on ... and the cat didn't garlic went up to that say that\nWell every time I bring up garlic myself and we used to recommend a commercial product that was wonderful that had garlic in it their time I brought it up you know they have several people listeners and everybody in the business and everything else say that you know that there's toxic for dogs and uh just like\nYou're saying there but I've never seen or saying I'd never seen evidence\nOut of the way we cook with a lot of garlic and we we definitely let our dogs lick the plates and have a some of our food I Try to keep a large chunk of it away but I don't I don't think it's a problem but I don't know for sure because there's sure a lot of vets say it is a is a problem\nUm the um\nThe fleas you might want to look at the product of if you want to use one of the products on like the toxic ones with the one called revolution is a pharmaceutical product and you might look at that if they continue to have\nSleep problems but I personally am why here I don't I don't have a big problem with the garlic if that's a helping with the problem\nAnd then and he's never had any problem with the guy in bad taste in ... in it Scarlett out are off the floor that had\nDropped out in our never hurried well I appreciate the or the feedback on it will see a now many people call me and write me and say it's a bad idea but if it's working for you keep on going\nHow ties back to ...\nLike you to talk to you later yeah that's the one that comes up all the time and the other one is a ... and I eat\nA lot of Colorado and I tend to try to keep it away from them but a a wall nut is another one that's on that list of being highly toxic chocolate it is\nTo try to keep it away from them but a a wall nut is another one that's on that list of being highly toxic chocolate is I think it definitely is I think the worst one for dogs uh that that could be a problem to get into around a lot of households\nIs the um the artificial sweeteners that a lot of of foods and um does our tall I think is the name of it it's extremely toxic supposedly for\nAnimals for ... dogs

answer is it just depends on which way you want to go\nBut uh that's not the right answer so here's a place that leads forth as the word education means that goes to lead fourth and he'll sell the understand true education means pursuing the highest answer to the question which way is fourth\nCorrect it was all true may sound corny but it is true they'll they'll students are challenged to discover the right way forth by the way there are people as a result of these Hillsdale things now send their\nKids to hills though it's a it's a it's not even I don't even think it's part of their thinking when they have us speak about feels about I I it it's okay it's a good benefits\nIt holds a unique an important role in American education today teaching things that matter in life things that are good in true and beautiful Hill's college is impacting not just students on campus but students across America with their free online courses\nImpacting for the good home schoolers and charter schools which last night I was in Denver fundraiser for ... are you there was a woman there whose kids are the are the Hillsdale charter school in Denver she's thrilled with it\nSo all all I they ask is that you go to a prayer for hills they learn what they're doing\nA lot of money request that's a big deal of support the good guys in\nThis case it's just moral support and being aware I encourage all of you to learn more about this remarkable institution a prayer for Hillsdale Dennis Prager here one eighth Prager seven seven six\n... it's a\nIt's a very yeah it's a very upsetting thing when people sort of take the easy way out on moral issues\nIt is very easy and it is proper to condemn the show humor is totally proper the question is after the condemnation what is it that you want the loss of the moral big picture is very disturbing the enemy at this time it's not Saudi Arabia\nIs a profoundly flawed ally\nWhen you're fighting evil you don't only have allies who sit down and read the federalist papers daily\nRight that's the way it works that's part of the reasons that I find that so disgusting that adults believe people were basically good it's a five year old believes that it's excusable the for the ... believes that he's a fool\nThe same people who believe people were basically good get all all frazzled when there is no when when something bad happens oh gee where did that come from\nLet's let's cut off arms sales that way we can strengthen the Iran which never kills people like the show ... [laughter] ... bought I got a good chance to feel good about myself\nI Am cutting off sales to Saudi Arabia\nMhm\nIt's like the condemnations of Israel which is hardly a Saudi Arabia right it's a oh it's an ally of it's a\nAnd they they have this proportion it's the same people with the on the show issue all the ones who are fish for poor Israel's disproportional response not everybody there are some people\nWho have their moral compass right and and I wanted to say again that murder of his show is despicable\nIn life the question is not only correctly labeling bad acts as bad acts it's what do you do about them afterwards\nSee\nThat's that's the way it works a ... in the real world real world is not pleasant\n\nAnd then the real world you will fight evil with people who are morally\nTroubled themselves and in\nThis case it Saudi Arabia and ironically it's happening when Saudi Arabia is becoming a morally better place that's the irony\nAlright\nFeinstein Feinstein wants to reopen Kavanaugh hearings if the Democrats take control of the Senate Dianne Feinstein his so deteriorated this moral figure\nOr because of the running against a radical leftist she's just the regular leftist Kevin ... um so for her the issue is how do I win\nNot waters right\nWill open hearings again on the Supreme Court justice I Want you to understand something about the Democratic party\nAnd in this case it Saudi Arabia and ironically it's happening with Saudi Arabia is becoming a morally better place that's the irony\nRight\nLike steam Feinstein wants to reopen Kavanaugh hearings for Democrats ... ... the Senate Dianne Feinstein says so Syria rabid as moral figure\nBecause of the running against the radical left is she's just the regular leftist Kevin Philly um\nSo for her the issue is how do I win not waters right they will open hearings again on the Supreme Court justice I Want you to understand something about the Democratic party today because it's a left wing liberal party\nEvery institution it doesn't control wishes to destroy you realize that\nIt doesn't control the electoral college it wishes to destroy\nIt does it wishes to and the electoral college\nIt doesn't control the Supreme Court for the first time in my lifetime and the lifetime of any of these senators so it calls the court illegitimate that it's a regular phrase\nThe the court has no longer Supreme Court has no longer seen as legitimate because it's not like if it's not left it's a legitimate you understand\nIt's a force for chaos left as it is a false that just really a tornado of destruction\nNow where was the article about how the Senate protects white voters against black voters and Hispanic voters did you see that it was the Washington Post I think what it might have been the New York times\n\nAnyway this is a good example people have written things about the show ... let's say they're not true so then you have what do you do with not true thing you battle then withdrew things that it's the whole point of free speech you paddle untruth with troops\nAnyway Twitter risk is committed to truth or as a as a I don't know\nWhat could I mean what good at a modern algae comes to mind as people living in sub Saharan Africa are committed to a to us loving that was what came to mind whether example\nAll right\nThe big believer in home security big big big big believer in like a big believer in life insurance and health insurance an earthquake ensure\nLenders are eager for news talk change the law\nTechnology truth to buy like fruit you have fourteen Logan passwords Andrew can't remember any of them died one or two is awesome are getting awesome one two three\nTruth heat so easy to switch and save on car insurance I Tyco dot com is super cool ... percent underscore exclamation point exclamation point Nineteen eighty five\n...

Do think militants uncompromising secularism has become something of religion in the United\nStates we're joined about Saudi Arabia turkey hockey's done\nWell how bout Decatur, Georgia there's a case in Decatur, Georgia that is just unbelievable as an assault not only on religious faith but on common sense\nAnd it's one of those cases that I think should convince you about why you have to get involved the alliance defending freedom because they're standing up for people who are victimized by this kind of insanity and one of the people\nWho is doing the most to stand up to this kind of sanity as our guest his name is Matt Sharp he is a senior counsel for the ATF the alliance defending freedom a man thanks very much for joining us thank you for having me\nOkay we've played tape before on this show of Pasha Thomas maybe you can explain who she is and what happened to her five year old daughter back a less than a year ago in two thousand Seventeen go ahead\nWith right so cautious daughter\nOr is it a school that had with little notice the parents adopted a transgender bathroom policy with essentially said boys if they identify as a girl\nCan use the girl facilities use the girls restroom showers et cetera um and so what ultimately happened is one day cautious daughter in the hour we're going by our national to protect her privacy something the school didn't do here\nWas excuse to go to the restroom a and a boy in her class that identifies is gender fluid with also excused and while Pashtuns daughter was using the restroom the boy came in\nAgain allowed under this policy and sexually assaulted posh his daughter a posture went home that evening I learned about at her daughter telling her what happened and was shocked as any parent would be to hear that this happened to her daughter\nAnd she talks to the school officials and finds out that this happened because the schools transgender policy\nSpecifically allowed this boy to use the girl facilities\nOkay is there a is there a policy of the schools just basically ... any restroom you want to go to that it is it's fairly fairly easy for a boy to go into the girls restroom\nThat's right it all it takes is for students to assert that their gender fluid or identify as the opposite gender and they are allowed by the school to use these facilities a play on sports teams whatever they want to that embraces that gender identity that's different than their biological\nSay okay I assumed that when you say that the little girl's five years old was molested she was touched was more than just a her feeling uncomfortable\nThat's exactly right that this was a um touching in a private area I won't go into a lot of the ... hills but um and it's something\nThat we would all be involved I of course with the ball and anybody who has children or grandchildren is going to be appalled by that so so what happens Pasha went to the school authorities are looking obviously for some justice and probably looking to correct this policy what the school authorities say to her\nYeah no justice was given you would think the school with the very least would reconsider this policy um they refused to do so you would think the school might at least say well let's\nTransfer the boy to another classroom because remember they share the same classroom the school refused to do that as well so Pasca was left with no choice but to do with any parent what they would take her doubt daughter away from the harmful situation and that's when she reached out to us and and we've been involved in in helping or seek the justice at the school district refused to offer her daughter\nOkay now let me make clear we're not talking about Portland, Oregon or Bennington, Vermont\nThis is Decatur, Georgia wouldn't you think that there would be more upholding of a a traditional commonsense values\nYeah you would think so schools everywhere have a constitutional duty to protect the privacy and safety of their students and it's just common sense that\nGirls go into girls restrooms boys go into a boys and if you've got a student that's struggling with issues you can accommodate that you can allow him to use a\nTeacher's restroom a single use or facility but you never allow them into facilities or the opposite sex and this demonstrates why but this common sense even in places like Georgia is being thrown out the window because of this gender identity ideology being forced on our school kids\nOkay and so Pasha Thomas who by the way as African American not that it matters but uh uh it's usually you things that people on the left would have sympathy for an African American mother who's doing a beautiful job trying to raise their children\nUm what what happens next year ... alliance defending freedom you've taken this to the education department is that right\nThat's exactly right so ah the school district was relying on a an old guidance issued under the Obama department of education that it's it's been rescinded and we brought this to the attention of the department of education and they have now launched an investigation that were encouraged by that we're glad to see the federal government taking this seriously\nLooking into whether the school district has violated federal law as a result of this dangerous transgender bathroom policy\nOkay as so a ... in the best case scenario or what\nI should Thomas who by the way as African American not that it matters but uh and it's usually you think that people on the left would have sympathy for an African American mother who's doing a beautiful job trying to raise their children\nUm what what happens next year ... alliance defending freedom he's taken this to the education department is that right\nThat's exactly right so the school district was an old guidance issued under the Obama department of education that it's it's been ... and we brought this to the attention of the department of education and they launched an investigation that were encouraged by that we're glad to see the federal government taking this seriously\nLooking into whether the school district has violated federal law as a result of this dangerous transgender bathroom policy\nOkay as so a ... in the best case scenario or what happens next what happens to address the concerns of this brave mother in Decatur, Georgia\nI think first we're hoping the department finds that the school was violated federal law and hold them accountable for that and to the school has to revoke this policy is is not working and it's causing harm like what happened to Pashtuns daughter there are better solutions\nBut the common sense solution should be never allow a boy into the girls restrooms or vice versa those are supposed to be private intimate places that are reserved for students that designated sex\nOr better solution than what the ... the cater school district did hear\nOkay I'm speaking to match they matched sharp who is a senior counsel for the alliance defending freedom and he's one of those terrific attorneys that I've told you about who um I give heart and soul to this cause now not everybody is in a position to give heart and soul and legal skill to this cause but everybody's in a position\nTo give a donation and it's really important because right now even with a much more sympathetic\nAdministration in Washington DC religious liberty is still under assault and it's under a saw 'em by bureaucrats by local officials by school board\nIn many many different areas and right now you're on something of a winning streak over at ATF aren't you\nWe have we've had some incredible when from the Baker jak fill up to defending pregnancy care centers and most recently she Cochran also in Atlanta getting a one

period is a great film I think the same is true ... or maybe fantasia\nOkay that that they these are amazing artistic achievements they're just amazing film and they have everything going for them and the idea that they are now being criticized now let me just say\nThere are aspects of these films that are badly dated where political correctness has actually lead to some corrections I've I'll give you an example of a lot of people may not know this but I've actually seen the original form of fantasia\nAnd fantasia for those who don't know it's a movie made by the Disney people and ... was very

honestly I'm not making this up this was in the original movie and at the time I guess it was considered funny but it's profoundly offensive and racist and you'll pardon me I'm not endorsing it I think they did the right thing to take it out of the film but they had\nThis little black scent or shining the hubs of the of the other centers and it it detracted from the movie and it was horrible and they changed it but I don't believe that kissing\nSnow White counts as that\nAnd by the way when I was mentioning cure a nightly criticizing the Little Mermaid was for a cure nightly said she was

a the idea of the kids know best which is a very regular theme and a lot of films for children that parents are daughter and foolish and ridiculous and should be ... taken for granted\nBut okay ... kids can still love the movie\nAnd I don't think we should have a problem with it nor do I think that suggesting that people might take names that can be comfortably written now that don't have to be

enough and I think that's true with our whole criminal justice system we had here in the state of Washington\nA a terrible Supreme Court decision where the Washington state Supreme Court\nAh basically said that uh they couldn't give life imprisonment to people who had committed murder before the age of Eighteen no it's a life in prison and that's the more reason they not only struck down the death penalty for people who are convicted of murders as adults but for people to victims of murder\nAs adults who are convicted for crimes committed before they're Eighteen you can't give life imprisonment

with are these people in Pakistan who are at literally committing murder and wanting to execute a woman because she said that ah Jesus died for the sins of humanity and the profit didn't\nUm okay you get to you with her and that's fine but the idea of putting someone in jail and are threatening to execute her and then murdering politicians what a defender that it seems to me is a very different
