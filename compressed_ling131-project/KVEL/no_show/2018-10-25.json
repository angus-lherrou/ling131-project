more than any other that most Americans do anyway women sitting the pocket books of American families are the outrageous cost of prescription drugs in a recent poll conducted by Frank launched\nYou got an earful on this words like greed gouging an unfair kept coming up and a lot of questions why does the cost of drugs keep skyrocketing why the cost of the top two medications increased over one hundred percent since twenty eleven why does the whole system fuel rigged\nThere is an answer the drug maker spend a lot of money lobbying to protect their profits over one hundred Seventy one million dollars to be exact\nBut there is a bigger lobbying America our politicians must answer to we the people and we want solutions to prescription drug affordability and we want them now\nIt's time to hold drug makers accountable and put patients at a profit they've law they have their lobbyists and there are hundreds of millions of dollars but we have our voices are stories in our votes it's time to end the drug maker monopoly\nPricing power and stop them from overcharging the American people it's time once and for all to put parents ahead of profits enough is enough citizens for truth in drug pricing\nShare something with your ... the conversation I had this morning that I was reporting for us stepping the rule of MSNBC um there's about another forty seconds of it and you did not get to hear that I wanted to do to you to hear the end of the conversation because as you can see\nIt was rather um eventful uh she she is insisted that the president of the United states is dog whistling has always been dog whistling uh in order to reach his base of white nationalist when he said he's a nationalist\nI explained very clearly that no he was comparing nationalism to global as a matter of fact I Wish I had the skewed up or I Would have played this at the time but you do remember this one the president pulled out of the Paris climate accord right\nI was elected to represent the citizens of Pittsburgh not parents you know what that means that's nationalism\nRepresenting the people of the United states first not the people of the world first that's what nationalism is what does it have to do with white nationalism what does he have to do with anything having to do with race but that's what the left tries to do is I Want you to go buy more to go back you're just a little bit\nWe play a little bit of stuff and he wrote conversation that I had already play and let the things in a shopping and what your reactions eight eight eight nine of them on stage eight eight nine seven ... seven to for three\nGive us all is that the president Stephanie the president very clearly in Houston very clearly defined what he means by comparing nationalism to globalism\nNot comparing whites to blacks not comparing white America to to minority America he said global is think about the globe burst in our country second a nationalist think about our country first and the globe second I'm a nationalist he made it very clear\nThat this had nothing to do with white nationalism and it seems like people are going out of their way to find fault with it\nAnd we're going to agree to disagree\nGiven president history on racial issues giving his professional history given his father's professional history I prefer ... extra careful in his word choices especially as we go into an election where he is capitalizing on your mind going so we're going to agree to that we're we're\nVery well yeah we we certainly are but what I Want to know is ... how it is that you are going to take the position you are when he defined globalism before defining what he means when he says nationalism you you can't put words in people's mouths and I feel like that's not cause you to do it sounds like what you're doing stuff and\nI'm not putting anywhere in his mouth what I Will be able to do is look back on many many president has said over the years and it's why it makes me feel uncomfortable\nOkay what what exactly has the president said recently about this issue that makes me feel so uncomfortable and it's been you know your your expertise is is largely in economics you or your you know Bloomberg TV a editors while you're a former anyway\nYou know you so given all of your economic history the president is largely talking about global or ah nationalism in globalism in ... you know it matters of trade you know he has often said look we're gonna stop other countries from taking advantage of the United states if I have to use tariffs if I have to start trade wars in order to make sure that we get a better game throughout the market\nIs that and that is not an economic nationalism but is that not economic nationalism is my question [noise]\nNot if you look at the way the president is conducting themselves to give you the truth is that an impact he would engage and things like ... point out and partner with our outlining that have been ...\nWhich is to say

Would guess she checked the board\n[laughter] well listen as we said that letter comes to them and it says honored sir we take the liberty city by express today an article of her own manufacture which is attracting a great deal of attention call though which board president Cleveland kindly wrote back and said\nI acknowledge with thinks the which board which you sent me as a wedding present I accepted as an evidence of pine ceiling and friendship and can a moderate fourth ingenuity but hardly think that I needed to be tested powers to disclose the path and forecast the future\nWhen you take it or knew he was he took it he took it I Would leave censored back\nWell there's no there's no history of that now we don't know where that board it but let's just tell you what happened fast forward a few years fast forward for years and years now Eighteen Ninety and a group of businessmen and one business woman got together and came up with their own board version of it\nAnd they got it named and talk about this woman here her name is miss Helen Peters not worthy and they consider her a gift tax psychic and she said at the board and the message came through and it said they asked what should we call you wish we call this tool this board this device it's\nSpelled out we job they they decided let's go we job so ... so they needed to get it patented so in Eighteen Ninety they went to the U.S patent and trademark office allies are bon the attorney for this group went along with miss Helen Peters they sat down at the board because they had to prove\nTo the Patton officers that this tool works everybody kept saying no I'm not going to do this no I'm not going to register is not this this is ridiculous finally the head guy came out and said okay you don't know what I mean I don't know you if that thing there can spell out my name\nIs George what do you think happened it's bill and sure enough in the ... came alive\nNo didn't spend a lot of his name was somebody on the planet ... where he probably would've accused him of doing something or do the work by itself you\nKnow you got to have your hands on the plants and after that yeah you have\nI don't know you if that thing there could spell out my name\nOn a charge what do you think happened it's spelled author's name sure\nEnough in the ... came alive\nNo didn't spell out his name was somebody on the planet ... were you probably would have accused him of doing something or did it work by itself you\nKnow you got ... having a plan Shen after that\nYeah you have to so it started out they didn't know him and\nIt was that you know that's how the story goes so this woman I'm it's Helen Peters not for the uh it's really critical a crucial to the naming of the board\nAnd also to get a patent it and a lot of people didn't even know about her till about six years ago when Robert merge the chairman of the board of the ...\nDug up an old archives stories and letters about her and so it's we were honoring her just last month and as a Denver, Colorado and gave her beautiful gravestone with everybody\nEverybody's and that was hard at our is buried in her plot their names are on it\nUm she was just on her she was just lost to history but we resurrected her at our family was so grateful and thankful and and now she's going to be well no and she's going to go on the heritage a group of people who do tours in his grave yard it's called the Fairmont cemetery and Denver, Colorado and she's going to be remembered and recognized\nFor her contribution to this device forever\nHow do you explain to somebody called on the show a couple of years ago and talked about\nHow to get rid of all read the board and the proper way he sold and it was to burn it and he said as she was burning it he could see little sparks coming off it and scream she heard screams coming out of the board you believe up\nWell okay so I don't have the story is right and again I'm gonna I'm gonna references again we all have our stories based on our perceptions belief\nOn how we view the world her own fears our own desires and so I didn't mind is a powerful thing it can create many things that we have and\nTruly measure and understand and we don't fully understand awareness or consciousness\nAnd how we might even affect our world's through creating our manifests yet I'm just gonna say that's a story but what I Will comment on some boards don't work very well because they might be made I made the night and the worst thing to do is really burn a board I mean you could sell that I ... I have said to us\nAt the ... society will take 'em and we'll refurbishing and selling it given to a loving home they really wants to protect us the history and heritage of these devices\nTearing what's the oldest board you recover crush\nWell for me and my oldest for the circuit Eighteen Ninety to Ninety three board so I got a raft they started to start being made in Nineteen Ninety One in production minds one year after that\n... how do you explain this back in St Louis when I'm doing my night talk show must be Nineteen Ninety seven Ninety Ninety eight somebody gets me a weed you board I've got it in my studio and I'm going to do a little bit with them and I've got a producer there\nAnd this we gee board is in the studio with me that I never had any technical issues with in the studio all of a sudden everything is going wrong\nWhat commercials I couldn't play him because the computer board went though the board that monitors you know my voice levels that was all screwed up the lights were going out or didn't know what was on what was off it was weird and I finally told my producer Howard is a term\nIs an hour to get this thing on the year\nHe took it out and within two minutes everything pop back up working on the computer\nThe board everything and I want this is weird anyways what I didn't know at the time was Howard ... widow news guy named Daryl in hot word game Darryl Luigi board he should've gotten George and I don't want this you try to run and so we took it as a gift I didn't know that\nAnd um you know I Do my shore of their work and I was fine uh about two days later Darryl is no longer employed at the radio station which was kind of strange what he's gone\nAnd I want for that's weird oh\nAgain not knowing that he had the ... board\nI I run into him about a week and a half later\nIs at a restaurant and I went Darryl how're you I'm sure you've heard you're not one of those anymore and they weren't George nothing has gone right with me ever since Howard do me that we'd you board I got fired I lost my relationship I Can't get a job\nI I got rid of the thing and hopefully things will get better ...\nWell it's always all too easy to point the finger at something out there then to look at yourself you know maybe the filing down any way on a path of not doing very well working there or maybe he wanted\nWell what about the studio thing with me in the beginning well I you know we want\nTo blame that we've all by something that you'd want to make it mysteriously don't want to look at something logically first it was\nIronic that it'd Barry I\nThink I Would add to give you that George but I gotta say we we we ... the the the sport because it's so controversial and it just causes all kinds of meetings and and visceral reactions in people\nWe've really got to look at um what's really going on inside herself and what's really going on in the world around us and not just quickly jumped to say the board did it but that happens too often because it's almost easier like end is to blame for that external\nAnd to think that's the reason now now hold on that's another way to think about this too we create a lot of things we could just have the thought in our mind that uh we divorce is scary dangerous bad and then we can draw those things to us\nJust for the power of our minds is one power of unconscious mind and then send her on and go I told you the it's like self fulfilling prophecy\n[noise] I don't know I don't know you know all these years I've known you hearing you haven't been able to convince me yet to use the region board\nI Know it that happens sometimes\nI mean could you be wrong could you be wrong\nAnd there's something very wrong about\nWhat aspect of it um\nThat it can conjure up evil spirits let's say\nAlso that you can ... anything evil in your mind and I think evil exist in the heart of humanity I hate to say that evil and then people there's evil all over the world look around at people caught evil\nBut what I say is evil is not a force\nOutside yet we can draw these energies to withdraw other evil people too if we can have equal things happening and they are real bad evil things doesn't if they mean just because you get a piece of wood out or cardboard or there's numbers on a piece of paper or letters that that's going to cause any problems so I I I for my world my life\nAnd what I've experienced with this tool and away from the tool I'm convinced that you cannot\nNow but having said that people have their own beliefs and their own beliefs will still become a self fulfilling prophecy if that's they truly truly choose defined\nI mean do you recommend kids play with this as a board game\nWill recommend it if a child wants to use it the best thing to do is to not go don't do that because they're going to want to do it and sneak what better thing to do is say hey what is it about the ... why would you want to use it what ... what do you think about it what do you like about what do you want to know if\nI Want to go to come through for that they they you know what they want kids like touch them\nOf course some adults do too I mean look ups populist go shows

dimensions from when we came up where we go again I definitely believe in an afterlife with it for life and in between live and so I I came into this world as a very young child scenes there at having imaginary playmate\nHaving positive experiences with them as well and I knew there was something so much more and for me the wage war became kind of my lifeline to have a connection that get him throughout my whole life [noise]\nUm so it becomes just that permission allow me because my allowing it comes to my a gateway or becomes just a channel I used to do what I actually could do I mean I did this as a child that\nSounds we put that stuff away as we get older and grow up and were told not to do that not to talk to beans that aren't there are imaginary playmate and go to school and I was told those things\nAnd so I found myself putting in a way that this is the one tool that worked really well for me to be able to have a communications and to this day I'm I have communications that I used to have the child and I could do it on the board in off the board and I know it's not the board that let me do this\nIt's my self with my ... my beliefs about the abilities\nMy allowance of the field is to come through and this again just becomes that kind of a door that threshold that left me moving around and interact with them\nHow often do you use the board\nNot as much as I used to I'm doing a lot of work George direct channeling uh with my voice or writing off the board more often than he is the board but I use the board would say that once\nEvery two weeks maybe twice a month I might go as much as an only doing it once and I but I I prefer to work with a partner at ... at the very busy traveling schedule himself the would we do get together we'll do\nA session on my last anywhere from three to five five and a half hours having said that I Do a lot of uh sessions for my YouTube channel where I Will do answer people's questions and let them have readings\nUm and I

writing about it or answer people's questions about it\nWhen you travel with the ... board does anybody freak out\nWell yes [laughter] yes they do I do it\nYeah you know you can't hide them um and I just hope my boards I always have a traveling for with me and if I don't have one of their forgot one which has happened all you've got to do is get a piece of paper right the letters down but the numbers down yes or no and a wave go with a coin\nWhile the rest of the several hours going to fly by so let's get some calls in for you Karen Angie in Ohio welcome to the program high energy\nI think

the rest of the several hours going to fly by so let's get some calls for you Karen Angie in Ohio welcome to the program I N G\nI think he's taking my call and say we want to go right rate ...\nBack when I was a teenager I had a boyfriend that he could new out of body experiences and his family has really religious and they didn't like the things he was practicing they put him in a home\nFor a while while and me if I had a we keyboard and I had been ... actually I Do he said well if if you talk to me I can leave my\nBody and I can come visit you tell one night me and my girlfriend were babies and my brother and sister and after they went to that we decided to try it and it was really calm quiet my aunt was warmly and the windows open in the front or a phone you know it was early eighties we really nothing to be afraid of\n... and we're trying to talk to him next thing we know we\nHeard a weird noise in the front door at the screen door opened\nAnd there was no way could open so we jumped up and when ... when the door locked it\nAnd just started shutting all the windows because we were like oh my gosh somebody tried to come in well the next day he called me cause for good behavior as well to make calls so he called me and he says\nWhy just shut the door on me so what are you talking about he gives you tried to talk to me last night I can tell you shut and all around me I said that that I get rid of the weeds\nYou look at things and grudge\nUn gee that's an I I Love when she shared it and what I've learned about the border over the years is that you don't you can talk to people's higher self you can talk to people that are still alive you can talk to animals that are alive or deceased so it's an it's what it is it's really you're communicating with their consciousness you communicate with that part of themselves that exist\nLike the higher self that exist beyond their corporate ... existence or experience\nAnd so you start having these other dimensions of a person so I don't one bit doubt that you can do that as I have done that myself\nAnd that one didn't have a real bad into doing\nYou know and I think she spoke yourself because it is kinda\nWeird at first we start doing it and you go how can I talk to that person is still alive isn't the board of the use of the deceased person will no I learned that this board can become your costs make the phone I I use it as a cosmic phone like I Would have wireless phone I dial on the frequency through my intentions\nDo my thoughts through my feelings and then I can tap into connect\nBecause I've trained myself over these years to all these different things that are in and around and for me I use it for personal growth self development and helping people with disclosure from Greece or just evolutionary expansion\nGene truck driving in St Louis ... go ahead\nA gene that George or you know like like like all this talk to your parents with\nAll due respect I'd like to disagree with your book they just record you know but what do you say that\nWas only on the board it's things that are coming out of you in but I really can't buy that because you're talking about their ... the people who never met the man right well we used to board\nThe more shoulders man these people have no idea who you are really there was a more jobs being coming through the board in may on\nBefore they ever got there and you know were warned not to have\nCommunication with spirit because it is that people will want and the living will they will die but did not anything I really believe that you're going to find them and you think that the spirit and they will continue to do that\nGo ahead and journalists react to those things\nYeah I think again I'm so listen when I'm Talking about abilities we all have a six sensibility we have the ability to be intuitive and path ache to gut feelings your heart feeling we'll talk about your guy or you had you had sneaking suspicion something was right or wrong\nThat's the abilities and how that turns out and you win life we often have will have dreams of prophecy will have I'm sort of like something just doesn't feel right here or gosh I've known the person for years it's do things I'm Talking about when I was born people use the board on this level of using the board you're able to bring out\nYour own six sensibilities so these people using the tools were able to tap into that whether it's their Indian motor using or subconscious mind which include\nThese abilities of psychic abilities or medium chef or um even just tapping into just your your knowing this\nOr that connect with the spirit now oh I'll just a second part of that he talked about you were told not to\nDo this often told not to do things that will keep us in control and keep us down\nAnd so what I've found is we are told you have to have an intermediary to talk to spirits you have to marry an intermediary to talk to God and I find that I have a direct connection\nTo all these beans which has been nothing but loving and beautiful so with all due respect gene I disagree with you but I think we both can have an opinion because you're going to find George that's the extreme and on the other extreme you'll find people in the middle to and that's OK\nSam's with us now and the lesson burn Connecticut ... good morning\nPam Hi I'm so thrilled to be able to to speak with you I Can't believe that this is this is what I've been thinking about so strongly this is the most amazing thing and I wouldn't\nCall it a

phone calls eight hundred six five five Mike John we'll start with you have John welcome to Philadelphia you're up on the Mike Gallagher show\nOn God's going good how are you John [laughter] not too bad I'm kind of in a dilemma what's the dilemma let me straight yeah uh\nWell I'm trying to figure out a specifically which Democrats are running on open borders because all I care a lot of talk about it but you I only hear about it from a counterpoint or\nOr which ones are running on that let me show\nOn trying to figure out which ones they exactly or like saying you\nKnow let 'em run free let 'em run ... want to know that ...\nYeah let me let me answer you because there was an analysis I was just reading from the Associated Press and it ran on Fox News\nHeadlines Democrats are remaining silent on the issue of the caravan of thousands of immigrants on the march from Central America and unwilling to get into any kind of a debate with President Trump says the new terms or just weeks away that the answer to that either way\nOn him to step up there in the waiting on him to step\nUp the the answer John is that the Democrats are saying a word of condemnation of the thousands and thousands of illegals you're heading towards the border the answer is they don't condemn that because it's it's it's it's an ... billion plus at least supported\nFind me a Democrat and then you know maybe the easiest thing is the answer your question with a question which Democrat is expressing concern and fear and worry anxiety\nUm over the thousands of illegals you were headed towards our board name one they want because they are in favor of open borders they've all set it in various ways and and sometimes you say something by your refusal to step up you're talking about stepping up John\nHow about a Democrat stepping up against the kind of violence we've seen directed towards\nMitch McConnell in restaurants and the mob mentality Boulder thrown through a a house majority leader Kevin McCarthy his office in Bakersfield, California\nHow about some condemnation now what we've heard is getting Republicans faces go after them create a scene create a crowd that's that's your answer they are not\nUm uh expressing the will of the people in concerns and and and frustrations over this uh this angry band of people heading our way eight hundred six five five Mike will your next how you doing will\nNot do all make it really thing that I haven't heard a lot about\nIt and it's a little bit frustrating is where does it say it in our constitution and our laws or whatever that we have to pay benefits\nTo people who are here illegally [laughter] I mean ... it's just it's almost like people assume that well when they get here it doesn't matter if they're here illegally and I were given benefits ... why don't\nWe just you wait a minute what's wrong with you you mean you don't want to give in state tuition benefits to illegal you mean you don't want to give drivers licenses to illegal you mean you don't want to give free health care to a legal what are you a racist well what are you\nI mean I honest to goodness you're right where where in the world does it say we should be given folks who come to this country illegally and tried to steal residency and that's literally what illegals or doing any kind of benefits whatsoever that's the kind of reasonable question that you don't hear too often

clearly has the momentum and this caravan that's making its way to the border police and the and the research I've done in Arizona immigration is the number one issue and they are set up with people coming across the border with out\nFishing effective border security that as sad democratic challenger is very tough\nWell known in Arizona that when it's still too close to call\nYou know what is good news there is a doozy is robbing and the governor's race I'm back to big pharma one more word on the care of an eye it's up to according to some reports eleven thousand other reports fourteen thousand and it's getting amazing press conference how does that play in the elections Frank\nThe public looks that goes from says why do we have no control over our borders why is it still happening to us and they ... and here's what's interesting\nAh the vast majority of Americans want to compromise they're willing to accept a path to legal status or citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants would so the so called DREAM Act in return for some sort of barrier and genuine border security\nWith the American people are saying is first fix the border then why should we punish those who came here to no fault of their own I Know a lot of your listeners don't like that second part but the majority of Americans support\nActually my audience is very much beyond that my audiences pro fence and pro regular as they shouldn't be on DACA my audience is reasonable it's Ninety percent of Ninety percent agree\nPeople who are in the country already or not lawbreakers can stay but we want to double sided strong tall fence with a road between it and I know my I I've been talking about this for Fifteen Years of my ideas that you'll find other audiences that are harder line but my audience is very very smart very apple and very educated very a Christian\nVery faith ... people who do not want to punish anyone now Frank what should a Republican candidate B. saying about drug prices what should they be saying about big firemen and you also it's also the author no my brother\nWorked for almost seven years as a research toxicologist for big pharma\nI Know the good that they do the drugs we developed everybody gets that but this pricing is crazy what should have Republicans say on the stump about big pharma\nThat they should get it if the pharmaceutical companies refuse to do it voluntarily the public does not want to invade the free market system but they don't want Americans pay more than Canadian that if they will not let were drug prices here as they've done it in other countries\nThat Americans should be allowed to purchase drugs under FDA supervision 'cause nobody wants the high line to be poisoned by the Americans should be able to purchase drugs across the border and that one change about\nThe pharmaceutical companies will bring down their prices that you cannot have a situation where people are literally literally dying because of the pursuit of profitability\nReminds you of conservatives do believe in the sea markets system but they also believe that monopoly should be broken up and then when you have cartels they should be challenged that's what you've got in this situation\nNow secretaries are of age eight she hasn't been a guest on my show a lot in saying about transparency and pricing that's really what the ah new regulations coming out of the department of health and Human Services are about will that feel the need or does more than that need to be done Frank was\nMore than that needs to be on at least from a public perspective because knowing that you're paying the highest prices on the face doesn't help it's actually finding a way that they will still eat profitable\nBut that people will be able to afford the medications but they they want competition in the marketplace they want the ability to buy cheaper medications if they are available and\nTired of all this money going to things other than research and development when they claim that all the money that they're spending is going into research and development they want integrity noticed them and they don't feel like they have it now\nOkay I Would

they get their money but distribute their jobs in places where there need that's why the Google going man Arbor is such a great idea why hope\nAmazon goes the Columbus or Virginia or someplace that needs a lot of jobs let me turn to the end of leadership in turbulent times because it was there we find\nMaybe the best friends or should the current era and President Trump you write about working to your FDR and LBJ the fame they craved the recognition they thought bears little resemblance to today's cult of celebrity for these leaders the final measure of their achievements would be realized by the super two are\nVery mittens tuned in during plays in communal memory before we talk about President Trump in that role what is an enduring place in communal memory I think I Know where do you explain\nWhat I think what it means is that at a certain point when a leader goes into politics they go in perhaps for themselves at the start\nBut at a certain point it gets transferred into an ambition for the greater good to accomplish something that will stand the test of time and that normally means something that creates more economic opportunity and a greater degree of social justice we know when we look back at our leaders what happened during their era did people be able to share more in the country's\nGoods did people feel better at the end that something had happened in their lives that they have more opportunity it's not hard to figure it out or was there a war that was prosecuted that has to be one and that was what was your depression that has to be lifted\nOff and the leaders who go into communal memory or those who have great challenges to face that's what Abigail Adams said great assessed these create great virtues but it's not always so that they are up to those challenges though sometimes they can go into memory and a very negative way I mean James Buchanan with the president when the country was falling apart in the Eighteen fifty and was\nOnly able to exacerbate the problem is rather than hailed him and he goes down is one of the worst part of history\nI'm not sure that um that Herbert Hoover was capable of his given his temperament of dealing with a depression he was extraordinarily good man but how to fix ideology but he stays the same challenge that FDR was FDR goes down and communal memory as does Teddy Roosevelt and asked us Abraham Lincoln\nAnd even and Lyndon Johnson having faced civil rights as a southerner and made his conviction that the civil rights bill would be his first priority the risky to\nThat memory of civil rights will go down even though the war in Vietnam will always be a scar on his legacy with not celebrities not doing what you want to that moment it's not just campaigning it's really going forward and mobilizing the country\nToward tasks that will make the country and the people in the better it it's a big thing and and that's if that's your desire it somehow lifts you above the daily struggle\nArguably the greatest leader Americans had in terms of the longest period of time would be like\nA leader of a ... D Day invasion we're sharing a NATO\nLeader Columbia University of course eight years in the White House during a period of time when the Soviets reached parity with us on the hydrogen bomb and we had to begin a recognition of the new world order with a nuclear age I could pull that off but I I don't really think has a place in our communal memory yet Doris Kearns Goodwin do you\nI think it's a missing place I think there will be more biographies devise an hour I think the way he handled the presidency and the dignity that he brought to it and clearly the leadership he brought during World War two and two the beginnings of the Cold War I I think these leaders sometimes it takes a generation\nOr takes the biography written about the person to put their whole life as you just didn't in those moments in perspective not just what he did as a presidency but what his whole life meant to be\nAnd yeah I think he'll come up in the presidential historian polls they come up and down after a period of time and sometimes it's looking back on an era from the context of our own era of the relative peacefulness of the Nineteen fifties I think what's so much about us now than we don't take it for granted\nThe way we might have what now that we've had a period of such perpetual war on our side similarly the looking back on Lyndon Johnson's ability to deal with Congress and get I've partisan support for\nMajor legislation not supposed to be a great civil rights laws that Medicare PBS NPR headstart immigration reform and most importantly bringing both Republicans and Democrats together and are broken political system\nThat looks so much better what we took for granted there once currents that generation but I'd say eyes and how is the person definitely ready for great leadership stuffy\nDoors proven last question about leadership in turbulent times has to do with Donald Trump whose numbers are improving is change the Supreme Court is one of the third year battle for those records\nMilitary bring rebuild the economy was booming along but of course we're divided country and I'm just watching the news this morning was blaming Trump for the pipe bomb that Sarah what do you see emerging which way as his reputation going to go based upon extrapolating the first two years in the next to impossible sex\nI think the main question will be is there a point in which he will recognize that he has done a lot of things that he hoped to do and then in ... he has to reach out to expand the base not just do the base and try and become the leader of all the people that is a huge transition that still has not taken place and the question will be yes\nPeople are feeling better about their jobs they may be feeling better and that's important they may be feeling better even about the confidence in the economy they feel better as citizens right now\nThey feel that the country is in a more a better place the way the language is going the way people are fighting the way the polarization is deepening the way they wake up every morning and they see\nSomething on television that they wished they weren't seeing that sense of feeling good about being a citizen as the country is another level I think of judging are you a better or worse off having been here for two years than simply the material goods that are at the bottom which are absolutely important as well\nSo we'll see what happens if that shift if that gets worse if the polarization deep and if it leads into even more violence as we might be seeing potentially in these last couple of days and I think we have to use that as a standard for is this leader leading us in a direction\nThat is helping us become a better country\nOr a sports the discourse that he's not only responsible for but it's just escalating

going over the past couple of days though I I Want Sean I think everybody needs to look at one thing or all that rhetoric that you played at the beginning of this was very specific about violence very specific about who to target\nAnd when I look at the at at the response which you had which are seen from other people are when bronco bomber was an office I'm In the case of the shooter that shot a um the Mr ... um what you saw where people not blaming Bernie Sanders\nBut what you see here and I find that is so hard is that uh these devices have been put out there that somebody went the distance to to put these things together to ah to carry out a plan covertly to put these things in place all at once\nAnd none of them went off and immediately the rhetoric starts in a way that is organized\nAnd now I'm not saying they have something to do with whoever puts these out there but the organization of their rhetoric is so disgusting to lead a low on the political chain that it it does make one pause and asked um was this\nRhetoric prepared it's a it's a very alarming thing was that I got Daniel\n[noise] you know I just I just want to make it really clear I'm not blaming the president's today I think that they're playing the lane\nAcross the entire political spectrum and what I think regular people like me see if\nI go out and the world I deal with people who I don't necessarily agree when I get my job's done I said I I ... hot and somehow I managed to get around the world around this country to get around my city\nWithout inflaming tensions people around me and I just don't understand what is wrong with politicians that they cannot get their job is done without this kind of rhetoric\nJonathan the way I look at it and this is now gone on two years\nOf vitriol hatred lies conspiracy theories on a level we've never seen before\nAnd what's worse is you know when the president says the fake news a lot of it has been fake news it's not even news all of his political commentary quote dumb as news and it's not news at all there are these are not news channels these are opinion channels\nYou know I don't see much real reporting from fake news CNN or or even NBC ABC or CBS anymore they're all run by\nLiberal activists George Stephanopoulos has an agenda he's a he's been Clinton's ruined through his entire life and he hasn't changed one bit and it's not any different on CBS or NBC or any of the two cable channels\nAnd you know it's interesting I say I'm a talk show host part of my job is to give opinion but I also reports straight news we do investigative reporting we've been doing it for example but we've added Obama when no one else would we be vetted the deep state more deeply than anybody else in the media\nAnd so that's part of what we do giving an opinion as part of what we do we're like the whole newspaper they say they're only the news part of the newspaper but they're really the opinion part\nYou know Sean I I've been on your TV show on the radio show I've been around you for five years now\nAnd one thing that I can truly say whether it be you or anybody else on Fox News and and a lot of these other networks out there is that when when something like this happens and all these Democrats are having these devices deliver to them you're not going to see what else on NBC's Today where they have the\nThe ah down below where they have the headline a boy with a reporter and it says that Trump opposition is getting devices delivered to their to their addresses Trump proposition\nThat that's the way that they're they're playing this so they're automatically putting suspect on Trump just by the way that they are labeled the lower half of the screen I mean it it is it's it's it's such political\nUm this tasteful rhetoric\nThat when you couple that with the things like McDonald's said with the things that are these politicians are are instigating people to go out and carry out these things Trump never

me\n\nThe Democrats are always wanting to regulate industries they're always wanting to tell them what to do they're always wanted to set up their price structure and their employees structure and all other structures in our industry we don't support that doing\n\nI mean the way you create more products in the way you drive down costs is worth less government right less government interference\nI mean that makes sense\nThe Democrats constantly want to drive up the cost of domestic steel\nWhich\nResults in you paying more for pickup trucks and you'd truckers out there for your Eighteen wheelers and people who want to buy purchase a car drives up the cost of homes because believe it or not they're stealing your homes are stealing a lot of stuff so it drives up costs and the Democrats are always wanting to drive up costs why is that\n\nThere's a payoff to certain unions is that it\n\nAnd it makes it much more difficult to export our products because it's much more expensive to create them to to build them right to construct the manufacture them\nAn automobile for instance if it costs two or three thousand dollars more to build an automobile in this country because the Democrats drive up across the steel well then we're not going to export as many automobiles and what happens to the uh to the auto workers well\nThey don't seem to well do they what happens to the American
