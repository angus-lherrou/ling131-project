the opportunity to figure out what the comprehensive immigration means we're\nGonna throw all of this garbage into one giant bill that everyone has to vote on and it'll include border protection and it'll include asylum entered a clue to amnesty and it'll clued past the citizenship and no clue you know the ... visas to bring in some a computer nerd from India and all of these things and you stop him and said well ...\nWhy why why does all of that other stuff ... why does\nThat need to be part of the solution this is a very cut and dry standalone problem\nThere are people from another country who are crossing our border illegally and demanding to stay here it has nothing to do with path to citizenship for people who are already here it has nothing to do with visas it has nothing to do with comprehensive anything\nAnd if you and if your solution for these people who are crossing our country illegally and want to stay here in demand to be in our country\nIf your solution is tied to all these other things that you want voted on an approved then it means your part of the problem you're using this to get other things that you want\nI Am so against the idea of comprehensive anything

I've known Dan since I first they actually before I even came to Washington and he's been so great on this issue with Spygate and with the FBI and the doors and\nAh all that jazz and I've been doing a quite a bit on that story as well\nAh I recently this week got to interview Carter Page and a quarter page of the central figure\nOf the uh Spygate scandal right\nUh and and the he hasn't done a whole lot of media but I was able to have a quite an extensive conversation he's in the news this week and I don't know if you saw this but Carter Page has filed a defamation lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee\nAnd against a Perkins Kuwait which is a a high powered D.C law firm that represented the DNC and by extension the Hillary Clinton campaign you know in a presidential campaign when a person gets the nomination for a party they are the de facto head of that party\n... and especially I implore you read Don of Brazil's book it's called hacked\nAnd it's a double entendre it's partly about the Russian thing but it's also about what happens her experience taking over the DNC after Debbie Wasserman Schultz who was a mess it was completely mess and\nShe she tells a lot of troops in this book about how awful Debbie Wasserman Schultz was and how terrible the Hillary Clinton campaign was to her personally and to the DNC how the Hillary Clinton campaign absolutely ran roughshod over them uh\nBut I was able to have a quite an extensive conversation he's in the news this week and I don't know if you saw this but Carter Page has filed a defamation lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee and against a Perkins Kuwait which is a a high powered D.C law firm\nThat represented the DNC and by extension the Hillary Clinton campaign you know in a presidential campaign when

this book about how awful Debbie Wasserman Schultz was\nAnd how terrible the Hillary Clinton campaign was to her personally\nAnd to the DNC\nHow the Hillary Clinton campaign absolutely ran roughshod over them a bill to them for whatever money that was coming in\nAnd they were in charge of all of it All right so so when you hear that the dmc hired a fun through a lawyer to create fusion GPS to to create the Russian dot CA\nThat apparently you know slime Carter Page or that really means that Hillary Clinton campaign\nBecause they call the shots so not Carter Page this week fired adept filed a defamation lawsuit against them against the DMZ and against a Perkins go now why do they go after those people will be I think it's because they have deep pockets frankly that's where the money is\nAnd and and had it not been for those who enter these there wouldn't have been a Russian dot CA there wouldn't have been stories saying that Carter Page is an agent of the Russian government there wouldn't have been a a FIC to warrant the petition for\nAnd approved or to the FBI position for by the FBI unapproved fruit flies accords for them to survey all him to look into every little or if is of his electronic\nFootprint via email text messages phone calls and the people who associate with him for over a year they kept getting this are incredibly intrusive\nSpy warrants that that without a fight the war and it is against the law for a federal agency to spy on an American citizen the only way they can do it as through advice or worn and they're supposed to be a very high bar\nTo get a five to warrant and to get the spice of weren't they had to use the the Russian dot CA\nThat claims Carter Page wasn't they in fact if you look at the applications for the warrant for the price of weren't the FBI said we believe Carter Page is an agent of the Russian government it's right there in black and white\nAnd we believe that he was working on behalf of the Russian government to alter American foreign policy through his meddling in the presidential campaign of twenty sixteen on behalf of Donald Trump that's what they said that's what they claim that's what they maintained under oath to the court\nSaid Carter Page filed a defamation lawsuit this week\nSuing the DNC and ... this law firm for defamation and I think about this from it Carter Page is either an agent of the Russian government\nAnd basically ... participated in a subversive if not outright treasonous acts against our nation\nDuring the twenty sixteen presidential election or he is an innocent American citizen who has been slime than slandered into famed and used as a tool for political purposes not just by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign but ultimately by the Justice Department and the Obama administration\nHe's got to be one of the other right\nThere is no in between here there's no if an or\nCertainly no but I mean if there was a button hero it'd be a car Daschle and proportions\nCarter Page is either as stool or a a sorry a stew dj of the pollutant Kremlin\nOr he is completely innocent and and I don't know if you know a lot about Carter Page I guess it hasn't done a lot of a media he's a Naval Academy graduate he was a navy officer as all Naval Academy graduates are unless they're you know pro athletes [noise] he was in intelligence\nIn the navy in ... in an officer in the intelligence division which you know usually you've got some hurdles that you have to cross to get in the military intelligence in the United States Navy as an officer um and after serving his time well beyond his obligated time as an officer after he got his a nickel academy education\nHe then went into private business and did went into the energy sector he got his doctorate by the way he is about the ever noticed that you can't say Christine Blasey Ford's name without saying Dr Ford but one of the last time they said Dr Carter Page he's a doctor he got his doctorate\nAnd he didn't do dealings with energy sectors out of Russia you can argue with that if you wanted to understand most of his dealings were in the house in days when Hillary Clinton had to reset button when Bill Clinton was pulling down six figures for giving a speech in Moscow\nAnd when a bronco bomber was promising his counterpart there that he'd have more flexibility after he got rid of this uh this Mitt Romney guy in won reelection\nSo it was a different time it was a different era it was okay to do business with Moscow now he still thinks that's a good idea to do business with Moscow he actually doesn't think that putting government is as bad as everyone says guess what that is not illegal he he can do that\nIn fact it's not illegal for a business to do business with Moscow as right now as we speak\nNo sanctions and in a in a huge way against that government their individual sanctions against individuals but uh businesses can still do but we we still do business with Moscow you may disagree\nBut guess what he has the right to do that that doesn't make them a spy it doesn't make him a Russian agent now he could be don't misunderstand my point here\nCarter Page could very well be\nAn Asian or the Russian government as the FBI maintained based on the Russian dot CA paid for by the DNC and this law firm that Carter Page is now suing but ask yourself something as you evaluate the story as you use your cognitive skills\nYour reasoning the brain that the good lord gave you\nAs you evaluate the story that is presented to you that the FBI and the Obama administration said Carter Page was an agent of the Russian government and has been for years and worked on behalf of the Kremlin and let him are prudent to colluded with Donald Trump to meddle in the twenties sixteen presidential election as they say that\nUnderstand to facts number one to this day no one has charged Carter Page with anything not James Comey not Loretta Lynch not Jeff Sessions not Rod Rosenstein\nOne at the federal level no one at the local level no one at the state level Carter Page has not been charged with a crime of any kind and they have sort of veiled every inch of his whole life\nFor almost two years they've got everything on him no charges number one so so think about that for a minute and then think about this if you're Carter Page and you are an agent of the Russian government and you did commit near treasonous acts\nBy colluding with the Trump campaign and a vitamin pollutants\nYou're standing to facts number one to this day no one has charged Carter Page with anything not James Comey not Loretta Lynch not Jeff Sessions not Rod Rosenstein\nNo one at the federal level no one at the local level no one at the state level Carter Page has not been charged with a crime of any kind and they have sort of veiled every inch of his whole life\nFor almost two years they've got everything on him no charges number one so so think about that per minute and then think about this if you're Carter Page and you are an agent of the Russian government and you did commit near treason effects\nBy colluding with the Trump campaign and a vitamin prudent scrambling to alter our presidential election and twenty sixteen if if that were true\nWhy would you file a lawsuit why would you file a defamation\nLawsuit against the DNC because you see the perfect the fact that the DNC can defend themselves and get out of this lawsuit with one very simple strategy\nIt's only defamation if it isn't true so all they got to do is prove that Carter Page is in fact an agent of the Russian\nGovernment and if you're Carter Page why would you invite that why would you open yourself up to discovery why would you open yourself up to a full court well funded and you know there's going to be a lot of money funding their defense a well funded investigation into you\nJust on the outskirts of Naples actually seven sixty Seventy one of those sort of we were called Seventy one

that we're gonna Claire McCaskill's team is going to want to pay very close attention to\nThat last week we showed you the tape project very toss with uh the campaign surrounding Brett is a news the former governor of the state of\nTennessee and now he's running for the open Senate seat of Bob Corker Corker but thank goodness Marsha Blackburn is now pulled out of the fourteen point lead in the latest polls she was down for a little while\nA lot of people were concerned about it but I think now that they see that reticence staff has basically saying he's saying one thing to the people of Tennessee I'm planning to do something very differently\nBut where do you see the tape that we have tonight as it relates to Claire McCaskill another important red state Democrats Senate race that's going on member you vote for Claire McCaskill you might as well vote for Schumer you vote for any democratic congressman you might as well vote for below sea\nIf you stay home because you don't feel like voting and you're being lazy well that's a half a vote for ...\nAll right let me get into this this case that has really been a mystery in terms of a global affair crisis I'm the president now said that he has dispatched his secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia immediately to discuss what's been going on here\nAnd it gets almost more bizarre by the second now\nThe allegation has banned the Saudi ... crown prince ordered the killing\nOf this guy Jamal quiz show he now he's a Saudi national who's been critical of the Saudi royal families Washington Post contributor\nAnd he's a U.S resident but he's not a citizen he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day\nThe Turkish government had suggested that the show he was killed by a Fifteen members Saudi his team who then dismembered his body and smuggled out and\nOf the consulate in pieces to an unknown destination but so far the evidence supporting that up to today is been heroes some reports claiming that show these murder was recorded but to Dayton audiotape know videotape not even the Turkish government which is no great friend of America is currently feuding with Saudi Arabia over other issues\nThey in an absolute saying it's absolutely short because she'll be was killed by anyone that can't say it\nLet alone the Saudis and others just began to break moments ago and a reports of now surface that Saudi Arabia is preparing or report which in fact they will admit Jamal cause show ... this is the Washington Post columnist now this is a very dangerous we start seeing journalists killed\nWent missing earlier this month was killed by interrogation gone wrong\nUm\nWhen he entered the I guess the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nRight here to talk about it we have Morgan or take us is with us national security global affairs animal is former U.S treasury is past shape to Saudi Arabia lived in Saudi Arabia two years\nOr she along with them on Gino former Secret Service agent author as well as the now best selling book a Spygate thank you both for being with us um Oregon you lived in Saudi Arabia two years this just breaking there's been a mystery up until like an hour ago what do you think right\nYeah yes and I lived there for ... ten and eleven I needed something like this breaking and the reason I did it because when the president said this morning that he's sending secretary palm ... to Saudi Arabia that meet the secretary of state when it did these people in the world\nCertainly in the government has canceled all the plans to fight halfway around the world um I I Do is incredibly serious than\nAh we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with whatever it is so if there were purchased you believed and we're still going to have to just if if the records are out there it's like what comes out a way that the Saudis are claiming some sort of responsibility for this looks like they're not going to there are there any claimant senior leadership not involved\nBut that people are in charge of it in order to be held accountable there's a lot\nTo how was your ... there's no until now because it shows how would they not know until now or what had happened in their consulate in Istanbul\nThat just didn't have to question and I think the big takeaway that I have from this report we'll see what happened the secretary\nOn pay me to them and let the readout as it\nDoes not only need to to come clean on this and satisfy President Trump the secretary I'll tell you know they have an audience and the and the Congress and the Senate that they're also accountable to mind you just massive arms deal is a memorandum of understanding it is nothing find that if president\n... bipartisan consensus first sanction people like Rand Paul have actually the very locally um I'm supportive of the relationship I agree with senator call for a number of reasons that I could go and kill why I think the relationship it is important but the Saudis need to understand how serious it is\nWe need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to see massive\nA movement away from their big finance farm just a few leaks secretary Mnuchin says to me that we saw the Dow fell off this afternoon as reports\nAnd they were threatening threatening stake here yeah well they were threatening you know maybe even using the power of their oil of impact\nAny of the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S damned bonds you know I mean it's getting more bizarre by the men and how to somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely sure there are really two aggravating factors year one year already brought up the fact that this happened\nIn a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility that that I mean that breaks every single a protocol moral ethical role imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well I mean aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media and I think this is ever

has gone wrong in the university especially in certain fields within the humanities\nScholarship at base less up on finding truth and more upon attending to social grievances has become firmly established if not fully dominant within these fields and that there are scholars increasingly the bully students administrators and other departments into adhering to their world view\nSo Dr James Lindsey a along with a couple of other friends decided you know I let's find out what this is all about let's see what the lines are and they learned an awful lot um they learn something\nA quite valuable that you just can't get away with anything you have to fall into a a set pattern really Dr James Lindsey a is joining us now he is a thinker he's not a philosopher but he has a thinker which I like a doctorate in\nMath or background or in physics uh James how are you sir\nGood Glenn how are you\nHave good um so tell us what you were tell us what you were trying to do what were you trying to prove\nWell we were looking into the field to find out\nWhether or not their scholarship has gotten so kind of ideological bias that if we put forth I'm really absurd arguments\nOr that they might be willing to publish those so long as they've salt fell in line with the political views that they seem to be forwarding and plays a scholarship\nSo ... that first you didn't you didn't really understand the political view part right because the first few the studies that you use submitted\nA you've got back they were rejected\nYeah um well it's not quite that actually we I think we understood the political view but we didn't understand the need for a scholarship we started this project out and as you said we got the first several papers are back rejected we started in August by Thanksgiving everyone are literally Thanksgiving a day of\nWe really realized we were in trouble um we weren't getting anywhere with trying to hope that the problem wasn't we didn't understand the politics so much although there's still a lot to learn there and there was for us to a very complicated\nThey call it a matrix of domination that you have to understand um but it was more that we actually we're not trying to work their scholarship and so there are two things that are needed to to get these papers and one is that you actually have to understand what they call scholarship you

I mean I don't know how if you guys had years before you came up with this or how you guys came up with these ah but they're fantastic oh let's go through some of them one by one let's start with the first one dog\nPark the ah the thesis is dog parks are really rape condoning spaces tell me about ... tell me about it\nWhat kind of funny actually um I tell you that story um when I went to we we all got together to to have this ... public as best we could so I went to Portland we all went to Portland\nOregon to um get ready for this project to come out publicly went to the dog park on the first day I got there almost right off the plane I took in over next thing you know I'm walking haters out there for the dog or\nWith our filmmaker and uh we get to the dog park and there's this just dog they're living out the paper it was crazy this dog was fighting the other dog's hunting them down holding them left right and center or the owner comes over when the\nWhen the ball thrower at the dog gently I'll point out he wasn't being abusive and says oh hoping and then we get to as a lean over to the filmmaker and kind of modern\nI get a little to LA but maybe we should start interrogating people about their sexuality given what is it going down here and then this lady yells out\nTo me oh no no it's okay she's a girl dog and I was like oh man the papers happening for real\n[laughter] so what is what is the thesis\nSo the thesis was well the original idea behind the thesis was that we should write a feminist paper arguing that we should train man\nWe get to the dog park and there's this just dogs they're living out the paper it was crazy this dog was fighting the other dog's hunting them down hunting them left right and center the the owner comes over swing the\nThings the ball thrower at the dog gently I'll\nPoint out he wasn't being abusive and then he says stop hunting and then we get to as a lean over to the filmmaker and kind of monitor but I guess a little too loudly and maybe we should start interrogating people about their sexuality given much is going down here and then this lady yells out to me oh no no it's\nOkay she's the girl dog and I was like oh man this papers happening for real\n[laughter] so what is what is the thesis\nSo the thesis was all the original idea behind the thesis was that we should write a feminist paper arguing that we should train man the way that we train dogs to prevent rape culture\nAnd so I thought that they thought it was pretty funny when I was brainstorming ideas for papers sure to Peter Peter takes his dog the dog park every day I'm ... said let's work in some of the stuff from the dog park and as we started working and just you know absolutely absurd ideas from\nWhat might be considered the most ridiculous dog park in the world\nOr the paper grew into that and so we made it about so called queer perform a pivotal in human reactions at the park and then ended up including things like the ... we we should build a leash man likely least dogs X to prevent rape except if not politically feasible and\nUh gosh it would be great if we could could put shot colors on men but that's not okay either so we have to shock them out of you know hitting on women by screaming\nAt them to scare them and it gets them to desist from their behavior we the thesis of the paper was though that that humans reacted differently to gay dog hunting as opposed to stray dog hunting and men were far worse about this than women\nAnd then we concluded that this is indicative of race culture and we called the dog park rape condoning space\nThan whites to nightclubs said great night clubs are also rape condoning spaces with no evidence for that whatsoever\n[laughter] um\nSo there was pretty out there um that one was was really out there I think it's I don't know maybe the one about the the feminist spiritual spirituality meetings and poetry is a little more out there but it's probably close to the most\nWell LOU LOU finished the dog park this one was accepted\nAnd reviewed uh some of the reviews is a wonderful paper incredibly innovative rich and analysis extremely well written in organized a yadda yadda I Believe this ah intellectually and imperial in periodically exciting paper must be published\nAnd congratulated the author on the research done and in the writer\nAnd in the right yeah yeah\nThat was the most disturbing parts of this I feel like because the ... again it wasn't like these ... these journals looked at this and didn't really go through it and kind of just ... it made its way through the process there are very specific comments from dozens\nOf reviewers who are on the ... who are doing peer review insane specific things that you wrote that are completely ridiculous or ... amazing new accomplishments in the field I mean that had to be wild funny and improve your point had to be really disturbing as well\nOh yeah that's by far what we consider to be the most important evidence that we gathered in the process of of this project that the papers got published or that they got awards in some cases are one case and all of this is fine and it says a lot in his disturbing but the reviewers comments show that these\n... peer reviewers which it worked out between two and four or five or paper so we ended up with something like forty five or fifty total a set of comments they they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they ... ...\nSet our analysis was good ones are analysis was terrible they didn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that\nUm you know the dog park paper contains a bit of completely irrelevant evidence about were dogs go to the bathroom and unauthorized ways as we were to that and it's completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody raise an eyebrow about\nHow ridiculous that is um they were concerned however that we indicate that we're human not dogs so that we can be sure that we don't claim that when a dog there was a ...\nA hunting of another dog whether or not the dog they go home to want it or not because how could we know that as\nBeing ... and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody's seen in our little\nVideo we put out to announce the project they're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy and the process of inspecting their genitals um\n[noise] and we haven't out [laughter] what what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... what I mean\nYou got me man\n[laughter] and then it was done in the privacy of a a veterinary office [laughter]\nOkay um let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nWas that the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which fat is displayed politically so that fat as just considered another to issue a that equal with muscle\nAnd to say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people pat phobic as they call it\n[laughter] ... and that was accepted\nYeah that was accepted that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because uh we actually had a real scholar who let us use his identity who wrote that who we claimed wrote that paper and you actually as a professional body builder or Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something that I mean this guy's Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind to this guy being the author of this\nPaper for fat body building was just kind of all areas\n[laughter] he said something I think to a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean it some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking would it would it wouldn't have had\nWas on but um the the idea that that giving students experiential reparations and asking them not to be able to speak in class or to be spoken over\nHim interrupted to teach them what that feels like none of that was questioned\n... what what if this were published anywhere real if this were published ... what what would that mean to the university system would would would send me and\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm\nThere would be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at the University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some some uh educators primarily working and social justice\nSide or the fields topics\nCourses I guess that's the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general ed stuff would take up some degree of the suggestions as\nYou know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to the gold standard journalist wasn't some fringe of journal and education this was the gold hundred Venice philosophy journal have a shot that we were working with here\nWhich is where a lot of the literature that like this already exist\nWhich you don't mind me going on a little bit this is kind of what's happening I'm we think that what's happening here is kind of in the equivalent with ideas of money laundering called idea laundry\nOh so they take they take these these bad ideas some of which are just opinion some of them are prejudiced some of them are genuinely terrifying like this educational thing\nAnd then they wander them through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge so you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or we face this program on studies that show well that's fine when the studies are good but when the studies\nAre coming from a place they can't tell a truth from from prejudiced an opinion it becomes a real problem\n[noise]\nSeems one of the other ones I found um disturbing or was the uh H. O. H. two NHL each one in nature wage\nToo was was accepted can you explain the explain this one\nYeah that paper was accepted by ... the singer and I was just mentioning that\n... ... stood for hoax on hoaxes so it was a hoax paper we wrote that was about writing academic hoaxes\nThat code namely gay for convenience\nWould argue is that that you can\nOnly properly criticize things that go against social justice in particular you can only use humor to make fun of or or do satire to deflate\nThat which goes against social justice if you use humor against social justice if you criticize both will do that what that means as you never really properly engaged with it therefore we don't have to consider your criticism and that's one of the huge problems going on in this this set of of\nFields is that they don't accept criticism if you tried to criticize them they say that it's a privilege preserving epidemic pushback that a scholar named Allison Bailey huge huge\nIn the education literature they say it's white fragility that's Robin to Angelo who has just had a big book published on that this year but it introduced the concept of twenty eleven which says that if\nI'm somebody with privilege in particular white people for her work uh is challenged so that their privileges point in question that they are fragile and don't know how to deal with it because their privilege made them weak they don't know how to psychologically deal with having that challenge and they act out in anger or grief or something like that\nAnd trying to maintain their privilege and so\nThese ideas are already getting out there we just took him to step further\nThan the you know it's interesting I've ... the one about hope to this is interesting in that if ... to criticize what you guys did they would almost half just cite your paper as that was\nThe idea yeah it was definitely to put them in that position and I've asked\nAlmost half just cite your paper as that was\nThe idea yeah it was definitely to put them in that position and I've asked a patient to stand by the paper\nThat they accept it and publish alright names they haven't responded yet but we'll see what they do I'm that way indeed people who want to criticize our project from a position of interest like an old feminist ... will need to cite off in order to criticize us\n[laughter] I can we get one more to go on and on the you talked about this kind of scary front at the feminist mine ... uh\nWell you also did the white man my income you did to one time and this was accepted in the white man wasn't fright\nCorrect correct tell me about them\nSo I'll do though the white one first because I didn't get in it was much more frightening it was written in from the position of an auto West Nile graffiti where the researcher is reflecting on an effort to states her own experience\nAs a white lesbian women coming to hate her own white mass and it was rejected partly because the scholarship wasn't quite er which is the case in all of the papers but also because the position to the author as a good white\nRather than being sufficiently software can or whatever to critical race ... ... so there was a there was an explicitly political reasoning behind why it was was rejected and it was that the the author as a white woman was trying to make herself look good by criticizing her own white\nWas was one of the main reason the feminist one was\nWell hold on just a second hold on just saying that that took mind the parts of mine come where he was talking about Jews and replaced the words Jews with ah with whites\nYeah in that case it was either whites are white and this and then we edited the text around it and added a whole bunch of literature and rewarded things so get past plagiarism jak and things like that so yeah that was a\nIt started with scanning through my income picking out passages about the Jews and replacing Jews with whites are white ness\nThan editing around it uh the feminist one didn't\nDo it quite the same way the first one was not about it didn't take the Jews out and replace it with with men for example that actually is the chapter in my income where Hitler explains the need for the Nazi Party is chapter twelve and what its members would be expected\nTo a whole to and including especially the sacrifices that after make it'd be Nazis and we've replaced\nOur movement the party et cetera he doesn't mention Nazis specifically in that chapter or we replace that with intersection of feminism or solidarity or ally ... something to do with with the feminist movement\nAnd criticize the idea that\nA feminist do what they called choice feminism which is the idea that if a woman is living her own life the way she wants to and considers that to be a statement of feminism than she is doing feminism the salmon is for women to have you know full agency and make their own choices in the world that's what this paper was criticizing\nSaying that no no the responsibility if they really want to consider themselves feminists is to be to make sacrifices him stand in solidarity with other oppressed people particularly of you know women of color or women of other marginalized status is\nJames [noise] couple of quick questions um bay\nThis had to be one of those things that you entered into and hoped that you were wrong and when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later going\nGood God this is bad am I right\nThat's exactly that is exactly right so especially the ... paper I think the one that got accepted um the idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine ... of course still I mean as you you know you that it's a one to one thing uh\nBut the ... the the politics of grievance through I really am glad I get to talk to you about that if I can\nBecause politics of grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic left as we were trying to demonstrate recalled this stuff grievance we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided\nA politically right now I was really happy to talk to you because I mean I Know we don't want to get in touch with you but you're real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this whole May of ... about\nHow things were going for you under Obama's time and I thought that was huge and I was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation is on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know or people on the left were left liberals I'm not ashamed to say that I Know you consider yourself a classical liberal and\nConservative on the right that's great I'm we're on the left me to take responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that you know or left wing people who want the left\nTo come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people\nIn general I get a lot of sense that people send me emails about this now all the time especially um\nWe're all kinds of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to productive politics and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media sphere as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't\n... remember you know you are an American I'm an American you're a person I'm a person we have ... most of the things that we think income and even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversation we want to move society in a direction that benefits us all\nAnd it's just a matter of working out the details\nAnd I really hope that you know that our projects kinda reaches reaches that point does that make sense\nIt totally does I I Am I I hate to say this to I'm Out of time it could I invite you

five four three three eight eight\nOr let's just go back for a moment to this deep question about\nThe out of wedlock birth and why it is a problem for\nAny child then and I'm not now suggesting that people will be punished for having children out of wedlock I'm not suggesting is\nPreferable that a baby who was conceived out of wedlock the aborted are dispensed with what I Am suggesting is that we get back to the idea that in this society there are norms norms are worth preserving and one of the norms would be that\nIt is worthwhile\nFor people to come together to form a durable relationship and to raise a child in that context\nIt the truth of the matter is an you've heard this a lot on this radio show but it's always worth repeating it is a common lie is a misconception it's not just a misconception is a total distortion\nThat most marriages or even half of marriages don't last anyway so you could get married before a baby and well then the baby no no it's true not all marriages last but the majority do and particularly\nFor four people\nToday today people are getting married a much older age is an average American Woman\nNow has her first child woman who's going to have a child at age twenty seven that's still pretty young that's up from twenty two and Nineteen Seventy and one of the things that they're blaming for the out of wedlock birth rate is the fact that people spend longer in school but the the idea that\nYou're getting married at age thirty or age thirty one or age thirty five or aged forty\nThat's that doesn't mean that it's not valuable\nFor your future children to be in a committed long term and chances are permanent relationship\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six the traditional progression of western life has been reversed says John ...\nWho teaches at Columbia University he says cohabiting partners are having children before getting married that's a long term trend across developing nations\nOkay the idea that they get married later find good lead to see that but what about all those couples and and we know this is couples who are cohabiting\nAre much less likely to last long term than couples that are actually married and there's a wealth of data that make that clear let's go to um\nBob in Cleveland, Ohio Bob you're on the Michael ...\nI think instead of trying to go back to the cash\nThough society we should uh adapt to these new trends and I'm finding new ways of helping these kids succeed and I just want to say it is you know back in you know maybe a hundred years ago uh you know that my challenge the rates were so high\nThat often a parent would die in the trial would or maybe you have to live with their grandma parents or relatives or other relatives show I think this can be done successfully as long as we are open minded\nRelatives show I think this can be done successfully as long as we open minded to these translate\nWhat does that mean I Know it sounds good and adapting to trends wow that sounds very open minded and terrific but what does it mean\nI Would say that we need government programs horse would\nThat would be to kids in a single parent situation\nOkay what kind of programs are you thinking of you want the government to send babysitters you when I was down by the government day care center\nI think that would be one way I think manners where you pay people professionals to go in and spend time with these trials these children and help them out\nOkay let me just mention something to you Bob\nI I understand that sounds very generous and very nice\nBut you know what there are some times families who are married to each other who are raising children sometimes multiple children\nAnd their financially press is it fair that people like that we're having a tough time financially with their own kids at home should have a bigger chunk taken out of their income to provide for other people who may be struggling with only one parent\nYou know you're going to hate us but uh I I I'm going to say this we should cut defense spending because it's just it's just not necessary and we should also raise taxes on the rich\nOK well of course when you say I'm going to hate this on their shelves you down but the idea that hunting defense spending is going to be an answer right now we are spending more on the interest on the national debt\nThan we are on defense and in my opinion I think the and opinion most Americans the defense spending that we spend is the best investment we could possibly make\nAnd some of the very ambitious social programs are the worst one of the things that has happened in this country and has been shown by a wealth of books and information\nOr there is uh Charles Murray wrote the first book that that blew the lid off the welfare system in the way the welfare system has it been designed particularly by Lyndon Johnson the great society actually encouraged out of wedlock birth and there are Democrats\nWho have written about that Daniel Patrick Moynihan who was a moderate Democrat\nWrote about the problems with the family structure in the United states and he predicted exactly where we are\nThe government rewards out of wedlock birth of course they're going to get more of that we'll be right back uh with when does a a public figure go over the line and expressing hatred\nOkay I look I I think I think that's true and\nThe idea that Farrakhan now that he's elderly and I believe he's in his eighties I'm sure he's in his eighties and ah\nHe does not seem to have lost an ounce of his passion but it's not a passion for anything constructive\nAnd if you are going to say and I would that it's unacceptable to say that one ethnic group or one religious group is responsible for all of America's problems and they are enemies by definition\nEvent doesn't classify you as an anti Semite what would it take\nA we'll get back to that a quick word from relief factor this came in from somebody that I'm most you know

Michael again you Mary Jo\nUm so I just wanted to say oh there's there's a difference of the impact of statements when it's coming from different group\nBetter disparaging other groups and what I mean there's there's a history of white supremacy throughout the world for a long time ago in particular when you're looking at white versus black or white versus use you have your money you have the United states for different places where you know blacks were\nOver centuries in factories in generations are attacked in that way that hadn't been the case of a history of black supremacy on issues or on white people or something like that so there are different impact of that\nI I agree I agree and again I I think it's obviously\nMuch more serious if somebody in public office say is saying something that is negatively racist then if somebody like Louis Farrakhan saying it however I think people were right to challenge President Trump when he was a candidate for office about support he'd received from David do\nBecause even though David Duke is a joke and a loser and a creep and a former klansmen and a former leader of the Nazi Party and all of the above\nA she she still to to allow him to be associated in any way with someone respectable is a very real problem and this brings us to Farrakhan because\nIf you look at ... history of just a ... anti American hatred of his own country the idea that he should be on stage as he was at a recent Franklin's funeral he was just a few seats away from the former president the United states Bill Clinton\nAnd uh I Do not believe that

disagreeing tweet that came in\nSays Michael this is from uh\nIf it came in says Michael this is from a Jeff\nAnd Jeff says Michael it was reported today that the budget deficit exploded Seventeen percent year over year do mostly to the Trump tax cuts the Jew so often preys on your show\nPerhaps you could comment on that instead of this ridiculous Elizabeth Warren side show very glad to comment on that of a let me just tell you that those people\nWho are saying that the reason for the budget increase the budget deficit increase is the tax cuts are part of the next it's not true how do I know isn't on through\nThe cause revenues year over year at the same time that the budget deficit went up revenues went up they didn't go down the increase they increase slightly but ah my source for this is\nA not only government figures but the New York times and the Treasury Department the New York times\nThey um they report that as a matter of fact the\nTreasury reported that federal revenues rose by huge zero point four percent\nFrom the two thousands Seventeen fiscal year to the two thousand Eighteen fiscal year and uh they view that a treasury is assigned the tax cuts are paying for themselves and the New York times takes\nIssue with that because they say well the growth in revenues would have been even greater without the tax cuts okay they might be right that the growth in revenue would have been greater but the growth in revenue is still growth in revenue we're taking in more money\nThe problem we have is we're spending too much and I actually think President Trump did

social media I stand for the flag I Neal for the cross I'm not making this up\nOr Salvadoran that's the hard way south wasn't simply a loyal Democrat he was the head of Allegheny county Pennsylvania Democratic Party also military veteran you think should be allowed to stick up for America once in a while but now he made the mistake of writing this in a Facebook post quote I stand for the flag and yell at the cross\nNo not so long ago most Democrats sort of nodding in agreement that today is hate speech and he lost his job but tonight that losses are gaining marks Elvis joins us now\nMark thanks for coming on the show a mistake that I mean did you have to leave your job running the county's Republican rather Democratic Party because of those words on Facebook\nAnd again also a military that I stand for the flag and he lived across loses his job\nWhile I was the executive director of the county party um and yes basically that's exactly what happened because of that post which reminds me it was over a year ago that I'd roasted that uh I was asked to resign yes\nSo you're a veteran you say you stand for the flag and you were denounced as a racist for that\nCorrect the people who brought this to light tried to tie it to the NFL players taking a knee\nSo I I look I'm confused I I'm not a democratic voter never have been but you know I've been here a long time now a lot of decent patriotic Democrats doesn't seem like that long ago\nIt wouldn't have been weird for the head of a Pennsylvania democratic county party to say I stand for the flag and you'll before the cross what is it Ben five even\nAs a member of this is the the party DNC that blew the inclusion of God in their platform remember that\nYears ago a crazy thing to say\nAbsolutely not and and I can tell you that even just last year when the Pittsburgh Steelers decided to stay in the locker room instead of come out for the national anthem\nA one player villain a waiver who's an Army Ranger came out and stood by himself with his hand over his heart and he was not considered a racist so this even as much as a year ago or it would not have been unheard of to hear somebody a leader in the party defend the flag\nSo what I mean you're the executive ... weren't the executive director of the party you obviously know a lot of Democrats in your county traditionally democratic county what if what if your ... your former coworker said he has since this happened\nI haven't heard from any of them I understand the party line is that is a personal matter and I can respect that ah however those that are elected officials or party members who are not tied with my direct sort of chain of command if you will I have not heard from any of them\nThat's a shocking what is the same to you about how the parties change\nWell it makes me wonder if ah there is room for moderate Democrats in the Democratic party nowadays um there were some elected officials who said that they acknowledge that they've known me and I'm not a racist\nHowever it wasn't sensitive and unfortunately if my patriotism and standing up for family friends has become insensitive or that I think we as Democrats need to stop and reevaluate exactly what we stand for\nStanding up for the flag is considered racist then what happens to the country do you think going forward\nResolution is the only resolution from that I back you
