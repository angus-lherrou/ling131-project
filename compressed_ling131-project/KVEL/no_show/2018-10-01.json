hold onto power when\nRon ... is an Andrew Gillum got the nomination for governor in Florida My very first thought was the San Francisco to erase watch this has to be they're going to paint him as one within twenty four hours they flip around some use some harmless phrase next thing you know the lead of every show Ron to San Francisco racist unit was going to happen because it had to happen\nAt work right there there are in Nineteen Ninety eight a radio ad in Missouri by the Democratic party subs a you know elect Republicans black cross a cross is going to be burnt on people's lawns\nOr I remember it well the James Byrd at I mean Al Gore telling a predominantly black audience Republicans have the wrong agenda for African Americans they don't even want to count you in the census at all\nAnd just really outrageous claims and you know one of the things I'd like to see come out of this that what has now become a predictable tactic they get called out on this Brett Kavanaugh up until two weeks ago yesterday was a gentleman gentlemen\nAnd now all of these allegations all of these solicitations and it doesn't matter like if Michael ... making the claim that thirty six years ago\nThat there was a gang of boys that were routinely drug ing girls and then waiting in line to gang in trail raped them and that this was happening with the regular cards but nobody said it at the time nobody told the teacher a law enforcement official apparent\nThat it just kept going on and was covered up for this long because I Know where I go to where I went to school in one kid got in trouble for anything everybody knew within seconds\nWell it's ridiculous I mean his client is alleging that she went to nine consecutive ... gang raped in a row and never said anything to anybody and no one else does either in she on the tenth one was raped herself\nAnd didn't say a single word about it for thirty seven years okay I don't have time for that actually there's a whole country\nWith all sorts of real problems to address it tends to what you really have to be a Republican senator since you had to take that seriously these people fall for the same gag every single time it's ever football and you have like the senator from Arizona's like oh really you're hearing really\nIf there are laws or claims being made yes they should be investigated this is a guy who's had six FBI investigation into his background in space Twenty years\nRadical clearance that allowed him the codes ... nuclear arsenal\nThat ... and yet we lead another on the basis of claims that have no system actually shut all remember tactical Christian for it I'm just making the obvious point she claims that this happened to him for people she says repressive off or say it didn't happen and no one has the brass to ask a follow up questions for me\nIt's a joke is what's actually happening it's a joke and only the Republicans in the Senate don't know if\nThis is either some said they had no recollection ever of anything like that ever happening or being at any party in the case of a best friend she said well I I don't doubt what professor Ford is saying about I don't have any recollection\nBut also professor Ford identified one person and that was mark judge Moore judge having been in the room when the alleged assault took place\nAnd he has said over and over again that's not true now they made statements under penalty of felony and if they so when the FBI goes back to them if they changed their story they will be admitting to committing a felony\nSo I'm not really expecting a whole lot to change here except now the Democrats put out a statement earlier today and they are now demanding all the witnesses telling the FBI how to do their job and meanwhile when they had a chance last week to talk about this Ramirez or\nA Michael ... client they passed and they punted and they didn't bring it up but now they want to end it into that aspect didn't put so\nBut why we playing along with this I mean they actually\nThat I can tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra work done it was supposed to be limited in scope and uh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way Jeff Flake is not\nBut now they want to extend it into that aspect and put some\nBut why we playing along with this I mean\nThey actually going to tell you why because Jeff Flake and Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski they they wanted this extra work done it was supposed to be limited in scope and uh just a limited amount of time it didn't turn out that way\nJeff Flake is not in control the Senate they could pass it without flake and where the leaders other than ... and I hate to say is Lindsey Graham seems to be the only person\nWilling to tell the truth but we're the rats were the other night in Republican senators out there on television make their case not just for Brett Kavanaugh but common sense and presumption of innocence but where are these people and\nThey they control the United States Senate they haven't passed any of the agenda pretty much that the president land on they're giving the finger to their own voters and on this one thing they can't just tell the truth\nWhy is that the Oregon whatever parade of exactly I don't understand\nWhat do you think that you've been in cable news a long time you were back in the crossfire days I think even had a stint shortly at MSNBC I don't know how that worked out for you but um yeah I got fired\nYeah um well I mean I think that they are one opinion network and that's it and it's all conspiracy all hate Trump all the time but\nI'm now you've been doing really well in the Fox news channel news shows doing really well and uh what is the difference that you think is happening with cable news today I mean we're on the opinion side of things and Fox\nObviously I was a news division but I kind of look at what I Do is talk show host as being the entire newspaper we report news\nSometimes it straight news we even do investigative reporting other days and we give strong opinions other interviews where people give opinion um we do sports we do culture pop culture it's to me it's the whole newspaper all these other people claimed to be reporters and they're anything but\nWe break a lotta news on our show and we have reporters working on the show there are only job is to fight do things to flushed out do interviews I mean I you know I I had been in this my whole life\nTo what my family did I don't feel insecure about you know why you're not a journalist whatever I don't care what you call me but we bring new facts for white\nEvery night and I see our drop water every record to explain what this means so really confusing time it's I wrote a book about it that's what the book is how do we get here why did this happen why did Trump got elected who didn't get a black to grow up what actually happened what actually happened was\nThe people in charge made a series of incredibly dumb decisions about our culture our economy our foreign policy they never said sorry and they never learned any and so voters got mad at punish them and good for them but why would\nSo that's I that's what I think my job is to explain what gets me and I think you know maybe disagreement but I think that's a valuable thing to do right\nNow I think the other thing is I'm a believer in strong opinion but at least we're honest about it I'm not totally like for example there'll be days on his radio show we're all we're doing is reporting news same on TV there'll be other days we're doing investigative reporting there were days I'm just giving opinions and taking calls from people that have opinions\nAnd that's what it's all under the umbrella of being a talk show host you know people say well Hannity you even said you're not a journalist no but I Do journalism is part of what I Do but we don't just do that um anyway talk\nA little bit weird that all the attention that we get there is like nine people in the media who disagree with the prevailing story line and they need to be crushed to\nSilence why don't you know they're you know what I mean there are less than nine Tucker there is a is a handful of us Tucker there's not many and by the way there's a\nOrchestrated effort and millions of dollars being spent to shut down any anybody that dares\nTo not hold that prevailing left wing view but anyway we're putting it up on Hannity or on the website Hannity dot com\nThe ship a fool's how selfish ruling class is bringing America to

occasion but just basically double standards\nIf they hear your raise it a great point\nIf they cared about the issue they would be demanding FBI investigations we can go back now to Juanita ... and

that's what it all comes down to politics alright Christian good call we appreciate it All right let's go to Don is an Iowa Don how're you we got about a minute it's all yours sir\nHi Shaun thank you for taking my call and thank you for a trip to nearly bringing up the true for everybody I'm Glad to be here every day thank you for giving me this microphone\n[laughter] uh basically all I wanted to say is is the obvious that's of this whole case is that um\nGo to Don is an Iowa Don how're you we got about a minute it's whole yours sir\nHi Sean thank you for taking my call and thank you for a continuous bringing up the true for everybody I'm Glad to be here every day thank you for giving me the microphone [laughter]\nI'm basically all I wanted to say is is the obvious\nThat this whole case is that I'm bored it's perfectly willing to do to judge Kavanaugh what she has accused him of your assaulting him on a daily basis all eight in the present and just so much\nFake uh evidence everywhere\nListen she she identified and there's a there's a part of me that really sympathizes with is just such a serious issue in and I don't think we give the Republicans enough credit for how they've handled this including the president they handled it with the proper seriousness the topic deserves\nShe gave the names of poor people and no no the Bork\nAnd corroborate her story including the guy that was supposed to be an eye witness to it\nThen they find themselves really addicted and somebody offers a ten dollar bag of heroin and now they're a heroin addict and the recidivism rate is like eighty five percent if you're addicted to this garbage and they can't get off it and then the next thing you know they're going to buy a bag of heroin that God only knows who's putting it together\nAnd they drop what is the equivalent of three grains of salt\nThat's how ... we would be upsetting all inside of the heroin and these kids die and these adults or even die\nWell I think I think there's another point to the DEA chief with interview today and he made it very clear that the biggest threat to national security\nIs the Mexican drug cartels so what's happening is it's not just that people in the article in the hill I saw that too that John Solomon wrote in and and and John Solomon wrote this article at the DEA chief ... ... you know did that's in and took some\n... some of the statistics from the film that we did and just said you know this is very serious and we're we're looking at a very closely but there's this huge misconception that the borders just about immigration when in fact the kids are dying on the other side of the border national security helps us both not an immigration issue it's a life or death issue not right or left life for\nI don't think anybody I don't know anyone else and media here that line I did life or death yeah no no not right or left life or death I I heard the line life or death you give me credit for\nThat no that was very good very very catchy but it's but it's true and desert bowling often reminds us this can happen to you because it's happening to a lot of people and I don't think there's anybody listening to this program that hasn't been impacted by opioid addiction or addiction of some kind alcoholism but this is the worst\nBut it's a hundred and Ninety to death I day a day that's every day one death every seven minutes and that then by the way and there's even a lot of lives with nor can which were versus the effects are ... but not fat no not a problem federal\nDefinitely nice kids don't know it so it's like even if they're taking coke or his antics which is pretty scary for these college kids they don't know that it's laced with\nThat now that one time one dead one notes terrible alright well congratulations again when it becomes a\nBoss when it becomes available we will tell you how to get a hold of it All right as promised let's get to our busy telephones here as we say you can't even read this land is in Orlando Lynn Hi how are you\nShow going on how are you man\nOh I'm sitting by the expressway waiting on you to put me on [laughter]\nBut yeah certainly glad we got young what's going on no price no\nNo I won't but I also worked for Bill done of it in Athens, Alabama\nWow what'd you do or do these bill was the by first professional radio gig in what Nineteen Ninety\nYeah I uh I heard you say that all of a you know pass out when I heard that but uh I guess the strip appreciation radio concerts we ... down at\nThe airstrip in Huntsville remember those radio station\nWe had a country radio station and he had a a you know today's hits yesterday's classics WC wipe Pete which was a big big station that they are\nWhat are we ... the one for a Pashtun radio was what I mentioned became [laughter] you're right yeah\nMy buddy storm in Norman used to work in the mornings there was one of the funniest guys on radio ever knows a great guy he'd call on my show all the time and I wouldn't even notice him half the time\n[laughter] yeah that was those are fun days and then of course those big State Farm cutters down there on university\nOh you bet and the soil so\nI had a question have you heard Democrats said that if the FBI investigations cruise these allegations faults that they will vote for Brett Kavanaugh\nNo maybe in the end would do it I we know

he's denied the Supreme Court glad that about right\nNow let's go through the prosecutors memo like Sherman through Atlanta just stick with me no offense Elana\nShe writes Dr Ford is not offered it consistent account or when the alleged assault occurred in July sixth text of the Washington Post she said it happened in the mid eighties\nEntered July thirty letter to Senator Feinstein she said it happened in the early eighties or August seven statement to the ... river\nSaid that it happened one high school summer in the early eighties but you cross that the word early for reason she done did not explain\nThis is because the lawyers get a hold of her you see and they're trying to make sure everything's consistent in order to get Kavanaugh\nIs September sixteenth Washington Post article reporter the Dr Ford said it happened in the summer of Nineteen eighty to notice July six mid eighties July thirty early eighties\nAugust seven early eighties but then crosses out early but September a sixteen when she's being lawyer the summer of Nineteen eighty two wow she not only remembers the year but she remembers the season\n\nSimilarly the September sixteen Arnold reported that notes from an individual therapy session in twenty Thirteen show her describing the assault as occurring in their late teens\nBut she told the post and the committee that she was Fifteen when the assault allegedly occurred she's not turned over her therapy records for the committee to review and yet ladies and gentlemen she's wave any privileged she has on those records because she either gave them to read them to the Washington Post there is no more attorney client privilege\nBut she's withholding why\nVoters common for victims to be uncertain about dates Dr Ford failed to explain how she was suddenly able to narrow the timeframe to a particular season any particular year\n\nWell let's say the shoe was on the other foot and it was Kavanaugh would they tolerate that and say why least credible\nNo they wouldn't this is a big deal ladies and gentleman\nEarly eighties mid eighties early teens late teens\nThat's my memory loss\nDr Ford has struggled to identify judge Kavanaugh as the assailant by name NO NAME was given at her twenty twelve marriage therapy notes NO NAME was given under twenty Thirteen individual therapy notes\nWhy not\nDr Ford has been claims to recall that she identified judge Kavanaugh by name and twenty twelve by the way before I read on that's her husband ... irrelevant\nAt that point judge Kavanaugh's name was widely reported in the press has a potential Supreme Court nominee if Governor Romney won the presidential election in any event it took Dr Ford over Thirty years to name her assailant\nDelayed disclosure of abuses common so this is not dispositive she writes she's nicer than I Am\n\nBut speaking with her husband Dr Ford changed her description of the incident to become less specific Dr Ford testify but she told her husband about a quote unquote sexual assault before they were married but she told the Washington Post but she informed her husband that she was the victim of a physical abuse at the beginning of their marriage\nShe testified that both time she was referring to the same incident\n\nDr Ford has no memory of key details of the night in question details that could help corroborate her account we talked about this last week\nThe memory to me it's quite selective specific details\nDetails that are most harmful to Kavanaugh no details at all oh cooperation\nShe does not remember who invited her to the party or how she even heard about it she just not remember how she got to the party she does not remember in one house the assault allegedly took place aware of that house was located with any specificity\nPerhaps most importantly she just not remember how she got from the party back to her house\nHer inability to remember this detail racist significant questions\nShe told the Washington Post the party took place near the Columbia Country club the club is more than seven miles from her childhood home as the crow flies and she testified it was roughly a twenty minute drive from a childhood home\nShe also great for the first time in her testimony that she was driven somewhere that night either to the party or from the party or both\nBut you couldn't remember\n\nDr Ford was able to do this\nFormer childhood home as the crow flies and she testified it was roughly a twenty minute drive from a childhood home she also great for the first time in her testimony that she was driven somewhere that night either to the party or from the party or boat that you couldn't remember\nDr Ford was able to describe hiding in the bathroom locking the door and subsequently ... accepting the house she also has also described wanting to make sure that she did not look like she'd been attacked\nBut she has no memory of who drove over or when nor has anyone come forward to identify him or herself as a driver no one\nGiven this all took place before cellphones arranging a ride home would not have been easy indeed she stated that she ran out of the house after coming downstairs and did not state that she made a phone call from the house before she did was that she called anyone else there after\nThat's convenient because then they can't look at phone records\nShe does however remember a small distinct details from the party unrelated to the assault for example she testified that she had exactly one beer at the party was taking no medication at that time of the alleged assault and I will continue\nThis after the break but as I said last week during the course of this questioning that is prosecuted it was devastating and\nThat we have the experts judicial analyst and a host to the money she\nDoing what is she doing she's growing up I mean that doesn't mean anything to the American means everything\nEverything as it did you stop listening to these more on after she

regularly outperform stocks because they're true wealth that said that have real value\nDuring this through your recovery period after the two thousand eight crashed the Dow went up like three point five percent well gold doubled in price call it\nIn her testimony she could not hear them talking to anyone\nIn her letter she stated I lock the door behind me both loudly stumbled down the stairwell at which point other person's at the house we're talking with them\nQuote unquote but she testified that Dr ... excuse me the judge Kavanaugh or mark judge turned up the music in the bedroom so that the people there's could not hear her scream\n\nShe testified that after the incident she ran into the bathroom lock the door and heard them going downstairs but she maintained that she could not hear that conversation with others when they got downstairs instead she testified that she assumed that conversation took place\n\nNoticed she never said she turned down the music either at any of them turned down the music\nHer account of who was that the party has been inconsistent according to the Washington Post's account of her therapy notes\nThere were four boys in the bedroom and what she was assaulted\nShe told the Washington Post that the notes were erroneous because there were four boys at the party but only two in the bedroom in her letter that Senator Feinstein she said me and for others were present at the party\nEra testimony she said there were four boys an additional ... ties are in herself she could not remember the name of the fourth boy and no one has come forward Dr Ford lifted Patrick DJ ...\nAs a bystander quote unquote in her statement to the political refer and enter July sixth tax to the Washington Post although she testified that it was an accurate to call

important recent events relating to her allegations in her testimony regarding recent events raises further questions about our memory raises further questions about her credibility because we're talking about things that are recent a few months ago not thirty six years ago\nFord struggled to remember her interactions with the Washington Post Dr\nFord cannot remember a few showed a full or partial set of therapy notes for the Washington Post reporter and she does not remember whether she showed the post reporter the actual therapists knows her own summary those notes the Washington Post article that\nHe's six years ago\nDr Ford struggle to remember her interactions\nWith the Washington Post Dr\nFord cannot remember a few showed a full or partial\nSet of therapy notes for the Washington Post reporter she does not remember whether she showed the post reporter\nThe actual therapists knows her own summary of those notes the Washington Post article that portions of her therapists notes were provided by Ford and reviewed by the post but in her testimony Dr fork and I recall was that she summarize the nose for the reporter or showed her the actual record actually was even more and I took notes during the testimony to\nShe thought she may have summarized them over the phone or couldn't remember whether she physically handed ... anything over I mean it was really preposterous we're talking about July, July ...\n\nShe does not remember if she actually had a copy of the notes when she texted the Washington Post WhatsApp I count on July six Dr Ford set in their first watch ... message to the post that she quote\nAt therapy notes talking about unquote the incident when she contacted the Post's tip line\nShe testified she had reviewed a therapy notes before contact and oppose to determine whether the ... whether they mentioned anything about the alleged since then but could not remember if she had a copy of these notes and she said in her ... message or merely review them inner therapists off and on wait a minute\nSo she couldn't remember on July sixth if she had a copy downloaded the copy of her therapist notes or had reviewed them in her therapist's office does anyone believe that\n\nShe's providing information to the Washington Post and she can't remember\nA few months ago if he downloaded them from the Internet or\nIf she had reviewed them in her therapist's office\n\nCan you imagine if Kavanaugh said this about drinking back in high school that I Can't remember if say what\nDrinking at night I don't remember if I had three cans or six I don't remember too are far and we can you hear me saying and I learned a lot of big things so I Would ask call me and I would ask Blumenthal Mr Vietnam vet not I would ask him is a little why\nWhat does that evidence that they say more lies ladies and gentlemen I'm here to tell you this is not a memory is yeah\nThis is an attempt by her lawyers and I think her now split a round peg in a square hole or square peg in a round hole you get the point\nIt makes no sense this was July sixth it wasn't thirty six years ago wasn't even six months ago\n\nDr Ford refused to provide any of our therapy notes that the committee and that is outrageous they should be subpoenaed she waived her privilege on these therapy notes\nDr forwards explanation 'em by the way I'm sure Shelley White House White House ... what are we supposed to\nDo rely on a lighter can't rely\nThat's a long trip where they actually asked by God\nDo I have another drink wait a minute not in the public\nDr Ford's explanation of why she disclosed her allegations the way she did raises questions she claimed originally that she wished for her story to remain confidential\nBut the person operating the tip line of the Washington Post's was the first person other than her therapist or a husband to whom she disclose the identity of her alleged attacker\nShe testified that she had a sense of urgency to relay the information to the Senate and the president quote unquote she did not contact the Senate because she claimed she quote did not know how to do that unquote oh it's very hard\nTo contact the Senate\nYou could what we called Google you could call what we could being you could what we call call even for one the one you could call or asked one of the people on the beach who you consulted apparently frequently or millions of people contact\nThe Senate every every year we have our living surges and Google and phone number for the Senate is right there\nShe did not contact the Senate\nDidn't she did not explain why she knew how to contact for Congress woman but not a senator\nDr Ford could not remember she was being audio or video recorded when she took the polygraph she could not remember whether the polygraph occurred the same day as a grandmother's funeral the day after her grandmother's funeral\nAgain these are all recent\nIt would also then inappropriate to administer polygraph to someone who was grieving\nSays the prosecutor Dr forge description\nOf the physiological impact of the event raisins question since the prosecutor she maintains that she suffers from anxiety claustrophobia post traumatic stress disorder PATS the\nThe data the hearing was delayed because of the committee was informed that her symptoms prevent her from flying\nBut she agreed during her testimony that she flies quote fairly frequently for her hobbies and work unquote she flies to the mid Atlantic at least once a year to visit her family she's flown to Hawaii French Polynesia Costa Rica she also flew to Washington DC for the hearing\nNote too that her attorneys refused a private hearing or interview Dr Ford testified that she was not clear whether investigators were willing to travel to California interviewer\nIt therefore it's not clear that her attorneys ever communicated chairman Grassley has offered to send investigators the meter in California or wherever she wanted to meet to conduct the interview\nWe pointed all these points that are important she alleges that she struggled academically in college but she's never made any similar claim about her two years of high school\n\nIt's significant that she used the word contributed contributed when she described the ... the psychological impact of the incidents of the Washington Post used the word contributed rather than cause suggests that other life events may contribute to her symptoms and one question on that point\nSaid that she could think of nothing as striking as the alleged assault in other words she wouldn't that to it\nAnd the prosecutor ads the activities of congressional Democrats and Dr Ford's attorney is likely affected Dr Ford's account\nAnd she attached a very detailed timetable\nOnce the
