what's our for your loss for about ... minutes far for your loss thank you sir\nI'm Sorry I had a question uh been trying to run this down about the case of warm Kim arc um and how I guess they said he had birthright citizenship or was that somehow related was his parents were his parents\nHere to parents were legal residents Chinese residents legal\nResidents in the United states so we're talking about illegal alien children now\nOkay that's what I was trying to ball is down through and I was researching and trying to read but I couldn't get the back story on his parents um\nYou know his parents who are here legally they were legal immigrants [noise] um and ah he was born in the United states\nAnd look I don't have a problem with that I think you can certainly find the fourteenth amendment support for that and the fourteenth amendment even if you do have a problem with\nIt doesn't matter there's the Supreme Court decision the idea that the president can't reverse what the bureaucracy did in the Nineteen sixties without any constitutional statutory authority he is the executive branch he's our president he doesn't have to listen what the what the Social Security administration says or this department or that department he's the boss\nAnd so the idea now that we need a constitutional amendment or a statute and the president can't reverse what the bureaucracy\nDiverse with the bureaucracy did in the Nineteen sixties without any constitutional statutory authority he is the executive branch he's our president he doesn't have to listen what the what the Social Security administration says or this department or that department he's the boss\nAnd so the idea now that we need a constitutional amendment or a statute and the president can't reverse what the bureaucracy did really by stone in the Nineteen sixties early seventies it's absurd\nThat's not to say these activist judges will compel it because they're activist judges they don't comply with the constitution but Paul Ryan has no idea what he's talking about nor do many of the others to sound like Kim let's say you can't change the constitution was an executive order he's not changing the constitution\nHe's complying with it he's complying with the man who drafted the amendment he's complying with the chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee he's complying with the interpretation of that amendment all the way through and so then the early Nineteen sixties\nAnyway I thought the but the nature would want to know thank you Tony\nBill Hayes can just a great K. R. M. R. do\nA mark good talking to you are listening to you and uh and on your TV says the very beginning I was given to her subscribers headway\nFile a somebody was talking about\nThe fourteenth amendment and their babies born in America from LA grow parents\nI ever saw and I'm from what I've read them and started that fourteenth amendment their reason for it was a that the slaves earlier would not\nConsider citizens this has to consider the slaves and their shoulders citizens now have to exactly correct why why is that gonna flip over here from the south and ... and but the parents are not\nDoesn't make a liquor Seth now they're saying well what can the president do they don't have anything to properly interpret that fourteenth amendment\nThat's right and uh I don't have a lot of faith in the courts or concerns me but the president has to do with the president has to do and he has to do what he thinks is right and uh\nI don't see why we need a constitutional amendment to reverse the bureaucracy did buy stuff in the Nineteen sixties you do need a constitutional amendment to undergo a constitutional amendment that that means what it says if you understand the text through the original meaning and the legislative history\nAlright bill not listen you've got a big governor's race there don't you\nYeah we do and I I don't think there's a problem\nI Hope you're

you very much for taking the time professor I was fascinated by your piece that you wrote on housing here in California is it true that the regulations Ruth restrictions literally ad fifty percent to the price of housing here in the state\n[noise] Oh yes absolutely do and in fact sixty percent might be an understatement um and there was a there was a report in or out of San Diego just two days ago indicating that building\nAnd affordable housing a unit a which is not a large unit is now at no cost up to four hundred and twenty five thousand dollars um which just just teams are beyond the pale um\nCalifornia is just the most expensive state in terms of regulation and it really does affect the price of housing and and the ability to\nPut a new construction and er which would which would bring asking practice at but California right now is forty nights and the country in terms of housing construction is very expensive to build in its time\nAnd it and it takes an awful long time\nProfessor my next question was going to be why aren't Californians outrage and recall studying economics in college or in in recognizing that the price of these regulations jacks up the price of a of housing but I didn't realize it was that high fifty percent and if I didn't realize that I think a lot of people aren't aware of it as well\n[noise] yes um I think people are becoming more aware of that now given just how rapidly prices are rising\nRecall studying economics in college or in in recognizing that the price of these regulations jacks up the price of a of housing but I didn't realize it was that high fifty percent and if I didn't realize that I think a lot of people are unaware of it as well\n[noise] yes um I think people are becoming more aware of that now given just how rapidly prices are rising I'm only about twenty six\nPercent of California household and this includes households with multiple wage earners only about twenty six percent of households can afford the median priced home in California\nAnd people often think well what about all those people that make those high salaries up in Silicon valley or forty bill is even worse they're only about Fifteen Percent of households in the Silicon Valley area can afford the median priced home in that location\nSo there's no there's no sense in which um there's ... there's absolutely a housing crisis in California and people are becoming very very upset about this and they're looking for government or to put in place policies that will make it easier and less costly to build a increase supply and bring those prices down\nYou might remember a few years ago professor I I got a fact check when I was on CNN when I talked about\nUm the ... the high cost of a of a of regulations and said that if you

attack helicopter African American I played for him this clip of Eddie go out our mutual friend on your show this is what he said\nIf it works politically but I Do because it means something citizenship in this country has always been tied to free white person system naturalization act of Seventeen Ninety so when folks this question of immigration and you see planes with the Republican base is all about a certain conception of what this\nThis idea why is it has led to eleven people being gay in in in Pittsburgh people in a Kroger go before last so here we are after the carnage and this man this moral monster is playing to those bases\nDown at definitely want to ask John James has been endorsed by Trump loves Trump is going to support Trump and as an African American what he thought about and they said well you got excited it's obviously passionate and true but it's not representative of the entire African American community what do you deal with\nThat no one person's voice is representative of an entire community\nRight whether it's any or John or president shopper you or me I'd voice doesn't represent all women it doesn't represent our mothers doesn't represent off from New Jersey um so I I think that he can have the view and I think the candidate you speak up connected\nSo when when Eddie says moral monster which is what I'm getting too it struck me is like when Julia Ioffe said the Jake Tapper that the president had radicalized more people than ISIS and she had to stop and get her moment to apologize I don't think Donald Trump's immoral monster do you\nI struggled with Donald Trump from a moral perspective right he's the president of the United states\nAnd while he might say things that you could say that many I've said that at the dinner table you've said that at the dinner table it doesn't matter I didn't have to hold himself to a higher scandal or you could say Stephanie it's no big deal and she said and nationalistic need the Patriot some could think that\nBut knowing what he divided divisive time we're living if you're the president of the United states it is your obligation raised us up on a more level\nAnd be absolutely careful and mindful of everywhere you well I knew that and I am saying\nLike on a national is going on a patriot go with I support ah America First are being a great American so so in terms of being a moral monster I think the president doesn't put morals first and I think he does the country's first\nNow okay now I don't want to put you in a corner I moral monster though is different I really reject the president's use of enemy that people because it's just all of this term that usually was followed by a bullet through the back of the neck\nI really reject the politics of division I reject a lot of stuff like that these done over the but he's not a moral monster he's a controversial them a dollar\nAnd then it it it if you don't want to if you if you don't if you care so much about the division and the divide pick any topic you don't pick the topic is the president of all monster that topic capitalize on division chicken new conversation you want to talk about yet I'd love to talk about that\nBut that's a that's a topic from your show that's why I picked up that's otherwise they wouldn't throw it out she was just out of your show they\nKnow that something somewhat set on my show and then we moved on but if you choose to continue to capitalize on it you're capitalizing on division\nI don't I don't know if it's capitalizing if it's if it happens like the Julia Ioffe thing and it becomes obvious story coming back to it for one segment isn't capital I just wanted to know whether or not angry at that moment ads\nHis has ... if he chooses to believe that the president of the moral monster he can you know what if I was an African American and I felt like the president I'm not even sure if he acknowledged does to people who are killed because of their race at a croaker last week\nOkay this is a purely professional question do you have an obligation as the host to say you know there are a lot of African Americans who don't agree with you Eddie when you call them a moral monster do you have an obligation\nI Do not feel like I have that obligation\nInteresting I I check the other day I'm One of my guests who who called someone or a creature and I said I checked them I

savings the sim were on the low end with the Thirteen point nine billion dollars on upper in about thirty million dollars so there's where most of the payment and actually I'm from and what's that mean that we can do it actually end up build with interviews were actually introducing that bill today\nAnd now you can support for it I Want to report\nThe fourth one is gets back to what I said about the Heritage Foundation that is that a\n... a date that benefits the while we're only paying for the the uh the ten thousand dollars in taxes\nThat that will stop so is it the actual the fourth point here and the big point is not you can't exactly they put a price tag on it but it will accumulate statements that is the wall itself well it's a the the age as they said they were all were actually stopped Ninety percent of illegal\n... one and people say are just bring a bigger ladder they don't really know what they're talking about because they work they work in a while ago they work in Israel they work everywhere\nIn stock and say you add up all that that more than pays for the wall and and so it's a beautiful thing\nNow I now I Want to switch switched on your Mr Chairman a you know I Am a huge supporter of the United States Navy and President Trump promised a three hundred and fifty five ship navy during the campaign\nHe reiterated it on the deck of the Ford his Senate many many times it's been two years and we have a plan for a three hundred and eight ship navy and sucker defense Madison sucking in the navy Spencer dodge this question again and again when are we going to get a plan on how to get the three fifty five 'cause that's what we need\nI Know it and every time I've heard you say that you have to remind myself to maybe get on that show and\nAnd let you know one of the reasons it's falling behind a little bit first of all nobody out there were very few if your listeners are different because they've heard it and that for me talking about they for others talking about it in terms of what did Obama due to the military\nNow I don't criticize Obama for this because he is in\nIn the heart liberals who really you know you know where their priorities are in is not in defending America but what we inherited from him uh we were in our army brigade combat unit as an example we're down to only thirty three percent of those could be deployed right because he\nHas problems and all of that now we rephrase that uh thirty three percent ... percent so we're we're in the right direction now this team as a result of our authorization do end appropriations bill you got to keep in mind we did a great school getting are offered his Asian through in record time and then that procreation\nAll of a sudden we now have operations those less than it real serious problem but this anyway that's resolved that problem I remember our army aviation brigade they were down to twenty five recently twenty five percent to be deployed were up ... percent now the other areas that I was going to go out is\nThe the Marines use efficacy and we'll have thirty five percent of breath Eighteen to fly in and so that was the really serious probably had along with the problem that was pointed out by this terrible that you'll see is a staff\nThat is that we're out range and artillery in other areas\nSo somebody is going to read it\nI Know that you would like to prioritize and get started on this shift and I I think we can do it that's a long range program that I wanted to stop the bleeding and the areas that had is that as an immediate effect\nI get it and I

gotten worse\nYou know look at this this horrible terrorist attack in the shooting took place in the Pittsburgh synagogue and\nWhat does the media but they're blaming Donald Trump port and meanwhile the the guy responsible for the shooting hated Trump in large part because of his\nStrong support for Israel including moving the capital to Jerusalem wearable along so well it's interesting so what is your take I mean how are people reacting I'm I assume you're getting a fortune\nOf negative ads thrown at you and how are the people of Iowa reacting to\nOh yeah I'm getting out and about four to one for my opponent and Nancy Pelosi and the superPACs out there so it's message versus money my opponent all her money is coming from from the east and the left the end the west coast a message over money and results right\nResults look what we have done with this economy on the national international stages well with the president when it comes to sitting down with North Korea\nHad it for ... ah we would help or making sure that yeah we did move that embassy from Tel Aviv Israel prompts has kept and being a shining light on the hill or were there was a lot of doctors for a long time still is but the shining brighter we lead into world others will follow\nA more prosperity and peace uh you'd want to go backwards that's how important this election is right now\nI think it's about a lot of things I get our voter\nLook I took a vote for any Democrat and any district for four hundred and thirty five house seats up for grabs his vote proposed because your opponent will vote for Nancy Pelosi and vote with her I'm sure Ninety eight percent of the time just like in the Senate if you vote for any Democrat you're voting for sure\nUm to me a lot of it is you know look at the limitation of due process presumption of innocence during the Kavanaugh hearings\nA look at the the agenda Democrats\nIs it's it's out there they want their crumbs back because they want the taxes the tax cuts that are putting a lot of money in the pockets of middle class Americans they want it back they want to eliminate eyes open borders they want to keep Obamacare and how they're running on health care is just\nThe definition of just or Cassidy considering they ... how many there are counties I read in Iowa that have seen two hundred percent increases in their premiums people lost their doctors and plans and they have one health care option that's it one provider that's\nIt yeah and and those that are paying it are paying twenty to thirty thousand dollars a year or their premiums their deductibles are so high\nThey can't even if they just risk and don't even go to a doctor but you're exactly right my opponent we had three opportunities to distance herself from Nancy Pelosi and she said she couldn't think of a an issue where they could be separated so what's that mean she's a rubber stamp\nFor hopefully not a Speaker Pelosi but increasing taxes open borders doubling down on government run health care and of course what they've tried to keep under the rug shot and you do this and our listeners know this impeachment\nNow that an endless investigation but not into the deep

this is an important race it's on our top thirty we have the top Seventy racist if you want to go to our interactive map at ... dot com and the most important house races that will tip the balance of

can't take anything for granted go to David Young for Iowa dot com to volunteer and help us make sure we keep the majority thank you Sean for all you do you\nBet welcome a hope all the best to you and six days ah it's tough out\nThere nobody can predict what certainty but I Will tell you\nThey don't I I just there's something about um some things not clicking with me and I never you never really have a feel for how the house was going to go twenty ten might be an exception\nWhere I mean it was a massive landslide and you could see it coming same thing I Would argue when Bill Clinton became president Nineteen Ninety four remember Republicans have been out of power for forty years that Newt Gingrich became the speaker of the house\nYou know so if you look at history and this is what Republicans are up against their forty five retirement and\nA headwind of history that usually the the party in power loses a lot of seats in the first term but then like in the case of Bill Clinton it was Newt Gingrich in many ways Newt saving of Clinton because things got better\nBecause Newt Gingrich forced Clinton into what led to balance budgets and and serious reforms in Washington\nAnd I think the same thing you know you go to a bomb on me and it was just a white powder and twenty ten and especially after Obamacare and you know the fact that Democrats are that that's their main talking point now\nI'm this is really fascinating to me this brash means to poll out today I had to go back and double check it showing that African American support for the president is now hit an all time high of forty percent\nI mean that's a five hundred percent improvement\nIf you go back to election day twenty sixteen when he got eight percent of the African American vote in the country in

I Do as a kid you know I'm not really in a band pliers and Kristen Stewart\nAlthough you know [laughter] and where will not\nNervous because I didn't know what you were talking about but Don I talked

can I tell you what you inspired me to do\nWith I'd love to tell me I Love inspiring people\nOkay so I ran around town everybody that I got on your show and everybody was like were you nervous or your fate and I don't that no no but what I realized was when we're talking about the young and how are we going to get people to tune in to a conservative talk radio\nI last went out to Willis in North Dakota right worked in the oil field\nAnd now in the evening I came in after scrubbing toilets experimental cleaning business out there at a cleaning and catering business right yeah so I come in at night and I was in my truck because that's where I could contain audio and I hated the ballot\nConservative talk radio I last went out to well let's see North Dakota right worked in the oil field\nAnd now in the evening I came in after scrubbing toilets it's our email cleaning business out there either cleaning and catering business right yeah so\nI come in at night and I would say in my truck because that's where I could contain audio and I hated the ballet DeAngelis show and it was created for people that don't normally listening to talk radio so the silent majority Eighteen year old rock next six year old black liberals women were listening to my children at the highlight of it\nHad a following of like twenty thirty some thousand\nAwesome internationally as well yeah that's good for you well let me ask you this is all\nI'm back here in Minneapolis and it might actually go read and do the job that we need to do and prove to try and that we a hundred percent a hundred and fifty percent support him because it's now the Trump train and and the fat in Newburg has closed the gap for Clovis shower\nWard low is Thirteen percent higher than Alice and there's some really good signs here for going red in Minneapolis\nWell the last thing is I Want to remind people there are very important house races in uh Minneapolis ah in well in Minnesota for those race um that are going to tip the balance of power like Southern California it's interesting New York New Jersey or places like Minnesota\nMichigan California state you wouldn't expect that's where a lot of these tossup races that I keep talking about our um look but let me ask you when you move to North Dakota and you're and you did this radio show and you started your own business did\nYou make a lot more money I\nMean here I mean we were in such a bad recession in Minneapolis and when I moved out there I mean that excitement and all the jobs are not going to say I want to give us out to the oil field because hunted victory\nTo what a lot of people here about a booming and will stand I met some of the finest people in the world and the most hard working and I got to live the American dream which really didn't exist back then but\n[noise] it's been it's been ... about two to one at this point no they're not spend two to one but the good news people know me that help and so you\nKnow the lives that they tell really aren't getting the narrative but\nWe're all male and state every all ballots have been out for ... for a week and a half now and so every day's election day every day is election day I got the most left wing opponent I have ever had\nA you know she she woke up the day after Hillary law and decided that you need to be a member of Congress in March and more angry protests in Seattle increase in the district\nThinks it hating the president and somehow a qualification to be a member of Congress but Sean I think we're all hoping for more than that aren't we\nDo you get it well of course we are we want to help the forgotten men and women and we have a trajectory of success or that I think has been unparalleled the as quick as any politician has promised stuff and then make those promises happen [laughter]\nYeah it's it's it's just ridiculous that's essentially what she's running on and uh and so we're we've been doing everything from going door to door or eight thousand houses personally I'm a second pair of shoes or we need people to come make phone calls doorbell with a volunteer contribute you know Dino Rossi dot com come help\nYeah what what do you think do you get a day by day return in terms of a Republican Democrat or do they not give that information out there and\nWe don't register by party in our state so it's only based on what we buy deed and uh and our people are voting whatsoever there's clearly asking a master so we really got to get our people the mail and about anybody listening to us right now if you haven't senator ... do it now get your family to do it all your friends get it in because\nOf the ... comes in the same work take after list a heartless do when you get to the heart cases who may or may not vote unless we talk to him\nWell she's just writing running basically on hate as you said so that's the main difference she wants Obamacare let me guess she wants to impeach the president he wants to open borders she wants to crumbs back anything else that's any different from the rest of the checklist of every other Democrat running\nWell that is a checklist\nWe have a few other things that are that we're in the ad obviously we we we don't have a state income tax or state she favorites that that's been turned down nine times by the public a year but she's she's still on that bandwagon\nOr you know when she attacks the all time for a for not being a fan of Obamacare when Obamacare came in I lost my health care myself my wife and my my four children and I ended up with a lousy plan to cast too and at times as much didn't cover things I Want coverage coverage things I didn't want covered\nThe twelve thousand dollar family deductible on top of that you know my goal is to have as many health insurance companies chasing people around for their business we can possibly get so you can decide what's your plan versus some bureaucratic politician decided for you it's called freedom\nListen we wish you the best Dino Rossi\nPlan to cast to an armed as much cover things I Want coverage coverage and I didn't want covered\nTwelve thousand dollar family deductible on top of that you know my goal is to have as many health insurance companies chasing around their business you're possibly get so you can decide what's your plan or some bureaucratic politician disparity for you it's called freedom\nWell listen we wish you the best Dino Rossi a that is the difference between Republicans and a conservative agenda or the radical left agenda Nancy Pelosi\nI keep reminding people vote for any Democrat anywhere in the country is a vote for her and it is because the electorate speaker and a vote for any Democrat in the Senate well that's pretty much a vote for sure so I Hope the people in Washington state's eighth district get out there for Dino Rossi\nUh I Know you've done a good job and you worked hard and a sadly you have to take all of the incoming it's pretty pathetic\nUm but so thank you so much for being with us and we wish you all all the best this was one of those races\nThe Washington state eighth district where this was the tipping point the balance of power is right there if you're in the ... district ... thank you wish you the best\nThank you very much John taker\nRight eight hundred dying for one Sean is hard toll free telephone number if you want to be a part of the program well you've been telling me all day that you want to do something funny and that you're not even paying attention to the show\nWhile I was going to say goodbye to her I guess the by all means let's\nTalk about what what would you all day you been threatening oh I'm going to say something funny what\nIs I ... it's not it's funny to me I think it's funny I think our audience a lot of\nI Want to do a poll whole uh-huh on Hannity dot com perhaps and I was\nThinking about Hannity dot com or we have all the tossup races it only has already most important races so if you're out there and you're registered Republican you need to go to Hannity dot com and look at the thirty most important races in the country we also have an interactive map which has all Seventy races\nAvailable for you to see everything ... top when you're right it's in the carousel is the first story or a ... if you have any questions or concerns please call us that eight hundred nine for one day it again in the four story in the first story\nFirst the first ... say Singapore Singapore Singapore it's not Singapore say coffee coffee coffee\nCoffee it it is coffee say somebody said to me that they talk the talk so yesterday I answered the phone and this guy was calling from Texas and he had a nice comment but it took him Thirteen Years to get there so I said please we meet up a little bit and he goes listen they became [laughter]\nThis hot talk here from New York I hear you talk real fast [laughter] and that's just the way it's going to be I was like you know what ... oh that's right maybe maybe\nThe last person I Would think that would get insulted at anything settled eighty assigned\nSweetheart dialing honeybee sugar pie and like all the\nSugar bye honey bunch because my sons right I think a very\nYoung so anyways so and I was thinking that it will be a lonely or I have a good story or a gun keep interrupting your show host your terrible listening oh no you're not ... on my mind right I can reclaim lifetime just think about Maxine Waters is the head of financial committee to think about\nThat for one second just a brief diversion so I was thinking it might be nice if on election night you hosted your own show and I think we should take a poll and see if America would like to see her through her own show okay well we'll see\nWhat you're saying is which has been a fact all my twenty three years of Fox's I don't work on election night this is true and it's all Fox News division that takes over\nAnd I went one year I went in and uh you know I was on for five minutes and I'm like I I Want to be home alone and I want to have my three TV sets off for depending if I can set up another one in the meantime\nAnd my six computers and I want to do what I always do\nI Want to be looking at percentages and finding out beforehand whether we're winning or losing\nNow the former president of Fox News bill shine can attest to the fact that has emails to the fact\nThat I have called it right before anybody else every single election year because\nYou know I'm sitting there looking at let's see uh\nUh Cuyahoga County and Palm Beach county and the panhandle and southwest Florida and I can figure out usually Broward County all these important counties whether or not Republicans are going to win or lose now there's a little tougher because of\nThe different congressional races my guess is it's going to be late into the morning before we can ascertain who can maintain control of the house\nIn large part because California matters Southern California we been featuring the seven important races there on our list on Hannity dot com the thirty most important racist Seventy total important races although they're all important and I'm just not sure people understand what a Speaker Pelosi means\nTo heartbeat away and you have a woman who says we have to pass the bill to find out what's in it yeah that's what you went running your country then by all means staying home\nListening at the end of the day will deal with whatever it is where I'm going to reach their ... well you can rage away as long as it's not against\nMe I don't really care I'm going to be so mad at Republicans if they don't go out and vote well a very\nIt's very exciting at least on ... she's already checked out the drapes she has got to be covered\nUm I'm not so sure I'd want one of the unknown factor is the ... the greatest hope for Republicans in my opinion\nIs that it absolutely there is an unknown Trump factor\nAll bets are off 'cause I don't think Trump supporters of the type of people are going to answer anybody's call for any poll ever I don't I've been with calls me I never get called for a poll and polls you know I look at them I Know the conventional\nWisdom is is I read real clear politics every day you know they ... as an eighty five percent Democrats take the house\nOf but I also know that they got it wrong in two thousand for two thousand and fourteen and two thousand and sixteen and not the only did they get it wrong they did it in a colossal spectacular way\nSo I'm just saying to the American people don't be swayed by polls don't be dispirited if you think you can't win assume that you're behind and go out there on the field that is why we play the game\nAnd you know sometimes your favorite team wins and sometimes your favorite team loses I didn't particularly enjoy election nights and two thousand and eight yeah because you can't swallow\nYou cannot complain if you don't vote to go out and vote ... I Can't complain because I'm basically my talking about you everybody knows you vote\nHas nothing to do with the voting I said oh we can do is informed people has everything to do with the voting no it has everything to do with everybody my my vote is meaningless in New York for the most part\nNow we know we're in a blue state so we do the best we\nCan do boating I don't do it every year we do our civic duty and but I Am saying look look at where it's important look at what states presidents do whatever the he's not doing eight states than a Lebanon rally blitz\nCalifornia Florida Iowa Ohio we all need you go\nThan a Lebanon rally blitz California Florida Iowa Ohio we all need you go\nHey Sean Hannity here before you joined me in the afternoon don't forget you can catch your local news on AM nine twenty K V E L news talk sport only\nFive FM and am nine twenty two [laughter]\nWhere the basin problems to talk news stars now\n[noise]\nBreaking news is our from town hall ... president from thousands more military troops could be deployed\nTo the U.S Mexico border White House correspondent Greg ... report\nThe president is considering more troop deployments to the southern border to combat illegal immigration\nWill go off to anywhere between benefit the vows military personnel on top of border patrol life he\nSays the move would be aimed at preventing the entry of a caravan of migrants traveling from Central America nobody's coming in the president says immigrants are welcome as long as they enter the U.S legally ... and the White House the suspect\nIn the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre has been indicted by a federal grand jury indictment which was expected was announced today that charges Robert powers with forty four counts including hate crimes federal prosecutors have previously indicated they planned to seek the death penalty\nPakistan's top court on Wednesday acquitted a Christian Woman who was sentenced to death on blasphemy charges in two thousand ten\nA landmark ruling that sparked protests by hard line Islamists raised fears of violence\nChief justice me on ... announced the verdict to a packed courtroom and ordered ... be be released she has been held at an undisclosed location for security reasons and is expected to leave the country BBC correspondents ... reports from Islam about\nOne would imagine that there would ... underway between the finding that representative and other foreign countries about ... it'd be be could potentially moved to ... to an aside and say for example\nA former federal investigators as a mafia hit man as a suspect in the prison slaying of Boston crime boss James Whitey Bolger the official told the Associated Press on Wednesday that phobias Freddie G.

served in combat\nHe's now saying that the census wrote a book that support slavery\n\nSo I I went back and I read what this guy Gillum is talking about and it's also up at hot air if you want to check it but I I'll upon them it's not supporting slavery in the least he's explaining one happened here's what he wrote here's what he wrote\n\nHe wrote and I'm paraphrasing but what happened at the constitutional convention\n[noise] what's that they couldn't push the issue of slavery as far as someone or to push it\nAlthough some wanted to push it all the way that is the abolition of it because you wouldn't have a United States under those circumstances you wouldn't have brought in South Carolina Georgia and some of these other states in this there's no question that's the history\nOf what took place that's the history of what took place Benjamin Franklin was an abolitionist\nAlexander Hamilton was an abolitionist several of them were abolitionist but they voted\nThe way they voted\nBecause they felt they needed to have a union and then from there they could address the rest that's exactly what took place you know who else took that position sixty years later\nWell Seventy some years later Abraham Lincoln he explained it exactly the same way that they had to leave it to their progeny their children and grandchildren to fix the citrus slavery\n\nBut if there hadn't been to a union they wouldn't have been a civil war to\nEliminate that's what the census rights\nFor all intents and purposes taking up the position that Lincoln took up taking a position to Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton took up so\nThis guy Andrew Gillum says that demonstrates that the scientists wrote a book defending slavery\n\nNow this man is repulsive and he's a demagogue\nHe has a lot of his way through this election about the undercover FBI investigation not only the city but him\nYeah it was just shut up when they gave him that ticket to Hamilton it was set up when they gave him a ... a hotel room what was that set up when he got a trip to Costa Rica any pretense\nThat he wasn't under or is not under investigation and if you didn't raise it you're attacking\nAll African Americans that's how they stretch it out\nThat's how they shut you down but I Want to tell you a little bit more about this man who the Democrats are hanging their hopes on rock Obama's in Florida

name dream defenders is it two thousand five graduate have Gillum former why he for group\n\nNow yelling swipe before he gave Agnew that Norman Lear award named after the producer and activists who founded people for the American way you know that group hardcore left wing trashes constitutional is nominees to the court\n\nGillum has faced controversy over his refusal that disavowed dream defenders which has engaged in activism to promote the boycott of Israel as spouses anti patriotic anti capitalism anti military and anti police ideology with which has already been associated\nThe dream defenders website refers to the Empire State of Israel as quote the site of a continued settlers colonial project on ... said this is\nAll about anti Semitism\nAnd laments US military aid to the Jewish state large section of the site promotes the group's anti Israel activists now why isn't this being reported on CNN\nAnd MSNBC instead they're promoting him\nGillum stream defenders allies compiled an education tool for us teachers about quote liberation movements and that glorifies the popular front for the liberation of Palestine PF helped me a deadly terrorist organization\nWell I guess he has a lot in common with Obama\nRepublican challenger round the census has repeatedly called for them to distance himself from the dream defenders\n\nAnd during a debate nine days ago going claimed that he had no idea what the scientists was referring to when he brought up a dream defenders pledge Gillum reportedly signed that simple\nRepublican challenger Ron descent as has repeatedly called for him to distance himself from the dream defenders\nAnd during a debate nine days ago Gillum claimed that he had no idea what the scientists was referring to when he brought up a dream defenders pledge Gillum reportedly signed\nThat supports a radical manifesto the fact is Andrew signed a pledge with a dream defenders pledging support this radical manifesto dissent just said during the debate\nI have no idea what pledge he's talking about the only reply so he's a liar\nAnd that's a pattern whether it's taking the Hamilton a hotel room Costa Rica is that patter\nBall face lie because he thinks his supporters and his would be voters are so stupid they're going to buy is race baiting his Jew baiting they're going to buy his Hawaii\nYellen's claim of ignorance\nAbout the pledge came despite is already know close relationship with dream defenders Gillum has talked about aiding the group's activism and has written in strong support of dream defenders and its cofounder

Huntington Beach California have dinner Rohrabacher don't agree with Dana Rohrabacher on everything but I can tell you this is a good man\nHe's oregano I remember when he and I worked in the Reagan White house together he was a speechwriter for Ronald Reagan he's in the fight of his career now that you really want some left wing cook to represent you\nThere are other races in California about seven of them and the Democrats are hoping to win all seven so they can take the house and I can assure you that the media if it's close or they're going to be pushing these races all through the night\nTo try and influence the outcomes in California for a Republican you know live in one of these districts you must not give up your must vote\n\nYou must vote so a lot of important races in California they got a big race for governor in Oregon they might actually get a Republican governor the first one in forty years can you imagine that but there's big races all over the country look in my state become a wealth of Virginia\nWe've got Dave Brat so what they did the Democrats as they've found a former CIA employee who is a left wing cook\n\nBut she keeps campaigning on the fact that she's a former CIA employee\n\nBecause the left is many of them trying to cover their trail they can try and cover what they really are and who they really are she will vote to impeach the president of the United states and Dave Brat as a member of the Freedom Caucus is crucially important that's an important race\nWe're Barbara Comstock in northern Virginia she's the only Republican left in northern Virginia she's it and she's being targeted by the gun control crowd Bloomberg she's being targeted by the ... the pack and all the left this they want to take her down\nOf course conservatives have been disappointed with summer her positions\nBut the choices between her and the biggest tax or\nHave a in modern times in the state Senate origin\n...\nWho also voted to impeach Trump so I urge my love and I said these different districts that turned out and vote for Tom stuck and the vote for some of these other candidates\nYou need some of these rhinos in order to win this isn't what your clean out the rhinos you clean up the rhinos in Republican primaries\nBut we have certain candidates in New York New Jersey and the Supreme Court a Pennsylvania controlled by the Democrats you know what they did these low down Sony justice is\nNot too long ago a few months ago they completely ... district did the state but Democrats which may in fact if you don't\nTurn out all

well for aspect to it and it obviously must comply with the constitution and that's part of the problem with the rock Obama era or they went so far beyond the pale\nPresident Trump is doing it right and we know unfortunately Joe mansion his first vote in the U.S Senate would have power Schumer and that radical team that was on full display of obstruction and resistance during the judge Kavanaugh nomination\nAnd the people of West Virginia\n[noise] they need to understand that when Hillary Clinton and her bunch talked about deplorable they're talking about people hardworking men and women blue collar men and women like the wonderful citizens of West Virginia tell me what if the Democrats done in the last forty years for coal miners I Can't think of a single thing other than trying to put them out of work\nI work I think the biggest thing is when you of a presidential nominee who says we're not put a lot of coal miners in coal companies out of work you might be able to say oops and try to take it back but the people West Virginia don't forget that's one of the major reasons why Joe my actions going down that is true self\nThrough the fact is that Joe mansion vice president Pence said All right he's there when you don't need him he's never going to lead and they certainly not going to stand together with President Trump and that's why more and more people as they're examining the contrast between my campaign\nAnd Joe mansion coming over to our side that's why we're tied or maybe I'll buy one and the latest poll we feel very good\nBut I have to tell you um are we have to get the word out because Chuck Schumer and the coastal elites Bloomberg and Soros and all these radicals\nThey're coming in and they're spending unbelievable money we think it's going to be over twenty five million West Virginia most expensive state in the country per capita in the Senate electric\nPatrick Morrisey if America wants to donate to your campaign of the people of West Virginia want to turn out in support of the grassroots level what is your website\nOr our website is Patrick Morsi dot com and that's to ours and want to ask since the folks consider donating twenty five dollars right now you'd make the difference we know that Schumer the other day just dumped seven hundred thousand more money in\nThe Democratic Senatorial Committee put a couple of hundred born today we're fighting like back in the arena and we're going to win but you know how we're going to win or you know went through these grassroots patriots that are listening to you mark\nUp people care about the constitution people care about the rule of law the separation of powers that's what I've been all about as the state attorney general a West Virginia that's how I'm going to act in the U.S Senate buddy\nPatrick Morrisey dot com to ours want to ask and please twenty five dollars here twenty five dollars there the limits twenty seven hundred we need to fight that Schumer mansion Clinton team or\nBecause they've got the money but we've got the heart and we have a Trump Card\nAnd you know what if we can't get two Republican senators out of West Virginia to give him with the Democrats have done to your state it's going to be very very tough so uh I Hope the folks in West Virginia understand what man she comes home and he smiles and he shakes hands any\nAny kind of doesn't Lincoln a nod about the liberals in Congress when somebody he votes with them Ninety eight percent of the time so I'm\nA and all these big votes you gotta sit recklessly on the edge of your chair and wonder if he's going to come through or not is he's trying to figure out what is best for his his political career I assume Patrick you're going to take a leading role defending your stay you're going to take a leading role as a conservative\nWe are mark and and I appreciate you saying that as attorney general we helped lead a lot of these national challenges we\nStood against illegal amnesty and we were very strong we took on that rock Obama EPA time after time\nLook we say no to this PC nonsense that comes out of a laugh I mean what they did is absolutely outrageous and anyone who says that Joe Manchin ... only voted for cabinet or they have to look back at one point\nDo you know that all of the shenanigans and the obstruction resistant circus that we saw could have been avoided\nIf Joe mansion it's stepped out earlier instead of taking a powder when they called his name first so that he could wait for the state of Maine Susan Collins to cast the deciding vote that's a profound cowardice and that's not going to be my approach on the exact opposite\nAll right Patrick Morrisey I Wish you all the best I obviously support your effort very very strongly and give out your Web site again so America can try and help you hear\nWell thank you it's Patrick Morsi dot com and that's to ours and want to ask and once again if you'd donate twenty five dollars or a hundred dollars or whatever you can do I'm fighting gets the machine but I tell you what we're tied in the polls and I think we're going to get it done\nBecause I think people speak a lot louder than money but your
