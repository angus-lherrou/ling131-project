terminate and replace NAFTA Andy NAFTA trade agreements with an incredible new U.S Mexico Canada agreement called us MCA sort of just\nWhat [noise] and [noise] we have negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity\nTo me it's the most important word and drink because we've been treated so unfairly by so many nations all over the world that we're changing that by the way without tariffs we wouldn't be talking about a deal just for those babies out there that keep talking about terrorists\nThat includes Congress oh please don't charge tariffs without terrorists you wouldn't be we wouldn't be standing here I can tell you Bob and all of these votes would not be standing here right now and we're totally prepared to do that if they don't negotiate\nOnce approved by Congress this new deal will be the most modern up to date and balance trade agreement in the history of our country with the most advanced protections for workers ever develop\nNow the a caller asked me if I'm prepared to apologize of course not\nLet me tell you something initially President Trump talked about terrorists in order for\nUh for national security remember that never mind that we produce most of them are still here and the two other major suppliers Canada and Mexico are friendly countries so the national security stuff with the U.S and you know if he's not saying that\nNow if the goal is to reduce tariffs with our trading partners I'm all for in the short run doing something to make them stand down the question is is this going to benefit the American consumer\nAnd it's too early to tell that New York times called it a victory for the president and it is the hill did as well and it is because he campaign to reevaluate their renegotiate NAFTA the question is is it going to be positive for the American consumers for example\nNew York times points out that for the first time the new agreement mandates that an increasing percentage of parts for any Tara free vehicle must come from so called high wage factory\nThe agreement says they'll sacrifice pay a minimum sixteen dollars an hour in average salaries for production workers that's about triple the average wage in Mexico right now\nAnd the assumption is that division will force automakers to ship supplies from Mexico or Canada to this country\nBut there is to that automotive Alice it warned that the provision could have a damaging effect for Americans ... by raising costs for American car buyers and incentivizing automakers to move production the low cost countries outside of the country like China so we don't we don't know yet\nAnd uh I Wanna find out more about it before I determine whether or not the president has done the right thing with NAFTA and know

move production to low cost countries outside of the country like China we don't we don't know yet\nAnd I want to find out more about it before I determine whether or not the president has done the right thing with NAFTA and it was popular among the base especially and now all that stuff or any Sanders has become a anti free trade and um the Republican Party also anti free trade are both parties now have pretty much the same position on trade\nOne more time\nThis is about consumers and tariffs if they are designed to protect industries that are there are feeling all they do is prevent the business people from doing the kinds of things that need to do in order to make those businesses competitive\nAnd if the idea is to retaliate against or the or the country for so called dumping products on us dumping simply means of other companies are are being subsidized by their government\nThey're not making money but they are being subsidized by government and and if that's stupid why

talent but as\nI look at myself as a guy I have not spent my life studying the Bible um I read it now more than I ever have and you you have made this a part of your life study\nYes I just when I I really wasn't a believer when I was a young adult and I\nKnow your incorrigible jerk like me [laughter] you know like Brett Kavanaugh at\nAll I Know like that or like rock Obama's was part of the human gangs smoking pot and we'd and yeah and drinking in excess yeah\nThere you go in and so I just I was always a seeker and I kept\nLooking for answers and and and finally I found the answers that that uh I thought were intellectual opposite goals and I don't really think they were ultimately but there are intellectual answers reasonable answers and we can give\nReasonable answers to why we believe in were encouraged by uh the Bible Peter that tells us that always be prepared to give the reader that you believe and there are rational reason to believe in fate is beyond reason of course but it's consistent with rate\nBut there are intellectual answers reasonable answers and weaken\nReasonable answers to why we believe in were encouraged by the Bible\nHeaters that tells us to always be prepared to give the reader that you believe and there are rational reason to believe in fate is beyond reason of course but it's just great so I wanted to share with the game began I'll make this quick\nQuick I I got on fire for the Bible in theology so I've been reading it pretty heavy on and off for Twenty years\nAnd I have a passion to share what I've learned and helped people accelerate their learning curve reduce their uh intimidation about scripture\nAll right so let's go through all three cases that the the Democrats now want or expand the investigation they they never wanted a limited investigation they wanted to know floods investigation is now being the seventh\nFrom every indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work but if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed\nThat these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness\nTo the alleged abuse in her case um was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nWill the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mr Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't sure short herself was Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News anymore if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate the stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nOr even the Democrats are um declined to fully embrace the Julie sweat next story\nBut on the original story the Christine for a story I think what we're going to find and what we're already finding um is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like PJ Smith and mark judge amazingly enough\nThey're telling the FBI the same thing I told you this shirt committee which they have no memory at all or to support this now I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections or you're not remember\nA Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal with this party entry into Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two\nThirty six years in three months ago by the way\nI'm ... who is that the party and it didn't match up with a\nWith Christine forks account of this but they thought this was a big deal so\nLet's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that that I think there are three additional people calm burning and squeaky or who had not been interviewed earlier a and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about\nA Christine ports are allegations so uh I listen I I I don't think this FBI thing\nFBI investigation is a bad thing I think that they will find out that there is no evidence to support this very good find out actual real evidence to support it than I've changed my mind but I don't think it's fair\nWell if you go through I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell um now he's the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes\nAnd she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be extremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so\nThey brought in an independent prosecutor to\nTo question professor Ford who showed incredible respect for her but she pointed out that he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove itself\nAnd then she goes on this cases even weaker than that and then she stopped afford identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues\nThere was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault happened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually the failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh's the assailant\nAre inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember key details who invited forward to the party how did you get to the party where does the party even take place how did you get home from the party um and and it goes on from there but every case is similar in as much as there is no corroboration there\nIdentify judge Kavanaugh's the assailant\nAre inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember key details who invited forward to the party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place how did you get home from the party um and and it goes on from there but every case is similar\nIn as much as there's no corroboration their big holes in the stories and at some point when do we ask\nIs this becoming a witch hunt we know that ... cats as a friend sending out emails\nAnd she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly consistent on the issue of of sexual misconduct and they're sending out letters to dear so and so do you know anything please call us and we'll do those letters went out\nI Know some core operation you know the ... case right in the time they said they called they talked to dozens of people not to me that says twenty four people or more I mean that is a lot\nOf people can look at it and on on the ritual ritual thing you know she was a lot of criticism of her and um I think that the way she approached it was not\nA really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they have to be on a rocket every five minutes but she did\nIt listed all our nation I was working today at her questioning of a Ford about her therapist and the therapist notes and the way we even know about this because remember\nFord says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty thirty six years\nTo two thousand twelve and she ... she says she's in marriage therapy with her husband and she tells\nThe therapist about that and she later also tells an individual therapist\nAbout that as well and she checks the therapists notes and the therapists notes do not mention the name Brett Kavanaugh and she says as a matter of fact it's only her husband remembering that after session she brought up Brett Kavanaugh's name that is the only evidence\nThat it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the ... there are would be confidential but of course she gave them to the Washington Post so they're probably no longer\nA confidential ... even even her account of how she finally mentioned it to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have Judiciary Committee Democrats now they're wanting to investigate the quote ice throwing incident in college you know this is what it sounds\nLike you're on the trigger but that's what they say\nWell now we have the the democratic hope uh Hawaii senator the one that said the men to just shut up and sit down and Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants that investigation into the ice throwing incident\nI'm at a ball game and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity\nAbout was he truthful about his drinking he said he lives here he liked to drink beer then he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college in high school kids I drink too much fear but they said well he must have blacked out in this event um\nNobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said to somebody I blacked out correct so did you become a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him\nSo here you know ... question mhm yeah go ahead where were these artists\nThat things have changed you know from an emphasis on the the sex misconduct allegations too was he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact\nThat there really isn't any evidence to support the sex\nOr allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking although mentioned many times in his testimony that he did um in fact\nDrink today rocks published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking trick is mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr are they going to let it go there thank you so much Byron York with us sanctions on Washington Examiner eight

Amy\nHi how are you you're wonderful daughter Kiley is now joined our team here on the Sean Hannity show the G give you the back number or did you call in and actually get it wrong [laughter]\n[laughter] oh Sean I Hope you all can handle or she's a little firecracker and thanks for taking care of her at their\nAge you're doing right we love and and I was wondering\nI appreciate you and all you you do and the teams that Sean I have to tell you something I never in my life it's that that it'd be on the same page with Lindsey Graham and inviting had to one of our of that and actually we've done that this week and he's ... he just I mean he ... out is all last week that he not\nWell I think ... ... you know and that's another thing well he doesn't have the temperament now if you if you're accused of gang rape and accused of sexual assault and you're innocent\nHow was the what is the proper way to act was he supposed to be monotone uh guys I didn't do this or just not true I mean because as his wife is crying behind him as his daughter is saying to him pray for this woman and it ... a bright innocent\nAnd the half the country and these people they don't care they don't care who they destroy in the process of accumulating power\nAnd honestly it doesn't matter what he would have done it wasn't going to be the right thing and I and I believe it that didn't even have to be Kavanaugh could have been anybody this is much bigger it's about than stopping the Supreme Court\nConfirmation that's what it's all about they're willing to do anything to stop it and these liberal when at least he kept wearing liberal women out there thinking like they speak for all women\nThey don't they absolutely do not end when the press in the media and the the leftist obsessed about women this um this cycle we're just not going to sit back and take it we are the ones for sixty six Nineteen sixties women have the deciding vote\nWomen were the ones that don't like the Donald Trump's women are the ones that are going to decide what happens in the Senate turns and we're going to be the ones that decide what happened and twenty twenty and conservative women are kind of that\nTogether and we're back on all of this and say they don't speak for us and we stand with Brett Kavanaugh I mean we're not going to get back down and let and let them win this absolutely no way\nWell it's going to be up to three senators probably Jeff Flake snowflake and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski and then it's gonna be whether or not the whether or not I'd look the Senate's going to hold a vote and I think Lindsey Graham has a point\nUm we haven't really heard from Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski on the issue what is it ... the the convinces them is not qualified for the job\nAnd then it's going to be whether or not the whether or not I loved the Senate's going to hold a vote and I think Lindsey Graham has a point\nUm we haven't really heard from Susan Collins Lisa Murkowski on the issue\nWhat is it your lovely the that convinces them is not qualified for the job you know the guy admits that he drank he liked to drink he drinks fears that likes to drink beer sometimes drink more beer then he should've drink\nAnd then people saying but he must have blacked out we know we did he's a liar he's a perjure right and now they want to investigate in the eye throwing incident at some game you know back thirty five years ago this is how absurd this has gotten\nWell I Can't tell you what I was doing thirty six years ago but I could tell you what we're doing it to days and that is we're having a when the ... our first ever conference here in Washington DC it's women for America first heels on clots off\nAnd women from across the country are coming together and we're going to spend three or four days together and talk about why we love this country and we're going to be bold and are supported the president and Brett Kavanaugh and on Thursday we're taking a little trip to the U.S Capitol while the others are camped out at their most\nConservatives are working but we're going to take a truck and visit some of the senators and let them do how we feel about it and encourage them to vote\nOn his support to confer Brett Kavanaugh we need to do this and I'm hoping that Mitch McConnell brings ... on Thursday it we're having our first event Thursday night and it would be great to be able to celebrate the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh um women for Trump at our conference\nWell I Want to see what happens we'll know a lot more by the end of the week we may even no I'm I'm hearing rumors that the FBI may be very close to finishing their report\nAnd when that happens maybe it'll happen for tonight when that gets an ounce will senators will get to read it and then the cloture vote will be called and we'll have an up or down vote and we'll see where people come down on this shouldn't be that difficult to read the FBI doesn't reach conclusions\nThey don't make recommendations they just say interviewed person a B C D E F G and but in every case there's no corroboration in every single case they will taste is inconsistencies and every single case is very problematic\nAnd all I'm saying is is if this is successful we will never ever get good people ever in this country who would like to want to do anything\nPublicly why should they\nSean I completely agree it's a political ... job and we need to stand up and make sure Republicans\nDo the right thing and confirmed hands so glad to see Lindsey Graham\nStaying with the ... with the president and fight back for a change instead of playing on the terms that the Democrats that so um I Hope that they keep up this fight and confirm Kavanaugh weekend anybody that's out there that wants to join us this weekend we'd love to have them and that just keep up the fight\nRight thank you so much Amy for being with us we are very proud of highly is now part of the Sean Hannity show\nAnd she's the one that's answering everybody's calls and she's doing a great job and we appreciate her on the team as we do you that's or busy telephones are Kathy is in Virginia Beach Virginia how are you Kathy glad you call\nSean ... nice to talk to him [noise] what's going on okay I'm very upset with this is going on the way the Democratic party it's been cheating this judge I'm\nI feel sorry for the men men children son's father that we have the fear that a woman is going to be paid five could come out and say\nOh I was molested okay if the woman was my heart goes out but it was not by judge Kavanaugh I feel that I Know that\nThe Democrat and that story in the system\nI Will tell you that we see it every two and four years systematically it's now we come to expect that they want to smear slander destroy character assassinate\nAnd now they do it for anybody anything everybody is fair game doesn't matter how young your children are does it matter what your that your wife is crying behind you does it matter that there's no evidence nothing matters a Pam is in Hampton, Virginia Pam how are you\n... thank you for taking my call and I have three quick points and I'll make a

we're the parents are the owner of the house or the houses I mean somebody had something I just can't leave the kids were just ... and\nIt it has gotten listen it's very very hard to believe this part of it to me\nThat again in the case of Julie's sweating it goes down all over the place with her story\nAnd well he was near the punch bowl so I don't know he gave girls red solo cups that is not drug ... that was the original al ... girls and gang train raping girls\nWhile he was in the hallway but I don't know if it was him he was there but I don't know it was near the punch bowl whatever you call the bowl this is so serious you don't make allegations that somebody is a gang rapist and that what goes on almost every weekend\nYou know and she went to ten of those parties and that she was aware of but she didn't realize that the time why the boys were lined up in the halls waiting their turn to gang rape the girls that they have drugged this is what Democrats won investigated\nAnd she gave an interview\nAnd in the interview she gave multiple statements that were inconsistent with a statement she put out\nLast week and was backtracking from her original state but probably because
