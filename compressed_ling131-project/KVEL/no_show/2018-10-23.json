some\nAudio from night storm what a great story [laughter] [noise] it's amazing I had a question I Believe we have the technology or for financial institutions to prevent personal funds from being transferred to the United states to Mexico Honduras\nGuatemala and I'm Wondering if that doesn't make sense of the logical or at least a part of a logical answer to the immigration problem we're happy\nTo stop the remittances from here to Mexico\nMexico Honduras Guatemala\nI I Would imagine we do have a technology to do it the question is whether or not or it would be effective are these people are already here\nAre and the question is what do we do to prevent more illegal alien from coming here and that's what the president's trying to do or if he were to somehow try to stop remittances or and or remittances that his money coming from people in this country to Mexico\nBecause I Believe they're a second uh largest source of income after oil\nUm I don't know it seems to me that doing that would also exacerbate the problem in in Mexico I hear people say that\nIf President Trump for example withdraws the aid from Honduras Guatemala it'll simply make the conditions there even worse or and or would create even more so called migrants it seems to me the argument against a Mexico his at Mexico's economy under developed\nAnd needs to be developed and you stop the remittances if even if you could do it legally\nI'm not sure how that would create conditions that would make it better for Mexicans to stay in Mexico as opposed to coming up here illegally but thanks for the idea of you know look into it Thai is in San Antonio Texas tiger malarial to show\nThat I Love your show man thank you so much thank you\nUm so yeah that that that's all you got on a fantastic on that as a conservative\nOr for now a long long time one of the things I've understood is that the Democratic party has had an absolute spring will hold on the black community now and the mind that uh for about six years and they had no intention of ... what is going to take the black community in general like him to get out of their cells\nAnd so\nBut but to my point you you had a caller asked you how many legal immigrants are accepted into this country and um\nAnd I happen to know living in San Antonio I'm married to a Hispanic woman her family is from Mexico\nWe as a country per year except about one million legal immigrants of which about six hundred thousand\nOr residency changes I don't know maybe they have dual citizenship and they're moving to America I'm not sure what the situation it but that leaves you with about four hundred thousand so that boils down to almost eleven hundred per day okay legal citizens that we are accepting into this country and at this point in our\nHistory we have the most legal immigrants that we have ever had and that's thirty seven thirty seven now if you if you estimate on population a\nMillion and do that math\nThat closed up ... percent of our population ... illegal immigrants mhm so you know to make the argument and this is through not only democratic uh you know president for Republican and then is raisins and and this has been going on for a long long time\nUm but you know I wanted to ask you you mentioned earlier on your show that Mexico has that when the policy for ... body who entered the country illegally\nThat's right my my bigger question here my bigger question is if Mexico is and from what I hear they have a blockbuster and the willingness to help you you say that they're they're pretty much just escorting them and kind of\nYou know um how you protect them or whatever they're doing and how is it that these people are not rounded up by the federal rally immediately or at least\nNo not always democratic you know president here for a Republican administration ... thing going on for a long long time um but\nYou know I was as you mentioned earlier on your show that Mexico has that when you call it bother you entered the country illegally\nThat's right my my bigger question my bigger question is if Mexico\nAnd from what I hear they watch and be willing to help you just leave it there are pretty much just a quarter numbers harder you know I'm ... I Am or whatever they're doing and how would these people are not rounded up by the media or at least\n[laughter] ... you very much for the call a whole bunch of people are beginning to rethink\nThe relationship with the Democratic party now this is an issue\nYou hear about more than any other one that's getting pocketbooks all American families heart and that's the outrageous cost of prescription drugs in a recent poll conducted by Frank loves you got an earful words like greed gouging unfair kept coming up\nAnd there were lots of questions why does it cost of drugs keep sky rocketing why do people in Canada pay forty percent less for their medications and we do why does the whole system feel rigged\nThere's an answer the big drug makers spend a great deal of money loving to protect their profits over one hundred and Seventy one million dollars to be exact but there is a bigger lobby in America or politicians must answer to\nWe the people\nAnd we want solutions to prescription drug affordability we want some now it's time the whole drug makers accountable and put patients ahead of profits they have their lobbyists and hundreds of millions of dollars we have our voices are stories in our votes as time went to ... to ... patients ahead of profit enough is\nEnough to go back to Minneapolis Mars or San Francisco for all intents\nFire your stockbroker and hire yourself\nI'm Scott power and I've been to professional traders for over twenty five years\nI've treated for Goldman Sachs and it was the first Amazon market maker at the Chicago Board options exchange I'm also the c._e._o. here it prosper training academy the leading educational from teaching people how to trade the markets for\nA limited time I'm giving away one of my favorite secret training techniques used by thousands of our students every day to help build their financial future to learn this technique right now call my twenty four seven voicemail and just leave your email address I'll email you might free trading technique right away just call one eight hundred to two weeks two one five five\nThis is a very information my students use every day\nTo invested in their financial future again call one eight hundred to two eight two one\nFive five in the next thirty minutes and leave your email address on my voicemail that's one eight hundred to two a two one five five call one eight hundred to two eight two one five fight\nWith the U.S embassy now open in Jerusalem the world is witnessing the fulfillment of God's covenant with his chosen people what does this mean for Christians around the world watching these events unfold\nIn his new book earth last empire best selling author and privacy expert pastor John Haiti unpacked thousands of years of history at the local prophecy to answer your most pressing questions about the end times get earth's last empire\nNow on line and wherever you buy books\nEmail phishing attacks cost business ... billion annually in real cash data law and brand damage fishing emails are hard to get attacked because the messages appear to be legitimate to unsuspecting employees\nIntroducing barracuda fish lined a groundbreaking cloud based solution designed to help employees recognized sophisticated email phishing attack through interacted training reinforced by continue with the new age and transform your employees from the liability into a line of defense\nDue to barracuda dot com slash pm to learn more\nRunning a little short on cash red rock on it for ...

needs they handle auto commercial home recreational and your life insurance me seven eight nine zero zero zero one when you think insurance\nFor Meyer ensuring\nThat we\nCan give you a mind even make you know when you read these people for your marriage\nCourse they'll be there for you would if you're a real cars up there for the family over an operator metaphors wherever you back in order for it all the money on\nReally fast so\n[noise] [noise]\nTwenty two minutes after the hours we continue by brand sitting in for Hugh Hewitt this morning and the pain free really factor dot com studios are being fourteen twenty the answer\nIn beautiful Cleveland, Ohio Peter cursing our is with us Peter as a member of the United states commission on civil rights and we're talking about the migrant caravan though a gallery of it all the politics of it all and now the security of it all Peter\nThe president said in an interview on air force one yesterday there is no limit to the number of troops he's willing to send to the border to stop this caravan he repeated that last night it has been in Houston for Ted Cruz he has the plant a re power\nTo deny anybody admission to the United states as long as he deems it in the interest of the United states this is granted him by the uh immigration and nationality act in Nineteen fifty to\nThe question is how far do you think he is willing to go and how far should he be willing to go in order to literally physically militarized that border with troops with tanks with jeeps with whatever's in order to stop these migrants from getting to the ... century where they can dust then make their asylum claims\n[noise] well I think he's willing to go as far as he can go under the law you know that's no doubt about shoes motivation and use determination to do that as opposed to slow the president's\nHowever there is a you know he is ... conflict homes of the law yeah and it has been completely educated as far as how far can go we've got some historical perspective as to how far we can go\nBut although he's got the white I think he's just going to get it and we discuss the snow asked\nTo do my classes of aliens entry into the United states and it's sort of political like the means by which he does that subject to dispute because he is constrained in terms of the use of the little tree domestically or the policy kind of taught us act\nNow looks like substance to that has them fully litigated as to the extent of the president's power in terms of using um a truce\nNo doubt about shoes organization and used determination to do that as opposed to some other presidents\nHowever are there is a you know a certain conflict in terms of the law yeah and it hasn't been completely educated as far as how far can go we've got some historical perspective as far as we can go\nBut although he's got the right I think he was just going to get it and you discuss this ... asked\nTo do my classes of aliens entry into the United states and it sort of political right the means by which he does that is subject to dispute because he is constrained in terms of the use of the military domestically public policy kind of taught us act\nNow works exceptions to that has all of them are fully litigated as to the extent of the president's power in terms of using um a troops to do that\nWith the president can do for example is he can stay tuned to you I'm a deploy the national guard ... that are allies the national guard troops but if you ... them again he comes up against us he kind of us know what they can do\nIs engaging non law enforcement and that is that as a deterrent but they can't easily equipment or your goals they can't stop and frisk individual\nWrecked as law enforcement or you know a law enforcement yesterday but there are at least some would maintain there are exceptions to that and that the president might have the ability\nTo have a two two quest that the national guard retain their state status and then there are there any potentially use them in active use if uh it's deemed necessary to do so but there's there was real gray area in terms of law now\nSetting that aside is whether or not affected me by which we can use that are lies National Guard or army troops or even state National Guard troops to engage in the kind of interdiction activity\nThe presence of the army there or or a troops there\nActs as a truck and as a back to back stuff now you may recall that earlier in the year the president said that he was going to send down there and support\nAnd to do logistical assistance to free up the border patrol in others to engage in order\nTo these and I think that uh you know look he's got plenty resorted to do that that is without question uh there was a real question as to whether or not you know some would say well the this so called ... and that's coming in who knows how large by the time it reaches order is not really an invading force per se\nOr it doesn't have weapons but at what\nPoint does become a threat to national security\nYou know many of us would argue it's already a threat to national security looks at several thousand that are a threat to national security it's Fifteen thousand what about if it rises level what we saw in Europe where it's Kansas thousands maybe a hundred thousand\nIf it's on the way it it's on the way by the way new Mexican news agencies now say that caravan is at fourteen thousand and it only started a short while ago went from two thousand uh fourteen thousand by the time it gets here you know several days from now because there's still a thousand miles away the work that we are going to be in the tens of thousands\nRight and do they have to be carrying weapons in order to be considered invading force official to which could uh uh justify the use of troops I don't know there's a lot of gray area there but I think\nThat the first instance for the United states as a commander in chief needs to do what's necessary to secure the for\nThe border that may not include Egypt and law enforcement [noise] but at the ... on the border is important\nAnd that it is indeed that Peter thank you so much Peter personnel us commission on civil rights for joining us twenty seven minutes after the hour by friends sitting in for here he went right back after the portions of the Hugh Hewitt show or march you buy

six for this is a huge huge show\nRJ we hear this all the time that we're ...\nEvery asylum applicant is detained not released into the interior of the country where they didn't disappear go work and that's exactly what they want it\nRJ we hear this all the time that we're loopholes or ... is our guest he's the director of government relations for fair the federation for American immigration reform defined the loopholes that you want our Congress to come back from the campaign trail and come back and vote to close right now\nYeah for example we have our our credible fear standard what these people do is I think everybody can agree\nThat that these migrants coming up they're not refugees they're not as ... their economic migrants listen if they're saying they're fleeing some violence in Honduras Guatemala or El Salvador and they cross into Mexico I think everybody can agree that Mexico is a safer environment than where they're coming from\nSo you're automatically not a refugee anymore but what happens is when you come to our border\nYou come to a port of entry again this is why a border wall and itself cannot solve everything because you just they these people just go to a port of entry and they claim credible fear they say I have credible fear of returning to my homeland and that's the initial basis for an asylum claim\nAnd and we we approve those credible fear claims and math so when they say I claim credible fear then they get an appointment before an immigration judge\nTo women and their ... or ... let me interrupt for a second to clarify something\nIt's it's my understanding that credible fear has to be on the grounds of one of five protected grounds in central race religion nationality political opinion or particular social group\nNone of these people I mean ... they're all on doors so where you can't be rising nationality or their religion I I I unless they're claiming their Muslim and they're they're being discriminated against in a largely Christian population which I don't know that they are political opinion or public particular social group they don't have any book where you're writing on those grounds\nYou're right Bob but you remember just look how organized this caravan is these people are coached their coach they know exactly what to say when they get there\nTo fall under that credible fear determination and a lot of the times works you know these people are getting approved in large numbers they were approved and a lot larger numbers and the Obama administration but they still are and that's just the initial German determination\nSo they come in they get released into the interior of the country or asylum backlog is massive it's a I think it's around five hundred thousand\nSometimes it can take years for their claimed to be heard so they get released into the country in some cases they even get work permits employment authorization documents\nSo that's what they want they know that can happen and a lotta times again they just disappear so Congress needs to tighten our credible fear standards and again with these family units in ... in our law right now\nUm Mexicans are the only people that can be promptly deported\nAgain Central Americans can't be promptly repatriated at the TV PR a loophole it's called or you can get let's an asylum system is is riddled with loopholes I mean those are the main pull factors for people to come here and as long as Congress just just sits on their hands it doesn't do anything these caravans will still\nCome and keep happening and again President Trump's talking about the border wall securing funding in December but a border wall will not do much good overall with this current crisis we have unless those loopholes are also close\nOr ... helped me out help me understand this it was reported yesterday that are on Fox that the Mexican government has offered asylum to these people\nUm if that is the case we don't have to repatriate them back to Honduras or Guatemala El Salvador we can repeat your patriot them back to Mexico there are no longer in fear of persecution from their governments if we're not sending back then back to their governments were sending them to the country that well actually we're just saying\nStay in the country or in right now you have been granted am not asylum at amnesty by the Mexican government\nTherefore your claim of persecution about a hundred or a government holds no water\nYeah I'm I'm I'm that we're not clear how it's exactly working out with with the Mexicans are doing and one in one instance I saw it as well that when they reached a certain area in Mexico Mexican authorities were right they're offering them an opportunity to claim asylum and then the caravan blue right past them\nAgain so it it it's unclear kind of how that would be treated when they do get here but again as you mentioned\nYes these people are no the fact that they entered in a safe third country they entered into Mexico shows that they are no longer fleeing violence is that are not willing to stay right where they are in it what we can all agree as a markedly safer situation\nSo if that's the case then I mean how how do you why do we have\nTo then go on through the process of allowing them into the United states or is that what you're calling for you know our job when you're talking about let's bring everybody back in the campaign trail and vote on this than we do if language does not exist in our laws they maybe that's why we need a ride in that if you know have been granted\nIf you've been granted amnesty or asylum by a third party country year than your claim of asylum in the United states is no longer about\nRight now that's called a safe third country agreement again too and that ...\nThat is something that needs to be that done with Mexico and it's something that but again those people have to be interacting with the Mexican authorities NAFTA actually interact with them rather than blowing pass them and just continue on to our border\nI mean they have to they have to enter right process if you will but again this is just something that Congress needs to rectify and I know President Trump is working his tail off on this issue and and and he wants to stop this caravan but again in some in some areas the administration's hands are tied\nAgain you see it with the travel ban it anything this administration does on immigration\nEnding DACA other things like that\nThey get into these open borders groups forum shop they go find an activist judge who who doesn't who doesn't care about our sovereignty\nAnd then they get their ruling that they want the administration can't can't ... can't act on on our national security it simply ridiculous that's why Congress needs to act and if Democrats want to obstruct than they should do that in front of the American people and let them decide\nAre you familiar with the Merida Initiative and if so what what what good does it do to have this uh but not familiar with that I\nKnow it's it's it's also called plan Mexico a it's a security cooperation between the U.S Mexico and the countries of Central America
