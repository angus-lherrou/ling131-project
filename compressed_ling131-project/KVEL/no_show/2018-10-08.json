C. but it would be imprudent politically for the president\nTo fire him he has no intention of doing so\nYou know must receive mothers report and I think the president wants to see how that will play out and I think it's beginning to wind down many of the people on Miller's staff of already left in return\nTheir jobs at the department of justice so I think that is reaching a conclusion I agree with John no collusion\nNo structure and a and then let's launch a serious investigation with a grand jury and the people at the department of justice and the FBI\nWho engaged in this what I Believe to be an illicit illegal scheme to frame Donald Trump\nWill take a a break here but we got to say goodbye to Greg Jared John Sayles thank you both for being with us eight hundred Ninety One Sean ... Republican number\nDerek John Sayles thank you both for being with us eight hundred Ninety One Sean poll very mobile number\nThey say please don't say impeachment anymore I say impeachment\n[noise]\nIf it turns out that he just become justice Kavanaugh and your chairman of the house Judiciary Committee would you investigated for possible impeachment if he is on the Supreme Court and the Senate has investigated than ice in the house will have to do investigate we would have to investigate\nAll right joining us now is the man himself has got a brand new book out say I love the title and I liked the content even more why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies Dr Sebastian Gorka is with us or how are you my ... this book is a must read for everybody and ah how are you going to say I'm\nVery excited show and thanks for having me or I didn't think uh this title would be as appropriate as it is all through low Seventy two hours but my we are in a fight right now for the future of the republic\nIt is a fight for the future of the republic the one thing I Love about you and I've come to know you very well is that your patriots\nAnd you understand evil in our time evil abroad the need to defend and keep America strong and you understand the political aspects of it as well because if you elect their own people and we're going to have policies of appeasement again in that renders us more vulnerable\nJust looked at the last eight years what do we have we had a commander in chief who started his presidency with an apology tour and then he blamed all the bad things in the world on America what resulted the rise of ISIS Russia invading its ... Chinese Chinese re militarization\nOf the end of the Obama administration just one metric take take politics out of it for a second\nWe had sixty five million refugees in the world that's more than we had at the end of World War two when you don't have American leadership the world is the most dangerous place now that ... thanks to Donald Trump now we have a commander in chief who believes that evil exist read his ... speech\nListen to what he says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing what he\nSaid at the un line yes absolutely absolutely so that's why I wrote why we fight but but you're absolutely correct we have domestic issues here he will exist not just outside of our borders look what they did so that godly man Brett Kavanaugh in the last four days a man who had\nThe probably the cleanest most spotless record in an American public life goes from being\nA stand up stabbing federal judge to amass rapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next ... days are so important showing\nIt means ah everything and then look everything's riding on this\nI don't know if you would have asked me three weeks ago I Would have leaned in on the side that history would would win out because the party that wins the White House\nUsually ends up losing seats in a midterm election they totally not happened three times only vote picked up seats three times in the last hundred years the last was after two thousand and one of the attack on number eleven September eleventh\nUm but there's so much at stake here and that is what would literally jumps off the pages I'm reading through your book that we better defeat America's enemies and we'd better do without apologies\nTactic orca we don't get to do that if we're not in power right\nWe we have to take very seriously this concept of the left so the left has been taken over by the radicals think about the fight but JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist stronger national security you wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have we have the crazies we have the cost of your Cortez\nIs we have the Maxine Waters and control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply\nThe ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool\nWell guess who use that philosophy in the past about philosophy drives to the labor camps to drive to the ... and Dr death camps whether you are right wing extremist whether you're ... whether you're a communist that's the philosophy and we've got to stop that shall we have to stay true to the principles of the republic\nYou talk it in a book about the a will to winter and then again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can't have any more and you talk about the will to when you talk about will\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized it is and we pulled out you know in Iraq\nAnd Afghanistan we pull out leaving it dates of our withdrawal and we lost nearly six thousand kids in the end so many others comeback without their arms and legs in their in their faces\nJust figured fighting for their country we cannot commit American troops ever again unless we're willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you have to win these wars\nOr else don't start to be involved in the\nIt's not commit American troops ever again unless we're willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to you have to win these wars or else don't start them to be involved in the\n... so my book is about two things about all the threats we face of the countries or whether it's ISIS Russia or China\nBut the second part is much more important is is the one who hitting on it do we have the will to defeat our enemies because Vietnam is a great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with wooden sticks and Ross the rifles defeat us\nHow that's possible because we lost the war at home because we allowed the left to undermine a will to win\nAnd and what are the most important things is the individual rule to win in addition to the the ... of the threats I have full of in yet so the American heroes I go back to the Bobby was two hundred years ago I took her by the Korean hero a trustee pulled her talking about a man who spent six and a half years as a naval aviator in the Hanoi Hilton\nBut the last story is very very important for what we are seeing right now and it's wicked chambers\nMost kids have no idea where to contain but this this is a man who was cabin old before Kavanaugh was born in Nineteen forty eight the\nFirst live televised Senate hearing was a medical would it could chambers who have been a communist age of of the Soviets\nWho went on record saying hey I'm no longer communist but I Need America to know whether the communist off of the governments including algae his he was a guy who was working for the Soviets what happened to this man who stood up for the truth\nBut you choose him of everything cheating on his wife ... of the death of being responsible for the death of his brother none of it was true but what did he do you have the will to fight he stood up for the truth justice justice Kavanaugh will have the social and his his his his a scary thing\nThe Democrats have done this before they'll be surprised at what they do have to Capitol they've done it several years ago\nI they have done it every election in my lifetime they play the race card the jet rye or you know they divided America old versus young rich versus poor black versus white this is the identity politics which which they have mastered and I keep playing them in their own words it's not like I'm

get you the indictment if you if you have time to look it over it's pretty it's pretty\nIn depth it damning and you're right you know understand another thing is that not one of these people the

I'm confused there was a kid who was the last conservative president you tell you I I don't remember\nOne of those George Bush republic oil ...\nListen I ... I I appreciate your opening and I promise I'll give you the chance to respond by trying to be a jerk but\nI don't know if it's that you're a liberal and you don't or you aren't really reading on conservatism I Love George W. Bush I worked for the man I Would have literally given my life for him I was a secret service said I'm not being hyperbolic I mean if that was my job he was a good and decent human being\nGeorge W. Bush was not exactly a conservative president okay the spending levels of the government spending was out of control we had Medicare part D I liked George W. Bush there were some great things that happened the tax cuts package but I think\nInsisting he was a conservative president is a little bit of a stretch so let let me just stop you right he was more of a moderate Republican establishment type I think that's more fair analysis that's like saying that's like me coming out and saying to you\nHey bronco bomber was a moderate he wasn't he wasn't moderate on any issue at all and I think you know that um so so go back to your point your point is that the economy went south under George W Bush because of conservatism now\nLet me ask you a question if you don't mind\nWhat sort of ideal whether it be limited government limited government spending limited government intervention the economy caused that recession\nOne word deregulation\nAh how how exactly do you figure that when deregulation or the repeal of Glass Steagall happened under Bill Clinton\n\nThe bank where all deregulated well you're you're actually right 'cause I I I'm\nI Know I'm right but but the reason I'm right to focus number one the deregulation you're mentioning happened under Bill Clinton number one and number two uh\nTell me the commercial banks that went under because liberals site this talking point often they said was deregulation and it was the splitting of investment banks from commercial banks so I always say to them okay well explained to me what commercial banks one under as a result of over central ...\nNobody here will now all the problems with the stock market and the mortgage industry and\nAllowing call no no I I we can't get past the first me and you have a back and forth you can't just by pass uncomfortable question\nYou said that it was a conservative president that had the last recession I disputed that it was a Republican president now what I'm trying to suggest you as the recession was not caused by what you said it was caused by and I'd like you to acknowledge that the deregulation happened under Clinton that's just the fact\nThat for the last now in the coffee or right was under Bill Clinton and it had happened for many years before that because what happens is when you have regulations right what happens is the the ensuing administrations left and right who were bought and paid for by special interests over the decades years in\nDebt yeah but but the corals your point you're making isn't even true I'm asking you if the deregulation\nThat commercial bank they the the skin of some of the commercial and the majority of the commercial in the investment banks was the cause of the recession then what commercial banks there should be some evidence that a number of commercial banks went under the answer is you you can't answer because there there there there's no answer to it\nSo I listen I Can't go on to all day because it's it's a wonky topic for the audience did that I'm just trying to make the point I appreciate your call though don't hang of it I I think you're a reasonable guy\nI just wish that whereas I can criticize some of the the policies by George W. Bush I thought were wrong\nI Wish you'd open your eyes to you can't just throw out something like oh deregulation that Bush was terrible and then not follow up at all and presenting the facts and data that's totally irresponsible that's not what happens\nIf you see what what happened is under Bush right at the very end of the eight year in power this is when everything fell apart just prior to Obama being elected alright\nCar listen I gotta run we're up against the break I'm Sorry but listen thanks for the call but sorry folks that's not what happened I could go on about this all day we we lost because we had we had a cheap money problem\nWe had a bunch of G s e government sponsored enterprises in Fannie and Freddie that incentivize people to buy homes they simply could not afford that it was the genesis of the housing crisis that ripple through the economy\nMaturity mismatch is it was it's a very simple problem to observe looking at it in retrospect and claiming it was a massive deregulatory effort that happened other Clinton therefore the Republicans caused a recession I'm Sorry\nIs just completely utterly absurd All right I'm thinking about you know went from work within I

comes out what busted knocked on doors it had commercials on TV I'm afraid that they're not do that\nWell Jim at ... but I don't I don't know about is why it's been so I'm going to take a pass on that

a conservative I Am a registered Republican but I'm a conservative and when the G O P abandons our principles it is you are absolutely right it is time for us to go get out there and get our act of

calf politicians I don't give a damn if you put an R in front of your name you don't vote our way in a primary you never get my vote again and this story period full stuff I'm with your brother\nThat I'm just telling you that we live in a world of fallible human beings I'm not your preacher nothing like I'm just saying we're all sinners\nThe GOP as screwed up mentally on government spending they cannot get their heads out of their collective bought and cut spending I don't get it we're walking into bankruptcy but\nGiven a binary choice right now and that's what it is listen I Love it I I'm really I'm a libertarian in my soul and I love the party and I love that they fight but right now it is a binary choice and you're a binary choice is real\nYour binary choice is this a party of police state tyrants right now what Palmdale I'm Talking about the hill Democrats I'm not talking about the rank and file voters out there I'm Talking about the hill Democrats you're talking about a bunch of police state tyrants\nWho did this Spygate disaster who spied on the president who tried to take down cabinet are trying to take your money take your business take your health care take your kids' education your choice right now is between that\nAnd Republicans who\nMay be sixty percent of the time with you that choice to me is an obvious one but having said that you find a good independent or libertarian out there who we think can win\nHey man let's get behind them let's keep these people honest in a primary I have I broke entire pieces about this who knows maybe there will be part time

that make sense and that's why it is so important for us to go out there\nAnd vote we cannot the other option is terrible it's like someone said they gave us a man I'm you're going to die in a heart attack of eighty years I'm going to cut your head off with a chainsaw right now you're going to die either way so what do you think the answer is obvious\nThat Democrats are terrible they are awful they did after what they pulled in Spygate and on cabin on the answer here is obvious\nMy highest re with you there and you don't have to sell it to me you don't have to sell it to me one hundred percent I'm going to\nBe out there anybody I speak to I'm going to be out out there with the ten minutes and then you stay on your heart cast the problem is I don't think the G L E it's going to be out there to try and get the independent vote and turn some of the Democrat\nNo one more thing do gyms I got to take a break the ten ten ten folks who is you don't know what I mean\nEmail tend to your friends all tend to your friends Facebooking and tweet to tell your friends and make sure they get the heck out there and they vote that's that's your job you have to go out and do that but Jim just remember that the more Republicans we can get elected\nAgain I Know they're not the answer to all our problems but I Know our problem is the Democrats right\nIf the more we get elected we can afford to lose a few rhinos and still hold the conservative majority of the problem with this slim lead we have now in the Senate is we have to collectively kiss kiss the parts of unreliable people\nAnd we can't do that in the Senate we have to be able to let a few rhinos\nGo and still hold on to a concert at great cost ... unfortunately going to take a break\n'em run up against odd but folks as important as a pivotal let you get out and vote bring ten friends again it's not always a choice between good and bad sometimes it's a choice between ... and really bad and this is one of those times
