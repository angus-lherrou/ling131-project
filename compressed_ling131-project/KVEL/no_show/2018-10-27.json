quality of life in advance our economy protect you know our citizens\nPublic safety I been endorsed by the police benevolent association but I've also been endorsed by and supported by the federal employees pack as well as every business group involved so I brought together a diverse coalition\nWhat what kind of groups of back your opponent\n[noise] um well the uh the metro union group that is running an attack out I keep\nThreatening to shut down the um the metro in the Washington DC area and violate and violate the law and they're attacking\nMe for not raising taxes so my opponent attacks me and then people like this was this is a union that was so dysfunctional that the Obama administration supported suited and that's who's supporting her and and other union groups but she hasn't gotten\nYou know any business endorsements she wouldn't even sit down interview with the police benevolent association and this is someone she put her own staff\nInto fake party city costumes\nAs police in or out to imply that she had the support of the police when in fact the police have endorsed and supported me because of my record on\nPublic safety on let me ask you for ... let me ask you this before on at a time roads it's a big deal in northern Virginia on there's a lot of road construction going on and that's even before the president pushes through an infrastructure program but she's a heavy duty tax or on the toll road is she\nWas she was ... that that those forty six dollar told you see when you're ... you're going to Washington she was for them before she was against them and you know she was on the committee that you know that they put through that but more importantly is she saying she was against them yet Terry McAuliffe who put that into place\nHow she was ineffective and persuading him now you look at something where I Know we might disagree on this but I really advocated for the I'm a pay raise for our federal employees and the president and you know the administration initially it was going to do a pay freeze and I went to them politely made my case and talked about why it was\nAnd the caller who put that into place how she was ineffective and persuading him now you look at something where I Know we might disagree on this but I really advocated for the I'm a pay raise for our federal employees and the president\nAnd you know the administration is late with going to do a pay for you and I went to them politely made my case and talked about why it was important that the people who you know at the FBI the CIA other the other day got their pay raises so they can do the good work they did and\nYou know arresting a character that day today and so um I work politely with the administration on that she was ineffective and getting Terry McAuliffe to do anything um and then get rid of that forty six dollar calls and so we need somebody who defected who can work with\nYou know a Republican administration or a Democrat I'm demonstrated that and and I've always been\nSomeone advocating lower taxes [laughter] theory\nAnd public safety which is why I'm thrilled to have the support of our police and\nI think well you are in a tough district some marginal districts\nIn what they're hoping of course is that they can scare the hell out of everybody in northern Virginia a particularly the federal workers and others and the teachers are the usual unions and so forth to turn those people out and what they've done and the Democrat Party is they have selected\nThe most extreme radical Nancy Pelosi like candidate they possibly could and they're hoping to turn the entire area blue so it's crucially important\nLet me speak to live in I sat there many conservatives out there as well I don't know it is crucially

don't know what I felt the FBI Director disappeared and he was on the FBI's ten most wanted list you know never hear from him and his like he doesn't exist I've not been happy with his lack of enthusiasm and taking actions against those who who's department who abuse their authority and they clearly did\nAnd speaking of unhappy with leadership I see where attorney general sessions if you're watching today he made a statement showing some leadership in one of his last\nMy opinion likely high profile lax\nBefore his dismissed I I think the only reason he's not being dismissed by the

show\nMore guys are filling in for Larry Elder of the pain free will effect or dot com studios and as I said we're taking your calls at eight eighty nine seven one saying what you call in about\nYour reaction to everybody in the media seems that way to meet somebody on the left trying to blame President Trump for what this is crazy guy did as if this guy did it because of what President\nTrump says because of course everything that goes wrong is President Trump's falls and everything goes right like our economy is because of President Obama and if you didn't know that just that ... he he mentions it all the time all credit calling me that's because of what I started okay\nWhich by the way explains why they were so against now justice Kevin Oh you wouldn't have mattered if the president had nominated left this like the pope\nWhatever the prisoners for their against remember they were against whoever the nominee was they didn't even know the name it didn't matter they have their son's ready that is their basic platform this November and it doesn't matter if the president has done a great job none of it matters they hate him and they hate him with a passion\nYou know I thought that we reached the are the top with George W. Bush in their hatred not\nThis one is being surpass this bumbling fools could never have beaten their candidate and they will never acknowledge the great things that he has done so these\nActs will not long be about this evil did you notice just like it wasn't long about these Lee Ford that didn't last that wasn't a found her it was about the Democrats regaining power so she she's like an asterisk now that's what she's going to probably be in history\nSo it'll just be always about punishing President Trump and all Republicans because we're evil and they are not you get it\nWhich is even more reason why you have to vote tell me what you think as I said an eight eight eight one eight eight eight nine seven one six age it is also been amazing to see the Democrats in the meeting in action you know the Democrats thing going to use these acts to that part is an advantage\nBut for the media to be so blatant in their advocacy is all new in the age of Trump they haven't been on partial to their views for many years now a lot of us know that that's not a secret\nBut they use to pretend here's the difference that they were not vice no more now does out in the open with their advocacy and you can even see it in their questions what's his name Jim Acosta from CNN hardly hiding his disdain for the president I'm telling you you could see that\nIn his questions they're out to get the president and make no mistake about it and the media has an enormous power to influence the debate in our elections\nAnd the president is right to call them out on this so the president has rightly call that the press for who they are and the press cannot deal with it in their righteous indignation and just today I was watching getting ready for the show\nThere was Shepard Smith on Fox saying that Trump's phrase lock her up and the chance to encourage in that vein and CNN sucks are the kinds of things that AIG that and people like the suspect on so Mary was Trump is responsible for it\nBut those of us on the right lane people with ... bad values were bad acts not those who share their political views\nBut of course that we're on the right blamed Bernie Sanders for his support or remember who shot the seriously injured Congressman Steve skull east and the other congressman he would have wiped the matter if he could what President Trump is responsible no matter what he says he's only tries to unify us he's no good\nCNN is hopeless by the way I I Try to watch what's the other one MSNBC it's it's not easy watching each one I I live in another planet and there's a real argument to be made for not letting Hillary Clinton be above the law yeah CNN is hopeless that's my point and President Trump is right\nAnd a lot of supporters are people who argue with me when I'm done other shows\nThey said how could you say you know because here's my position if Hillary and bill will agree never don't bother us again and leave the scene which is I Know it was impossible it's not going to happen then I might agree not to indict or if I had any power to say that oh you could imagine the calls I got mark how could she be above the law and they had a great point\nThat is not inciting people to write or to physically harm someone that is a legitimate political asked to see what it's asking us to see on the right and for the Democrats and the left and now the media that\nIs unacceptable\nSo they're almost all on the left and we're fortunate to have someone like President Trump call them out\nWe've had so many weeks presidents in the past and it's absolutely\nRefreshing to see someone take it back to them even if the media the left\nThe Democrats can't take President Trump is not responsible for the craziness in our country tell me what you think as I said eight eight eight nine seven ones sage and let's try to get a call or two in Houston, Texas let's go to mark\nMark you're on with mark Hi Mark\nHi Mark a Mark I'm what you were bringing up about a media is absolutely true\nThey don't want to report the fact that the a cycle and here's a psycho prior to the threatened to blow up Florida like our I don't know the other two so what Trump responsible for though no\nHe happens to be just you know the the ... the the course of the ... now and another distinction is the fact that you know Trump literally to not say let's go blow them up right to work you said a few times during his is a a a\nNot his candidacy while he was trying for a couple of times said oh yeah go ahead on the face or something like that that was that but he hasn't done anything like that where the the left whether it's the actual a political or people or the news\nWell the worst time during a\nNod to his candidacy while he was trying for a couple of times he said oh yeah go ahead on something like that where the law whether actual political people are the are they\nGoing out in the Bronx and run 'em out of the stores all this other so again that that part of the country\nYeah like Maxine Waters right get in their face or you ever you see them you know don't let them leave especially if you know they're in the cabinet ... this is\nWhat they do when they do it's OK mark don't you get that\nOh of course it's the the ultimate double standards that everyone recognizes that accept them well do they recognize that they're not saying that even most of the hard core I Would say\nYou know intelligent Democrats because that's the other thing to what they're doing and the people that are acting out these acts of violence most of these are actually borderline psychotic react that way if the Trump terrain or they could argue that that the ... not too and that makes them psychotic\nYeah it ... you know that's what they would say no question about

notion of jobs not mobs or in the whole notion of how the former attorney general say when they're down kick them right oh I think for most Americans that's just way too much yeah and so I Do think in

nationalist with I'm white nationalist white supremacist because you said the word nationalism is is a national TV anchor host\nWell nationalist as racist overtones anti Semitic overtones bigotry show I guess we're now in a place with the left where if you say you believe in America's sovereignty and you believe that America is the greatest nation on earth and you want\nTo make America First as an American you're nothing but a stone cold bigot\nWell that that is the modern left the modern laughs loyalty is to some kind of vague global assume that the president's speech at the United nations was brilliant\nAnd the first really solid defense of America as a patriotic foreign policy since the Nineteen twenties and and he drew the real distinction\nOr do you want an American government that worries about America if you have this which is the smog coming up\nFrom what I Am from from Central America should the U.S government to decide that we want to take care of the entire planet if that means that we bankrupt America we eliminate are free to destroy our prosperity but at least we met that John Lennon standard of all the you know caring about the global\nWhich is what ... what I

represent American policy\nAnd and the Obama administration was I think the first over a global ... administration where we've ever had and their view was that the United states was at the weaker the United states was the better\nYeah but I but I have a theory too and I want to try this this out on you I don't believe Don Lemon\nOr any of these guys on the left it in the media the advocacy media is trying to stop the Trump agenda they don't believe that Americans who believe who who feel the way we feel about\nThe sovereignty of our country I proudly saying you you better believe were national is they don't believe we are racist they don't believe we're big and they they don't they don't believe for anti Semite there's just a way to chill the debate\nNow look they believe they

heard and understood\nAnd parts of it challenged I'm sure but uh I Would like to just pick up on this point so the number one driver of happiness is vocation your one guy that will understand that if that's true in the next ten years we're in deep trouble\n[noise] we're headed toward a really interesting time in human history it's scary and fascinating so somebody some people shorthand for this is the ... the economy I think the simpler way to think about it is just the average duration of people's jobs or their relationship from is going to get shorter than ever before in human history\nSo let's go macro for a minute\nHunter gatherers throughout most of human history\nYou don't have any conception of what your job is you pursue that buffalo\nRight and then ten thousand years ago people settled down and started planting and harvesting and we we enter farm on a on a regular cycle and from ten thousand years ago to a hundred and fifty years ago nobody had job choice they just did with grandma and grandpa mom and dad and aunts and uncles had ever had done forever\nEternity past with the industrial revolution we get jobs specialization and it was really disruptive\nBut when people took a job they still kept it till death of retirement to not everybody graduated high school at the beginning of the industrial revolution by the end almost everybody does\nBut you still get one job but sometime between Fifteen and twenty two years old and you keep it for all of your life I was born in the Nineteen seventies average duration at a farm for a primary breadwinner then it was still twenty six years now it's four years and getting shorter and it's got to get shorter forever more McKenzie a farm I used to work with\nBelieves that fifty percent of the American labor market\nBy three years from now this is not Twenty years in the future\nThree years from now they take fifty percent of the labor market will be primarily freelancers meaning that most people will cobble together a bunch of different jobs not all of them are going to be ap enabled tech jobs like being a new driver with the right software that makes you more efficient than an old school Gabby but\nWhat's really going to happen is we're going to head toward a world where people are going to get disrupted out of their jobs at age forty and forty five and fifty and fifty five\nForever more we've never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the ... of what's often called now the quarter life crisis\nThe sort of late adolescence crisis of trying to figure out your your role in life and how do you go from just being a consumer and mom and dad's house to be in a producer that can not just put bread on the table for your kids but can actually have a sense of meaning that you're serving your neighbor that disruption that most people know in late adolescence working experience that again every three to five years for our whole life\nAnd that means there's a lot of new potential for upheaval and frankly for unhappiness there's going to be more economic output than it's ever been produced before in human history\nBut it's not at all clear that it will redound to the media and family and the median household and the media and worker or going to have to become a civilization of lifelong workers able to get retrained when you're forty nobody's ever done that before\nOkay so there's about an hour of questions uh just on on that one uh but I've got about three minutes left can you give me\nA is your take on the first real political upheaval that we're going to see that I think by twenty twenty it could change everything could start global wars the fakes\nYeah so one of the reasons I wrote them is because I spent a lot of time on intelligence issues and I'm In the intel community there are people who talk about the perfect storm of deep fakes that we have gone back and the storm is these three ingredients number one\nNew technology makes it possible to sort of narrow cast a world with fake audio and fake video where lots of people can be susceptible to being sort of\nUm a spoof or persuaded the things that are real are real\nThere's always been enemies doing malicious actor you know information warfare since the beginning of time you can find it in proverbs ... these are just so discord in an enemies tent but it used to require a prostitute and honey trapping effect business partner in a bribery scheme\nAnd more right you had to get people around people number one is now we can use technology\nSurround somewhat and give them a fake experience and ... are fake audio and fake video that are going to seem really gonna make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constant\nScored in an enemies tent but it used to require a prostitute and the honey trap that affect business partner in a bribery scheme\nAnd more for you to get people around people number one\nIs now we can use technology to surround somewhat and give them a fake experience and ... are fake audio and fake video that are going to seem really gonna make that possible number to Russia is already trying this constantly against us they're just bad at it the real reason we need to take that Russia\nType investigation so seriously as because China's right behind them running scout team offsets I'm On them and ready to do\nBig deep fakes a hybrid war information operations against American leaders and business officials and the public at large and number three we have so many internal divisions about geography about race about gender about guns\nThere's many many issues where Americans are so divided\nThat we are susceptible to these kind of campaigns like Russia is already tried to run on social media they're just not very good at it where they\nTry to exacerbate and inflame tensions on every side of every issue the NFL kneeling controversy majority of the stuff on light on social media in the first Seventy two hours after that flamed last fall the majority of it on both\nSides stance at the anthem and taking the NFL most of it was Russia on both sides and so we're going to have a world where you're going to have things like the Kavanaugh hearings were all of a sudden the audio will appear of Schumer's strategizing with Michael ...\nOr video will appear it'll be fake but video will appear at it will be Kavanaugh party and hard as an undergrad at Yale it'll be fake but in our echoed silo chambers of the way we consume media right now it's going to be\nA potentially much more divisive than what we know today and so one of the reasons I wanted to write that the ah why we hate each other is an awareness that there is actually national security exposures for this country and how much we ate each other around politics we need communities of people that live\nIn the same neighborhood believe lots of stuff in common even when we differ on politics\n\n[noise] how come we can't get anybody in Washington or in the media to talk about this than\nAh it took us what twenty five minutes to unpack some of it and the business model of selling soap three minutes from now is let's just say who the bad guy is you know there's there's some nut job somewhere at a McDonald's right now who probably slapped an old man wearing a blog a hat and or\nThat person is a weirdo and did something wrong but they don't actually stand in for all debate and that's really the way we're consuming most of our media right now is that kind of backing and so it's harder to do ten and twenty five year out issues but that's the that's the strategic stuff that Washington should be focused on\nHow are you going to do that when you have about thirty I've got thirty seconds I'm not getting even ask you not even ask you I Would like to ask you to come down a Ben and and really unpack this uh because I think your voice needs to be heard and understood and I think in soundbites\nUm it's not a not always understood I'm so thank you very much\nFor them but good to be with your limit\nSenator Ben Sasse um why we hate each other and how to heal I really wanted that you're really want to get into him on taking on your own\nSide how do we feel if we're taking on our own side I Hope that he will come down and uh and spend some real time with us back in just a second\nOh so it's important to make those distinctions I think um and you know look at that is a this was just this is going on at our founding you know people were doing it at our founding in ... and ... at our founding what we what we we realize is when we were in a gauge and informed populace we chose correctly\nRight I mean I you know if we're not\nWe know what the ... which we know republic if you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's going to fall apart we knew this was an experiment and that was the risk of it\nAnd I think we are seeing some some of those risks pop their heads up but I mean the whole foundation of this country is to let people come out and make their arguments\nAnd we have to make our back that does not mean I'm In a ... thing and I was so encourage I Hope you are too so encouraged by the ... a reaction from conservative\n... shouted down\nA and I did not see a\nPeep of support from conservatives over the actions of the people protesting home and I didn't see I was just to buy I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't see any I didn't know I'm not saying there were none I'm sure people will show me a tweet if some you know not job it was like I think they should harass Nancy Pelosi at dinner\nBut I didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actions not one you could see you\nThe actions of the people protesting hunting I didn't see I was arrested by I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't see any I didn't know I'm not saying there were none I'm sure people will show me a tweet if some you know not job who was like I think they should harass Nancy Pelosi at dinner\nBut I didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actually not one you could see if we can we played dozens of Democrat and you\nKnow here's here's here's one from Sean King I've said it before but I Need to say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so but I'm Glad we have people in this country who stand up to fascist and a bigotry and are willing to confront hate face to face right and that you can tell you there's nothing ...\nOr ... even prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened to policy and that's right and I'm Glad they mean that that shows that there's still you know even though we're divided and even though a lot of things come down to the minute you know emotional politics like a minute to minute I'm Glad to see that there's still principles there\nSo here's where I think Ben was wrong when he said to deal with ants of a um\nHe was right when he said you know it's a small group it's a small room he's right\nIt is a very small group and they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media but it is a small group where I think he's wrong is ignore it\nIs a part of the solution is ignoring yeah and I think you know because you can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the alt right right you know the Charlottesville situation um you know\nThere's obviously a crime committed there that um you can't ignore right um but generally speaking when we're a bunch of Nazis or KKK members this has been having for ever go back for American bunch of KKK members walk through your town like ... you know largely speaking it's great to ignore them because they want attention and they run they\nBut that's not what we have now we have to follow a breaking laws you can't ignore them now can you can ignore them I don't care if it's the Nazis or ... you can't ignore\nThem excess would argue nor the right I mean like I think he's saying that we get a little bit too wrapped up in the back and forth of viral videos and people who are not even really engaged in politics\n[noise] getting freaked out over things that they're never going to have to necessarily deal with if you just to miss a group like as if though that's how they grow\nOr and or at least arguably that's how they grow their own oppose you're seeing it happen in Portland right in the mayor is largely just ignoring what they're doing and it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse that does not mean our lives have to be ruled by ... father and I think that the generalize argument he was going\nWell the the\nThe key here is what do you do about it and the solution is to not to do what people did in Florida with Nancy Pelosi you don't do that\nBecause that doesn't give you decide to run to yeah you don't do what the Proud Boys are doing I'm Sorry but it's so I just\nWhen you talk to a gabbing about that yeah and I think Gavin is even you know looking at things going again you know look we were we were doing things because you know it's funny\nA media yeah he's a comedian um but you know this this will grow out of control you just don't do that because there's nowhere to go when you're watching that you're like well I don't like\nWell Nancy Pelosi is doing but I don't like what they're doing\nSo who do I go to and look at look how the press is treating Donald Trump become\nDepressed treated Kavanaugh everybody kind of hard and their positions to me everybody just hardened their positions and got more outraged\nThe only the only thing that might have happened is independence looked at that and said\nYou know what I don't want to be with those people left the left and and I don't want to be with the I don't want to be with the left and then looked over to the Republicans they weren't misbehaving during that but\nWhat are we doing to welcome people in if you're kind of saying I don't want to be with those guys and then you see [noise] you know you ... get out get out there pounded on ... and I'm like okay I don't\nWe can't we can't get to a place to where people disengage because if they do completely disengaged then it just run the country is run by radicals\nWe need to be a safe haven we need to be a place of real thought real actual timed this um and real principals\nAnd we have to present a rational logical alternative I mean that that is one of the reasons I'm a conservative right right I saw the left you know early in my life as a group of people who made decisions emotionally yeah and that's not something I Want to be part of snow\nAnd we can be a part of that we can't do that ourselves let me go to Andrew in Florida hello Andrew you're on the Glenn Beck program\nGoing good morning first time caller longtime listener I all\nDuring the day very good\nOh right yeah you know I I just wanted to let you know I mean I'm here from Florida I'm In an independent uh most of my adult life and I'm exactly what you guys just said a victory all on both sides it's so ridiculous I think a lot of the independent just stay out of it because it's\nSo immature and it makes every one of those type of fat because they just can't talk to each other mhm anymore it's\nJust at our God now that being said every one that I Know that an independent in the state of four will be showing up for the conservatives\nYou know of ever really are and why is that you\nKnow a simple reason she got it all enemy office ... office just right now out there that are fighting for lower taxes I might I'm bringing home over three thousand more dollars this year than I did last year which is a huge\nDeal for me I've got two little girls and I've got one more I got my first uncommon in a\n[laughter] uh yeah I mean yeah\n... ... ... there's there's things like that are going on and on and I'm a conservative Christian showed up at you when you're when you're talking about\nWhat these people represent and how they forced themselves into a restaurant it can hurt people when they're eating with their family or most defended and then think exactly the way I Do it just so disgusted with some of the rhetoric on both sides\nWe just ignore it and where we used to be an independent thinkers or we're going to stay that way we also know what's wrong is wrong and what's brightest right as far as extras concern I think a lot of people are underestimating that\nWell Andrew I'm you if what you say is true ah than people are um the then the Republicans will keep the house most likely\nA because it is so close that levels we've never seen of interest in participation in the mid term election ever\nA and it's it's within the margin of

question number one is\nObviously you you wrote so beautifully frankly as the world's a greatest living American writer um\nHe rose so beautifully about what marijuana meant to you and how important it was too you know it's obviously an empty place in your life where you no longer smoke can haven't for a year almost a year and have you filled up to an empty place with something else\nWell you know I'm doing pretty much the same stuff I was doing when I was high you know I I still I I go into the movies or watching TV and banging out with my family reading books doing yoga or exercising walking my dog yeah I've just doing it over\nAnd uh and in some ways it makes things a little more boring in some ways and in other ways it makes things a lot better because I'm able to be more ... more attentive spray\nYou you haven't you haven't replaced the marijuana was some other um a stimulant or ... or\nI wouldn't I wouldn't say that I had a little I had a period after I quit a weed where I uh I was I was playing\nA lot of poker um uh-huh and stuff that is also addicted yeah\nAnd I felt a little bank roll and then I lost the bank roll then I then I and I was playing for free and some and I and I but I I had to back off of that because because that that kind of became all consuming as well I mean I had the biggest wide and twenty Seventeen because my mother died very suddenly\nThen I watched it happen and it was very traumatic and so the\nFollowing nine months were just a you know I dealt with it very poorly I did a lot of drugs and I play I did a lot of gambling and it just was not good and so\nYeah I was but once I sort of moved to the poker into the background and I I'd say that I've replaced it with um you know just a a filled up with books and movies and music\nAnd um you know other sort of as as they say in in the twelve step program you know our circle activities things that that are are fun and healthy that don't have to do with your addiction\nRight and you have a is your son the lines are you still fourteen\nHe's fifty almost sixteen\nAnd he's on the sixteenth okay 'cause I mean you've got a freshman up your website do one thing about your website it says in the uh towards uh the very end it says public loves cheese marijuana Boston terriers Los Angeles Dodgers classic cinema and do you ah well\nThat is true although I'm not doing the marijuana

others\nAre let's go to Robert in Naples, Florida Roberts you're on the Michael Mann that show with Neal Pollack\nHey how you doing that my dad used to say it's a poor ... tool but I uh have been ... with a lot of friends are different kinds of ... alcohol sex who wherever the case Las\n... basic with them or what they told us some as an ally non as a person that you have a a personality disorder where you need something\nTo make yourself strong one and in retrospect you're a strong all along and you didn't need to do that\nSo I don't think just to marijuana is a person I like to show\nA Neal yeah I mean that's well that's the thing about addiction right it's like it\nIt emerges as a response to some sort of drama uh which create character flaws and then you try to fill the gaps with whatever the addictive substances and he mentioned do a whole list of them you know alcohol drugs\nGambling sex eating shopping list goes on and on so yeah I mean that's an absolutely are accurate a

shows that the election coming up in just Fifteen days from now no it's a yeah it's Fifteen days from now it's a tomorrow's Tuesday\nSo two weeks from tomorrow is election day and age going to be a series of very very close elections if you look at the the Trump Clinton election state after state after state was incredibly close\nUh most of those states that were incredibly opposed President Trump won Hillary also want some states that were amazingly close New Hampshire Nevada\nThat she won I'm at the point is we have close elections and that is exciting and there's a reason everyone should vote\nBut you have full confidence that if you go out and vote your vote is going to be counted and it's going to be counted fairly and it's not going to be basically invalidated by all sorts of phony votes\nWell there's a new book that says you got to be concerned and the book is called fraud how the left plans to steal the next election and you might just sort of throw this on the pile and say well this is nothing but actually it's a book by\nEric eggers who is research director for the government accountability Institute\nAnd he's worked with Peter Schweitzer who's been a frequent guest on this show on Clinton Cash or extortion and secret empires which blew the lid off a different kind of corruption right now\nFraud is about voter fraud and one of the most ... basic forms of fraud imaginable a Eric thanks very much for joining us and congratulations from the book\nHey thanks so much Michael it's great to be here\nOkay first of all we seen this in the New York times in the Washington Post time and time again there is no evidence that voter fraud has ever ever occurred\nCan you or I help people with a a little bits of evidence about some recent voter fraud that really made a difference\nWell absolutely and I I think it's important to point out Michael cause you touched on this earlier about uh the idea of you know people have could should that concerned with their vote count a I think the real\nConcern is that their vote will be I think invalidated the true weight of it won't count because of the legal boat being cast than what you hear from the left\nIs it voter fraud is that you just mentioned incredibly rare ah it's really not happening on the scale to swing elections but that's because they defined voter fraud in the narrowest possible under inclusive terms or they defined it only as an intentional acts of impersonation buying the legal voter\nAre on behalf of illegal voter right but in fact I think most people would say well anything that makes my vote knocked out as much as it should\nThat voter fraud or in the reality is that happens all the time uh and you have to look no further than the tactics being employed to get illegal voters onto the voting rolls just in Texas this week there was a story\nAbout the Texas Democratic party sending out a voter registration forms with the boxes that yes I'm a citizen check to non citizen voters\nOr their bloat in voter rolls all over the country there's actually two hundred and forty eight counties in this country that have more registered voters than citizens of illegal voting age\nOr the Supreme Court but that the that nearly three million people are registered to vote in more than one state and it GI where I work as part of the research\nWe did a national study in which we found Twenty one hundred instances of double voting in the state of Florida alone in choice to either Michael you remember\nThat nearly four times the margin of victory over presidential election this century so clearly it's happening and it's happening in the scale of the largest elections you noted that Trump election predicting how close that was a so it was a very real problem and that's one of the reason why\nIf you do you um can you point to any specific elections where you do feel that evidence exists that the the result was tipped by fraudulent voting\nFor instance when there was a lot of people look at the Al Franken I'm a Norm Coleman election back I'm ah in two thousand and eight\nThat that's exactly right there was I think that the election and that being settled by around three hundred vote and it wasn't until a couple of years later unfortunately with discovered more than a thousand votes by I think spelling and people that shouldn't have been voting so that's a that's a very prominent example and by the way before the\nOutbreak and went on to become the sixty vote in the Senate\nSo anytime people ask what the true cost of voter fraud I Would say well look you're a ride and insurance premiums because uh Alfred it's actually became the vote that locked in Obamacare are in New Hampshire and twenty sixteen New Hampshire has a very weird policy about voting to have what's called the intent to reside law\nSo and I write about this in the book that Democrats ... said New Hampshire bill Gardner even admit this is a massive problem he's actually a champion of\nTrying to eradicate voter fraud in New Hampshire the senator from New Hampshire Kelly yeah Audie she ended up losing by one thousand votes in twenty sixteen well they had six thousand people registered to vote on the same day in New Hampshire\nAnd they have these buses that come in from Massachusetts a neighboring state six thousand people voted but then didn't actually register a car or take the follow up steps to suggest their actual New Hampshire residents\nSo those are a couple of recent examples but um you know but but some of the other things that happened I think\nThat document example you got mayor's races you got share three the sheriff's rate in Florida that uh it's basically been proven to that they've had felons that had voted illegally but because the election basically been certified\nOr that the judge has ruled that well we have to give these fellows due process though that's not enough evidence brought invalidate though\nHappened to me a nationally okay would would you say there's a certain amount of voter fraud in every state every election I I Would\nIt really been certified or that the judge has ruled that well we have to give these valid due process though that's not enough evidence right invalidate though\nIt happened a nationally no kids would would\nYou say there's a certain amount of voter fraud in every state every election\nI I Would um because it really get down to the below in the voter rolls I mean and this is something we experience I live in Florida\nAnd I've been having numerous interactions with the election here and elsewhere\nBecause the reality is biased to let people vote right I mean no one wants to suppress illegal voter\nBut because of that it created a system of vulnerability but I think are actively avoided by bad actors so I'm In the Texas Democrat nailing the the voter registration or\nIs one example but you know you got groups like acorn and ... and their whole job is to go out and Ralph stop at many voters as possible regardless of the legality of the voters right you've got\nVoted I I Know one drives were saying why one of the things you're\nOne of the things that people seem to be a interested in on the left as the idea that if you're a college student you can uh register both in your college and uh where where you live and then you vote twice now that's illegal but that happens a lot doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean they're nearly three million people registered in more than one state in the country or that the court sided use that are that the twenty four million voter registration in this country are completely ... so that one in a way\nThat we know we've got math\nProblem and then the question is how easily are they waited\nA gay they as much as we are going to face and just a moment with Eric Eyre angers his new book fraud how the left plans to steal the next election it's posted up at our website\nAnd question that we're going to ponder is what do you do about it how can it be fixed how can we be protected we'll get to that and more with Eric eggers his new book is called fraud how the left plans to steal the next election and we'll be right back on the ... that show\nGet it's such a handicap for somebody not to have an ID because you can't cash a check and you can I mean all kinds of stuff you can do\nSo if you're actually helping people by giving them IDs at the same time that you're requiring ideas for voting doesn't that help precisely the victim groups that uh we're supposed to be protecting\nIt does except for when it enables I think I'm Still like cities like Chicago and San Francisco the issue these municipal id\nAh but then the problem is that I think it creates a\nPhysician's designed relief factor as an essential way to
