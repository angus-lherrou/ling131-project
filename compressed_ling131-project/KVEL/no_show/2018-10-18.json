C. and a ship Gettysburg and a couple of place went to Harper's Ferry and walks walk the AP we're told we were calling it the Appalachian Trail um they said\nNo it's we ate the [laughter] the eighties so we now know what's the eighties so something I've never done before obviously it was incredible um and so valley forge we will explore tomorrow\nIt's great you have that opportunity there I'm Kevin ... you know you've you've been in education for for for a long time you've taught both of my my children in school I can you tell us a little bit about your personal background\n[noise] well I came to verbal I had just graduated back when it was called southern Utah State college and my wife and I worked Twenty one almost twenty two when we signed contracts we moved to colonel and I think we plan on staying a year or two\nAnd then of course that didn't happen we love it and we are so glad that we made that decision to find her first contractor\nSo you signed you signed is a brand new and brand new teacher he does your does your wife teach with you\nShe came with me she was in elementary school teacher and was also a ... teacher for thirty one years team mates or elementary the Naples\nGoodness so you guys that sign together and you then with his district since the beginning you've you've you must have really enjoyed the community\nOh it is now our community\n[laughter] I've I I'm I'm the same I started that twenty five years ago and you can find me outta here what at what Kevin what qualifications do you have to serve as a on the on the you went to school this morning\nI I Would think it's such a variety of things that I was given the opportunity to do as an educator that ah I taught so many subjects are\nBack then credentialing wants a little bit different and where I was teaching things like theater arts I couldn't necessarily get a full schedule teaching um speech um theater arts so I taught English and history and some things on there which was a wonderful learning experience for me and hopefully the kids didn't suffer too bad\nBecause my lack of knowledge but my main subject for a speech theater arts broadcasting and then I coached almost as many sports of subjects I taught\nBut probably football and wrestling or the ones that I coached the longest and all those I coach probably twenty five years I also directed the musicals and dramas for twenty five years\nAnd then after that after twenty seven years of teaching I went into what ministries ship and that was the vice principal for two years um moved to the district offices the students service director for three years and then came back to the high school\nTo serve as a assistant principal athletic director for three years so those experience of put me in pretty good shape to understand what a school board should be and then of course I was elected to the school board so I've actually done that for the past two years\nAnd then with all that time in in in education in in in you in a county a winner the top three issues that you feel are most important to us now and and why are those those in priority in your in your mind\n... I I think the first one and I think everybody hits this this isn't just an issue and it's everywhere gets recruiting and retaining teachers or this is becoming so difficult so\nI just believe in order to fight the best possible education we need to be able to attract them keep highly qualified educators salaries overall are not enough to make this happen however they are an important piece to the solution we were able to adjust their salary schedule to make a lot more competitive to recruit new teachers\nAre starting salary maker's pretty average in Utah right now sort salaries don't necessarily attract teachers\nBut it's no longer a deal breaker that that look at our salaries that check older but what separates us as our ministry ration has changed do plan to go beyond salaries to recruit um I've been with them and\nActually been a ... we really promote our community to get people there we talk\nIt's the same feeling you have about our community and I do we're not making things up but we really sell what a great place you want a county is to welcome to raise a family we also really talk about the recreational advantage of living in ... county\nI'm ... and this is really\nReally promote our community to get people there we talk\nIt's the same feeling you have about our community and I do we're not making things up but we really sell what a great place you want a county is to welcome to raise a family we also really talk about the recreational advantage of living in ... county\nI'm ... and this is really tasty evidence for us then principals make personal contacts with the candidates to let them know at\nOur school really want you and I'm quite frankly we've done quite a bit better than most school districts do wanna open positions and now the important thing is once we have them in the system what do we do to make them stay\nAnd under the leadership superintendent Dr we have an incredible system in place to train employees\nAre the ... support system with the district leadership school department leadership trained coaches and possibly the most important teams appears working professional learning communities to study ensure ideas to bed at best educate our students\nAre team leaders are well trained them best practices in late discussions with their team to tackle challenges if students are struggling in reading there is a system in place to first diagnosed the problem\nThen create a plan to fix the issue a lot of times what we did is oh they're struggling and reading and there really wasn't a play on so I didn't know was a comprehension what exactly was a problem where things are an employer are in place to do that so teachers are no longer left alone to figure it out on their own\nAnd teachers that are successful and believe their voices being hurt\nThey become much easier to retain and kind of along the same lines I gotta go number two is one of the emphasis on the district has this your shirt leadership\nAnd the emphasis on sure leadership is a focus of this district shirt leadership to me is actually ... done because as you know an idol of true leader all shares the leadership and again because of the framework we have in place\nOr in a good place to move forward with this ... shirt shirt leadership made sharing what all stakeholders\nAnd one of the best examples I can give a shirt leadership is a group of talented people I worked\nWith October create musicals for the high school we all lead\nAnd we all respect we listen to each other and we taught each other and I see the same thing happening in our schools today and then all of our programs and all of our apartment\nThere's this shirt leadership and we will get\nBetter with a lot of emphasis this year but I Believe it's absolutely important before going to educate our students with the highest level possible\nFor for remodeling are never to renovate the buildings was eleven to Seventeen million so that those are the figures that were estimates\nThat we're dealing with at least from the business administration are shut off as a let's talk about central coal preschool and building for a minute on on on Fort Sam fertile avenue that was built in the Nineteen forties um what are your feelings do we need to first of all why does the school district need to provide preschool education\nWell there's two reasons first we need to provide it that federal guidelines\nSo we're we're we're we're we're instructed were were mandated to to provide preschool education for handicapped children's I understand it\nYes for ... and the other thing that we need to do is we also need to put um kids with learning disabilities\nAnd things those are and then we also need to put peers in their ... for example a lot of it is speech development I had a son that really struggled with speech development of as a young age and what we find is you put them in school but you also surround them what's yours that don't have speech\nDelay our problems\nAnd so ideally that's what you want to do you want the free schools should be\nA lot of students are some that are have some developmental delays but you put them well some of the tone and so they learn from each other therefore why this project is so important work will be able to expand it will be able to put more students into us\nWhich is a great thing so as I understand that a special needs child in preschool their children um have you need a better um teacher student relationship so the ... of the class sizes you need to have more involvement with teachers directly with the ...\nCentury and other students ... ... ... what are the best\nT class sizes need to be smaller is what I'm asking do that I\nNot not at the pre school I mean obviously but what it is is when you Put Students who have speech problems and they are surrounded by\nThe sizes you need to have more involvement with teachers directly with the slum\nTours and other students ... ... ... what are the best\nYour class sizes need to be smaller is what I'm asking do that\nI not not at the pre school I mean obviously but what it is is when you Put Students who have speech problems and they are surrounded by students who don't\nThey do that in ... oh yeah absolutely\nOkay um the the the construction renovation was an estimated to seven to ten million and the biggest project on on the slate here you can stretch ... again was right in about seven to ten million\nOr I mean they need to do something or do we we just painted and and and and you know a blurry Norman said you're you're gonna you're gonna put lipstick on a pig you feel that way\nAbsolutely the worst thing you do is and what we're gonna have to look at projects the worst thing you can do is put two hundred thousand dollars into a building that you have to tear down three ... three years later\nRight you know that's probably the biggest problem I have with central cold is what you do what do you rebuild it\nUm\nPut a new school there or do you remodel it because I Love that school\nWhere there's a lot of heritage with that school and I like what do you feel that that needs to be presented to the public and let the public have some input on it I didn't even house\nI mean and to me the public catch you jump up when they voted to do this\nThat was twelve years ago with the with the leeway right\nAbsolutely because when when you were doing all the buildings you can't do with them 'cause I I\nThink if you are in question than than I Want to ask you in a suit direct question do you need all the public needs to be more involved in these projects\nOr is this something that the that the district administrators and and and the board just need to make behind scenes\nWhy I don't think anybody's making this behind scenes where I think it's very transparent people know that these are coming up I've known this for years of this project was coming up\nOkay All right well let's talk about that the ... and I hope you don't mind these are questions that are being asked and these are positions that are being presented in the community and I just need to be very direct with with ... candidates and ask them questions directly transportation building it's sixty years old currently sits in a residential area\nAt about six thirty five west two hundred south and burn on the other the building is old by my every candidate that's running right now is in desperate need of repair or get bids were received renovate the building from five to seven million dollars\nAnd the new building construction would be five to seven or there's also talk of the administration offices which are forty to fifty years old not ADA compliant\nRenovation is a ... I mean not desperate there but at that it would be probably a ... is a is a project that that should be discussed and there's been some of the candidates that have suggested maybe incorporating the transportation building and the district administration offices\nIn one building to save on on construction costs that what what are your feelings on on these young\nThat that is that is to point out yeah and that's one that you look out on the plans if she can put those two together it absolutely stays on him at all because you're doing it in one building Robert ... okay you know basically what you're doing as few out the district office\nTransportation you're adding officers on the out rather than a new building\nI wanted to ask you um I wanted to kind of paint a scenario for you from from the average from the average citizen that that is on the street I'm this voting\nA property you know families families were were devastated businesses were devastated by this recent recession and it's been it's been a cycle that we've experienced a up and down I've tried to manage my business through these are these treacherous times and it is very very difficult\nUh his property values have declined the only relief and families have been split you know some of them are are in Texas and the other um dad's up in up in North Dakota and the families here and and and they're trying to make make make do and the only relief that they felt they hand was was when their property values decreased on cable that means our taxes are going to be decrease\nUm do do you think I'm ... and then to find out that uh that we had voted in a a I'm a certified tax rate\nWhich maintained the same revenue for the county or for the district but taxpayers were ... they they didn't really pay more but they didn't receive the relief did you did you support that are changing the tax rate certify tax\nYes okay so do you explain your position on it\nYeah and a lot of it too is there's a couple of ways to do it you need believes that needed to replace they bought another one way to do it is through bonds but that way you spike really high and then you drop down it and you spike high and you dropped out this is a pretty level way\nOkay All right um you can understand people's position on this and and and I think that's where that's where the ... the perception in public perception is their reality I'm In ... we need to do a better job of communicating with on a\nMember of that community too but I also pay taxes and taxes are Hartford late to especially on the teacher salary right understand I I you know when we talk about you know mainstream a community\nSteve on names I'm mainstream fertile I pay taxes like everybody else I Believe I was mainstream as anybody else I have zero kids from the system right now I'm On a fixed income I'm retired and you know what\nFor our kids I'm okay with it when I think taxpayer not as candidate Kevin excellent as a taxpayer yes I Am okay what\nOne thing that's happening I think the consistent thread between all of the candidates run is is they both have they all all six of you have your heart's in education I the platforms are different and uh that's the purpose of this program is to provide people an opportunity to\nTo understand your position to different positions so that they can make an educated a choice\nAnd Kevin I you know I I appreciate you joining us it's it's been it's been a wonderful conversation and ah I appreciate your candor and and um I I think the the voting public would appreciate a in pre shake your candor in in in your your your\nUm your response to the questions you're honest response to the question so thank you\nYou're welcome\nWhat are you doing tonight are you going out to dinner somewhere fun out there\nOh yes I think we're going to get out to dinner and we're going to see what's going on\nRight going go enjoy you know I'm so envious of you being near ... vacation I Would love to have I'd love to go to a valley forge I mean I just think of George Washington kneeling down by is worse when when when he's not the world is coming to an end there I it's it's it's it's a great a great place for spiritual place\nAnd to conclude Steve I'm going to tell you I speak from my heart or not a politician a lot of people what I think they want to hear somebody who is running for school or I'd look I rarely or school or I'm not running against Dave shivers or not robbing whip\nRobert McClellan or Laura Gilman I'm up against I Am running to be on the scoreboard are going to tell you exactly the way I feel ... and I hope people understand that I'm not a politician I'm not going to try to figure out what I think people want me just say\nYeah people we don't we we were kind of not real fond of politicians these days\nAre not running with\nRobert McClellan or Laura Gilman I'm running against I Am running to be on the scoreboard aren't going to tell you exactly the way I feel that and I hope people understand that about a politician I'm not going to try to figure out what I think people want me to say\nYeah people we don't we we we're we're kind of not real fond of politicians these days are we so\nAnyway we we uh we appreciate you Kevin thank you thank you for joining us now here we we will ah ah take a break right now and when we come back we'll be visiting with that was good Wilkins a man running so thank you and and travel safe Kevin is a very very pleasure much pleasure of visiting with\nYou by now okay let's hear\nYou had three sit here yet to down at the other end of the table but nobody\nSo he felt mutilated nation on on the board right right and I\nAnd they didn't want it didn't seem like they wanted to communicate with one another case you have to have communication to make it work you have to have community involvement mhm you have to have the taxpayer because the taxpayers ones paying your bill they're paying the bill for what we're doing\nOkay and it's not there\nTo tell us a scoop them a little bit about your qualifications or\nA I've been farming and ranching for sixty years okay and twenty three and a half say twenty three years ago I went into business among I'd I'd worked in oil field for\nDifferent companies had to work and you also have to supplement your your farming and ranching didn't right [laughter] and I don't know if I'm now that doesn't supplement\nWell now I don't know if that's any good or not because ... you've got the best to get uh hooked patients or as former richer and the whole field yeah and they're both fault but the economy is down right our economy is in bad shape\nAnd we find this out because we cannot hire people there is no the unemployment down mhm but there's no one here the Phillies job sites and so it's it's wicked and I used the\nStarted that and then I spent twenty nine years and the ... district mhm and served several years on that as a German ... and I know how our board operated there\nSo you've had him parents working on a board and write and making concessions and and listening to people and and and coming together for the betterment\nOf right and we never had this kind of problems that you go to school district has okay I Know that you know school district is a huge employer mhm sin is bigger than what we had but it also operates under the same briefing\nOn ... can you tell us what what would top three issues are most important to you that's facing you feel is facing you went to school district and why are those well for it and then went by priority that top priority number one\nNumber one is a teacher pay okay we're ... we're we're out of whack with the way the teachers are their income\nAnd then they said it ... that's ... that's a consistent with each one of of of that now you're the last person that I interviewed this running a ... and it's a consistent theme that everyone everyone believes in that\nAnd I saw how we're going to get it done we're going to raise ... we're going to raise their pay how we're going to do that we have enough money in the general fund that we can cover that okay\nCan you figure that it'd be at one point to do one million okay to bring them up three thousand or from a ... year\nThree thousand a year at one point two million this is the estimate that you have a right to bring them up to three thousand dollars a year um the pay increase all three ... and and do we have that much money there is in the general fund there is certainly less in surplus\nBecause I think last year it was two point four or five or something okay we ended up with enough from last year surplus pays at one point two for two years\nThen you know that this was going to continue each year because it's out of your property tax mhm and it doesn't look like the property taxes are going to be going down um okay it hadn't anyway\nAnd you're so that the school district receives the majority of\nScrutiny the school district um recently recognizing that uh uh you know into\nAnd it doesn't look like the property taxes are gonna be going down um okay it hadn't anyway because and you're so the school district receives the majority of\nScrutiny the school district um recently recognizing that uh\nUh you know in two thousand sixteen Seventeen I share this with with the audience before you went to school district was three point six percent lower than the state average per teacher pay now put you went to a twenty ninth or forty one districts in the states or not\nIt really hard to recruit and retain quality teachers with when we're on that level of the spectrum with pay right\nRight and so the state why can't we we have in our county the opportunity that we could be probably in the top ten okay and I think that it's there and I think\nWith transparency and honesty and community involvement that we can build that up to that\nWhat are your feelings about the administration I Know that in two thousand six teens there was some ah some contention with the board and and um cooperation with the administration there what what are your feelings about our current administrators starting beginning with our our superintendent Mr dolphins\nYou know ... I Can't\nI Can't give you any kind of an answer on that because I don't know man I have never I've never been around him\nI met him at the at board meetings and probably shouldn't be tens or four times and they're probably been twenty twenty five words mhm back and forth in of four or five times so I Can't honestly\nGive it a an opinion of the man I Know that I can work with any man as long as they are doing their job to their best ability okay then I don't but I Can't I don't want to go in data more\nOkay All right ... ... let's talk about let's talk about taxes proposition and one is a potential gas tax increase for public education and local roads\nOr this is a ballot on the ballot at rates to provide additional funding for public education and local roads should the state increase the state's motor and special fuel tax rates are by an equivalent of ten cents per gallon\nYou support knowing how how's how's the how's it going to vote excuse revolt against it okay why because\nIf you figure right now I think our diesel fuel is probably about three forty five\n... and so you add another ten cents on a three fifty five\nAnd with my business and I'm a small trip in business mhm but if you take ten cents a gallon ... a gallon and you put three hundred gallon than a crook mhm and you get sixteen trucks\nSo then that's ever day every other day in ... the\nMoney's going do you think a rural I citizens in rural Utah a are going to pay a pay more than than they would in the metropolitan areas\nOr no they will because right out here we pay more for fuel right here in the basin that probably anywhere in the state may have a bigger geographic area to travel we do we have a whole lot of my with her but the thing that bugs me to stay on this is the fact\n\nIs anyone ever stop to think how many people we have in your academy on fixed income mhm how many single mom we have with children I'm trying to raise those children trying to educate the children\nAnd then have to have another tax stuck on them I I don't\nI Can't I Can't I Can't go on with All right I'm let's move on to a ... to the campaigning here now that we have we have a five member school board there's three physicians that are open\nA we have we have the three candidates are voting on one player or campaigning on one platform and three candidates campaigning on a separate platform it seems to be pretty polarized between the six candidate is\nA you have been marketing yourself with with the three of a of the potential school board candidates\nI'm your claim as you intend to increase teachers pay we've talked about that lower property taxes are and and the third one is that you you want it to a stop the twenty million dollar new district administration complex can we talk about\nUh how you would propose to lower taxes\nProperty taxes the the money to take care\nOf all of it is available pay so let's let's just go that route\nI mean let's say if you lower him to ah\n\nWhen are you talking about the are certified to actually no I'm Talking about ... or the property tax the property taxes you're you're\nBecause there are only ... is what goes into the general fund correct correct how how are you going to increase teacher pay and reduce the money going into that fund because of the excess that's already in it okay unit with violence is in the general fund I Do not\nTexas in Texas right now saying I Want I Want to get on the air and we've got a football game to do right here but you know I'm not a chicken ... scooters pleasure meeting\nYou and I really appreciate the opportunity and getting to know you and I I I think you know I just want to thank you for your patience with a with me with these questions are very direct questions and hope you can appreciate the the the spirit in which they're asked well\nI appreciate you and I appreciate the people the taxpayers have you in the coming All right thank you in\nA ...

center Daniels heating Johnny Was the only\nShape from where insurance and sand buddies you off and now let's go live to the football field with the voice of the UN to you both teams Brian Baldwin [noise] they ...\nThe line from selling males high school game time I was just a minute ago and sailed hills kicked off to the youth youth received from the north went to the south catching it at the Seventy our language it hard\nHe went all the way left up to the thirty five you tell a second attend right now from the thirty five is the first player was pitch and throw they picked up the Jane horror actually rolled out right and try to hit ... down the field\nIt was a place a second down at ten dig it up center center left cash is going to head off to Jay and worked hard trying to balance it inside is going to get just across the line with your image maybe a yard or two\nIs all it's going to be a third and eight so the it's just running to place now from from the line of scrimmage\nSo basically I think they just put the ball right back in the original line of scrimmage I thought I originally thought some progression\nFrom getting hoarse but they All right back at the thirty five yard line sort of started ten eleven fourteen clock rolling first quarter zero zero this last football game for the ... after a rose last last week\nSpanish for fifty five to six taking notes in shock and quick throw and hit is the catch was going to be made is tiger gardener the ball falls into place for it down and I say oppressed coming out the pond just a quick little slap powder or they got the ball and socket one step and throw it would have gotten maybe a first down it's caught\nA from Tyler gardener but he was hit as soon as the ball touches has so\nGood defense a youth Scott good position on the kicker turned so it ought to help when the fields start turning here on the upon by the press can bring the ball if he's got the time he's back their fortune yards back good snap pressure common\nAnd they run into and there's a flag and that's why also goes over the return the return or tatty\nTouches it now takes it up off the mountain is on the left side line returning it and still returning is going to come all the way not even realize the penalty I got to be maybe make it a Taco Bell jade hearts does catch up there are four flags on the ground folks and I believe both of them are on Salem hills vote that all these I think three of the flag\nOn return were holding are pushing the back but I did get hit by the defenders coming in to try to block the pond so I think that's going to give us a first down\nSo the return got Salem hills inside each territory at the forty five he must have picked that up with the cancer he ran a good forty five yards through the forty five and\nNow they're starting out all the penalty is now the the one on the kicker is is take precedence over the one on the return I think but I think they're all on Salem hills anyway so if you will have a choice of let's see what they're they're the referee\nAnd so he ran a good forty five yards to the forty five and now they're starting out all the penalty is now the the one on the kicker is is take precedence over the one on the return I think but I think they're all on Salem hills anyway so you still have a choice of\nLet's see what they're they're the referees are talking there were literally four flags are still all sitting out there once it the twenty\nThree yard line where is the parental at the pump go\nThe others are on the forty eight assailant hills and the forty six forty seven and save them hills so hold his declined on Salem hills\nAnd now personal fouls running into the kicker yeah that's a first down for the U.S on off and so do you still have the ball at midfield midfield fifty yard line first than than you it's rough and the kicker not running into the kicker it's roughly the kicker run it in particular it's been mostly it was only five yard

which was the intent of the lending program in the first place\nTo go to Gordon sorry to hear the board in Lakeland, Florida Gordy go ahead\nHey thank you for taking my call 'em holler probably think Alan he's the one they pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on the hook on it's gonna crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt is college dead\nOK I already knew the doping in hypothesis but now there's one thing they don't want to mention and that is that the I'm a conservative everyone knows that I'm the guy that almost won I lost a four to three\nSplit decision in the shadow case I'm pro life pro gun I'm a sport right conservative as Rush Limbaugh and most of it's not even the liberals want a free hand out okay\nBut the college tuition is technically and legally attack because it's money go into an arm of the state government college and were being over tax that ... role as a matter of fact\nThe price of college is about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and here's the thing okay we spend a lot of money on our military\nAnd it it's too much really we spend a lot in you know even as a conservative we spend a lot of money on Social Security but we can only cut those things a little bit the on the third or fourth thing is probably\nThe tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee college loans and we don't need to spend any money or that not only does it put the tax dollar on that hug and it's going to crash the dollar like Greece or Venezuela Georgian\nAnd I'm Alan by the way\nI'm Alan was good enough to make me the leader of the Florida group and I hope I'm I he's gotten on an equal talking a little too much and you know [laughter] but this and I and all of\nThe reason is here's the deal OK almost\nTen percent of the total that his college debt and and it's going to crash the dollar that the only thing if we get rid of the window and get a credit card Idaho okay with that line but let them get a credit card it'll save the tax dollar and it'll save the standing of college will drop like a rock\nAnd the I I Love I Love my rates man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide jobs in hospitals and police looking here\nIf we can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get but look if he can get bankruptcy repeatedly pre millions in bailout can handouts\nAnd if all these rich banks and these colleges can get rich on the students looking here ... that that that those are the two beneficiary in here and\nAnd okay and they use the third or I we all got your point there ...\nAllen [noise] you know I I he said a lot there but I appreciate all those points and he's exactly right\nYou know if we can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq\nI think we can throw maybe a trillion or so at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view [noise] you know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow I think on balance that would probably be\nA good thing it would return prices\nBack down to rational levels uh and you know it would it would really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system but in but in particular it would it would lead to lower price as\nLong as you do with all the debt right now Alan would you are just a white dude clean\nWell I Will say that if\nYou had a minimum bankruptcy protection is or not restored so that people can go to a judge\nAnd according to the wisdom of a judge I'm settled that debt according to their means\nIf that does not happen than we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a nonpartisan guy but I Will say that uh the Democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling all student debt\nAnd [noise] you know I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people are out there are able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon if at a minimum of the bankruptcy writes that the founders demanded aren't return\nWhat when you do have salaries and teachers' salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[noise] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate is that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly over charging students by and large\nThey could probably suffer eight thirty percent if not forty percent reduction in the student loan income that they're currently receiving and she'll be able to keep their doors open not have to lay off one person a and you know be able to service all the students that they do today\nSo I think there's a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia um\nSo yeah I mean ending the student loan program tomorrow would I agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise] um but certainly there's got to be a middle ground you know and with bankruptcy back with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other Linder has to contend with\nA that would go a long ways towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools\nTo lower their prices improve their quality and decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFirst time caller mark in Provo, Utah hey mark go ahead\nWell George you said they can't uh they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school\nI was on a full scholarship they've been paid for my books but the federal government makes you go to a student loan counseling and so I went and I told the lady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me well honey if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest on it\nOh boy I Would love to sue her this did you end up doing that oh yeah and then life happens the money disappears yeah you know over\nFifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student\nLoans and loan balance is a hundred and three thousand dollars a gallon never pay it off I Will die owing money do they harass you mark\nNo I'm right now they've got me on some ridiculous thing we're uh my payment is zero um I did a double major in a minor and ... some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility um I just I would've never tasted that crack heads she not pedaled it\nTo me exactly exactly well what do you think Ellen yeah these these loans are\nPushed on the students way ahead of any scholarship or any other um any other aid that were you don't have to pay back I mean the colleges and some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them\nA private banks and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's\nIt's just disgusting [laughter] hey you know I might actually add um the repayment program that that a mark is on a is probably the income based repayment program so they're a bunch of government programs out there that sound like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness ... their income based repayment\nBut what all everybody out there needs to know is that all of these programs are failing the vast majority\nOf people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service\nBased repayment program sort of a bunch of government programs out there that sound like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness ... there's income based repayment but what all everybody out there needs to know is that all of these programs are failing the vast majority\nOf people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where\nYou work for a you know if you work in a college or hospital other nonprofit get your love for giving\nOnly about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it so the rest are being just qualified and they're being left owing far far more\nSo mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan show so that alone is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that ivy our program\nAnd actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so\nTwenty five years you get a nice little thing that sense of the IRS that says this is income for this year\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were originally borrowed\nThe federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nBig was going to say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was ... acres that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and uh many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nAh they have no public a benefit a inspiration they jettison all

so that money that gets taken away from home purchases a you know business formation\nA auto ... you know other big ticket items that improve the economy [noise] uh so certainly it's hurting in that respect a\nAnd you know it's it's also running in a number of ways are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people a straddle or you know strapped under this new sort of debt levels ... sort of\nBig ticket items that improve the economy a so certainly is hurting in that respect a\nAnd you know it's it's also hurting in a number of ways that are really harder to quantify you know when you've got forty four million people a straddled or you know strapped under ... this these sort of debt levels typically the sort of oppressive type of debt [noise] um\nThis really can make people do bad things um you know make people do things for money that they wouldn't otherwise do\nI'm also forces a lot of people into the underground economy a and certainly those people will pay no taxes and and et cetera so so it's really hurtful in many ways that are maybe not a parent or to the naked eye\nIt's going to call Fresno, California to get things started here west

One of those fortunate case who are at one point three to aloe with talking about that actually got um most cars that were given I ah got\nThirty four thousand thirty seven thousand that I got you know that I owed\nForgiven wow how'd you do that graduations and\nI appreciate that thank you well I I did a little bit of a horrible way ah there's something called\nA you'll binding and what that is is that like a lifting\nOf pretty much like a courses you cook or trade the trades you chose yeah and what it is is a bit of course who are the reason they're in the situation because they both by ... so if you were from a certain time period to a time period at the end of the school\nI'm pretty much that when they committed a that broader\nSo it actually took me from I Would have to say December to dealt with it being too around August of two thousand and fixing to get it all given what I did is I actually wrote Kamala Harris email\nI'm surprised that we bonded um but the the avenue that I went to go after given how to write a cover letter M I submitted a pretty much a with a cover letter I have the political money on it then I had to pretty much just a political out there what I'd gone through no that that's the transcript to a\nA cover letter transcripts and pretty much all the information that I actually had to prove that I went to college\nYeah you know what it was the fraud that they've done it reduces I guess right\nBy yes uh that's one of the main things I put there because if you see many of the ... one thing they promises life long job placement of quickly so what how I\nFalse advertising youth exactly so when the schools shut down there goes your fault in the ... there goes your your last night long but at the right you got that right the interesting Alan isn't it yeah that\nYou know and that's a good point and I maybe I should have brought up at some other point of view there are some breaking news now where if you went to\nParticularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught lying just like to just like Paul mentioned\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates and you know say oh you know average earnings for your degrees this much and these could be lies and so there actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where if your school ... you\nThen at least on paper you have available to you and avenue called defense to repayment where you\nAt least theoretically you can get your loans cancelled and I I think I'm Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen does work successfully for him [noise] ah but I Will say that even just yesterday I'm\nOne of the federal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of do away and slow walk this\n... this program so as it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who were lied to by their colleges\nAre then there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be because believe me the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely\nHave to uh you know under gunpoint practically by the legal community but [noise] um but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so if you you were lied to by typically a for profit college or you may may may possibly have some avenue for record snow\nWell you know with all these credit card fraud that's out there and just credit fraud indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency from some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy in the ... and they don't provide it to you they're up a creek aren't they\n[noise] well that's right and not similarly for student loans and we find a lot of a private loans the underlying note\nUh well first of all the loan has been bought and sold so many times that whoever says they owned a note actually does not owned the note and they have no business collecting on that loan I'm ... now there are other there are some avenues that the lenders can go to they can\nSay that the note was lost and they have other avenues to prove their does have valid note but that certainly is something to be aware of\nAnd I should also say people who have private student loans are not federal student loans they do have statute of limitations so somebody comes up you Twenty years hence and starts demanding money from you for a private loan than almost certainly that loan is not\nLittle ... little suspect\nUm and you want to look into the statute of limitation laws that govern that particular alone depending on where you live or where you took up a lung\n... Minneapolis east of the Rockies ... go ahead\nI worked in a Social Security office for a while and I figured out that at ... at least one of the agenda as if the destruction of the Social Security

even more disturbing I see legislation out there right now and I wasn't passed yet\nBut I see legislation out there right now which offers a loan forgiveness in uh in return for people for going their

I was going to say through through um his his friendship with Senator Harry Reid but that's not that's not entirely correct and I don't want to do in this service hair he'd be it for the ... contract quite quite openly in legitimately in through the\nThe fans of contractual procedure and he'd go hey launch\nChunk of that a tip work but of course justice the the government requires that people selling their their secrecy oh it's so Robert Bigelow and and um his organization had everyone under non disclosure agreement\nSo actually the people involved in this work what kind of I'm stung twice so to speak they had they had to have government security parents but also the commercial\nNon disclosure agreement so so again there is a lot of this story that we don't know and that's the other thing in in aliens at the Pentagon and I've seen a lot of\nYou know you pick up the the media um reports of this you go on to the blog some forums you see a lot of speculation\nWas always taught at the ministry of defense\nYou know when I was doing analyst ... for example and briefing you must always differentiate between ... you know and what you think\nAnd that's not a skill that everyone practices when they they make films documentaries but I Try to be\nRigorous on that and and we don't even speculating I say I'm speculating and when I'm not I'm not so hopefully even though there are large parts of the story we still don't know I'm only ... about where we don't know those things\nNow what's the bottom line which as\nWell [laughter] I I don't want to I I don't want to get too far into spoiler [laughter] I I I think\nOne one thing that I Can't say which I think gives a pretty good summary of of what I think has gone down [noise]\nIs that I Would say there was and I use that would deliberately a believer faction if I can call it died within the U.S government\nAnd some of those people were permanent employees and some were can try and potatoes and this believe a fraction so but the phenomenon was absolutely rail\nAnd and they were to write and that of course\nDidn't entirely know what to think of it did not rule out the possibility that they were dealing with something extraterrestrial paranormal\nAnd actually then that believe a fraction became or or certainly interacted with an overlapped with with a tab\n[noise] and they effectively I I guess you got the chance to\nSee you those those\nBeliefs and those hypotheses within government with taxpayers' money and and that of course and gives us in\nAn interesting opportunity to find out about this because and I hope we'll we'll have time to get into this late but there is now with coast talk of congressional hearings to to get to the bottom of this but but the bottom line to answer your question is is that I think there was a believer ...\nThey made them move they came up against some roadblocks couple of different road blocks one road blocks was they simply going to a point where you know they they looked at this and\nAnd they investigated but because they didn't get a definitive answer the feeling was that they'd taken it as far as as they couldn't what else can you do the other sort of wrote block but they had this is very controversial is they hit a\nCold is a religious rather blog from from some senior people in the Pentagon who frankly for the UFOs and the paranormal with the money and therefore didn't didn't think what we should be having anything to do with it\nWell do do\nWe live well and I mean um\nYou are from the paranormal with him on it and therefore didn't didn't think what we should be having anything to do with it\nWell but do we\nDo we have anything to do it\nI mean it it all started the whatever the it was but I I as I say that there were people in the end again probably still all who cares\nDeeply conservative religious beliefs\nLead them to think that that they are dealing with it they don't make a demonic phenomenon here might come up come up again is this a couple of times in in the u._k. as well at the ministry of defense in fact one of one of my bosses was I'm\nA ... you know they're pretty extreme with this and the the the individual who wrote that the cat to fight intelligence assessment\nOn on UFOs in the ministry of defense\n... name project ... he would have wanted to go go too far down that road he had some slightly old beliefs as well and there's a passage in the Bible\nIn the book if Haitians I think it is where it refers to say as being the print the power of the air and I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious people get the idea that UFOs might be demonic\nYes and there were a lot of religious folks Nick that believe that\n[noise] yeah and\nIt's frustrating in a sense because and and it's almost combing Klee ironic in another way that you know you have a bunch of people in the the the the the IRA elsewhere and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense\nYou got a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon\nAnd we should be investigating yet researching it in a proper scientific manner and we come up against skepticism and you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect um\nBut that skepticism is to the store to Nicole or intellectual a human\nThat skepticism but I think most people I associate with that concept\nIt's actually it's a big probably trying to police driven skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the ... um\nSay that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things at the mall or let's just in one sense it's swapping one on your plate fringe belief for another ... released by\nThese people were skeptical told they would\nBelieve that they would you believe us in some some great Warren having with angels and demons\nNick we're going to take a break we'll come back in ... more right here on coast to coast through you\nKnow you can show up dates with other coups twins when you're doing the ... billion Facebook page just go to Facebook dot com slash goes to the human like button [noise]\nFind out if

close the cultural back with Nick Pope mix do you think at all but the alien presidents appears to have any kind of threat to us as a human species\nWell this is a problem we grapple with the ministry of defense and and if the law to oil\nIn the snow when the ten year program to finally from heavily into the question of whether there is a threat and how could you tell and who should make that assessment and in fact um it it gets quite\nSure between different divisions in the ministry of defense and and some of the the\nThat does make quite amusing reading as as the couch and people are kind of like some of the other people you know who do you think you are to suddenly put yourself into the role of of of an intelligence analyst and you know you know what your job and um\nThe fans and and some of the the\nLetters make quite amusing reading as as the intelligence people are telling some of the other people you know who do you think you are to suddenly\nPut yourself into the role of of of an intelligence analyst and and you know you that's not your job and um what what the intelligence people\nConcluded they they made a a kind of analogy and they said I'm a ... if you don't mind I've actually gone to document in front of\nMe home please give us some ... yeah\nThis is a this actually haven't officially been released\nYet I'm Will be tonight it will like I'm the second them critical question is do you a piece represent a possible threat to the defense of the realm we could argue that assuming for the sake of the argument that something exists\nThey have never shown any hostile attend intent and therefore kennel represent a threat however\nRussian act Croft attempting to penetrate the u._k. I defense reaching in the Cold War never showed hostile intent but they certainly represent a threat though is the only logical conclusion that we can come to is that we do not know if you ate piece represent a threat to the defense of the realm\nAnd so this\nThis gets quite interesting because a part of the the ministry of defense was saying\nTo parliament the media and the public know there's there's no evidence of any threat here we we look at these things to see if that of any defense in ... but no no no threat and yet in ... and they they were classified documents saying well look we just don't know we have not yet made a proper\nAssessment and so we we can't tell\nYou simply can't well what about the alien abduction phenomenon I mean wouldn't that be some kind of\nWhat it would be if\nWe could absolutely say that it's it's physically rail and not not some sort of combination of\nHoaxes and psychological delusions and\nAnd an other misunderstood phenomena the the other thing is of course we don't really know what's going on some of the people who claimed to have had these abduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic and and suddenly researchers like bought Hopkins and type Jacobs\nWhere we're always saying you know this whole style and it's it's a threat on the other hand people like John Mack and and some of the other people who take him on new age and spiritual view of this\nTalk about healing and things like that and it goes back to the idea of who who can really say I mean this\nSounds bizarre but in millet treat 'em there is actually an equation\nFor I'm working out whether this is a threat to our knowledge or rather this this is a kind of them\nWe don't know the values but intelligence some military sickles we say that threat is defined as being a a construct of capability\nPlus intent so so you look at the capability you look at the intent and then you would count whether there's a threat and if there is what ... what kind of a threat it is well we have\nSome idea about the capability of you I pay and and again the the file the ministry defense files state like clearly you know speeds and maneuvers way in excess of anything that we've gone\nSo the capability we we know has a higher value what we don't have any\nIdea about is intent if the if there is an intelligence behind this phenomenon frankly we don't know what it is we don't know what it once we it may be unknowable in the u._k. the astronomer royal so Martin race\nSpeculating about extraterrestrial intelligence and and the gender and motivation said it may be trying to cross to try and figure this out\nHe said it might be ... the analogy would be trying to explain quantum mechanics and the\nWell we don't know what it is we don't know what they want but can you categorically scenic that it's happening\nLike I Can't say that abduction is happening no I don't know that but I mean there's a well\nWhat I can say is that there seems to be strong and credible evidence that you a pay\nOur rail that paid do routinely penetrate are already defense\nRegion um but in the u._k. the U. S. and presumably elsewhere and they are seen by pilots they aren't trying to I'm right on they performed speech and maneuvers\nThat we can't match so in that sense yes this is a real phenomenon and of course we've now seen which brings us back to the tip story we've now seen those declassified videos of of navy F. Eighteen super on its chasing some of these things\nNo matter of fact let's talk about maybe what's your take on\nWell so far we've got three free videos I'm pretty amazing do\nYeah I absolutely I I sat down and watch these things with um\nPilots with I I've actually being in a situation where I live\nI watch these things and been sitting around a table with with a commercial airline pilot and I'm retired military pilots and we've we've ... this around and and nobody's saying this is is fake or anything and of course of course it's it's\nNot um [noise]\nWe don't know again at the I I'm not one of these people you know sometimes I listen to the people being interviewed makeup announcer for everything [laughter] I'm sure you probably interviewed a few of them they don't want to name any names I Hope you will\nWill respect the fight but I'm not afraid to say I don't know\n\nWell they do because you're not a skeptic by any means what are your researcher darn good one is saying that you don't know that's fine with me\nThank you I mean I don't know I think time I'm a skeptic no either I'm only a a ... I'll I'll believe everything kind of person and\nAgain let's be honest there are there are quite a few in this this field I mean we're all real life in my experience of looking at the ... the real real situation is is far more complex than than real or not real and skeptics versus believers\nAnd the idea that there's ever going to be one solution to the U.S mystery is is I think\nYou know crazy I I just don't think it's going to pan out that way but but getting back to your question yeah we've seen those three videos um we know that there are a more videos in science I think will be something that will come over the next\nFew weeks and months there is always the pressure going on behind the scenes to say well come on this doesn't happen in a vacuum these sorts of incidents have been going on for years um we\nYou a question yeah we've seen those three videos um we know that there are a more videos in science I think will be something that will come over the next\nFew weeks and months there is always the pressure going on behind the scenes to say well they come on this doesn't happen in a vacuum these sorts of incidents have been going on for years um we have a number of pilots on the record talking about this there must be\nMany many more videos Lou ... has said that there are other people involved\nIn in Boulder less have set that there are part of course none of these people\nWant to ... the cod or the CIA and and any other agencies involved might decide on this I mean I think if if people start talking about stuff that's genuinely still classified and the government hasn't released those people will end up getting a knock on the door\nWell we've heard that happened before him yeah\nWhere do you think your thoughts are on President Trump's requests for speech for\nWell it's it's it's interesting and it's certainly cause more than a few rumors in conspiracies\nI I guess in one sense I'm not maybe I'm not surprised and maybe I don't think it's going

course it goes back to this this thing that I think a lot of people in this field do no I'm the idea that this phenomenon suddenly started in Nineteen forty seven is of course crazy I mean people have seen strange things in the sky since\nThe dawn of time but I think the other interesting thing about uh this is cool and these these familial\nRecollections is is the fight that you know these these phenomena are always interpreted through the lens of of personal belief system and culture and it is interesting when you come up against couches where where this\nThis thing is is almost commonplace that it's it's like oh yeah you know ... that's the thing we don't necessarily know what it is but yeah it's it's real\n... real let's go to Andy in Norwalk, California now why Andy Glyn\nHi George you're agreeing patron and Mr ... it's a real honor I listen to many times and you're very um [noise]\nInformed and entertaining to listen to a two part question if I may uh first of all a based upon all of your knowledge of um [noise] the western powers all of the needle countries in for that matter let's say the eastern bloc countries ... approximately how many\nAs long as you've been following this how many uh aircraft and uh pilots have disappeared and this guy while pursuing so called UFOs\nAnd are based upon your response I I have a second part a final question if I may okay\nNicky with us yeah sorry I thought you were going to hit me with part two straight away\nWhile we're waiting for that will ... down part one\nI'm now I'm going to sound a little bit skeptical on on this I Would say the answer is less than than a lot of things that I've I've read in in the UFO and alternative belief communities I mean I've seen some\nPeople talk about pilots carrying missing and and your fires and I think\nYou know unfortunately flying is an inherently dangerous\nUm occupational certainly laws in in the early days in a lot of lot of a cough just\nDisappeared because they crashed now now of course then you have\nDo you have some ... cases like a ... ... the ... case he didn't disappear of course but he crashed chasing a UFO which skeptics say with the planet Venus we coming off of cost the fortieth anniversary of arguably the most\nFamous disappearance of all time involving a UFO Frederick for lunch\nAnd Oh yes that was strange isn't it I think we're literally don't use the way in Australia right\nYes I absolutely over the or is it the ... straight I think all the time and straight maybe the bass\nStraight is part of the past month say excuse me I'm geographically challenged in that particular part of the world but um but I I don't buy into the room is that that I've heard the pilots were whip\nXing and disappearing or all the time as a result of of that we had a case in the u._k. tragic case involving a pilot who who just flew his car off into the city in in I think Nineteen\nSeventy it was during a night exercise and some people years later I tried to attribute to us for\nA story on to that but I pulled out the board of inquiry file which was about two inches thick I went through every single paper in not filed and I couldn't couldn't actually substantiate any of these UFO rumors so I think I think the answer the question is is very few\n... do you go ahead and say\nOh okay so the second part question based upon your your response to this uh as you probably know during the Eisenhower administration there were so many aircraft\nThat we're a suddenly a malfunctioning falling out of the skies\nAnd uh yes in some cases just suddenly disappeared that the Eisenhower administration gave the order\nTo a stop to pursue the aggressive pursuit by American aircraft obese UFOs\nOr and secondly I spoke to Dr Heinrich ... before he passed away in Chicago radio station for about a five to seven minutes and I asked them what are the chances of\nA life or not existing on other planets and knocked coming and visiting us um and he said impossible that that was his response impossible so I I appreciate your perspective\nI Do personally believe\nThat they dominate the skies any time and every time that they come a within our airspace there's so many thousands tens of thousands and God only knows maybe millions of years ahead of us they\nCould be entered dimensional they could be ... are both but I don't think we're much of a match and they do have air superiority and [noise] I Do appreciate the honor and pleasure talking to both of you\nAppreciate it will set by the way and and\nAnd he made a really interesting point which goes back to something in the British Intelligence assessment ... and that was a I\nI don't like to call it amusing but ah I it was kind of poignantly amusing maybe the there was a line about the flight safety and safety implications off you ate the suit which goes directly of of course to the point just made and there was a recommendation\nIn ... combines final report and it said I don't have it in front of me but but effectively a pilot's encountering you ate pay should take no action apart from trying to place the object is done in other words you know whatever we dealing with here don't mess with it\nDon't mess with it or we're going to take a break pretty soon it can come back with final phone calls but I also want to talk with you you've been through in cold blood relatives don't you\nYes I Do a

the mold maybe it doesn't quite make the caught or get the coverage\nBut in my experience when people report and it just as when they report UFOs they come in all shapes and sizes\nAll they sure do but you but you're almost saying then that people basically they hear this they hear this and then they think they see it\nYes I think that she plays a big\nPart in this but here again who who can say what um what technology if we are being visited by civilization and let's face it the universe is\nNearly fourteen billion years old imagine what a civilization which you say a million years headstart enough money to be able to do in terms of you know hiding themselves masking that true appearance deception uh it's it's unimaginable\nSo so again I think we're in the ... ... ... we watch what we

we're in in sort of\nStar Trek Tara tree in in one sense of some sort of faster than light travel ... again there are some theoretical physicists working on this sort of thing trying to figure out whether it would be paying\nSpace time whether it would be using wormholes I suspect gravity is going to be the key to this um gravity I guess of all the fundamental ... is the one that we know at

Alex in Rochester New Hampshire and to get things started Hi Alex welcome to the show\nI think you have a question of her new hope um I Hope to preface it with a little bit of a personal experience um I saw a when I Would call a UFO I'm On there for two thousand Thirteen and France's town in New Hampshire but how do you want twenty miles west of a Manchester\nAnd I consider myself a politically and religiously liberal not conservative at all and unclear sober but just had a definite um [noise] really evil vibe who are real I don't I Can't say for certain it was demonic but it really had a very negative by who the whole experience\nVery scary very creepy had a very predatory feel that you believe that it's possible that some of the intelligent extraterrestrial visitors 'em might possibly be eager evil or negative possibly demonic not all of them but maybe some\nWell I again I think it takes us into the territory of water are we dealing with even if we didn't leave some\nSomething real do we really know what it is could can we really\nA scribe human emotion to it the problem with all of this is that we\nCan only come at this from an answer for centuries point of view and we tend\nTo to be kind of you know very black and white I think you know off thinking sometimes we see it in politics we see it in religion you know it's glass half empty glass half full good aliens fan aliens\nAnd and you know one has to wonder does this actually come from whatever it is that you're interacting with what does it come from\nYour own cultural background belief system section may be influenced by by documentaries or science fiction or whatever\nIt it may be I I don't I don't like to take anything off the table I mean I I I tried to be open minded with all of this and\nI think earlier in the show I said that there is unlikely to be one single neat solution to the usa mystery so I think\nYou know when you asked me what might be out there I don't think if there are other civilizations and the cosmos which I certainly believe there are I don't think it's going to be a question you know there's just one of the civilization\nUm therefore you know are they good are they died I suspect\nIf we share this cause most\nWe share it with with a whole bunch of different civilizations which which may have absolutely different points on the moral spectrum if I can call it that um I guess the person's way of saying that would be you know there's probably\nGood aliens outlet but knowing\nI'm actually stick extraterrestrials\nAnd and evil rituals yeah with with the various intentions\nWas no question about it and you know I'm so convinced that in this vast universal bars and maybe even the multi ... that the prime more more you'll shoot next is the same\nWherever you go you're going to have the same elements the same complexity you may have water you may not generally you probably will if you're close enough to you store your son\nYou're going to have things heat up a little bit I think there are millions civilizations throughout the universe the big question is how did it start and you know let's take religion out of it you have to do that for for just a moment\nWhat what do you think was the cause to jumpstart for life\nI have no idea I mean I think it's if if you throw ... nobody knows you know if\nIf you throw the dice trillions and trillions of times eventually maybe it'll it'll come up right but but much smarter people than me\nWith relevant experience in biochemistry and and all related field have have no idea frankly they they have some hypotheses but we

inflamed that race\nI Do not know how we get out of that bubble I because I had Seventy rural\nOn yesterday my colleagues um MSNBC and she agreed with me media has an incentive to very deep and send them to super served their audience and sort of your MSNBC you have a super super incentive to over serve the people in the far left in the uh a progressive agenda one percent two percent you know I'm a a successful cable show\nIf you're on Fox News if you super served the two to three percent of right wing American\nThat watches Fox every night you're never successful show there is really a place for Jamie wind saying\nYeah well so I Do things when I agree with you entirely about the incentive structure and that's the theme of my ...\nAll the cable guessed that have been on line that was good talking to Carlson Don Lemon this very question could you ah if you're gone lemon become a pro Trump figure and keep your audience if your cocker Carlson because you become anti Trump in the\nUh your audience might do they dance around it a little bit um but I think the answer is is obviously now I Wonder if you if you became a you know your ... never Trump or your your audience I think if it would be a very difficult thing I Do think there is an audience for something different I'm actually working on a project to see if\nWe can create something a little bit\nDifferent uh but right now I think the media and kind of structure a is a very negative and it's not only those networks if\nIt's you know uh you know the desire to be first on a lot of stories that are meaningless\nWhich often times that thing this law a says you put out you know false information that's correct that had no one reads the correct information I think there's a whole host of negative media incentives that\nThat are out there or help create this current polar polarized moment um and uh it's a real problem\nThis is self serving but I'll say in any way talk radio in the last place where you can afford to be subtle\nHonestly because I Am twelve segments today and sixty segments a week I can bring on a David Kirkpatrick yesterday from his didn't want to talk about cause show gay and I can

I never Trump\nOr as he was and keep keep his job and maybe they shouldn't be you know maybe you have to serve the audience but those are the structure is I'm sure a came into play with my lab and was thinking about uh whether he continues on a interviewee out of Donald Trump or not it seems like he's thinking of one hundred and eighty degrees yet I I Do think\nThe media incentive structures a run run the gamut everywhere but you're in radio you might might have a better perspective than\nI well I I Do believe you cannot be never Trump and expect to have conservatives listen to you got to be a balls and strikes person and when you've got justice Gorsuch injustice cabinet it's dispositive I had to start with the never Trump or before Justice Kennedy retired\nSaid if we had a retirement and we get another Gorsuch is dispositive you should have voted for Trump and the never Trump or said no it's either it's a silly yes it is a must you come up with a counterfactual where\nA Kennedy doesn't retire if Hillary Clinton put two people on the court the court would have been lost to originalism probably forever as it is to Supreme Court justices twenty nine funeral appeals court justices in southern sixteen million dollars in the defense budget this isn't an argument anymore you can't be a never Trump frame or Kenya Jamie\n...

talking point what is more true\nThan the fact is that the left has descended into\nMobs threatening violence that is so pathetic and so on American if we don't call that out shame on us that is not the American way in fact it is the antithesis of everything we've always stood for and you know what they're going to Stephen Colbert later\nThis book I'm not kidding my book Donald drain the swamp\nI Want it to topple his nasty sour anti Trump fake children's book who's voted this vote or whatever\nThe reason I wrote this book Hugh ... is that the left ... ... is always putting out things into the culture right here's here's a children's book that he wrote which is not a children's book it's nasty no kid would would look at it it is for adults\nTo make fun of the president and to feel morally superior I wrote my book because I thought we don't have things like that\nOn the right for conservatives who want to celebrate what America is who believe Ronald Reagan was a great man I think that we need stuff like that and I get\nVery upset because you just got a tweet from Jamie winds thing ... you know kind of a never Trump Bernie was just on the show earlier and I thought you were coming

you know that I'm even though I'm political I'm not as political as as you and some others I'm mostly a cultural guy I'm In the culture like Steven cold there but conservatives\nDon't we don't really have a voice in the culture right Stephen Colbert has a talk show tons of people like that have talk shows we don't have anybody effectively speaking who have talk shows like that I wrote this children's book because I think our side\nNeeds something that says this is our narrative this is what we think is happening we think he's a folk hero you want to call him a caveman go ahead what he's our caveman and we're actually proud of some of the stuff is getting done\nAnd why don't we why don't we talk about it I mean Steven girl there's not going to have me on the show to talk about it but

I Want to just go back to those documents that that are not what the inspector general you know the ... core documents that a couple of weeks ago Trump order to be declassified right right okay [noise] and then Rosenstein came over the White House immediately\nAnd I didn't go over from what I understand it was a phone call\nOkay but I Want to paraphrase what Rosa same basically I'm a I'm On a truthfully poison roses night they called him up and said look this president\nMyself and my buddies are trying to impeach you put you in jail\nIf you release these documents it's going to prevent us from impeaching your your tail and put you in jail and it's probably going to explode in her face and you weren't going to be a free man so would you not released the because we still working to support your president\nAnd then after Sean after the phone call Trump find out how to do all this stuff about Rosenstein and the stuff that was after the phone call\nWhy wouldn't Trump realize they're trying to impeach them put them in jail college inspector general say get that to the White House sit around the oval office it meant to things released arrest\nFrom my understanding\nIs there being extra super careful that the president still committed to de classification of releasing the the unwritten ... acted buys a warrant these are the main things we need we need the ... the warrant applications one we need the gang of eight material to\nWe need what's known as the thrill twos or the reports\nBruce or especially with his contacts with Christopher Steele because we already know because of some of the leaks and communications that Christopher Steele who\nUnder oath and under threat of perjury\nIn Great Britain and in in Iraq and tore even he couldn't stand by his own\nPony

documents his time to talk to the wall Street Journal but no time to talk to a the members of Congress and and hand over the documents\nSo I understand it's on track\nIt's a little more complicated than him just saying release it release it the second lawyers are on it as just as the latest that I heard my sources but I think I Hope that they get released before the election because I think the American people deserve to see it\nYeah it well they're trying to put them in jail he needs help himself\nWas and I I Will tell you this has been a soft coup attempt\nThere's no doubt about we know is the insurance policy is we know what the league strategy is we know that they knew there was no Russia Trump collusion\nEven in the words of Peter Struck there's no they're they're Lisa Page even saying no we had nothing\nThat's why they started leaking the pony dot CA information all the left wing or is in the news media they never told them that it was on verified are uncorroborated like they never told the ... the courts\nThat it was on verified uncorroborated they tried to lie to us to manipulate us with lies from Russia like Hillary paid for before the election and they tried to

discover the right way forth by reading the greatest books by the greatest minds in history and they learn the meaning of the three ultimate and related things the\nGood the true and the beautiful and I encourage all of you all of my listeners to learn more about this remarkable institution at low vision for Hillsdale dot com that's L. E. V. I. N. for Hillsdale dot com\n[noise] ... the trans followers\nThat in mind behind ... man on Mars love and one of the show [noise]\nBack it is the mark of an Chauvin Ferguson filling in for the great one and I promise he will be back with you next week and we'll hope things down for the next couple of hours here\n... we got a lot of talk about today Donald Trump threatens to call the U.S military to close the southern border as four thousand strong and growing illegal immigrants push to the north\nPresident says US military records or southern border with Mexico officials there don't soon stopped this northward push of a massive migrant caravan Trump warn that amid reports that this is swelling the size of a four thousand people\nThe assaults on our country at our southern border including the criminal elements in drugs pouring in is far more important to me as president than trade or the U. S. M. C. A. hopefully Mexico will stop this onslaught at their northern border all Democrats fault for week laws and I agree with him on that one\nI Will also say that the Republicans need to get their heads out of the river in and actually build the blank wall\nNow we also saw a surge in a legal immigrant crossings in the last month and that's partly due to the fact that there's a lot of people that feel like they need to hurry up and get in here\nIn case Republicans do have a good mid term election Democrats have been saying you know we won't have this wall and vote for us and we want to have compassion which translates into bringing as many illegal immigrants you can well eventually given the right to vote and they're all going to vote for us anyway so we we were in favor of this\nDemocrats want as many illegal immigrants getting this country's they can't because they know that the more they get in here the more illegal immigrants to get into this country\n\nThe better the chances are going to have to give citizenship at some point\nThey're going to have to\nAnd they know it they don't want twelve million illegal immigrants in this country they weren't fifty million because of there's fifty million\nCan't get rid of fifty million people you've got to give them citizenship and whoever gives it to them they're going to vote for\nThat's their plan that's what they want to do\nOne a one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three one thirty eight eleven let me go to a ... I Hope I didn't botch your name you're on the Marco venture Ben Fergus and filling and go ahead\nIt's an honor to speak with you uh I'm so glad that there's a intelligent millennial such as\nYou and and uh John John mirror so here in Green Bay or to take over um I certainly appreciate your books are it's called a my America too\nAnd I'm Glad you grab that\nMuch of an America if this kind of thing has to go on but uh I was going to make about about a year what you're talking about earlier about the journalists\nWere having a hard time hearing you hearing you with the dog so let's see if we can get a better connection in the meantime I Would try to try that again in a moment\nOne eight seven seven three one thirty eight eleven is Donald Trump during the right thing is present to defend the border and say I will say in\nThe military down there to stop this caravan this is what leadership strong leadership looks like Ben Ferguson filling in for the great one we'll be right back [noise]\nAlso of going after those that hire illegals I said for a long time if you want to clean up this country and get rid of illegal immigrants you don't have to deport any of them all you have to do is start seizing hotels restaurants\nCars equipment on job sites when you find people that are working and employing people illegally I agree with you we have a problem with hiring the illegal immigrants but you have a bigger problem\nWith that you believe that these illegal immigrants or somehow not breaking our wall when they come across the border illegally and you act like it's at propaganda when it's not it's fact it is propaganda to treat people like they are doing nothing wrong when in fact they're breaking our laws that is propaganda started\nAnd fortune of all with all these companies that are really the oil how come\nSo let me get a straight Michael why can't we start enforcing the law the way the president wants to do which is ... start enforcing the law at the border so these people don't even have the opportunity to come in this country illegally and then get work illegally why why are you still get that\nWhy you're exactly right with that but when it comes to\nThe federal level all these other constituents there you know the all that money how big is Monsanto\nI I look I don't know how much money they make I don't know why you're keep focusing on one single employer there's there's there's Fifteen million illegal immigrants in this country maybe even more than that I'm giving us a low number\nHere there are thousands tens of thousands of companies you know I'm not I'm not saying you're crazy listen to what I'm saying let's not focus on one employer one person let's focus on the factors tens of thousands of employers in America that employ illegal immigrant labor labor\nI agree it's a problem but if you cut off\nThe flow of the illegal immigrant late ... immigrant labor then that is a great starting point to get this under control why would you ... it's a two part solution I'm In favor of that but when you have four thousand plus people coming to your border right now\nThe president's job and the and they're broadcasting it live on social media\nThey're literally walking with the middle finger to this country saying we don't care about your in laws and were coming into your country and we're going to work in your country and we're going to undercut your wages and we're going to hurt the American worker and there's nothing you can do to stop us and this is how arrogant we are screw you America\nThat is the president's job\nTo make sure that those people are in handcuffs if they cross our border and immediately sent home\nAs far as far as that uh newsprint distorted whatever it is a mile and now is ours rehearsed I wouldn't say I want to go as far as saying that the Democratic party at that rehearsed\nOf course they do Michael I this is all propaganda for the midterms\nThis is all propaganda\nFor the midterms Democrats want to come out and say we love people we love illegal immigrants we Nancy Pelosi the only time she basically gets pissed off as if you were actually advocating\nFor a ... if you are trying to be a law and order president or a law and order congressmen that's about the only time that I'm supposed to be really gets mad at you because she stands up for the illegal immigrant now the American worker she stands up for people to break the law and not be able to abide by the wall\nAnd then she threatens\nPeople when you get in her weight just like she did this week\nDonald Trump without 'em in a minute ago hey download it you know remember when they threw a big party at\nThe White House this is coming from Nancy Pelosi celebrating\nThem passing their bill to get to get protections for people with preexisting conditions I mean she's talking right now about health care to try to move away from the other issue which is she's threatening the American worker the American family with her propaganda which is to give a legal immigrants the ability to come into this country illegally\n\nAnd ... and do that with no repercussions and it's for one reason she desperately need them to be able to vote\nThat is what this is actually about the Democrats are terrified that they're not going to win back the house and Senate and they were gonna do it before they did this character assassination of Brett Kavanaugh and it woke up conservatives who honestly we were kind of a sleep\nWe'd had a big when we think are Donald Trump's doing a good job I maybe I won't worry about voting\nAnd they woke up a bunch of people and I believe without the Brett Kavanaugh character assassination we would have definitely lost his Senate I think now we're headed in the right direction it's not over yet but I think we're at least had in the right direction and Democrats have terrified\nThat they're not going to get the house and Senate and they need new voters in this country because they don't have enough right now to win this thing I mean they want I mean Hillary Clinton lost the Donald Trump you don't think they're freaking\n\n\nGlenn Beck Rush Limbaugh

impact on I Would say almost every one that I Know\nBut one of the most amazing things about that day is the fact that you had a a little girl she was only nine years old when her father who was an MP the officer died while saving as many lives he could from the flaming World Trade center\nOfficer\nRaymond for as was forty five and his partner Marc outlets were posted on the lower east side of the city when they are the two planes had crashed in the building the two police officers didn't hesitate to respond\nThey got a taxi in rush to the same\nAs far as ran into the north tower three times he was able to save in a asthmatic woman as well as a woman who was seven months\nPregnant\nThe cool part is their wrists pictures of the police officer doing this heroic work that are still around today he never return from his third entry into the building the tower collapsed before he could escape\nUm that officer or\nHis safety of his own life ahead a behind the others and went in to protect

there's now is the time for change\nIt's been long enough and changing now will help get people involved people need to be involved where they haven't been involved in the past changing now is to help things move forward in a good direction changing now is to help the community grow in a good direction\nDo you feel that there is a\nProblem with the employee morale\nYes my personally I experienced it walking into the building when I did file as a candidate and I did file again as a write in\nI approached the desk with amazing faces\nThe individual that helped me file um was very polite and if that's not going well within the community as a citizen that can't happen you need to be able to build your team and support what needs to be presented to the community\nUm in your brochure you use you stayed under budget discrepancies I Will review the budget item often to prevent mistakes in of all others in the process and never will override the processors reason\nPerverse are in place but

budget\nI'd written yes there is I mean it was so here's a great example and I ... I participated with a fair in years past do we as citizens no watch each event as making how we've been told that\nUm is there a revenue that keeps it separate so we can say hey this event if not costing areas costing us too much let's cut our losses or is this event make enough money do he knows that different is it important that the public know that yes that's our tax dollars at work\nIs that important that the county commissioners ...\nYes they're the ones that approve it review it and acknowledge it\nCurrently right now or the county commissioners and your mind or are they being made aware\nFrom my knowledge not enough time so after the after the fact OK I'm\nBudget discrepancies any other examples\nIt needs to be posted in a timely manner so it's not combined you don't give

that that's their that's their job and or mental department men to live in and\nAnd you say I Need help with this and they say we're going to have to come back and talk to the other person\nCorrect

have and be helpful be helpful to everybody that walks through the doors be accessible be there and be supportive\nOf other team members and other employees\nRight under budget discrepancies um what would you do to uh to correct that problem\nDo consistent I'm audits the April to review them often and have people involved in them to keep them kosher keeps them compliant\nHave them constantly

community members now that those dial it some of them got them some of them were not correct ballots and they did not receive some of 'em did not receive ... at all\nAnd at the ballot process discrepancy that happened in the primaries was a big effect on I Believe those results who's responsible for the auditors offices responsible to make sure they're out in that you're applying\nCorrect All right and so if there's a problem with the way those are distributed or the way the information is incorrect on them um who's where's the book stuff\nIf ... it would stop me it would stop the clerk auditors office saying who's held responsible\nIn that position would be the person sending that document out then it comes back for review you approve what's been reviewed and approved for it to be printed\nThen it's confirmed that it's to be mailed and you select the date you want that communication to be very open and it needs to be consistent\nFor the community members when are they going to receive their ballot what is going to be in the ballot where what what information is going to be critical to them that it's all coming down to that position okay um the right the ballot\nProcess um is is this is a challenge it is you know a lot of people when they look at the look at their ballot they'll just go vote straight Republican or Democrat or the brain or whatever they want to vote and and they don't really give a lot of of a consideration for the count as a crowd on\nA some do some do and and and some are actually spend a little bit more time\nAh researching the candidate but if they're not aware of the write in candidate I mean sometimes you Donald but it's quite a few votes right right um so how how are people going to remember you to write you on\nSo
