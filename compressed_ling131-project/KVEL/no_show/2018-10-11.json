folk hero you need to watch him when he speaks ... so I watch them on I watched Trump on TV and something happened and I got it I thought wow I've never seen anything quite like this\nI said he really

caves everybody wants to have built by Donald\nUh and so they go to Donald and they see Donald can you help us\nAre they telling us that the situation is as well tomorrow you know I've got some time I'll go down to the swamp and see what's going on so we take a walk down to the swamp encounters a first swamp creature\nA lobbyist tourists and the lobbyists or says ... you don't understand you can't talk to the king the king doesn't talk to people who live outside the swamp he only just be live inside and so I'm so if you want to live in this one maybe we can work something out down says not interested\nI'll see you later so he goes back and tells the cave people he says listen it's worse than we thought were gonna have to get drastic and he said they said what do you mean drastic he says we are going to have to drain the swamp and they kind of get scared like you can't say that don't that don't say that the\nAnd he says I don't know if the only way and if you will how are you going to do it you can get a swamp people angry and he goes well you're angry aren't you and they say yes and he says well maybe it's their turn so the next day he decides I'm going to dig a trench

I wanted to put himself forward he was one of the the initial groups um because he suffered from terrible depression but\nThere was a woman there was staged for cancer Linda and so we\nWe decided to go with her but with had a terrible life he had been a really bright guy in college studying biochemistry wanting to be a doctor\nAnd he got a he got cold and he had a low lottery number in the very last years of the the Vietnam War and they'd done away with drafted for ... for college um college students so he had to go in the last\nHorrible chaotic years of the war and it was so traumatic for him he came back was really depressed and that continued in his life he even even lost the love of his life to fast growing cancer it was just terrible story so by the time he\nHe got to meeting me he had gone to a point of feeling like what's the use and he was living in a senior facility\nYou barely able to get up and make themselves breakfast in the morning really depressed so he does his intention for Linda\nAnd then that the next day he told me he\nWoke up and everything had really changed it was almost like he had this amazing heightened sensory awareness you know the grass is greener than it ever been\nHe drank a cup of herbal tea and knock the socks off he says um but even more amazing was the next night he had this extraordinary vision on a dream almost like a vision where he was\nBack in college and he met his Nineteen year old self\nAnd this then Nineteen year Old West communicated to him in some way it's all going to be okay there's still plenty of time and\nThat experience to him was so life transforming he's a completely different guy now he is\nPower walking Ninety minutes sees lifting\nWeights he's running group says it's at his church he's writing is trying to write again he's doing all kinds of stuff and he had completely given up and that is only one time from being a cinder um and this is a story I hear over and over again we're that act of\nBeing part of this group of being kind of a higher consciousness is life transforming\nWindows shunned or need to have any special abilities\n[noise] well here's the really interesting thing of it you know I again did not believe this I was looking at it from every angle um it took me ten years to even get the courage to write this book\nAnd we should you were the skeptic of all skeptics\nI was I was the ultimate doubting Thomas because as I said I I started the intention experiments because I wasn't I wasn't really sure about all of this you know manifestation law attraction I didn't I wasn't sure I believed it\nAnd I wanted to find out how far can you take it you know are we talking about the shifting a quantum particle are we talking about curing cancer here so um that's what I set up the intention experiments but I never\nI never thought these little groups we'd have the power\n... ... a manifestation law attraction I didn't I wasn't sure I believed it and I wanted to find out how far can you take it you know we talking about the shifting a quantum particles are we talking about curing cancer here so um that's one set up the intention experiments but I never\nI never thought these little groups would have the power but the thing that's so interesting is I had a life university is the largest chiropractic university I'm In\nThe world and they offered to do studies of the power to let their neural science department look at this so we set up a group of students and\nWe put a ... camp to measure the brain waves of\nEach one person one sender in each of the groups and\nWhat we found was so amazing that within a few minutes they\nWould have this completely different\nBrainwave signature it would turn off all the part of the power of a group would have a quieting of all the parts of the brain that makes us feel separate and also the parts of the brain that make us\nHave worried doubt negativity so these are basically brainwave signatures of somebody who's feeling a sense of ecstatic one and when we compared these signatures when the scientists who work at the doctors said Stephanie Sylvan\nUm we looked at\nOther things like the work of the University of Pennsylvania looking at the masters and and and Buddhist monk and ecstatic prayer they had an identical brainwave signature but the only difference was\nI had you know it takes years

effort to make things happen\n[noise] well that was the interesting thing about this\nNo it doesn't I think would it take is meeting regularly it it takes some technique and you know in my book the power of eight I've got all the techniques that people have to to follow to become a really good in tender\nAnd also to intend well in a group but for me the thing the real key element is\nCreating a little group of eight or so and you asked before\nYeah they have to be eight no fiber work\nEleven or work you know eight it's kind of a Goldilocks figure you know it's like the not too big not too little um but what's really important is meeting week after week after week and I found that after I'm putting people\nAnd you asked before he does it have to be eight no five all work\nEleven to work you know age is kind of a Goldilocks figure you know it's like the not too big not too little um but what's really important is meeting week after week after week and I found that after\nI'm putting people in groups in twenty Fifteen I wanted to do my own experiment because I wanted to see if everything in their lives would begin to heal not just their health\nSo I got a group of two hundred and fifty together and have them you know I taught them for a while and then I put them in groups of eight or so and had the meat every week for a whole year and\nIt was extraordinary of the\nPeople who continued to meet regularly you know every week and that was about a hundred and fifty of them pretty much a hundred percent of them had major life changing experience is so it wasn't just their health you know they got financial wind falls\nOr they got amazing new careers or they made up with this strange relatives or you know they got a great new house just the one they wanted um just came out of nowhere or they found a new life purpose but and pretty much everybody had extraordinary stories to tell\nOur or are you sure that this works um primarily from CU wars are showing your\n[noise] well I think there's a science in the sense that um we did that brainwaves study and we found that you know there are major brain changes that go on when you do intention of\nIn a group called ... group prayer in a way I'm In a sense that's what it is it's kind of secular prayer because you have these major changes\nWhich are really very\nVery much similar\nTo somebody having a mystical state you know somebody having a mystical experience people get changed during those kinds of experiences and they allow themselves to be open to a lot of possibilities or they suddenly feel you know something\nMajor his change all their senses are heightened um they feel really optimistic about their future\nAnd so in a way that starts to pave the way if you want to just look at what happens to the individual that paved the way for major changes and and possibilities but there's something more there's a\nBigger piece of this George that\nAnd believe me I'm trying to figure out what is it is a group of fact you know is it just the power of intention but a big piece of this is the power of altruism\nUm that was the big surprise for me because remember this Sanders we're having amazing affects to healing effects and when I started looking into um\nThe science of altruism it's extraordinary I mean people who do stuff for other people\nNo matter how small live longer are happier are healthier in every regard and that's what we found in a lot of our intention groups I mean when I talk about that group in twenty Fifteen and I was studying for a whole year\nI'm One of the people you know there were a couple of people that weren't getting anywhere you know one of them was a woman called Andy and Andy\nWas going through a divorce and she had two small kids she needed a new job and she was very talented in marketing and coaching and she just couldn't get anything you know young woman just couldn't get anything and she was just trying everything and\nWe talked with her and tried to work with her and this and that are group tried to work with her and finally I was a bit frustrated by it and I just said oh Andy get off of yourself start intending for someone else and she was one of the people who was intending for that young boy Luke\nAnd the moment she did that she gets a coal out of the blue from somebody offering her a dream job so can I tell you any everything about how this works\nYou're absolutely not [laughter]\nThere's a complete X factor here I don't understand but there is something about that power of getting off for yourself and doing for someone else that seems to get a reward for you\nBut you're convinced that work [noise] aren't you\nI Am convinced it works I watch it as I say I sort of look at it almost like a scientist I've looked at\nStudying groups over years\nUm you know I've run I run these year long master classes and I'm I'm actually evaluating what's happening to people they're filling out forms every month to say what's changed in their lives\nAnd you know we've done the brain studies were gonna do immune systems studies um and just seeing what happens in groups right in front of me you know I Know it works\nOr their mothers summer women don't get results in the ...\nWell I think it's the people who don't come regularly um sometimes it's nothing to do with skepticism that's the interesting thing too I gave a talk once in in Denver last last year\nAnd there was a woman who had really bad arthritis and she was a total skeptic and she got healed right away right there and um you know we've had\nPeople like that who haven't who were a little skeptical really didn't you know sought to themselves yeah right and they had some healing doesn't mean everybody in an audience gets healed\nBut a lot of them you know there's enough\nTo say something really interesting is going on here\nAnd are you interested in the human because it's easier to track in terms of the ...\nOh you mean a physical healing well yeah because it's easy to ... you know somebody had a condition they don't have the conditions are we\nHad a woman was staged for cancer I talked about earlier and she's now you know down to normal numbers

away from it any more if we see something wrong and I really thought the the attack on cabin on his family was so desperately wrong um\nWe had it was hard out a you broadcast forty three years you know every two and four years if you're conservative or Republican you're a racist or sexist you want to kill children you weren't granted to but to go with a clip the Ohio by Paul Ryan look alike

hundred and fifty billion dollars in cargo planes in cash and other currencies\nOn the tarmac of radical mothers that chant death to Israel death to America that to me is modern day appeasement\nWell you have a you have a world that sharply divided in what is considered good and evil um and and killing the ss really brings it home you're either going to be a person who fights against evil or not\nBecause some of the people who help these ss people get away after the war we're talking a Red Cross we're talking elements of the Catholic Church we're talking elements of the CIA helped\nHelped Eichmann mango a Mormon and Barbie get away and and you have to be able to distinguish in your own life\nEverybody listening to us right now what is really evil let me give me a real small thing you might have talked about it it was a writer there is a writer for cold there who put out a tweet that said yeah even though Kavanaugh is confirmed at least we destroyed his life you saw that right\nI did but I talked a lot about it was horrible we carry the man's wife\nThat is an evil statement yep now that statement could not happen from Sean Hannity's crew or bill O'Reilly's crew it couldn't happen because of anybody did that working for us they wouldn't be working for us much smarter would that\nNo not at all did anything happen to the writer for cold there nothing\nOkay so now you're starting to crystallize there are Americans apparently like Steven cold there who don't really care if they're members of their crew are trying to destroy other human beings doesn't really bother them very much\nBill here's what scares me about the process we live through every two and four years\nAnd I say this is somebody that really the my heart of hearts you know I'm a blue collar guy like you from Long Island and I just want the the good blessings in my life I Want an opportunity for every man woman and child and you're the only way you're going to do that is that get government out of the way and let people do what they were born to do\nAnd I I look around me and I'm I'm listening every two and four years and then judge Kavanaugh on Robert Bork and\nAnd I'm thinking this this this we've got to be better than rushing to judgment they did it wouldn't do Blue Cross they rush to judgment of burgers and they did it in in Baltimore they did it in Cambridge\nWe've got to be better than just abandoning core constitutional fundamental issues like due process and presumption of innocence\nThere's more to it though the new element in this that you and I didn't have to deal with in

this was an organized thing\nThat if they couldn't get him before the confirmation on merit they're going to destroy him personally\nIt was organized you would have seen it and I have seen it we've seen boycott sprang up we've seen demonstrations spontaneous we've seen a woman in an elevator with a CNN camera brow beat Senator Flake\nWho is that woman she working for a saw organization making a hundred and Seventy five thousand dollars a year\nDid anybody report that so there is a step up this is a step up and the Americans are largely ignorant of what's happening\nWell let me ask you this we've got an electorate and twenty six days what is the impact of all this going to be I don't know it\nDepends on the awareness of people but if you look back into Nineteen thirty to Nineteen thirty six this is very similar to what happened in Germany\nGood people in Germany good Germans want a way\nThey did not confront the evil that was coming at them and I'm put forth you in America we have a

sense of normalcy of what this country is all about I mean I remember when Reagan was in office the Democratic\nWay they would say is that when Newt Gingrich came to power every member was right after the the Clinton ... go they tried to do socialized medicine didn't work out you know Republicans when they took power Clinton was more than enough and I think through the advice of people like Dick

was more at a political necessity than any any principles that that he held deeply liberalism\nIs they failed law the ideology that never work it seems\nGreat on paper free health care free did they

have to be able to get\nTheir hobby that's so personal relationships and excel if you're an adult and you're sitting with our phone next to your bed at night you wake up for ... keeps you up in the

are in social media what kids are doing all these sites it's all very overwhelming and your\nKids have to remember that relationships are requiring that all the values that we value I'm not going to

conversations that basically said that welfare of the reason why a lot of black people end up being a Democrat they say you know first of all it it it to a limited amount of jobs are so the the father's lose their jobs and they say\nWe'll give you more money for having more kids in your home and then we got rid of the mental health Institute in the eighties and nineties and the prisoner

like because he was a powerful black man with a lot of talent who was challenging a white president United States of America who clearly doesn't like black people\nBut now oh\nNow you're just a black dude didn't read Kanye West met with Trump in the oval office he also talked about his childhood and when he was growing up\nNow again this is the ... there's the new line is the president is taking advantage of a mentally ill white man and exporting that black man as a token black man\nOf his racist White House that's the new wind that we've seen come out in the last half hour Kanye West as a black man that can't thing for himself\nAnd and clearly the only reason why things for himself was because he has a mental issue and so then the ... the United states of America is abusing this black man and I guess the Democrats saying we need to bring you back to the plantation to the mental hospital right\nThat's what we got to do\nThat helps you to\nFear of what it has the power of you know\nMy I I work and he said that he does he's talking about how to make America great again how he's at my own friends tried to bully me people to come after me they attacked me they threaten me\nAnd in a way it gives me power to where the ... of course now that definitely means that he is a negro the day they can't read or doesn't read I guess it's 'cause it's even more insulting if you say the nigger that doesn't really tell you what happened when they grow don't read there it is yes yes that's what it is\nHe talks about how he explains that he likes wearing the make America great again hats he understands that America should be something we should be proud of that we should say that for the African American job unemployment rates all the time was very good thing that was the last administration was doing was clearly\nNot working but Donald Trump now what a what a terrible person he is exporting this man\nHe is exporting him he is exporting him and he's using him and he's a terrible person it's a disgrace what they're doing one eight seven seven three eight one\nBut Donald Trump now what a what a terrible person he has a boarding this man\nHe is exporting and he is exporting him and he's using him and he's a terrible person it's a disgrace what they're doing one eight seven seven three eight one thirty\nEight eleven been progress in filling in for the great when Marco then uh let me go to Scott thanks for wedding you are on the mark of and show hello\nHow are you doing buddy doing well sir you know it it's a shame because all over the TV today and I'm In Staten Island New York which is you know it's it's I Would say it's probably about\nNinety percent Trump world right here in Staten Island uh but the rest of New York is terrible but I'm watching TV and every place ... belittling this kid\nA disease on not on his medicine that it's horrible it's going against the African Americans um you can't get a break or it's just it's despicable with I don't think I Know because Trump and it's it's horrible but these people do\nIt this is this is the public shaming and the assault which is exactly what he's explain what explains so well\nI mean you you will get the last week you bet to celebrities that have gotten into politics right you had you had Taylor Swift who comes out for a Democrat and says she's terrified of Congress woman running for Senate in Tennessee Marsha Blackburn and it terrifies her what would she what she would do\nIf she got elected to the U.S Senate and Democrats came out and said this is a brave independent\nWoman they threw down the woman card right this is a witness that brave independent woman she's brave she's a role model every woman should've should've should look at her and teach your children\nAnd your little ... daughters and your and your grandkids to be like hey we're thought because this is what a stronger braver role model of a woman looks like then telling you what comes out for Donald Trump and now he's a token negro that doesn't read\nHe's mentally ill he's an Uncle Tom\nTerrible and and and the things that these guys they say about it it's really really I mean it's unbelievable it's like they want to put in a they want to institutionalize the guy no\nRight no they they want to kidnap him and they want to bring it back to the to the plantation of the Democratic party and then lock him up in solitary confinement\nAnd their mental ward so they can control the black man because right now they can't control and then when they can't control a black man who's who's speaking truth to the world they'll tell you they'll undermined you and say\nYou're mentally and saying\nYou're mentally insane got blessed are good to\nTalk to you my friend ... filling in for Marco then a lot more

their owners you saw that on TV\nAnd it's nuts and and my question to the American people is at what point are we going to say enough is enough let's stop this let's be done and let's wipe this recon slate clean\nWell I I'm waiting for the the the Democrats to say that socialist Alexander Cortez um\nWho claimed the electoral college as an institution that has its roots in slavery and by the way the Democratic party has its roots in slavery so\nI'm just curious are we going to eliminate the Democratic party as well because the Democratic party has its roots in slavery but this is a woman that literally claims electro college is an institution that we should abolished because it has its roots in slavery just like the party that she's a part of and this is also a woman who came out and said\nThat she is going to be integrated [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nI'm waiting for a Democrat to say this is what happens when you don't read the constitution when you don't understand how the country works and when you don't understand how the world works this is what you look like\nNew ... thank you sir nice to talk to you appreciate the phone call one eight seven seven three eight

don't understand how the world works this is what you look like\nNew ...\nThank you sir nice to talk to you appreciate the phone call one eight seven seven three one thirty eight eleven let me go to Tony you're on the bench Ferguson show a calling in from Caroline nice\nTo have you with us I should say I ... I met them articles and show it's a it's a habit of mine who's my own show sorry about that go ahead\nI ride service for that kind of rats and travel got to get it because you got to have to drink like ... ... inch rather have a little travel a lot of phone\nI write to me what kind of wrestling concerns are too low\nGrade and forget that we've spent about we have to do a lot of doctors directly with what I found my father had in line\nWhat they had a liar world Wide Web declaration\nOr one of the ... de la ... LIE with why we're conscious which would be God they don't care what religion as long as the people that's the word God for that price tag early on by killing so\nA lot how little kitten which would have been the um\nWhatever that means that the global skates but what if it were a little over the last\nGroup like the Democrats tend to laugh so hard to say was that kind of the\nWell it was real it was wrong it was an scripted and and and I you know where where the Democrats probably way last week saying that NBC or an insider y the terrible thing by putting a mentally unfit man on the TV show exporting his popularity\nOr that there were there were nowhere to be found were they last week nowhere to be found\nMe last week was the week that they should have been out there saying how dare you take advantage of Kanye NBC Saturday Night live how dare you put him on stage and his mental state 'cause that's what they're saying today\nI didn't see anybody at NBC News saying this is what happens when it when when a negro doesn't read we take them on Saturday Night live Saturday Night live I tell you that's what happens\nYou know you you this is this is what you need to understand this is you know you're an educated ignorance\nPool tell you what is what happens when they grow don't read there it is\n\nYou just don't read you don't agree with us we will try to destroy your life and say you need to be in a mental hospital ed you're on the market then show than Ferguson would you go ahead\n[noise] hey man this is ed from Minnesota just south of the city's listen as an African American I'm really really just disgusted by what the Democrats did\nI shouldn't be surprised because this is their play but see I like Tania it used to be you know democratic a party believer until I fell off the Democratic plantation just probably three years ago\nGee it's we don't think in the black community like they want us to think when Tom where a sellout\nWere or whatever they want to call us we don't think we can't read well I can read and I understand I understand exactly what's going on what's going on here is when we don't do what they say they will do whatever they can to be a little less to destroy it to try to\nUh to make whatever it is that we have to say\nAnd and make it small I support the president I like what he's doing I liked the fact that I'm African American unemployment is as low as it's ever been\nPretty much I like the fact that we have jobs in our community the nation is driving\nAnd I don't like what the Democrats are so\n...\nWhere I work at the Democrats and I'm like what are they selling and and I didn't I didn't talk about this the other day\nUm with some college kids and I said All right what is it the Democratic party can run on this time\n... they they they can't run on the economy being bad right 'cause they're using the party of doom and gloom they can't run on health care they can't run on unemployment they can't run on on race or an African Americans being left behind or Hispanics being left behind\nSo they have to make it personal\nAnd the way you make it personal is anyone that you don't like you turn them into a racist for a gang rape is Brett Kavanaugh you you turn them into a mental a ... a mentally insane person Kanye West\nYou you turn Donald Trump into some sort of unhinged individual that out of control and can't be trusted with nuclear codes or the economy but you can't say economy anymore because the economy is killing it\nAnd so what you do is the only thing you can run on this time\nIt because you can't fear among right it's hard to fear mongering country into saying you must smoke for us because we're going to make the economy better that doesn't work the economy's killing it right now and everybody knows that you can't you so so the only thing you do is you have to undermine the legitimacy of the person\nYou have to undermine the legitimacy of Marsha Blackburn intent in Tennessee by the way the Taylor Swift it you know she terrifies me I cannot imagine thought\nA it scares me and makes me want to get in a fetal position because she couldn't attack on the issue so you have to pack or on the\nI'm I'm afraid of view you you you attack the president the same way you say that well the president's really not in charge this country's the Russians and they looted together and we're going to sell that until we can't sell anymore anymore and this man needs to be impeached\nAnd then you do the same thing with Tanya and then you don't like the fact that Brett Kavanaugh was on the Supreme Court so you scream and yell and you'd throw things at center at home than you surround them at dinner and you and you looked like an angry mob and then you say it's ... it's it's unfair to call this a mob that we are not an angry mob but you are an angry mob and you are\nA scary person and I should be afraid of you and everybody else should be afraid of you know that's what they're running on their running on personal attacks and emotion because there's not a single issue\nThat that the Democratic party can run on right now that they can win on you I mean the main core issues you can't tell us we're in an unjust war and innocent people are dying and we need to come home because we're not in a big war right right right they had\nThat they had that for years that they ran on you know you want to get to that you want to stop spending all this tax money Iraq Afghanistan you want to give kids a good education and you want to stop spending money on defense and start seeing these poor boys over to be killed and these women to be killed and since most wars you don't have that this time\nRight you're totally right that the playboy kids make it personal\nUndermined the individual turn the individual into a scary scary person Brett Kavanaugh's re here's my\nQuestion to you here's my question to you in ... interrupted no go ahead what we do\nWe're boys over to be killed in these women to be killed and senseless wars you don't have that this time\nRight you're right\nThat the playbook is make it personal undermined the individual turn the individual into a scary scary person Brett Kavanaugh as it re here's my question\nTo you here's my question to use for interrupting regret what we do conservatives and especially if African Americans in your opinion to try to stem the tide rock I said\nWell it was Democrats Democrats I Do believe would have taken control of the Senate if it wasn't for them over playing their hand with Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I think Democrats are angry they're inspired they're furious and they realize it another four years of a Donald Trump being president\nCould destroy the Democratic party as we know because if you have an economy that's doing this well and it keeps doing well and you have trade agreements are being changed and you have American Jobs coming back and you have when when employment numbers it's extremely hard to beat that person\nThey are terrified but what what I Will say this that we have to go out there and vote and not sit at home and be passive\nAnd I think the Brett Kavanaugh is what's going to wake up a lot of Republicans who say that character assassination that character assassination of a good man trying to turn them into the worst thing you can call them and when there's only there's only one thing you could do that would have been worse\nSaid he's a child rapist that's it right it's child rapist and rapists\nAnd they went all in against Brett Kavanaugh and ... and he was collateral damage it wasn't

had to use my gun to protect myself\nI've had a significant number of legitimate death threats I've had people that come after me and my family um that is the intolerant left they will come after you with everything they have\nA ... and and there are no rules anymore and and and Brett Kavanaugh's proof of that when I say there's no rules anymore\nWhat they did to Brett Kavanaugh what they tried to do to Brett Kavanaugh by saying every\nDay every day it was something else well he's you know he he he didn't write me but but he planned rate so then he was he was involved and gang writes we didn't game right me but he was playing the parties the gang raped me well then I think it was a gang rape is any drinking college any drink in college I think your game right people in college\nOr a sexually assaulted me we didn't actually sounds to me but he might have been the room when other sexually assaulted me\nThat's what's scary affect your bills or for somebody like Brett Kavanaugh he was the perfect drama I mean this book is probably the best American claim of a person over I'll bet on a high school or college and then\nI I don't think it will have to say I think he was probably a jock who was the captain of teams to drink and party with his friends and that doesn't mean that you're a rapist yeah\nYou know and and and today it was interesting 'cause on the view today they were having a conversation about this and you want to talk about mob mentality or and and and I we I appreciate the phone call but they were talking about this mob mentality Abby Huntsman or was defending Maloney as\nMe to comment saying call for evidence and and the view show ... loaded around her\nMaloney Trump talked about the me too movement and she said you know in this exclusive interview with ABC News\nThat she stood with women and the me too movement but added quote that we need to have really hard evidence that if you're accused of something show the evidence you cannot just say to somebody you know I was sexually assaulted or you did that to me because sometimes\nShe said the media goes too far and away they portrayed some stories it's not correct It's not right and I agree with millennia well you know the view of course took on Trump's comments and and sunny house then\nTook a swipe at Trump claiming that the first lady was telling women everywhere your\nWord is not enough um that's that's not true I mean it's\nI Can't support the me too movement while also saying that we need to make sure that the me too movement is held to a level of accountability that our court system says is that is adequate and correct that you must have\nEvidence you can't just destroy someone's life you don't believe me look at the kid whose parents are now suing a five high school students who are falsely accused their\nSon of sexually assaulting them destroyed is live destroyed his friendships destroyed his entire life they everybody is walking around saying and then they finally recanted their stories and they're suing as they should\n\nThere are people you know there was a star football player recently there was a ... a film I think it was on HBO down about him\nHe went went to prison missed out on the best years of his career because he was falsely accused of raping a girl and it came out that they finally that he didn't rape her\n\nWe should believe in the presumption of innocence over guilt but the mob guilt but the mob mentality of the left is if you are a woman you must be believe no matter what and the man is guilty automatically\n\nUntil he proves

still going Democrats are saying elect us to one of the houses put us in charge of the houses or the Senate and we will impeach Brett Kavanaugh\nNot based on facts based on emotions in a mob mentality based on the fact that got nothing else to run on so let's turn every Republicans into a racist or\nSexist sexual assault individual turn them into a gang rape is that's what you gotta do to turn them into that\nTurn them into that\nOne eight seven seven\nThree eight one thirty eight eleven one eight seven seven three eight one thirty eight eleven when they go to Steve thinks they're waiting you're
