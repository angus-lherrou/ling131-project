another another matter in this regard my original column that this ... this chart should have been ignored it was right on about the only one to the best of my knowledge riding on this in the national

the McCarthy Era\n\nWhen innocent people are accused of trying to overthrow the government and have their lives ruined based on false accusations won't being denied old semblance\nSemblance of due process or fairness the American civil liberties union the strong against McCarthyism for demanding due process by demanding due process and hard evidence\nBut the ACLU now argues that quote

and McCarthy was not for for being irresponsible for smearing people who were innocent but simply because he was on the right\nThe left is allowed to do exactly what they oppose what they claim to oppose\n\nThis is a very very bad moments in American Life\nDays before your your your folks they bring up a high school charge they used before I said it should've\nBeen ignored I could have been

refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate that\nI Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee nor nor do I believe that there's

the legal world all you need is the ... I think in the ... from not mistaken in civil suits the preponderance of evidence standard that's different from beyond reasonable doubt just ... there but it doesn't even meet the preponderance of evidence\n\nIt's a very dark day in America it's a very dark day because the ... there's an entire\nPortion of this country the left that does not believe in moral norms they acknowledge it ... oh if you put them if you do you believe in moral norms oh of course of course but some yeah where are they from their their from them their moral norms are left this moral norms\nWhy did they have such contempt for vice president Mike Pence\nMike ...

which we elect presidents the only way to change that is a constitutional amendment\nAnd it won't you know why\nBecause under our constitution in order to change the constitution you need three quarters of the state legislatures to go along with a change\nAnd there are more than Thirteen states and that's all it would take that are small enough that they would lose a lot of cloud of the electoral college went away I mean right now in New Hampshire is a very important state New Hampshire has only four electoral votes\nBut those four electoral votes and close elections really count people go to New Hampshire not just because the New Hampshire primary states like Wisconsin Wisconsin's Tana life robots\nAnd uh people go to Wisconsin and part of the genius of the federal system is meaning it is I mean that you need to win not a majority of the wrong popular vote but amen\nStates like Wisconsin Wisconsin's ten electoral votes and people go to Wisconsin and part of the\nGenius of the federal system is meaning it is I mean that you need to win\nNot a majority of the wrong popular vote but a majority of the various states which have their independent existence\nAnd look\nThat does a now those states are are weighted not one vote per each\nState but they are awaited according to population\nAnd so it's worked out for two hundred and forty years the the idea that that is what this protest is really about what the protest really is about is just to stereo on the left about losing some of the dictatorial power\nThat had been assumed by activists on the Supreme Court let's\nGo to your calls and to Tammy in Marietta, Georgia you're on the ... that show it's disagreement day\nHi I have a how are you I'm well I have a\nGay man a disagreement a disagreement if you talk about um several weeks ago\nBut my statement is why it is so passionate about this particular man it's almost like issue or nephew and you just so angry that people don't believe him or that is you know possible that he could have violated this lady and he's very possible that he could have done is not\nJust lying about it but if I said it is particularly man doesn't get confine\nIt's almost like it'll break your heart you just so angry that people are angry about it I don't understand why this particular man I mean Daniel Schorr even overturn roe v way but you sure that have gone to abolish devoting right 'cause that's that's what people are passionate about you know that more conservative\nOkay let me I Will I Will answer that in a moment but I Want to let you finish you had another disagreement and I will answer your question very directly coming right up but go ahead what's your other disagreement Tammy\nThis agreement with a few weeks ago you were talking about\nOh I think I don't know what it was a young black man it said he felt unsafe and I'm a white neighborhood\nAnd that does make you mad that someone would make that statement and you're trying to convince you say oh true it's true but you don't know how this young man field in a quiet neighborhood of ... any feel unsafe every white neighborhood is not safe\nThat's absolutely true you're right I Am but ... what he was saying is that he feels unsafe in any white neighborhood not just that he feels unsafe and specific white neighborhood which can be crime ridden\nThe point that I was making was that it you know that there is one of the things that is appalling in this country and that we need to continue to make progress on we've made some progress\nIs the high rate of crime against black people but nearly all of that crime nearly all of it or the overwhelming majority and it's over Ninety percent is perpetrated by other black people and that was the reason that I was speaking about that now let me go to your point about judge Kavanaugh\nDo I know that he is telling the truth uh in in terms of his denials about what happened allegedly to Dr Ford I don't know for certain diseases telling the truth\nBut I think the absence of any confirming evidence\nAt all is overwhelming\nAnd the whole way that her accusations against him came out or very suspect\nAnd ... and by the way it is impossible to remove this from a political context and the reason I feel so outraged about judge Kavanaugh is he really did appear to be the ideal nominee I don't know and I've never met him\nBut I Do know people have worked with him closely and they have the highest regard for him including people who are on the uh left 'em ... who was a guest on this show recently is a professor of law at Yale who has had interaction with a a judge Kavanaugh in the classroom and otherwise\nAnd he's a liberal he was very active in the Hillary Clinton campaign he strongly supports judge Kavanaugh's nomination\nAnd the notion that he should\nBe blocked from the Supreme Court based on on early unsupported unprecedented\nAccusations against him seems to me a profound wrong because one of the things that you know about people who were sexual predators real sexual predators and people who commit sexual assault and rape and and uh and violence against women\nMost of those people do it as a pattern it's not a one off\nAnd the idea that the other accusations against a judge Kavanaugh other than a Dr Ford are completely non credible and have been clearly denied or that I think it's worth taking into consideration upcoming a [noise]\nA a very prominent Republican\nSpeaks to a group of protesters happened to be women\nAnd he urges those women to grow up is that an outrage we'll play the shocking audio and more coming up on disagreement day on the ... that show one eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six is our phone number\nBut why not express compassion for somebody in

Norway and put a chemical fungicides al because\nThose don't work very well and they're very very toxic the reason I don't work very well is that they kill the beneficial microbes as efficiently or more efficiently than they kill the um the pathogens what kind of grass do you have a yeah blue grass fed skewer a mixture\n[laughter] that's a good question brass grass K ... it's ...\nThe three ...
