president now says that he has dispatched his secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Saudi Arabia immediately\nTo discuss what's been going on here and it gets almost more bizarre by the sec and now\nThe allegation has banned the Saudi ... crown prince ordered the killing\nOf this guy Jamal ... now he's a Saudi national who's been critical of the Saudi royal families Washington Post contributor and he's a U.S resident but he's not a citizen he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nTurkey October the second he hasn't been seen by anybody since that day\nThe Turkish government had suggested that to show that he was killed by a Fifteen member Saudi his team who then dismembered his body and smuggled out and\nOf the consulate in pieces to an unknown destination but so far the evidence supporting that up to today is been heroes some reports claiming that could show these murder was recorded but to date and audiotape know videotape not even the Turkish government which is no great friend of America is currently feuding with Saudi Arabia over other issues\nSaying an absolute saying it's absolutely short because ... was killed by anyone they can't say it let alone the Saudis now there's just began to break moments ago\nAnd a reports of now surface that Saudi Arabia is preparing a report in which in fact they will admit Jamal ... show he this was the Washington Post columnist now this is a very dangerous we start seeing journalists killed\nWent missing earlier this month was killed by interrogation gone wrong um when he entered the I guess the Saudi consulate in Istanbul right here to talk about it\nA report and which in fact they will admit Jamal ... show he this was the Washington Post homeless now this is a very dangerous we started seeing journalist killed went missing earlier this month was killed by interrogation gone wrong\nUm when he entered the against the Saudi consulate in Istanbul\nRight here to talk about it we have Morgan Ortega's is with us national security global affairs analysts former U.S treasury attach to Saudi Arabia lived in Saudi Arabia two years\nOr she along with ... former Secret Service agent author as well as the now best selling book a Spygate thank you both for being with us um Oregon you lived in Saudi Arabia two years is just breaking this has been a mystery up until like an hour ago what do you think\nRight [noise] yeah yes I Lived there for most it doesn't ten and eleven I anticipate it something like this breaking and the reason I did it because when the president said this morning that he's sending secretary palm pay to Saudi Arabia that made the secretary of state when it did these people in the world\nCertainly in the government has canceled all the plans to fly halfway around the world\nUm I I Do is incredibly serious done and not to say\nAh we're we're going to be under tremendous pressure to come clean with whatever it is so if the report to keep it believed and we're still going to have to just if if the records are out there as well what comes out or is that the Saudis are claiming some sort of responsibility for this looks like they're not going to they're going to claim that senior leadership was not involved\nBut that people are in charge of it in order to be held accountable there's a lot\nTo how was your does know until now because it shows how would they not know until now or what had happened in their consulate in Istanbul\nThat just didn't have to question and I think the big takeaway that I heard from this report we'll see what happens but secretary and pay me to them and let the readout as it does not only need to to come clean on this and satisfy President Trump the secretary um pail you know they also have an audience and the and the Congress the Senate that they're also accountable to\nMind you this massive arms deal is a memorandum of understanding it has not been signed by the president\nThere's bipartisan consensus for sanctions people like Rand Paul have actually been very locally um an supportive of the relationship I don't agree with Senator Paul for a number of reasons that I could go into\nWhy I think the relationship it is important but the Saudis need to understand how serious it is\nWe need to know who's going to be held accountable and I think that they're going to continue to see massive\nA movement away from their big finance form it's just a few weeks secretary that do justice to be there we saw the Dow fell off this afternoon as reports\nIt while they were threatening stake here yeah well they were threatening you know maybe even using\nThe power of their oil of impact any of the there was a price to pay or any retribution from the U.S then bonds you know I mean is getting more bizarre by the men and how to somebody in this particular case walk into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and never get seen again\n[noise] [noise] yeah that that's highly unlikely show they're really two aggravating factors here when you already brought up the fact that this happened I'm\nIn a consulate I'm a diplomatic facility that that is I mean that breaks every single a protocol moral ethical rule imaginable\nSecondly Sean uh aggravating as well and you know aggravating is is probably enormous enormous understatement here is that he was a member of the media and I think this is ever permissible please I'm not saying I'm just suggesting that this makes it even worse on the scale of Savage read the fact that this individual offers so he was a member of the media makes it even worse\nNow how could it happen in the diplomatic facility like that without a higher ups somehow knowing\nIt's highly unlikely but having said that you know there's there's two sides of this there's a sign that said wait back let's see let's get the facts looks like some of the facts are starting to come out now but we do need the Saudis there's this is not a ... as simple as a black and white\nSituation we do need the Saudis the relationship with the Israelis are starting to improve we need them were on a razors edge with the Iranians of their nuclear program so this has to be viewed that way and I do think Trump gets that one more thing or something I I think the Saudis did screw up big time when they\nSeemingly tried to make these veil threats that they were going to respond you know we were supposed to be responded to there was no you can't just let this go so that was a bad move\nYeah they're ... to ... and just to see the the thing that not only the threats that worries me that Dan just said it seemingly the studies need to answer why they live with the president on that you know the president came out and said that the king and ... among the crown prince had called Jared Kushner who's working on the scale\nUnless there's something that we do not elevate it looks like they have like the president I think that they need to there's a lot of explaining to be done there\nWell I think they're going to try and pass it on to an underlying that was in the consulate in in Istanbul and say oh we didn't know but I mean I I Can't imagine for a second that they don't have cameras all over the consulate in Istanbul you spent two years in the in the in Saudi Arabia\nOn the air and well okay\nYou're going to happen I mean the the women I chronicled the lot on this program and ... women voting in driving et cetera and being told how to dress or being told that granted permission if they can travel abroad et cetera um I'm sure you had to cover up if you left\nIf you went out in public anywhere what was life life like for you as a woman living under the sharia there\nYou know this is such an excellent point that you're bringing in China and the reason is is that what we actually last year\nWasn't modernization and Saturday we saw wind up being able to drive we saw the ... with the wrote that the government that I had to where it's called the ...

bags and puffing watch those stubborn sunspots vanish\n\nLet me to son and a negative way but I'm sure the liberals listening will be like no you got that from\nUh some right wing slanted website there there was just trying to manipulate the fact that she's from ... okay the top one percent pay thirty seven cents of every thirty seven percent income tax load the bottom line the only pay thirty\n\nWhy is this so sensitive to make us liberals are frauds they keep talking about this fair share some as John Kerry doctors vote in Rhode Island to avoid paying taxes would have we at Al Sharpton and his tax debacle we have a you know Bernie Sanders what do we find out he pays less than twenty percent of his income in taxes\nTo lead by example we buy sample if you believe in what you're saying there's no hypocrisy\nHere for Republicans we think taxes shock\nBecause we think outside of our military and our courts you flush the money down the toilet bowl you don't know anything about the economy and you waste it which you prove what's right all the time\nWe would rather donate it to charity and let the free market and an charities fandl it who can actually help people locally but no you suck up all our money you get a big ... flush and you flush it down to fall and I'm Glad we got a president who doesn't accept this premise are all\nTheir share not all they don't they're already paid to cut their taxes let them put their money to work in the economy grow jobs in the economy yeah why do you like them apples how do they taste\n\nI got some more numbers we may be after W where does this come from well obviously I'm Talking about the authenticity component with Trump that we didn't apologize but if I can be candid with you folks for a moment\nThe patriots cut their taxes let them put their money to work in the economy grow jobs in the economy yeah why do you like them apples how do they taste\n\nI got some more numbers we may be asked where does this come from well obviously I'm Talking about the authenticity component with Trump that we didn't apologize but if I can be candid with you folks for a moment\nThis is the first year of my life that my wife and I really you've done well uh my show the book things just did well they did thanks a lot of you by the way that things just did well I mean they'll need to go into the details\nBut talking to my account and I was absolutely floored I really couldn't believe it when\nWe found out how much money the government I was astonished I really was\nThat will be a really fine I mean we you know we keep money aside to pay for we don't we don't live above the frugal lifestyle at all I mean excuse me a spendthrift lifestyle the opposite we actually kinda were not cheap or anything but we just that we work a lot so we don't get to go out\nI'm telling you I was floored I thought he had a decimal point wrong\n\nAnd I play it straight you know because I I'm like you know a lot of liberals like John Kerry report their boats in Rhode Island played straight so whatever my bill is I don't like the law change it but if the law stinks you still got I got to pay\nAnd I was floored this is the first time my life I thought to myself I'm Serious\nFolks and my wife probably going to kill me for talking about this but it's okay I I mean it because I think this needs to get out there\nI grew up\nAt the low end at best the middle class and being generous cause I'm not I'm not a sob story\nThe low end the middle class at best okay like at one point the bologna for dinner kind of\nYou know what I'm ... now they're middle class like yeah we believe me steak was not I was a hot commodity mind when it was it was ... we were not eating rabbis okay McDonald's was like the restaurant to go to\n\nI worked my butt off where there was that the police department in the cemetery in the supermarket and the secret service\nAnd you finally get to a point in your life and for the first time you make what can be legitimately life changing amount of money right and you want to do so many things I'm telling you we had so many ideas and some of them were so\nYeah I mean we're going to be able to do I don't want to be dramatic about this\nBut you think to yourself I got to give it to these guys these idiots in D.C\nTo do was to do why were these\nTwo are you serious to do what I don't mind if I can I Swear to you on my life the constitutional role of government I military guys take my money [laughter] is\nWe need courts I get it that's why we have a constitution but you weren't flushing your money down the toilet bowl the people who have no idea what to do with it\nWe need we ... we need seriously some constitutional controls on their ability to take our money they are they are just burning it\n\nIt's the first time in my life I thought I could I could have bought my mother in law house and it said I'm giving it to some bow tie wearing bureaucrats in DC too flushed down the toilet\nBowl the worst unbelievable and I I think it's because I grew up\nAt the lower end the middle class and then in the secret service middle class and upper middle class later on I guess I mean I don't know I don't know what the categories I don't care I'm again I'm not trying to make the story more dramatic than it needs to be\nBut I guess it said I genuinely respected dollar because I Know what it's like and then when you finally get help other people right you're like gosh I could do so much with this and you're forced to turn it over and they just mega amounts to the government for me at least probably not for anyone else who's really rich which I'm not\nBut I just I'm paid by every ounce of it it just sucks so bad\n\nFilled my business everything we can hire new people to write for the website ... and we can't 'cause I've got to give it to these guys and ladies in D.C\nSuburb right so I get off track you can tell them kind of hard on this topic is another number about the fair share that liberals don't say we pay\nThe top fifty percent of taxpayers top fifty percent\nPay Ninety seven percent of all income taxes type B seven percent the top fifty percent of earners pay Ninety seven percent Ninety seven cents of every dollar of taxes\nNinety seven Ninety nine point seven Ninety seven percent why does that matter it\nMatters folks because the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers total logically then pay three percent if the top fifty pay Ninety seven percent the top fifty percent of earners than about fifty three percent of the tax code\nSo this Bloomberg peace they did an interesting analysis they said well let's figure out what percentage of the highest end or does it still makes sense at a second I promise what percentage are a number of the highest and earners also\nPay and equivalent three percent of the actual like the bottom fifty percent of the earners in the country ladies and gentlemen the evil rich that the left talks about the Bernie Sanders types\n\nI'm using their terminology show how this pure stupidity of their comments you're never going to believe is the top zero zero one percent of income taxpayers in other words just fourteen hundred people\nFourteen hundred not fourteen thousand one comma for ... for the lips fourteen hundred the fourteen hundred top earners in the United states\nPay the same percentage of the tax load as the bottom fifty percent of income taxpayers in the country\n\nTell me again please with a straight face\nWith a straight face how they're not paying their fair share fourteen hundred people pay the same equivalent percentage of the income tax or as the bottom fifty percent of earners in the country and he got Bernie Sanders a one percent or um so you're not paying their fair share really party do you even know these numbers\nThat is insane fourteen hundred people pay the same percentage of the tax code as the fifty percent the bottom fifty percent of income tax payers in this country that's amazing\nNow you understand why we got to just break the narratives completely you're in it for the rich no no no no no no no I'm In it for the economy and you have no idea what the numbers are fair share you don't even know what a\nFair share is fair shall we used we used to make up his doping stupid talking boy they're rich don't pay their fair share they don't pay pay as much as the bottom fifty percent of the country are you crazy\nA man of fire but at the same or if you want to give us a call it's seven seven three one two three and one one eight seven seven three one three one one of

live in a year expecting us to take you seriously that where we are right now might that that guy and I'll give you a second Kathy what I really do this on the air 'cause I'm up against the break you but I'll give you a second to Google it tell us who your representative is and what the district can go ahead do your thing\nMaybe we'll play the jeopardy south\nTo Manhattan\nYou don't know do you have no idea I Can't even make you think I don't know who that there wasn't that me and Washington who ... who doesn't to me and watched him to have any any way now represents\nA simple question what's the congressional district number you live in\nThe U.S [noise] I Love ... threats you are the greatest producer ever cap and we got the jeopardy sounds are in the back and have you figured out yet who your congressional representative Joe [noise]\nHoping their prey and you come through in the clutch you're making a strong argument here the rich should pay a hundred percent of the fact that we're asking your basic question\nHow he got on that so they want to wake\nUp in a band or make up for the liberals after copies congressmen is Joey back a donor representative back a donut cat is that it is it back to haunt us the\nTruth about the only people they represent\nCathy's is a prank call you for real seriously are you are\nConservative quietly calling conservative shows to act like a liberal who is worth it to make people go out and vote for concern is is this a ... I'm I'm seriously thinking is this a crank call\nBillionaires pay and then and said\nOh you think we should but at the\nGreatest phone call ever this is the ... can you please send me to pay for this this may be I have to put this this is the greatest\nPan why Kathy 'cause I got twenty second one more shot come through for the lives all across the country who is your congressional representative of what district here you go let's hear it\nMiss the call screener greatest tall and the history of something to do with his back and\nIf you're like most people and you see two gas stations in one cell gas for a little bit where you go to that one it just makes sense every little bit helps\nBut here's what's weird though sometimes we save a few pennies here and there and ignore opportunities to save huge money life changing money if you switch to met his share for your health care it could be massive savings for you the typical savings for family is five hundred dollars a month\nUp my kids from my daughter from rowing I'm thinking about like knocking out of work out in the gym spending a date night with my lovely wife who I don't get to spend enough time with at all and I wish I could spend more with\nUs all look forward to it I'm Serious\nI'm thinking about picking up my kids from my daughter from rowing I'm thinking about like knock it out of work out in the gym spending a date night with my lovely wife who I don't get to spend enough time with at all and I wish I could spend more when I was so look forward to it\nI'm Serious I mean I Love her to death she's the best\nI'm not thinking about your stuff do I don't care what liberals why are you so obsessed with other people six asks why does it bother you so much why is it so off putting that you need to lay claim to other people's stuff constantly\n[noise]\nIt's a serious question\nWhy are you in title to other people's stuff why how much of it and why didn't that what Thomas all the way I don't know probably know\nThe economists last philosopher he's both I admire more currently alive today than Thomas all\nWasn't at him and said at one point I I Can't remember which in conflict divisions and visited the annoyed and all this wonderful books I I read is when a PHD report you did on the wall was ... I Love Thomas or he put this thing was well how much of my stuff basically\nTitle do and why or why I don't get it like why do we owe you anything anymore why\nWhy do what do we owe you\nHave these call could not have been more illuminating\n\nReally I Am thankful she called I usually don't take a to a lot of the first call in so much liberal use kind of moderate that Cathy that was one of the greatest calls ever\nBecause that really sums up and liberalism in a nutshell\nThey have no idea what the numbers are they don't understand the facts they don't understand the economic data about tax policy they don't even know what marginal tax rates are they have no idea\nThere convince other people have taken their stuff but when you ask them how exactly they took their stuff they can't tell you how exactly did rich people take yourself well they took it well how what stuff that they take they took my money what really where where was it worth a billion dollars how did they get that money from you\nWell I don't know I don't just sounded good Bernie Sanders told me it was true\nThey're hypocrites there total fraud I remember running for office in Maryland I Can't tell the story you know I used to go there there's a the the Maryland the Montgomery County fair and I'd sit Montgomery County or a very very liberal County Maryland [noise]\nI Would sit there at the fair in front of the G O P boots and shake hands with people and one day the staffer for Chris Van Hollen it used to be represented now he's a senator from Maryland He stops and he's you know he knows who I Am so he's given me kind of the smart smart guy attitude\nAnd he starts getting it to me about tax policy has no idea what he's talking about he doesn't have any grasp of the numbers at all he's completely clueless so I got tired of listening to it so I said listen I have a really simple question for you\nSince you believe government is is that good right and we should all transfer of wealth through a bunch of bow tie wearing bureaucrats in DC you don't give a crap about your money or anything else for that matter please explain to me that you think this is a net good for society and you should ask this of all you're liberal friends how much money\nArgued donating involuntarily higher tax payments to the government did go how much\nThe answer I can almost assured you with near certainty is Ciro matter of fact not only are they not turning over extra money they are hiring accountants to avoid paying the money they owe themselves to the government\nConservatives this is not a problem we are not hypocrites we know that government is full of waste we know the government can't spend money with any degree of efficiency so we do everything in our power to legally avoid giving the government any more money that we need to liberals make the exact opposite argument\nNow the government it's such a force for good\nThe rich people should get more is that money to why me why please explain to me how we have been paying into these anti poverty\nPrograms since the great society and sixty five in sixty six and a percentage of people not working in households with an eligible member of the work has gone up knocked down we have not moved the poverty rate in any significant way at all it was actually going down before the great society and government intervention\nPhil Gramm had a great piece of the wall Street Journal about this last week it is now almost completely stabilized\nWe are transferring on average something like thirty thousand dollars in equivalent transfer payments over to people in lower income categories and the number of people working that are eligible family members the number of percentage of people are working has gone down in some of these households\nThe percentage of household with someone else would work that don't have anyone working has gone up dramatically please explain to me how this is evidence of government compassion effectiveness and efficiency pleased with a straight face try not to laugh\nWhile you simultaneously hire accountants like John Kerry and Hillary Clinton remember our real estate thing where they hired accountants to avoid paying extra taxes to the government why did you do that\nWhy if the government is a source for net good things in society turn your money over to them dopey a phony but you can't if you're a liberal listening to the show doesn't that anger that you're such a fake no serious that you're a fraud when you look in the mirror aren't\nYou like wow I'm a real phony I Love the government can do everything in my power to pay accounts to avoid giving the government money doesn't that make you a fake how do you live like that\nNo one serious I don't have that issue\nI look in the mirror go yeah the government really sucks patch I don't want to give them any more my tax money I'm telling you outside of our military courts and the constitutional role of government where there was mass consensus based fans they waste money like no tomorrow government it stinks it's a disaster I have no issue with that\nI look in the mirror and old yep I Do everything legally I tend to pay as your tax\nDollars as possible but not you frauds\nYou don't pay extra or you want me to pay more you don't do anything because\nYou may say well than a couple of people do voluntarily Petra I'd read a report and if the numbers are wrong tweet me I'm happy to hear\nBut I read the report a few years ago that the record\nAmount of money the government have brought in up until that time involuntary\nTax payments voluntary meeting people just donate extra money the government you're never going to believe this number\n\nTwelve million dollars million billion certainly not trillion twelve million dollars\nWe have three hundred and thirty million people in this country\nAre you telling me if I say let's be generous I'll play down the number for the sake of making it easy on the liberal say there are thirty million liberals was probably more than that probably closer forty or fifty who would classify themselves as liberals hey there's twenty five million if each of those liberals just donated a dollar to the government\nThe government they worship that they send you flights\nTelling me if say let's be generous I'll play down the number for the sake of making it easy on the liberal say there are thirty million liberals there's probably more than that probably costs in forty or fifty would classify themselves as liberals famous twenty five million if each of those liberals just donated a dollar\nTo the government\nThe government they worship that they send you fly in front of that that they they almost consider an act of religion and say if you just donated a dollar they would double the amount that voluntarily paid to the government the poultry twelve million dollars\nThat's it so webs step up stop being such frauds stop being such inauthentic fakes and frauds wake up tomorrow morning all your account ... and do the right thing by air quotes right thing because it's the wrong thing but you say it's the right thing\nRight a big fat juicy check to the G\nGo away it call your accountant come on five thousand ten thousand the government's a force for good baddie took\nThings ... things he wants to change\nHad knock yourself out set an example\nFor the conservatives out there you think are Neanderthals lookout slabs we donate ... hundred billion dollars involuntary tax payments nice job liberals dumb move but nice job at least you guys have is fine\nWe she stood for something your big frauds\nPhony phony fakes\nLook yourself in the mirror and say I'm a big fake because you are\nI don't want to pay extra ... every body else does why why I give to charity I don't need someone else to do it\nI think that we we my wife and I get the charity we sell short\nShorts on our website we donate the money why I don't need anyone else to do it I don't look for other T shirt bankers because we think we're helping somebody I don't need you to do it you say the government is helping people out to you not why do you mean someone else to do it\nJust don't give\nUp\nIts like Spike Lee said to the right thing lives step up you won't want your face\nRight folks on their bunch you know when for more than you want to get scali seven seven
