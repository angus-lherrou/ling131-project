lot of good and a lot of bad if you happen to be a Republican or ... or rooting for conservatives to to have a chance here to pass anything I'm obviously the both to really have a good chance of passing anything and as we've seen over the past ah the past couple of years even that is no guarantee you have to get anything done\nUm but uh what you're seeing now is really good pulling up for the GOP in the Senate a lot of these races that were close\nHave moved the geo peas direction um to get to fifty is which is what they need of course to have control with Mike Pence was the deciding vote\nYou need to have a a there is about ten races there um and they've knocked out most of it's not just the ones that lean in their category get them get them to fifty there's additional seven tossup races where they could get all the way up to fifty seven if they were to sweets those\nUm you know maybe even outside shot at something dramatic maybe getting getting to fifty eight\nMost likely you're probably in that area of fifty three fifty four right now which is an improvement over the current situation in the Senate but if they lose the house that doesn't mean anything is that yeah you know it doesn't mean it means something but it doesn't mean a heck of a lot 'cause you're not gonna be able to pass anything 'cause you know the house is going to oppose the other way and the houses where it looks real things look very bad\nFor Republicans um it's interesting the way that they're looking at this is not whether\nHe usually it's like will will will the party loser gains seats right that's the way we usually typically look at these things and then there's the control language as well who will control the house\nWell even noticed you haven't heard a lot of talk about whether Republicans will will didn't gain any seats\nLarge because it looks like it's not even possible at this point in fact um the the polling models that they have working right now uh five thirty eight has one which they have um the I the chance of Republicans maintain their current amount of seats at less than zero point one percent\nThat you might say oh well they've gotten you know there was issues with they didn't get Trump right which is the best thing every time I talk about polls were like oh well they didn't get Trump right well first of all the national polls are almost exactly dead on for Donald Trump\nOr it just didn't get the ah electoral college right but that also wasn't what they were pulling in writing some of the states were were obviously wrong but for example uh five thirty I Believe had about thirty percent chance that they thought Donald Trump would when they're saying there is a point one percent less than a point one percent chance that the Republicans will maintain the same amount of houses\nPolice nothing nothing\nNow I don't know if you saw the uh the mob in yes and I did use the N word gosh\nI don't know if you saw the mob in Portland but they had a a a law and order march and answer fall showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff started breeding\nKicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and the mayor ... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision I don't\nI mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we do want to make it any worse he's trying to make it\nSound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream our police can do no right\nThey they act and they're just sucks they don't act and their do nothing so they have no way to win the great observation there are two political parties and whatever you do one of them might\nCriticize you yes that is that the job of being married right out of your job of being a leader you're supposed to\nActually have an idea and do something which I think he did by the way I think you're right would you would not age because to me right when you say for public consumption that is exactly what he's doing yes his knees opinion is oh jeez where we're damned if we do damned if we don't but in reality what he wants is a is much more on this side but yeah the ...\nMore on the end of a side and you can back that up with how he reacted to the FBI the FBI building in Portland is is under siege for ... to ... I mean think of the balls and these guys\nThey take the FBI building and block it off so FBI agents are are now trapped inside the building they call for police police say ah we've got a call the mayor\nWhat\nI'm calling you dispatch police we have to call the mayor the mayor goes on and says if the FBI thinks that this city is going to back them up there in the wrong city\n... excuse me what what ...\nSo the FBI had to get federal officers to come in and get everybody out of that building\nAnd into safety sounded nothing Portland did nothing to these guys that I mean whoa what is this\nIs a I mean it's it's close to anarchy right it's certainly the weight of that you think it would come if it does it say you know the idea that you the FBI can't depend on police officer forget the FBI just these are people that these are actual real individuals who are in danger or and\nThe woman who has the food carts across the street from the FBI um she was a a threatened with an inch of her life that I think they've had to move out of the city or in your family um they took her stuff destroyed it a threatened the neighbors who are coming down trying to you know stick up for\nI mean they're just that they've become animals they become animals and their claim these are they're streets no they're not\nThey're not punk have you paid for them\nBecause I think a lot of the people who are trying to make it to work are the ones who actually paid for it your streets since when but read enough history\nUsually people are who are um\nYou know national socialists or Marxist radicals of some sort they're in power and they let this they let this stuff go until the people have had enough and then they do what they want with those people and they you know use those people as\nCover to seize even more power that's the way it works on a national scale I have no idea what this Portland mayor is doing\nBut it's insane\nMeanwhile Alex ...

lucky and this terrible news came I realized I wasn't really having fun and the music business I had lost that\nBut at the same time I was given back my faith in humanity\nUm he said uh the illness made him realize he needed to make a change in his life I spent a good a time a good deal of time with people who aren't so lucky\nThis terrible news came I realized I wasn't really having fun in the music business I had lost the joy and at some point just before the Brits I was starting to lose the plot\nI become desperate to hold on to something\nI thought I might be losing and I thought I had to do something special to keep it they started doing things out of my comfort zone like presenting and the truth is\nThat had been a while since I've been having fun it started I started to worry about ticket sales for my tours what the critics said what the perception of bite me might be I felt like I was living with this over my face and near ... and the reality I was seeing was all blurred by it\nI decided I'd never wanted to read my name and print again\nNever read a review and I never have I decided I'd never use social media again and I never have but the diagnosis made me realize how stupid I had been to worry about all of these unimportant things I was embarrassed by my ego\nI was embarrassed that has allowed this in security\nI realize that for many years I couldn't believe I was on the same stage as my heroes I couldn't believe I was looking cross somebody like Paul McCartney and saying things like it's hard to get here but my God it's harder to stay here\nThen I woke up and sought after ten years of trying to get here in five years of being scared that it would go away I think I can enjoy it\nAfter his son's illness he says I just don't have the stomach for it anymore the celebrity narcissism it started I started to crumble but then I started to wonder why I wanted to do it in the first place\nI had forgotten that it was all about souls connecting because I become so anxious there were people in my business life saying if you hadn't done this or that you've written a better song tickets might be selling quicker\nI started to take all of that on board and no one wanted to take any responsibility is just so much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was ... insecure enough already I Would digested and say it's my fault time rubbish it affected me and I started to think it's all going to go I'm going to lose everything\nIt is fascinating to read these things from him because what I've always felt about Michael boo play was she was just having fun\nHe was just living a dream and I wondered and I never spotted in him I just wondered\nIf it was ever going to get old to him because what makes him I think the best for former I've ever seen on stage his that joy he just has a joy of performance and it is it is so infectious\nYeah he loves it I mean you can tell when you see him live you can tell he just absolutely loves doing it or leave it at one point um but they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports that he's actually thinking about stopping it\nCompletely he says I was learning with passion that I was afraid I'd become a mere poor photo copy of my heroes\nBut when I come back from this terrible time I realize I'm not a mere photocopy I've learned everything I can from them taking it\nFound my own soul my own voice my own style and now no credit can take that away it needed clarifying now I've just seen the music I Love maybe when you let go that's when it comes back to you it's a lot like love\nHe is um he he I think he's joking\nAbout he's because he says I missed the guys in my band so when my wife had to go back to Argentina I said to the guys come on over to the house let's have a drink order some pizza place in video games and jam they came over we partied and I said let's play some music and I thought wow\nThis is fun it was then that I realized I missed making music I didn't even know I missed it that was about a year ago so why would he possibly be saying that he is now\nIt seems like it might be one of those situations where the Internet has taken a somewhat a sarcastic comment and turn it into reality has it spoke to people are coming out today and saying that he's not actually going to retire because he's in the middle of a tour in a book or their album released and all that other stuff so here's what he's here's what he says exactly\nTo the reporter he pauses there are three reasons I wanted to do this album one because I felt a debt of gratitude deeper than I can explain to the millions of people all over the world who prayed for us\nAnd showed us compassion that gave me faith in humanity to because I Love music and I feel I can continue the legacy of my idols and three because of the world was ending not just my own personal hell\nBut watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe breakup there's never a better time for music then he suddenly stops\nQuote this is my last interview he says quite solemnly I'm retiring from the business of made the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top end quote [laughter] somehow though the writer says I don't think he really\nMeans it it's unbelievable because you know that it was put all over the media as if he was retiring well he said it was his last interview he got other interviews scheduled\nRight like he's had a whole pressed for for this album is just silly and most important thing though is is looking at that and saying that is really the type of thing that ... that changes your perspective completely right you go through something like that and you stop and you examine all the nonsensical idiocy that you you participate in everyday\nOr and you can re prioritize you don't want to have to go through that to do it but sometimes it's the only thing that makes you kind of re prioritize the things you're doing in your life\nUh and and he seems to have I mean he he's making thirty five million dollars a year if he's out there a touring and stuff and he's able to walk away from that um\nBecause he just wants to spend time with his son how many times you hear those excuses um according to what is more time with my family that was completely real guy yeah it's nice to see somebody who actually you know and it's nice to see\nHe he got through it and has made it into a good thing you know I I have I have\n... probably more respect for Michael Google a than any other professional that I ever met in the\nEntertainment industry because he has found a way to keep his feet on the ground and he was on afraid I mean when everybody when everyone it was very popular to hate me\nShe didn't I mean you know as a hobby or hate you know by the heat but he and he was never taking a stand for me he just wouldn't he just didn't understand", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Vernal", "day": "20"}
