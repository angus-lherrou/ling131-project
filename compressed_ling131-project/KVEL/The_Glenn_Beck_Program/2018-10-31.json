James Madison is is looking at something different\nHe's looking at the weather you came from Great Britain or not correct he's not talking about people who are coming in trying to drop off to be able to take stuff you know or or you know or bring the whole family ... born in the colonies or were you born in Great Britain correct and they answered that two ways if you were born here you don't need naturalization however\nYou also have to be born here to be president and that's what they were worried about they were worried about these English coming in at ... ... try this out for size they were worried about the English coming in\nAnd just saying hey I'm I'm I'm American I'm living here and I'm American so I can vote\nBecause they knew that if all these English people came in they would change the country and that's why they didn't want at a a a foreigner as president as well you had to be born here so they were trying to protect it\nAt that time from the English coming in and screwing up the country with a vote which is what we're dealing with now\nUh I think I agree with that although he's saying if you were born here you are you\nDo have correct because it was a ... it was a different time in a different problem\nYeah and I say like as much as I Love James Madison I Love the founders I ... it's almost less important what they thought about this particular issue because it was an amendment to the constitution right we're talking about the fourteenth amendment\nYeah they do and that's why you have to separate James Madison because that's not constitutional he didn't put that in the constitution was that was put in under Lincoln and then so now go to that because that's a different argument as well\nUm so so this is now a Edward bases president Lincoln's attorney general mess that we're in a pretty this is again a few years right before they do the fourteenth amendment\nOr the eight incorporate the language in his uh this is from the articles National Review properly understood of codified ... attorney general base contemporary understanding this is what he says\nI'm quite clear in the opinion that children born\nSo this is now a Edward faith is president Lincoln's attorney general\nMess that we're in a pretty this is again a few years right before they do the fourteenth amendment or the it incorporates the language and is a this is a from the article from National Review properly understood of codified ... attorney general be contemporary understanding this is what he says\nI'm quite clear in the opinion that children born in the United states of alien parents who have never been naturalized are native born citizens of the United states and of course do not require the formality of naturalization to entitle them to the rights and privileges of such citizenship isn't there more\nThat is the end of that quote\nI thought there was something else too about or maybe it was in James Madison that they had come in\nThe proper way or something I I thought I heard that earlier today but the the the Abraham Lincoln thing is just the same remember so when a constitutional thing because there wasn't the fourteenth amendment yet I Know he's writing it this is this is the beginning of it and so the first one is\nHow do we know who are citizen is because it's almost all while it is at that point all immigrants except those who would come over and the Mayflower or or had their relatives come over before and so it's very small number it was mainly immigrants\nSo how do you know who is an American well were you born here that was it that was the question of who's in American at that time because it was mainly\nA you know people from England and they were worried about the English coming in so you're born here you're a citizen you can serve you can vote starting to get a pretty serious German influx too yes serious German and they were freaked by that the the second thing is uh with with\nLincoln he's trying to solve a different problem he's trying to solve at that point the Democrat literally the Democratic party this is their first attempt before poll taxes\nAnd you know moving the polling place and all of the crap that they did the first thing was oh well you know you're not okay you might be you might be a citizen but your kids to your kids weren't slaves so your kids aren't\nCitizens he's they're trying to say stop it stop it\nWe're talking about the slaves the slaves are free their citizens and so are there children that you have to look at the thirteenth fourteenth amendment for what it was talking about and what it was trying to do it was trying to say to the Democrats\nStop it\nThese are human beings and they are citizens that'd be fascinating to hear these two sides talk this out because they're both coming from the conservative perspective it's not like\nYou know Chris Cuomo versus somebody you trust or at least they're both sides of the argument I think a really interesting I don't\nBecause I think you're right but sometimes that is because that is definitely what they were intending right was slavery however sometimes you ... that is the also there's they're on an unintended but intended consequences where you would you would absorb a larger group to make sure one group is is\nThere is no way the intent is that if you come here from Mexico central and South America and you have a baby and everybody who does that is now instead of theaters Ryan way that there are Russian\nTours now that take you Chinese students take you to Miami the Russian noodle Miami you stay here for a few weeks you have the baby here your your your child as American citizenship same thing in Hawaii with the Asians uh it it big in Hawaii but probably also big in California\nThat's not what they were talking about this is not at all different problem yeah the the constitution the first ten in the bill of rights those are universal those are gigantic so when somebody says bill of rights\nWell is it in the first ten because the first ten our global pretty much\nWith the exception of new ideas are pretty much the the the rest of them\nAre a reef stating of the first one where they had to get very specific and say no dummy women women are part of all men are created equal women can vote same thing with plaques and the thirteenth fourteenth amendment\nMhm it there there were specific where\nThe where the amendments are very broad the first ten\nWhat is it made sense for them to think that in Dallas texas United States of America at Parkland Hospital Seventy five percent of the babies born there are born to illegals and now they're all citizens you know that doesn't make sense to anybody that doesn't I I definitely don't think it'd be a good idea right not a good\nIdea institution ... this this this is the best phrase and I just I Can't understand how people\nDon't understand that the constitution was not meant to be a suicide pact\nThat's positive or not but that's also a very dangerous free so I guess I feel like at the same argument people use with the second amendment\nOh well they would they look I mean at the time they only had these little weapons they know that what I don't know why I'm sure they wanted freedom of guns I mean these guys are too big huge brutal and this is not meant to be a suicide\nPower when I'm Talking about suicide pack I mean on the principles on the principles it's not meant to be a suicide pack\nIf we follow these principles you won't have a constitution you won't have America anymore you just won't because what he is doing it\nFor a hundred years and we still have America or am I doing differently now there was not the have a baby tourism back in Nineteen hundred no it certainly being exploited at some level right I mean but that does not mean huge it than I Am ... like let's just say we ally argument is an argument to amend the constitution\nRight now let's just say if it was their intent was to be getting let's just say it was\nThat we wanted it we want alien students come in and have been dropped babies over here and then they're going to be anchor babies that are going to get citizenship let's just say that with their intent I don't think it was but let's just say it was\nIf that was true and and back then people weren't exploding and now people are\nAre ... should not be I said we now think problem if you want to change guns don't make some slippery arguments just amended Eighteenth amendment twenty First Amendment and we said you know what we're going to ban all alcohol\nWe did it bad idea twenty First Amendment forget the Eighteenth amendment we need a drink\n[laughter] right yeah and that's the way you're supposed to do it yeah and they don't want to do it that way because it's hard it's hard and they know that it's impossible to make the argument because when you do something that big you actually have to think about it\nAnd that's why the president's not suggesting we have a constitutional amendment he's just doing it and it I go to the water\nRight and that's really overturned immediately hearing them in ... immediately alright are in

last week we talked about it but we wanted to emphasize that because we get so close to this uh yeah board meeting and we've been following the uh petitions and\nOnline we have changed dot org you in a base in real and that is where you can go on that and we have over a thousand signatures on that petition right now and we're like ten times more than that\nThey don't and and if you if you support the rail and and and the rail project it doesn't necessarily be anywhere in the even the basin per se Roosevelt dishing Bernal or even the two counties it can go beyond that anybody can sign it would just showing the support\nIs what we need and obviously post comments on their uh this this uh this is going to be provided this petition has provided a copy of this along with all inks signatures that have already been filled out we got sheet to increasing the jurors\nInfrastructure to support the real and sincere so the rail isn't just a set of tracks\nAround is also a term in a in ... is the expected area an ad that term at that term is area\nThere's going to be a a lot more infrastructure in terms of storage units a large tank inch and a trans loading equipment to to move crude off of trucks and into\nEither into the railroad or or into the rail cars or it into the tanks first and then from that thanks to the rail cars because this is going to be a very very very busy area [noise] um\nAnd we may see if we go from making eighty thousand barrels of black box a day to making two hundred thousand barrels of black wax\nThen we will see a lot more road building I Would imagine out in the fields I'm not sure about beefing up the uh the main the main roads the main arteries I I'm not sure what that's going to look like a we will see a lot of trucks on the road obviously from the field to the rail a terminal\nSo it it brings to me to read that when we're looking at the transportation of our oil which is very ... it becomes difficult because in the cold weather really harden up and it's you know how the heat it up and all these things that come into\nThat separate or seems more important to me than anything now because if we can separate\nThe the wax from the the crude then you can ... anywhere or without ... yeah [noise]\nSo are you referring to the ... refinery right raiders [laughter]\nOkay yeah so the so the operator will be really great um it's a plaque or I think capacity it's supposed to be forty thousand barrels a day and forty thousand is a lot compared to what we're currently producing that that'd be a fifty percent increase in um available market I guess for production\nBut uh and and they will be separating that out\nSo they will have a a loophole feedstock as a as well as I Believe a whack the output which will be shipped to you know I don't know who the buyers of ... the wax out but our um but that will be that will be nice but it will it will have so much to pass city you know so and we're making three hundred thousand barrels\nThe vast majority of it's going to be sent\nElsewhere outside of the area\nHow how do they keep those is I guess they have the technology to keep the the ... rail cars heated so that they're not ...\nOr so rep hires coiled cars they have a ... and it runs through them that aren't\nHeated there and imagine that are kind of quote pipes that once the once the rails part gets to its destination that destination refinery needs to have a steam unit that can push steam coils and re heat crude every ... so that it can fall at the bottom\nAnd so it's not necessarily kept warm the entire time\nOkay let me think it's more efficient anyways just kind of warm it up when you need to get it out\nThere a lot of people are working on that that's a pretty big problem um there's there's some interesting uh proposals out there for for how to move this stuff economically but that's that's kinda the way that's the way that ... isn't the ball a commodity waxes move in the exact same way\nAnd there's refineries out there that they specifically want that wax\nYes for whatever for for whatever reason they're configured in a way that they want it on the Gulf the Gulf refiners which is probably our best best that\nAre based on on some some studies and surveys done by market goals for the southern county coalition and are down in the Gulf and there are some refiners that are really interested the issue is they would then have to some of them which was still a lot of them would still have to invest in additional infrastructure to receive those cars and be able to sustain\nThem off at a a ... in a way that's economical and competitive with the other non work secretly they could also pick up that are essentially now in competition with our supply\nSo we're talking with re page there are any energy a Rocky Mountain energy economist or ... ... and you're you're kind of out there and you're at you're able to see and be all these meetings and have discussions about the rail the projects the pipeline\nThe the mentor that's already moving yeah between trucks and pipelines a gas I mean you're involved in all of it what does this mean to the base and having grill put an empty can you kind of but those that are listening kind of explained the magnitude of what rail will do for the basin\nRail for the base and would allow would allow us to maybe double or triple in size economically a potentially even more and mostly on the back of oil and gas development obviously but it would all it would also a\nGrand the opportunity for other industries to potentially move in and make use of the same rail infrastructure\nA manufacturing has been the primary wanted mentioned um and I think that's a real possibility I'm most importantly I think a part of this with the rail is it would act allows access to other markets which which stabilize that discount that we get to WPRI\nAnd who I don't know if it would end up being really close small discounted WTY if maybe it would put us at a slight premium or maybe just flat the WTO but at any rate the variability in that discount\nIn that difference would would probably be greatly eliminated so that would be swinging from a minus twenty dollar up to a plus three dollar and then back to a minus ten dollar all over the map every\nEvery once in a while I think it would be a lot more stable and it would allow producers to be able to forecast better into the future based on the kind of the benchmark crude nine next and it would allow them to hedge and allow them to make\nBetter um long term investment decisions it would be a really big deal for for our area\nSo one of the things I keep thinking in my head is that we look at a having a separate or so were pulling these wax the swag see out of the\nOut of the food that we have to me it would make sense to move factories here to the base and that would be able to manufacture that wax rather than ... on the other side of the country there's I I Would think this great opportunity to bring industry here\nTo stabilize our our communities that have those jobs here was this great potential that and I have do you know of any organizations that are looking into that to bring those manufacturing companies here\n[noise] I'm a there was one that was that was introduced at the unit base in energy sign is like oh jeeze I don't remember what the name of it was caused Lawrence industries or something like that and they do\nUm international shipping equipment or for international logistics and that was interesting and I think that's been kicked around um [noise]\nUh that's the only one that I'm aware of um when it comes to petrochemical man you\nOne that was that was introduced at the unit base in energy sign is like oh jeeze I don't remember what the name of it was called Lawrence industries or something like that and they do um international shipping equipment or for international logistics and that was interesting and I think that's been kicked around um [noise]\nUh that's the only one that I'm aware of um when it comes to petrochemical manufacturing and production I don't think that you want a base and is very well strategically located for that even with the new boil with the feedstock or the output of the separate or of a greater\nUm because the primary output of that is going to be a an advanced\nClue boil feedstock that will go into producing kind of your high dollar\nSynthetic live oiled or for motor oil mhm so um ... there are lots of refiners throughout the country that ... that are very very well situated to pay a good price for that type of feed stock ... we'll see the dollars flowing in\nAnd hopefully they'll dollars yet spun around and applied to you know other other forms of business and hopefully industrial growth and you want to base and um so [noise]\n... I think the biggest thing is is in the importance of this having our our voice in a community whether it be here or anybody else's listening beyond here if you're listening on line or\nA shining on social media those that haven't had a chance to sign a petition we would encourage them to do that you can go to the way to base in today's show page are just search on Facebook confided or you can go to change dot org and just type in you in a base in railway railroad\nAnd you will be able to see the petition and to sign it and voice your opinion is so important that we get this out here James I think they just sharing it even if they sign that if you've already signed it just share it make sure people are aware that it's out there and make sure that that petitions available um games\nYeah I I agree that it's a very important I Hope that anybody who's listening today tell everybody you know let let's get on there and are\nSpread the word out we we love to see huge numbers taken to this meeting you know if we had even five thousand six thousand names that's a lot to be able to take this meeting and we're we're over a thousand probably was handwritten probably Fifteen hundred or something like that but uh that's been within just a not even quite a week yet\nThat haven't we announced last week yeah\nCan I can I mentioned that uh I I've gathered maybe a hundred and fifty myself\nAnd in each of the people that I visited with I have not had one person say no we're object to it right so the community is is is a hundred percent in support of it well I Would probably say Ninety eight percent because there's probably to present I have [laughter]\nAbsolutely and I think that they are willing as a matter of just getting in front of them and for so the you know that everybody's going to be listening while I think some people\nThat are the like the status quo they don't want to see the community change because for whatever reasons that they have they you know that they're they're comfortable with where the economy is and they don't want to see the community grow and uh you know I spoke with one of the older gentlemen's kind of had that attitude a little bit until I said\nYou know this would provide jobs for your grandkids to move home he says give me yet [laughter] let me find out [laughter]\nAnd I think because there's a lot of us might be comfortable maybe our kids are that old yet and you're going like they don't think of that yet they're just thinking we liked the small community and\nAnd we just have a few kids that are still home in in their ... their in their bubble but once your kids grow up and they started leaving and they're moving to Oklahoma like I had a daughter that lives there and then all of us as well like a social

[noise]\nWelcome back to you in a basement today show with Mike single and James Costello this news talk K V E L A we had a great a great interview with a\n... page our Rocky Mount energy economist or just a ton of information I think James just looking at that the the possibilities and the opportunities\nThere so much we're just there's so much opportunity with Israel Project and it really is a it's a large part of our future economy it's planning for the future and investing in our future and not only that but revenue\nYeah and it you know if you're thinking about selling your home and\nYou want this real to come in to the the cycle of revenue coming in here it allows the market to destabilize them get better and so you know we we're in a down market right now in the price of homes have dropped quite a bit from where they were women in the last boom you know and so the only thing it's a buyer market right now\nNobody ... ... it's a buyer markets and well and not only that but ... it's an economy scale right so as as the rail comes in\nThe value of homes goes up the sodas job stability and so naturally you're going to have the housing prices go up over type stuff for those that are holding on to homes and waiting or maybe renting them out waiting the market out\nThat that's important too but the buyers you gotta buy or sell houses\nAnd you've gotta have jobs have buyers right good good jobs good paying jobs and of course the oil and gas industry is a great place to go to ... to me\nBut if you can stabilize that economy by bringing the railing supplement it makes a huge difference and so it's so important that not only the thrill project be supported to it you know getting through the ins and environmental impact study\nBut making sure that the sea I'd be ... you know supports this and then those that are there are elected officials that are on those boards are making decisions that they understand clearly the affecting impact that it's going to have\nOn the residents live here in the base and it's it's a central that they just\nThe industry is already here I was told last week that there was a a company here that could increase their employees to over a thousand more people well\nAnd and who knows better right now as far as the effects on the economy and then and that works for instance runway entertain we've got run winter to another phone I'm wrong we appreciate your coming on and being a part of the show thank you thank you\nYou know one of the things I think that that when we look at a where we've been in the past we've gone down this road this railroad\nProject is come up over you know for well we're talking with re page a minute ago a Rocky Mount an injury economists are tons of information on it but but we're you know he was saying that for for ... and and Steve you remember the quote but um but for ... it's the largest city without rail in Utah in\nLarge just sitting around you know I think the country to country in the country and then how are you going hey yeah in the entire that's insane\nRun how how did this happen [laughter] well\nUh let's go back about four or five years when are you dog and the counties did that real steady which you know looked at a twenty five other route\nAnd we basically we're trying to protect that ... you try the economy and help the base now and so all these all these route in Colorado we get dismissed because we were trying to help Utah\nAnd at that time we went back to Washington and with the federal real people and they told us that there had not been any new rail spurs in the past Thirty years there's money sitting there\nAnd we really wanted to do something at that time but trying to get through in a realignment of one Ninety One over the price\nThat that project came out of the price tag which too high\nAnd so you drop that a model and and it's just been on the shelf but I think that this one here as we look into by reaching out to get to to national Ralph burgers or railways this is this is the one that is doable and they said it's within our reach\nNow have they have any have there been any budget or there'll be as a bunch of been done on this the estimated cost\nOf what a real cost to put the railing over in India they break it out over a period of time is that I mean we're we're we're at the right now we're at the environmental impact study the yeah yeah so I Would imagine you guys have already looked at cost but we have an estimation of what it would run and they were to put this rally in this project\nI think over all cost and I'm a ballpark is because my ... he's the one that's been heading this project or the seven county infrastructure coalition\nThat if I remember right we're between one point one point five billion dollars\nAnd they said the pencils out that it would be profitable and it'd be a game changer for the innovation or I can get from a standpoint of economics when we go get try to entice people to come to the base and British questions asked\nA rail you have an international\nAirport or do you have a freeway the base handicapped right off the start so this would this would help us\nAnd people keep trying to say well this will get our oil out of the base there right they'll look at all the commodities that we will ship out or bringing in outside of the oil and gas industry I was to a foreign bureau meeting\nLast week with you in a county [noise] some\nOf them were excited because they could ship there we out they could bring fertilizer and we can ship pay cubes or hay to Japan right from here\nRight they'll look at all with modernity that we will ship out or bringing in outside of the oil and gas industry I was to a foreign bureau meeting\nLast week was even academy [noise] some of them were excited\nBecause they could ship there we out they could bring fertilizer and we can ship take cubes or hay to Japan right from here there's other commodities people are very narrow minded if they think\nThat it's just for oil and gas it will be a great benefit for us to get our oil to other markets it brings a price tag off so there's no discounts and there's other requires trapped in the United states in the Gulf Coast that want are wacky proved\nSo for us it's a win win if we can convince a community impact for to help fund the the application for the I asked which is\nAbout twenty seven point nine million dollars and uh if we get into that then there's federal funding and a very good rate on alone\nTo build this thing so tired of the essence you get this thing going\nNo no the community impact board um you you've set on that for how many years um I ... for years\nFor four years uh when when you have a when you have a large showing of community support for a project does that have an impact on on the decisions that are made there\nThere\nOnly five of us and you might want to use Octavia fertile rose about sushi where the basin comes to tough news stars no\n\nNews

ground back [laughter] [noise]\nI'm just a reviewing a all of the scripts\nUh from the uh the four part series that I did years ago called the puppet master George Soros because for some reason George Soros is being rehabilitated again in the press a and now they're ... they're taking it so far by saying that\nUm people are saying this caravan a is a is now being funded with Jewish money\nAnd when they said Jewish money what they're actually saying is George Soros they're saying that people said that George Soros is funded this but to make it sound more anti Semitic they're saying people are claiming that this is now being funded with Jewish money\nSo who's the anti Semite here who was the one light\nFirst of all this caravan we have absolutely no evidence that George Soros is involved in this or any of his money is going to fund or support any of this we have zero information\nWe do have information that two of the uh uh organizations that he helps fund were directly responsible for the last\nCaravan in April but uh probably next week we're going to go through a the puppet master and I'll bring you the absolute facts because the media has gone in ... just in saying\nThey don't even know how to describe the mob they can't call a group of people clad in black covering their faces a walking through the streets with sticks breaking glass\nAre on the government last year from China it's it's\n... it's it's it's staggering\nAnd nobody's talking about it they just got into a a a deal a few years back with a a wind generator\nFrom that was making these giant generators that you put on a on a windmill and they had a four hundred and Ninety\n[noise] let's say ... billion dollar but it can't be four hundred and Ninety million dollar a bed and they had all of these turbines being built by this company and it was like four hundred and Ninety thousand dollars a foreigner Ninety million dollars over of like five years\nWell the company shift out the first um turbine but the company was told by China hey we need to see everything we need to we need to know every step of the way what's going on\nWhat they did is they got access to the servers they hacked in they downloaded everything they got one generator\nThan they cancelled they said yeah we're good will they found out that China had hacked in got all of the blueprints\nEverything they had they had one that they that were made by Americans and they brought it into their factories and said okay just make a bunch of these\nThat's what they're doing to us all the time to me that's not a trade the problem [laughter]\nI mean depending on what ... ... ah information your accent thing it's an act of war I mean it can be\nThey have access to our power grid they have access to I mean I'm telling you if we ever go to war it's going to be lights out that these with China and Russia this is what well pollutants at World War three will be fought with ones and zeroes not bombs\nAnd China is doing the same exact thing so why don't we do more about this [noise] I think\nProbably because we owe China so much money nobody wants to make an enemy of China nobody wants to say anything we probably do some of this stuff not stealing things but I'm sure we are trying to hack into into their military as well so I think it's one of those things where\nYou know everybody's listening to each other right you know ... so let's not talk about it will all deny it but we all know\nWhat China is a different animal China is is it the wealth the largest transfer of wealth in human history has happened in the last ten years\nAnd it's all theft from China what they have stole\nFrom our corporations the plans are the ideas what they have taken from our our corporations and our country is the largest transfer of wealth in human history\nAnd it's all ill gotten goods route so that that separate from that separate from their rules like so China has a very restrictive rules in their country\nAnd they these are these are non tariff barriers rhyme mind which basically say hey you want the access to our ... billion and a half people you want access to this market where you're gonna have to do when you come over here is we'll give us access to your technology\nAnd willingly ... corporations do this all the time they go over there and they say well I mean I Want to have access to the market so I guess you could have it that's a ... a terrible policy\nBy the choice but also she visited he's choosing to do it that it is is that this is them getting in like the wind turbine mhm okay getting in a having a basic access okay we're going to buy these will buy 'em for four hundred and Seventy million dollars or whatever it is will buy those yeah it's great send them over to us but we need access\nYou know we need to be able to see anything then going and be on the access that they said ... and grabbing everything that's amazing it's it's crazy that is so bad and\nYou know people are one of these days they're just gonna wake up it twenty twenty next year\nIn just a few months it'll be twenty ninth team that in twenty twenty their total surveillance state will be will they'll turn the key for the entire country\nThat's what Fifteen months away which we\nHave the audio I Know he pulled it for one day this week of the Chinese train oh it's ... ... I don't know if we can pick that up I think I think it was yesterday\nNo there there's a train it's a high speed train and ear hearing over the loudspeakers you're hearing in Chinese\nA a announcement that says basically it's not in Chinese I was a it was it an English English yeah okay and it's basically saying don't break any of the rules\nAnd your tickets or when you are when you're asked do exactly as you're told otherwise you'll lose points and a social credit social credit\nAgain they're talking about this system which if you've seen black mirror that this is I Swear I've like we were has to be based on the real system being built into\n'em but there's an episode where you know you go every interaction you have you simply get raided a and if you do things that are wrong you're star rating lowers and you can't get access to things you might not be able to get on a plane or may not be able to go to a ... a fancy restaurant or whatever it is they ... they're actually building that's in China is already in effect in some places\nIt's there's already a skeleton in effect of it\nAnd then they already in Beijing they have three concentric sink the circles um and the ... the inner circle which is the main city and how many can you look up real quick how many people live in Beijing proper the actual city um\nThe the inner circle is the actual city\n[noise] they gave an operative uh uh I think a couple of hours head start and said go into the inner circle\nHide hide\nThey gave him two hours they then said I'm\nTo the the security service here's a picture of the guy you're looking for feed it into the system find him ... in eight minutes\nThey didn't just find him in eight minutes he was in the back of a squad car\nThat's twenty four million people\nIn eight minutes they found one\nIncredible that's what's coming that's the kind of surveillance that China has developed this is not something futuristic thing it's here it's here all it takes is a country that needs to be monitored that way\n... you know the the the the really truly frightening thing I've I've been doing a lot of reading on um communism fascism of World War two recently and I was shocked at how many countries were a fascist by choice not taken over they were ... fascist\nBut the the really truly frightening thing I I've been doing a lot of reading on um communism and fascism of World War two recently and I was shocked at how many countries were a fascist by choice not taken over they were fascist by choice\nOr there were only about three of them three or four of them that were fascist by choice in the Nineteen twenties\nBut there is like Fifteen before Nineteen thirty eight it all happens between Nineteen thirty and Nineteen forty that's when the world went fascist and communist\nWhat happened in the world in Nineteen thirty depression\nWhen you have a a we centered these people are bad these people are good and we we're right they're wrong we've got to get it if this economy falls apart and we haven't found our way to each other\nThe world's history will repeat we just have to find a way to each other and it's really not that hard\nIf we start concentrating on the things that actually matter and they're big things that are coming down the pike\nAnd I will tell you communism and fascism they failed because you could short circuit the system unless you hit the world with an E. M. P. you aren't short circuit ing\nTotal control your ... this is a we're building a system\nHappily\nThat in China is now being turned into a giant prison camp where you can't do anything\nI was told by a friend if you go to Beijing and you want to pretty much make sure you're not being filmed turn the lights off in your bathroom and get into the shower and perhaps you're not being seen\nOr heard no thanks no thanks\n[noise] [noise]\nI Can't believe that that system is Fifteen months away I mean there are already happening in many places in China but the full system goes on line in in Fifteen months can you imagine what that would feel like as a citizen knowing oh crap\nIt's got Fifteen months to get the hell out of here\nSimply safe simply safe is a a\nSystem that will keep you safe through monitoring of your home but on like the five eyes kind of a situation of sharp buys system or that China has", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Vernal", "day": "31"}
