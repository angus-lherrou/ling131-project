[laughter]\nAre we really got to start like bad [laughter] daffy duck show [laughter] nine suspicious packages\nAnd eight\nExtremely ridiculous looking improvised explosive devices or E. R. L. I. E. these\nEight\nHad been counted so far the Clintons the Obamas Eric Holder John Brennan care of CNN Debbie Wasserman Schultz George Soros Maxine Waters and Robert De Niro all recipients of these extremely ridiculous IEPs\nSo first oh these pipe bombs\nTo get an accurate comparison you'd have to watch a a Warner Brothers Saturday morning cartoon to see anything even remotely close this I'm shocked that they don't say\nAcne back me bomb on it pipe bombs are made from Steele why\nThe reason steel is used because the entire purpose of the bomb is to utilize the steel shrapnel went in explodes you put the explosive inside the pipe when it blows up the pipe breaks up and you have shards that terror people apart\nWell [noise]\n[noise] the attacker who\nThe press is saying it has a real level of sophistication [laughter] what world vis attacker who I'm giving the code name Wylie coyote has made his bomb out of plastic PVC pipe plastic\nSo when it blows up it vapor rises the plastic did it defeats the entire purpose of a pipe bomb also\nThe devices had protruding wires coming out of the PVC pipe was a big ridiculous looking digital timer tapes to it again this is not something you go on the Internet it never shows you to build a bomb this way\n\nAll of the wires and the detonator usually concealed inside the pipe I don't know goes through an x-ray machine just see a big metal pipe probably is not gonna make it to whoever it is you're sending unless you're sending it to their home\nBut if you have a long pipe Blake thing and it shows wires and in the X ray you can see that there is a timer on the outside it's definitely not going anywhere\nThis is Wylie coyote leaving eight overly large sticks of dynamite with a big alarm clock lashed to it with the words at me bomb stamped on the outside\nSchool until I tell you something I Know this is true because ah I've seen pictures and you can just imagine Hillary Clinton coming out in her bathrobe and fuzzy slippers with a cigarette\nHanging from the get the paper in the mail every day when she gets\nUp whose home do they go to that they didn't have a ... both of them have private security course or Secret Service after her right\nThey get all their mail you you have private security you don't get your him I don't like we never opened our mailbox I remember\nOne time my kids went to open the mailbox I said do not open the mailbox don't open the mailbox\nScared ... who are those people referring to read I mean I don't know all the address again like it was just the coverage and that was one of their they were saying that this was I guess Debbie Wasserman\nSchultz ah the Senate and now she is I mean she she's not even in Congress anymore right so uh\nI remember one time my kids went to open the mailbox I said do not open the mailbox don't open the mailbox\nGary ... who are those people are referring to read I\nMean I don't know all the address again like it was just the coverage and that was one of their they were saying that this was I guess Debbie Wasserman Schultz the Senate and now she is\nI mean she's not even in Congress anymore right so ah but she they sent her to the office or that it was that back to her office they said was one that would maybe not have screening I don't I didn't I didn't fact check their claim but that was\nWhat they were attempting to ah to pass off the sophistication I I've never built a bomb no one don't intend to in my life\nUm but it would you say it or that you would make it plastic to get past screening because we put a big metal pipe it's going to be more obvious right if you did it if you did\nIt to get past screening that's good but that shows that you have no idea what you're even do you're not even but you're you're there you have a very low IQ or your uh or your ... you know a a a young kid that just thought it was funny uh I I don't even know but\nBut it shows that you do not understand why a pipe bomb is just struck\nThe answer is no a plastic PVC pipe bomb it will ... it'll still be detected because and that's why he had to in my opinion that's why he had the wires and the big ridiculous basically equivalent alarm clock tasted a stupid thing because like you you've seen like at the airport like sometimes you're like hey maybe I can slip in this bottle of water you know like ...\nYou know like if there's no slipping this past the screening right like that ... that I think to the other two\nThings that back this up our one a ... you made it in in a way that was so none of them blew up right like yeah hidden bombs around the country none of them explode right like so it seems to be that maybe you didn't want them to explore possibly\nThe other part is why do you put a sticker with a mean on their elected not to explore\nThat people are gonna be able to write and I want to get into that and I also and I asked the question why would you put an alarm clock on it in the mail you yeah I

mocking Trump yesterday before\nAll of the bombs were even found your blaming it on him\nWithout the CNN is it's really irresponsible has gone over ... they worked or target of it and when you're in the middle of it sometimes you don't make rational decisions you know that's no excuse for soccer but not for someone who's running and his ... he wrote a there's a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media\nThe president especially the White House press secretary should understand there are words matter that's far they've shown no comprehension that\nThat is that I think it's a fair criticism at times and we made it um I don't like everything that he says about the media but we have no evidence no evidence at all the rhetoric or anything else that into these bombings we have no idea\nWe have no idea who get them we have no idea what the motivation was yet I mean I think you could probably say there's a\nPolitical motive but that ... political motive but that's all you could say you don't know it is such these bombs or so ridiculous that it was either done by somebody who was mentally inefficient or\nIt's somebody who didn't want the bombs to go off yeah the sticker the ISIS me right either done that clearly marks that as somebody from the right\nWhy would you put that on there\nAnd why did none of them go off right I mean again you hope God I'm Glad none of them went up by the way a ... ... it seems to indicate someone who one of these things to be seen every single part of it that we just talked about\nA no leads to that and and your in your in your point about the timer before at like ... there's a reason why there's FedEx and details like that because the postal service is not an\nExact science and you can't they go up and you point to our right at that time what are you timing to you could have blown up the post and yeah so I mean there was a ... it was just probably a digital counter that was doing nothing but that was kind of funny at the wires are going into ... were the ones doing the\nBut beyond that if you're gonna ... you have to look at this in some ... with some level of skepticism to try to understand we're a week before an election right or less than two weeks at least\n... you know the idea that that to the left would be victimized by this hatred of Donald Trump there's an obvious incentive to make America feels that way right now that does not mean that this was someone trying to frame the right absolutely could be\nThere are no jobs on the right that could do that and probably many of them stupid enough to get none of the bombs go off\nIt's certainly possible but\nThey are acting as if you have to be Alex Jones to not believe this is Donald Trump's fault\nYou do not have to be Alex Jones to look at this with some skeptics ally\nYou not to say that you know that that that if they do since you're proving anything\nBut you have to keep your mind open to the idea that there are no jobs on both sides with crazy motivation in a tense time look what they did to freaking capping off with people saying he was a gang rape is to stop it\nHere's here's the amazing thing do you remember the time\nRight after nine eleven for the first few years when something would be sent something would happen and we would hope\nThat it was somebody from the middle east remember that ... where we didn't want it to be an American no matter which side they were on we didn't want that to happen\nNow we just our dog piling on it for them it's that whichever them if you ... you know helps your political position hits them\nWe we don't even consider anything else we don't even consider that\nModern oh maybe the Russians are involved maybe\nThis is just a an outside influence yeah probably not now but we're not even considering it we have zero evidence of anything\nAnd everyone is the media is just condemning the right you have no evidence and I guarantee you if they find this guy and he is mentally disturbed and has\nNo real understanding of anything that he is doing or she's left you will not hear that\nThey will change the narrative immediately to well it is kind of thing happens and it happens all the time and it could happen where it where it didn't go off and it could happen where it is a right wing extremists they'll just change the narrative it won't slow them down at all\nWhat did you think what what's the part of this that's a that's a great getting your attention but while the first of all the fact that none of them have gone off yeah and\nList of the people involved too is pretty stereotypical I wing target I have a job\nTell them down at all\nWhat did you think what was the part of this that are that great getting your attention but well the first of all the fact that none of 'em are gonna yeah and\nThe list of the people involved too is pretty stereotypical I wing target\nI have you know this bomber ... code named Wiley Coyote [laughter] the only thing he didn't do is leave a plate of bird seed next to it and yeah I mean it's so obvious it's cartoonish to start with George Soros\nAre and to include Robert Deniro and\nAll of the ... scene waters all of the typical ... it's just too can be it's too much for it they don't go off and it's that perfect list of the people that the right really doesn't like that\nAgain is it hard to live it is it's a cartoon list that is\nNow ... so we could do this don't don't get me wrong and I think you're probably saying there's two it could be it could be a left or right wing or it could be a right wing person we have no idea but if it is a right wing person they live in a cartoon world yeah they're ... they're ridiculous\nThey they they're so in that that they can't make if they don't even understand why you wouldn't use plastic for a pipe bomb that that much to CNN's chagrin when they said yesterday well shows the level of sophistication\nThere isn't a little ... here none of them went off and like there's no if you can't get one of the tend to go off what level of sophistication you have the right low\nAnd it's so cartoonish there's no level of sophistication\nI I like this can you guys help me figure out the needle CNN is attempting to thread here\nThey write this is a from Brian filters newsletter thought she's most of the recipients were prominent Democrats or as the ... a Washington Post simply put it I made incendiary rhetoric targets of Trump's words become targets of bombs\nThat's not the same as blaming Trump weight like\nMany people on TV on Wednesday I specifically said I wasn't blaming Trump for the crimes of a madman shut news industry executives have repeatedly warned that Trump's reckless attacks against the media are having\nReal world consequences yet none Maxine Waters words are having any kind of consequences or they none of those no well you\nKnow and these aren't mobs these are not mob nothing or just people\nGathering together who are very passionate about what\nThey believe it I don't even want you to honor the word model called the um were and how\nDare you even say ... to ... is a problem and I was not a problem if reckless that we're talking about a bombing\nReckless attacks against the media are having real world consequences what are the real world consequences you're talking about are on the day of my farm showing up right in the middle of a paragraph about the bombing and how harsh rhetoric can lead to bombings here saying you're not blaming him but you're also pointing out that his words\nHave real world consequences like I of course you're blaming him just come out of the MIT it just come out and it made it yes we think he did you guys to bring in\nDavid ... a op ed piece or the piece in slate I saw where they weigh on yeah oh it is\nBeautiful I we gotta get David Gardner on David Gardner is a guy who I don't know invented the cursor or whatever uh and uh then sued apple for taking whatever it was he you know whatever line of code he did\nA and they paid him what was it five hundred million dollars it was a lawsuit I think he won five hundred million dollars really off the charts smart\nAnd wasn't he a victim mode ... Unabomber yeah first one I Believe\nCorrect very first one he's a futurist and he works at Yale not real popular at Yale right now why because he says\nDonald Trump wasn't even my fifth choice but he's the president and the he's doing some good things and yeah he's doing some bad things too but you people have gone insane\nAnd the slaves comes after him and doesn't interview and he just takes

of great serves as usual that we have here in the basement I can tell you this I I Love how in in our community where she was such a small community or the basin and we're kind of an island unto itself but we really know how to take care of our own do we do they do\nGreat I Want to remind those that are listening I'm at the bottom of the hour we're going to be having an interview very special interview with three page or Rocky Mount energy economist does he have hurt and listen to read\nTalk about what the oil and gas industry he is a massive ... uh just tons of information about the oil and gas industry in a valuable resource for here in the base and those that are listening to invite you to be a part of that the reason we're sharing message because we're going to be specifically talking about\nThat community impact order CI beat is going to have a meeting on the AIDS to discuss the rail project is it'd be the environmental impact study the I asked a steady this kid that that they're proposing to move forward this requires funds and we're gonna be talking extensively for about thirty minutes\nOr about what that impact will be for the base and so we invite you to be to be on the show for that or to listen to show for that or I'd like to introduce our next guests are Alex months and we appreciate coming on your with water holler ranch or your ... your family has been doing this for some sometime\nIn the community are located in Bluebell you talk a but you also have something called the blue bell ... which is very well known so welcome we appreciate being on the show [noise]\nUm so tell us a little bit about um lets us instead of going into the the maze let's talk about the water ... um I Know that you that the blue bell mazes was on the other side of the road this last year and it got moved over I'm assuming that's just farming right you've got to move it over with the crops but tell us a little about about the uh the ranch itself\nSo the rains has been in my family for over sixty years um it was my grandfather's and then my father and my uncle and now my my father's doing his own thing which the corn amazes part of that but yeah the we've changed the name to water holler ranch about five\nFive years ago and that's the the name of the actual creek that runs through the water Harlem so water hollow ranch that's what we are\nI think that's how it within the base if you're looking for something new to get somewhere it's always you know what's the you know where's that at their worst locations that makes sense to have a name change I have your hat I picked up by ... when I was there I think you are good good a patron so um so what what is the first crops I obviously you have corn corn or what other crops are you doing\nI'm so my dad mostly raises hay and we have these cows um again sometimes that cycles but mostly we raise hay and we we put the cows out to pasture on on the grass on that we don't use for hay and then we do have the corn Mays I'm In the past it was\nIt was a dairy farm my father originally they they were dairy farmers um and I don't know if any of you know a dairy farming\nHis life every morning every night in your milking the cows as a matter of his Christmas Thanksgiving you have to be a milking cows and some of that back when you were ... were you know I was younger I did [laughter] she had the he\nHad to wait till I graduated before he decided to stop milking cows he couldn't have done that when I was younger so that I didn't have to ... you know he had to wait until I I graduated but you know milking cows and no matter what job I have I always look back and go you know this isn't as bad as milking cows nothing cows as rough so does that you're married to them in that ...\nIs it similar I mean I don't know how similar to Stillwater changes I'm semi still doing a lot of that because I see I didn't see pivots out there so\nThere is actually a bit of there are those are the fun thing about child as it is the same ... you have to do it no matter what the cows won't put it off you have milk cows in the morning and night and you have to change the water during the summer in the morning in at night and then you have the regular farm\nFarm work so it's a fulltime job it's very ... they've got more than that exactly milking cows wasn't chores for me that was part of life\nI I it's funny when I Lived in California there ah we had a dairy farm very close to where we live and it was really neat like the cows eat they don't like they don't have to that they know exactly when it's time to get milk I mean it pretty much they come in and go I'm fall let's let's get the knock out so it was really very it's easy to just get them to come and do you have or haven't stray off our water or are they pretty much now it's time\nUm there's there's some cows it'll it'll sit back but it was pretty easy once we opened the gate and start walking out there they kind of knew it was happening it was it was it was routine um but ... um they don't they don't always do there's supposed to do [laughter] Ken's aren't always\nEither like humans we got to do what they want like ...\nAnd what's happened you got to find a week you're going into\nThis is the final week yes um we're excited it's been in a fabulous years of\nSay ... ... this year we went we didn't go through all of them but we went we got lost and he got started we lost yeah I got the point where he couldn't actually had to kind of had a very it's a little bit you can tell the oil field well over here and we're like a little bit of lights but then as soon as you start twist and through that thing and some of that corn gets really tall\nAnd you get lost really fast and it's such an experience when it's dark at awesome when it's dark but you you have something special when it's dark when did it one of your ... what are you doing there\nSo one section of the maze is purely set aside for a when things get spooky and so there's three different trails there's the two main trail and then there is the third spooky trail and that's a that specifically for the people who who want to get scared I guess [noise]\nAnd I'm Glad you mentioned the corners to all my data my dad was a really good job this year\nWas a drought year it was hard to get anything was to grow like that but my dad's very he plans to head and he makes sure that the coins nice until ...\nThe main trails and then there is the third spooky trail and that's a and that specifically for the people who who want to get scared I guess\nAnd I'm Glad you mentioned the corners to all my data my dad does a really good job this year was a drought year it was hard to get anything to grow like that but my dad's very he plans to head and he makes sure that the corners nights of tall for you so\nSo I called the comic question because you have to you got to harvest the corn or you harvest it could still see corn in there so what what's the deal\nThere's multiple things that you can do after the season mostly we use it for the corn maze but after the season is done we turn ... loose and and let them eat it you could harvest it but what kind of is that the corn that yeah you could you could you could you could use it for that but\nIt's it's it's easier and and and just does just as well just on the loose and let them kind of just eat it up at the end of the season plus they enjoy any extra pumpkins that are sitting there but this is your last week don't don't we'd rather give you pumpkins and er ... smoking\nSo are are you the one that's in the mask during the ... I I don't I don't know\n[laughter] I don't know who that guy is that's a that's a very he's tall and slender that's very that's a very a secret question but ah I I er plead the fifth okay [laughter]\nYeah you have any brothers that are your height and\nWhen I got a I've hell [laughter] after that tall [laughter] I don't know where I came from\nSo one of the day so we went in that what's that channel called expense because the vortex to okay seriously I like got a headache going through that thing I couldn't figure out fairly serious things that I said that her name [noise] um I I went through that and I couldn't keep my ... I was holding the hot chocolate or site or I have one of your siders I was walking through and\nI was trying to focus on not still in it because I thought literally I was falling over I'm normally those things don't get me but in the dark and maybe the way the lights were everything it was like I literally felt like I was falling to the left it was pretty cool\nNot pride ourselves but I've been through many of those things and we we've been through many but that one is is really good we learned a couple of tricks to help make it difficult to orient yourself especially in the dark as long as there's no light it's very difficult for\nWhat you need to do is put that at the beginning of the scare one and get them all of\nThat is the Oregon yeah [laughter] they line up right in front of the vortex and then uh we saw that in the interest for that is the ... okay just\nWhen we went through that we we went through that vortex but then there was a door closed the door just as open when\nWe ... door and the uh the the entrance so yeah so you fully thought the same all the way through and you have\nAnd uh the vortex confuse them as well as some times of scary stuff in there but\nNow when we went through the the longer a maze that's the one that goes all the way to the back\nOr we thought that we were actually hitting the right direction I remember him saying earlier it was your dad saying no you need to go we just keep pushing through and you'll get to the other side well my kids thought they knew everything so we had kids like running through the corn and trying to figure out how to get back and I'm like\nDon't get lost in the car to get back on her get honest they and then they you know it was a great experience our family went through that and and I remember we we laugh at my wife turned me and said I was a lot of fun we haven't had that much fun and a lot of whole idea\nOf the kind that Mike is a all their T shirts that get lost that's right\nAnd they did it and you've done a good job doing that\nSo well thank you very much [laughter] yeah I'm I'm Glad you have fun of that the whole point my dad started this because he thought kids are getting to absorbed in t._v. their phones and everything like that like I grew up having fun just out in the horn van on trees on on haystack\nAnd then uh the the last bit is with equity markets global stock markets there's some worry a a kind of a slowing of economic growth globally and so we see that in the stock market is having on in the last year we do um\nThat starts but oil markets a little bit on edge and we've seen a little bit of selling off due to that so\nHis ... rate has historically when we look at a we look at elections how much does that play into it when you have this concern of potentially a change in the house with the daily here a lot of these people saying hey the Democrats have an opportunity to win back the house\nWell how much of that does that play into energy markets as far as uh the concerns I mean do you think that that's playing into part of us\nUm I don't think that that's going to have much effect even um even if there's a real concern that Democrats are going to take out there in the short term there's there's not a whole lot of the house can really do church to throw a massive rich in oil markets\nUm in energy production mhm and so I don't think that that's really playing\nYou much into a class action\nYou don't know uh when we had a change before they tied up below the uh public lands up there and so I Know in our area and the base and there there was an effect because they couldn't get all those leases or to produce at that time as well it takes a long time after that I Hope that\nTechnically take a technically take off the table and so that pushes price that would potentially push prices up by the locking up federal lands um is technically\nIn our area and the base and there there was an effect because they couldn't get all those leases or to produce at that time so that you think they were trying to answer that meant\nTechnically take a technically takes off the table and so that pushes price that would potentially push prices up right so locking up federal lands um is technically good for oil price but potentially bad for kind of opened local areas\nWho is production is pretty focused on federal land so it's a it's a double edged sword\nOn a macro approach it would be good for the market on a micro approach for market driven\nHere and you get for the basin exactly okay yeah\nSo let's talk about the locally the that the ... we talking about W T I and there was a different scene what what is the W T irate right now the bench rate that what we're getting here out of the Salt Lake area because we're looking at a who were were not necessarily exporting were just shifting\nTo a local refinery what's what does that mean right now because there's obviously there's there's a transportation restrained so we're only pretty much have one customer so we're shipping to Salt Lake refineries\nSo what does that mean to the base in uh for the cost of the where the price of or that we're getting today for producers in the ...\nUm well we uh are marketed limited for Black Sea cruise specifically when we're having this conversation is the lack of experience to have a real problem um we do have a single primary market which are the four or five a north Salt Lake\nPointers and or any time we reached Pasadena the refineries\nUm and we pushed over on production um the excess will have to go somewhere um if there's no room stores in the short term so uh that supply demand and bounce will obviously Bush or the discount the WTO by a wide now\nAnd I'm not exactly sure what postings are right now uh five ten Fifteen dollars could be worse I guess a discount a\nWest Texas intermediates so right now I think WBAI straying about six or seven or just shy sixty seven this morning so a Fifteen dollar discount but says about fifty two dollars net backed Elise\nI'm so in insurance ... terrible but yeah we're still we're still make money and we're still making oil but it is not a very good place to to want to be really a big fight because you know that it's just going to be a struggle get your your oil out\nSo to this discount we're talking about it on the sea it's not a good thing it sounds like a good thing to discount mislead ...\nYeah it's not good means we're getting less for oil and largely because they know that the only place you can ship it to Salt Lake I mean it's my truck\nWell plus yeah and the only only only\nReally act now place but it's kind of includes the costs of transportation out you know to to other further out market ... so it really benefit fine or\nYou know big big way you know to have a supply and demand imbalance and so that Fifteen dollars kind of kept delayed the cost of transporting and getting to markets that are outside of Utah\nSo what does it take to to balance this imbalance that we have right now does that lead us to the radio\nIt's gonna be a rail but also an increase in markets so it'd be a loophole refinery that we often talking about for the last while that's going to help a lot it's supposed to be the I think the ... a box fast it's going to be about forty thousand barrels\nThat's going to provide some relief or until it's full of course uh soon as that comes out and bought or else can come online new production and then\nWe're back to where we started but still good um we really just need more cost effective transport outside of Utah and to a kind of what I Would consider it kind of foreign\nYou know outside of Utah markets before we go in the year to send it to the Gulf\nYeah I I Want to talk about the real project but real quickly there are there are some people that would say in in some that have said that the rail project with jobs as far as trucking what do you say to those people that have concerns are are that are concerned about their spouses with jobs and trucking in the trucking industry\nWell it it would definitely take trucks off of the road in a\nIs as far as the trucks that are kind of the medium hall there are taken from the base and um I I guess you're you're Ross will be short and you'll be you'll be trucking from the lease to a real terminal as opposed to you from the least all the way at Salt Lake\nSo the benefit of that there will be trucks trucks coming off the road\nBut the overall economic activity will soon and so those truckers will either find other things to move or they might just find themselves doing\nA different a different job but I really don't think it's going to be hard for them to uh to find something productive and uh uh economically beneficial to do so\nWe are talking shorter trips right so you instead of these ... can be short hauling 'cause you still have to pick up the crude and even the water you got to where are you still can always have watercolors they got to go to the injection facilities and then you have the crew did that are going to be moving that that oil to the rail to be transferred down down to Salt Lake or to the other area so they're just making short shrift triple\nAre never going to triple our production from eighty thousand barrels black watched it you know two hundred and forty thousand ... perhaps the triple though short haul on water and fruit and so you know they maybe they're not the routes might just change it possible that none of them really lose their jobs they just kind of change rapidly\nSo not as long they more more trips back and forth between the transfer stations and not among some means the net result of that is maybe their home sooner in earlier in the day they get their trip there rather down\nThey might just be so hot and busy that are I mean they're they're even busier than they are now and making more money than they are now you know this and that it'll be up to that\nIn rail doesn't just limit this did not just transportation of oil a transportation good services could open up for other industries for the area as well\nOr we're going to be moving frac sand with the rail that's going to be a really big so it doesn't really same industry but it is a different product um hopefully if we can get this new or his manufacturer that were kind of\nWe're hearing about to come out to the base and obviously that I think they're going to be able to make good use the braille um and so yeah we'll we'll be able to move stuff in and out um it it is for its primary use is going to be for oil and gas but ah I think they want it ... it's\nThe very existence of Israel is gonna is gonna really spur on other ideas and other opportunities to make you the same assets\nLet let's let's talk a little bit more about the maximum capacity that we've been talking about we may be a at max capacity at the Salt Lake refineries but what about the rest of the the ... all the rest of the refineries rather go\nI'm really hard to say what are what you know just how much of our crude the other areas take that's really a price I kind of a price thing um our crude black watch is really good because it produces a lot of middle distill it I'm kind of the high dollar fine product\nUm and it's low sulfur so there especially in the Gulf a lot of those big fat refiners are interested in being and being able to pick up or crude and because it works well for them economically and if we can get it to him in a ... again in an economic way\nUm so I I think that we're going to end up limited by our own ... to ... to be honest\nSo what what what's arising ...\nWhat drives that um the the the value of that wax the crude that's coming is that more because the lowest also because the EPA standards are ... where is it just it's easier to process through the through\nAnd again an economic way um so I I think that we're going to end up limited by our own ... to ... to be honest\nSo what what what the rising nine that\nRead what drives that um the the the value of that wax the crude that's coming is that more because the lowest helpful because the EPA standards or ... or is it just it's easier to process through the through the conversion just\nNaturally it's just naturally lower sober and so for the production of ultra low sulfur diesel it's it's easier to produce you will that be when your feet stock is already low naturally low sulfur\nOkay that makes sense though that nice and you're and you're processing equipment for processing sour crude\nTreats lots of sulfur are expensive those trains are expensive to to put together and maintain so it's really good stuff um and again it can be crackdown too high high value middle just to let 'em refined products and we talk a little bit of ...\nWe've talked a little bit about the rail but really the the rail service and the base in er which stabilized the local economy and then enhanced our local tax base um of course because you got to get more revenue out of that and then create hundreds of local new jobs because you know not only is that just\nA job that the existing jobs but you can have additional support in industry supporting as well as other industries like we talked about potential of having a manufacturing coming in and ... what are your thoughts on that\nThat if you want to do it locally you can go um says other

might hurt themselves\nThat you would be able to ... as a parent and detect that early and then be able to to to act upon it with with the professional\nUm would you when you think those are all that is that correct and benefits how would you add to the other ...\nI mean if you're talking to your children in the correct way and when I hear correctly there's conversation um were you think that you're doing it right and then in the end you\nKnow real like everything was wrong and you're not maybe sure how that went in and that comes from and we'll talk about that that cycle of emotional closeness and and so for you know doing this in in a proper way we're\nYou know opening up for those opportunities chicken happening what\nIs the cycle of emotional closest\nSo it's going to be so ... so you're going to you know the coverage you can start when you are ready to eat like your others that have now\nI'm starting to to bond with your child is one relationship and and you guys are you know things are going well and stuff um obviously if you're home is chaotic and you're not being close like\nYou know it'd be really hard to have a conversation with a child and then it goes on itself disclosure which is you know you or your child I'm In the ditch your child\nOr telling telling them about telling you about how they're feeling or kind of what's going on with them or I'm just things are going through or things are happening with them and it doesn't necessarily have to be something heavy that and then your and you know and and not these them into this could be vulnerable because now right now they've told you this information\nThey feel vulnerable makes like information and then if you like I say down there I don't hear them what happens right then they\nThen you fail then it teaches them and not come to you you know like this is the wrong person to open up to our kids to have my feeling\nThat's just the opposite of what you would want to have as a parent right absolutely yeah yeah I Want my child to be\nOpen to me to come to me with whatever problems or whatever whatever is on their mind so that I can be their friend and help them we can figure this out together but if you shut them down because you're too busy to listen\nOr because you don't like what they have to say\nYeah which I for crushing grandma or whatever you might not like it's\nJust um it's so easy like oh we just found that he can really sorry for that because it's not necessarily that you sometimes are children things just that we\nDon't necessarily want to hear or we're not sure how to answer you know were surprised by what they're saying and steps that we have to you know before we respond to our child and and just validate whatever their feelings whether we agree with the validation is about\nAgreeing with somebody it's just about a knowledge in their feelings um in regards to Detroit\nSo so the cycle goes emotional for most of the closest that goes to self disclosure when the child is hum discloses something\nTo you that's important to them you might be trivial to you but it's important to them\nBut they feel vulnerable because they're expressing that to you know and and and uh if if you listen to them and then repeat back what you heard mhm so that they know you understand\nFrom their perspective and that they've been heard they feel validated at night and that creates the emotional closeness that you can have to use in the sense that I think that principle would would help in in in adult inter personal relationships wouldn't they can\nThey would and and I just I wanted to kind of go back and say something about the emotional closeness and I just I was when I'm looking at that time I was talking about how important the conversations are even from when a when you first have your child when a child of the baby\nAnd how important it is to establish emotional closeness and how it it brings their um it helps their language development I've been studying a lot about this and how\nAnd when a parent as close with their child there talking using what they call ... or baby talk with their child holding their he's out on stage even at the infant stage it's so important to um to foster that early from the from the get go\nBecause that will carry on through out into adulthood mhm so I just I just felt like that was something that um that it's a fabulous so early and it's so important to establish\nI have to share is funny experience that happened with my with my granddaughter Presley she's seven years old and I'm In January she'll be eight um but she's really focused on on you know grandpa cussing because sometimes grandpa CASIS\nI mean that and that it's a fabulous so early and it's so important just ...\nI have to share is funny experience that happened with my with my granddaughter Presley she's seven years old and I'm In January she'll be eight um that she's really focused on on you know grandpa cussing 'cause sometimes grandpa passes [laughter]\nHe's she's she's she's right there to correct me grandpa you're ... you said a bad word\nGrandpa oh gosh I did that and say oh damn I did that I Know gosh I did [laughter] anyway um she got stung by him be over the weekend and uh we're putting ice on it her dad and I are putting ice on it and we're we're all dead damned be [laughter]\nShe's crying because she can fainted she says ... you just war I\nGuess [laughter] but but\nBut you can you know listen to your grandchildren and so I you know now that's her job is to make that she helps me with my problem with cussing and she's taking a really serious so anytime she she's listening to every word and every everything comes out of my mouth and and the correcting\nDoes that validate the child does that improve my relationship is that is another form of validation\nBuilding emotional clothes that you recognize and\nYeah because there are there you know something we talk about we're not supposed to do and then you're like well I can do it then yeah you do then\nYou're just say oh Presley that's not such a bad word yeah then what does that tell her I'm not listening to her and I don't\nFeel what she has to say is important you know I just have to say you know when I shouldn't say that a bad\nWord sorry [laughter] that I was really mad at them be but that doesn't matter I shouldn't\nThey shouldn't do that yeah okay so um that an emotional closeness I think if you got anything out of this uh this class that would be the one thing that you could apply to your life\nIn in really improving on the on the communication skills that you have with you with your child I'm understanding that a child when they when they share something with you\nUh are experiencing a little bit of vulnerability the worst thing that you could do was shut them down and not listen to what they say or or or discount what they have to say I'm ... listen to them hear them repeat that what they said empathize with then you're ... Presley grandpa I shouldn't do that\nUm and then then then validate their feelings and then you build an emotional bond emotional close with your\nWith your with your child or your grandchild or whomever it may be\nIn Steve you know you mentioned you mentioned adult relationships and and if you're listening\nTo the program just just kind of reflect on your own self how comfortable are you with ... with the world of emotions you know think about think about you in a in a marriage and\nYou know when when you're experiencing something and and and I like that I I like how with Trisha expressed a vote vote vulnerability ... people who\nPeople who are comfortable being vulnerable come across as authentic they come across\nDoes real so so if you look if you look at the at adults in your life who you connect with in and they just feel comfortable to you they're probably emotionally intelligent people and\nAnd and they can talk to you know they they can be having bad days and and they'll usually acknowledge and say you know I'm In a bad place right now and and and I'm thinking about this and I I Am kind of struggling a today and you know this this ... this\nHappened but the the open the they're open to that they they own at the they're comfortable with comfortable with that but\nIt's so you know there's there's there's so much I'm In the desert news recently ... a couple of weeks ago there was an article about just the rise in anxiety amongst a college aged students and in in a piece of this ... you know ... when you stop and you look\nAt anxiety and anxiety is often about you know not feeling good enough it's about you know having worries and and and having fears and and if we don't address those openly and honestly that anxiety that kind of yucky feeling of\nOf not being good enough and being fearful it stays with us stays with us but it's so much more helpful if we can uh knowledge that if we have support in dealing with that and so even I think as parents and this kind of goes back\nPossibly ... Steve to to our brief conversation about suicide it it's really important that parents value real notice from their children over perfection you you do not you do not want your children to grow up\nAnd like when you're battling maybe there are a little short with you you know or they get wrongly or you know just give you one word answer and stuff and maybe that's what we do and we're upset like maybe we go walking around the house and a grumpy\nYeah and like when you have an eleven maybe there are a little short with you you know or they get rumbled ... you know just give you one word answers and stuff and maybe that's what we do and where is that they can we go walking around the house kind of grumpy to everybody because you know we don't know\nWhat about the art of play yeah can you censor a child's emotions are and and and connect with them just to play\nSure yeah I mean literally there play therapy\nSo [laughter] slate therapy I like that that connected us to do with race word that are the guys you need to understand this is light therapy for me yeah and that um especially for young children when\nThey can't verbalize and what's going on or they just don't want to talk for things like playing through them you can work through a lot of things and in December logging and help emotions just replace Fisher\nSo step one Steve ... be aware of your child's emotion and as the ... said\nThey're not there especially younger till they're not going to cut they're not going to say you know I'm I'm feeling very frustrated because as schools today a cat\nOr a ... told me that he didn't want to play with me at recess and they're not going to say they're not going to say things like that so but that's your job is to read it it is to read those and and they'll they'll they'll often come across and things like aggressiveness may be a your daughter Kim\nQuiet mess um well you know kind of being left alone wanting to be left alone so those are all good science that probably some thing\nSomething at ... ... ... ... something is going on a step to recognize the emotion as an opportunity for intimacy and and I think this is critical or Steve because oftentimes his parents when when we feel kind of this virus from our child we\nWant to go we want to walk away we don't want to\nDeal with this movie or yeah or we want to quit or a quick resolution you know get get get over it a bit too says this is this is\nYou know and especially especially dads are probably more likely to struggle with this and being comfortable with this as an opportunity for a an intimacy in so well you know when you break that word down into me intimacy you know I like to kind of play on the words\nWhich is in to me see you know so see see see what I learned that into me in the city so so so so so that the and that's really what intimacy is you know intimacy is is\nUm you know be being open and honest\nWith each other and supportive supportive of each other um so but but bit dads in particular may struggle with being comfortable in this this this arena and especially\nIf the ... and and it's the same dads at the same day as we are going to struggle in this arena also going to struggle with it in their marriages and and\nAnd so overall the the the kind of developed this uncomfortable in us with this world of emotional emotions and being emotionally intelligent and and aware and so dad's in particular you know look at this from your child is this opportunity\nTo connect with them to be close to them you don't have to fear it Kim what do you think\nI well I was just thinking about when my dad was very emotionally\nWhy do I want to say I'm a he was a great dad that he was in junior high school teacher and so by the time he got home he didn't want to tell with what was going on and I'm On a dancer that way they've been under this trend might have been working moms right now there's a latch hanging out you can't you can't always dealt with it and so\nI that I can think back to so many situations that maybe could have been avoided had I've been able to communicate with someone about you know about what's going on and so\nI I think it's important and and sometimes we do sometimes as parents they take it personally like well gosh year and a bad mood instead of just thinking or saying to them you seem like you're upset today is that something happened at school or is there anything you want to talk about I think it's important just like what we're saying is recognize\n... ask don't be afraid to ask what's going on instead of just making the assumption that oh you're just in a bad mood and grouchy massive not got enough sleep last night or you know it just that to help them to be able to express maybe what's going on\nSo these principles that we are learning today can help you improve\nOn the communication skills that you have with your marriage improve the quality of your marriage if you apply the same principles absolutely in other words on last night I'm I'm I'm watching Tucker Carlson I'd like to listen I'm ... I'm Sorry let Trisha but I like ...\n[laughter] anyway so I'm watching soccer\nGirls ... and ... and my wife the symptoms are in starts asked me a bunch of questions and and their work related and I just turned the mute button on and I said can can we not talk about work and I turned up the sound that was bad\nLike I was bad that was that that was that ... that didn't help my intimacy no and and that's where at least ... the if you're not you're not applying the prince British are learning how to raise as he does that often [laughter] trust me she does that often but\nUh that was a that was that that was a spoiled opportunity for sure intimacy yeah who've the depth and quality of our communication and our relationship yeah\nAnd and and probably more than any other concept we talk about in parenting this idea of emotion coaching probably applies\nAs much to marriage in adult relationships is\nAs any ... certainly the attention of praises is good good good to practice um ... as well and I I wanted to build on ... comments I I think it's critical here in in step to as you look for this as an opportunity to be close to your child\nTo realize you know to to try to know your child well\nEnough to know what works for them um I I remember one of my one of my parents the took this class for most\nYou know she went way when her adolescent son was quiet was ... was withdrawn it didn't work for her to just go up and kind of say hey talk to me what's\nWhat what's going on but she said what would work is if we if we if we started to do something kind of physical and and and they would go run together\nAnd and and she said you know something about being physical being outside he kind of started to lead as guard down and he started to open up and before long he was talking\nTo his mom about whatever it was that was on ... on his mind so [noise]\nSo you have to you know the ... in in in session twelve and we don't usually have time to get to this and and the radio program it's about the art of we call it the art of parenting and and I think a lot of that as you know knowing your child well enough to kind of know\nYou know what what what works for them what doesn't work for them how how do I approached them to try\nTo be a more open yeah for me I mean you can use it 'cause he's a he's a very close person to come along and and you know when they recognize that thing in the hundreds and um\nThe child well enough to kinda know he was you know what what what works for them what doesn't work for them how how do I approached them to try to\nBe a more open yeah for me I mean can use it 'cause he's a he's a very close person to come along and and you know when they recognize that thing in the news and the one here if you want to talk to me and I just leave that die\n... all we come back later to approach me to talk about and what's going on and and my Thirteen year old like for him at nighttime I Know like when you turn right before bed\n[laughter] any human uh-huh you know you want to conversations and stuff so yeah definitely I think I Know your child\nI think also just letting them know that you're available sometimes I'll just go in and and sit in their random or lay on their bad while they're doing something in there like\nWhat are you doing non and and nothing I'm just just come in to say Hi and and because a lot of times when they do want to talk and if we're busy doing something they're not going so proud to say look at us ... they think well she's busy and I I'm not going to do this but if we kind of come in and make ourselves to mail a ball\nWe don't even have to necessarily say anything and I think sometimes so open up that way as well just knowing that we're there you know so [noise]\nWe ought to answer that phone call right here what do you think Dr [laughter]\nSo [laughter] so so came I I really liked that because because you do you you put you put yourself in your child's ... for ... for a perspective they're they're they're dealing with something\nYou don't know what it is and sometimes that probably they probably don't open up but sometimes they do but even if they don't open up they they have this feeling\nOf moms moms there for me yeah mom's available moms moms on\nMy side she she she she cares about me and so I I I Love that I Love that piece that they're still good that comes out of that a lot of good that comes out of that even though they may not\nOpen up even though sometimes they do so so step three Steve is listen empathic ally and validates your child's feelings\nHave empathy for your child can repeat it back to them tell them that I felt that way too sometimes you know sometimes down feels that way and and that validates them and and that that is just critical ... validated who doesn't like to be validated valley validation\nSo so what is what so what does validation look like what does it sound like\nA so it's just kind of repeating what they said taking what they need to you and so it seems like you're the really hurt your feelings when when um they did that I can I can see how that would that would hurt my feelings from me to or you know does it make you mad", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Vernal", "day": "25"}
