about this guy this Saudi citizens been disappeared I'm always I'm always amazed how the media does all\nThe stops doing any kind of journalism like like I see the stories are riding and I'm like this is not what I Would be writing about at all for one yes this is like a ... style movie surveys and really is yeah I absolutely think the Saudis are guilty on this I think turkey is probably over playing what they do have probably a little bit about it\nBut um but everyone's framing this this this uh this journalist ... as this great guy Nobel Prize winning oh yeah he's got to be he'll be a Nobel Peace prize winner so he came out so surprise surprise he really came to prominence of what the media loved him the west loved him during the Obama administration\nUh why was that because while he was one of these one's advocating for democracy and the kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other places when the Arab Spring was breaking ... now that lines of exactly what the Obama administration was wanting to do and also who were they in bed with the Muslim Brotherhood and places like Egypt will surprise surprise ... is Muslim Brotherhood\nHe's actually that's the reason why he's not and they the people in the media have said oh well he spoke out against you\nKnow the the the kingdom the Saudi kingdom and that's probably why they don't like him\nNo kitten but it goes way beyond that like he they support a political Islam group that wants to overthrow the monarchy it's a lot goes a lot further than ... spoke out against them yeah he is the public and I was a public enemy number one but he's right up in that group with them\nUm and then he was friends with the crown prince though was he not um I don't know how they're framing it\nHe was friends he was he was he loved the crown prince they got along and and he said a lot of great things about the crown prince now he disagrees with some of the crown princes policies\nAnd that's where they've wants to take the Saudi out of Saudi Arabia basically that the best way to put it for this guy but he's a he's not a good guy he wants political Islam he wants political Islam to invade countries all over the world and take it over\nAnd he was living here for quite a while before he went to work at Washington Post yeah no no issues there whatsoever\nI'm I'm On the other hand you have this one guy that it's not that great of a guy on the other hand you have a Mohammed bin Salman the crown prince who ever want to send this is a great reformer he he he's a great guys agree we're going to modernize Saudi Arabia women can drive now all these social is all these tackling he they dug\nPlain and simple he is eight Doug they go after he's doing this to tons and tons of people thousands of people in his own country people just disappear they go to jail for the rest of their lives here they dug and the only reason he's tackling social issues is because they have a lot of young people in Saudi Arabia\nAnd social on the rest of the doubt to hit the streets have you want to see the place where the next uh Arab Spring might happen\nSaudi Arabia the the demographics point to it I Would not be surprised\nRight all so how do you keep Saudi Arabia under control do without a thug\nYou can't ... I mean it's like Russia really either right groups like other countries like that you really can't here's a disturbing\nPart ... most likely most likely\nThis guy was killed by Saudi Arabian yeah um it just it just feels like you know maybe all of a sudden he pops up and I'm like\nNo I was a chick fillet and nobody in the media wants to look at it that way so I was invisible\nFor a while maybe doubtful here's the problem\nWe are we are pushing through a major arms deal with Saudi Arabia we should not be doing that now we should not be doing that that should it be canceled today I can tell you however what is being what is happening is\nYou know the United states was supporting the Muslim Brotherhood now we have some people who know exactly what's going on in that part of the world\nAnd there are probably being talked to by Saudi Arabia going look look guys guys yeah I Know you don't like what we're doing here but uh it's the Muslim Brotherhood and its a caliphate you what you want the whole region to be in the Muslim Brotherhood caliphate have at it you know and that's the decision our president is is having to make\nIt's why we should stay out of other people's businesses and then stay out of their business\nCan I make a production yeah so I think that Saudi Arabia will eventually own up to this because I think the evidence will come after them I think they'll they'll blame of very familiar a photo and they'll say it's the deep state the beach they did this no shelter salmon\nVery familiar a bow and they'll say\nThat he said the beach they did this no shelter salad matter thank you Jason back in a minute [noise]\nDot org are rescue dot org go\nThere and ah and make it under the name of hunter Kelly and make a donation now thanks hunter God Bless thank you\nAll right Bye bye bye yeah we got a letter from him and our staff has been talking to him back and forth and they are well they were all like to not give him a hard time\nHe is ... is so nice and I'm like yeah that's what he wants you to believe those Eagle Scouts\nI mean you have to be honest we wouldn't have given him a hard time until\nThey set a guy like that and then like I have to be hard but I Know you have to encourage your breaking and entering [laughter]\nI'm Sorry\nWas forced out who Mr Kelly the father I Apologize uh but anyway hunter Kelly and\nGo to oh you are a rescue dot org\nAlright sue\nI just want to warn you because you have kids that are younger than my mhm teenage years are always frightening I've done this before I got two older kids that I saw through teenage years and it was scary as hell\nGang mhm not like it is now and\nYou are behind me so I just want to warn you you're in for the terror of your life it's like it's like a a a a bloody house horror movie all the time really oh my gosh it's so frightening because you know kids\nWhen they go into their teenage years their bodies are changing and everything else and they you know they start not listening to mom and dad and ... out of all the usual stuff\nOkay but now it's like you know ... ...\nYou would lose them overnight and I need to lose them with depression rates the way they're going with all of this influence that they can get I'm just so freaked out all the time and I can't believe that I'm Alone\nOh you ...

Democrats should be learning and what they're not learning Kavanaugh since that uh since that nightmare looks like the poll numbers are are switching dramatically at least in the Senate\nSenate polls have been really good for Republicans since they have another thing which I don't know if that's a huge surprise to anybody but\nI mean you know Beto is now down by looks like eight to Ted Cruz which is you know about double the lead he had before then and then an as bill mentioned Taylor Swift comes out of talks about how bad Marsha Blackburn in his latest poll has her up by fourteen emotional started to be a toss up race\nYeah I mean it's I I don't think the Democrats are learning their lesson and yet they're doubling down built it I'd like to hear your thoughts on on uh what Eric Holder said this weekend Hillary Clinton\nYeah I um I I pay more attention to what a kind of a Russian Taylor Swift\nAnd a Hillary Clinton and right over to\nUm Dennis Miller thanks that Eric Holder is really a steadman uh Oprah's\n... and and they look alike you should put that up on the blaze ... side by side\nAnyway um\nThere's a few interesting things in play here Beto ... has raised thirty eight million dollars in the last six months or so which is ... breaks every work in the world where's that money coming from it's coming from ...\n... whose guys in the Hollywood people and all that so he'll stay competitive I and you lose 'em\nI'd hang on let me stop there Dr ... I've met people who have given to both sides millions of dollars they're not happy\nWith the party that loses when you give a lot of money a and the party says no this is the one this is going to change everything and then you lose especially if they lose by eight points\nBut those are normal people are talking about\nThe real shadowy guys which Beddoes getting I'm getting a big Soros money coming in\nI guess maybe I'm ... although they just want you know search and destroy so I think that you know I I agree with you back and that always hurts my toes when I said I I'm that there is a backlash\nAnd that the Kavanaugh spectacle alienated decent and when I say decent I mean fair minded people\nYeah both Democrat and Republican\nYou know when you have and and I bring up a lot\nI'm no one working for you know working for me I could have tweeted out well Kavanaugh was confirmed but at least we destroyed his life\nMember that tweet yes who did it come from came from Letterman's a writer's\nCold there ... okay when I asked him what Herman for coal bacteria both and he said\nOne of the writers are called their tweeted that out okay ... one of those hateful things I've ever seen so that happened to your organization my organization and that person wouldn't be working for\nUs if we would have to be great if we would have treated out but at least we got a Ford least we lease we rally destroyed her it would have been all horror show but I Would not be working today\nAnd they probably couldn't go out and out free so people notice um even if you like cold there which I don't I'm even if you are sympathetic to a doctor for it and and all of that me to stuff even if you're buying into it you've got to know\nAll right that the rhetoric and the plan to destroy human beings is not what America is all about\nYes it's not\nAnd and you know when you think in history Stalin and Hitler and and what they did by destroying their opposition or you know later on I was physically but in the beginning they couldn't murder people but they did it other ways\nAnd that's exactly what we're seeing here in America the hate is rising the fear is rising all of this is in play\nAnd guys like you and I unfortunately we have to fight against us and then that puts us in the kill zone but to get back to the politics I Do think there's going to be a backlash I'm not sure about the house of representatives but the Senate I Believe will um be even more Republican than it is now\nSo let me let me ask you this if if they\nDo have they they lose the Senate where just a few weeks ago the the person who is in the best position to win for the Republicans\nWas Ted Cruz and he was only one or two points ahead of of Beto so he was in the best position now it looks like they could if I mean if it's a good day they could end up with the majority of fifty four fifty five yeah that's significant if\nEspecially with you know Donald Trump is president do the most hated man of all time if if\nThey do lose do you think they will say okay wait a minute this democratic socialism this anger\nAnd all that never got to do that they're going to go they're going to go murder don't you think\nOf course I mean these people are really really deranged and and there are some are now on the right like that as well yes but not nearly\nA the numbers on the left and of course a media promotes that um but if they win the Democrats win the house then you ... that is why are you going to hear your in your area about ... yes I'm In the house\nYou know that's a little shaky because as everybody knows uh the first term in Clinton first ran Obama um they lost\nYour um and and the opposition party you only have one of the house right and if you're way Americans do usually vote\nYeah so bill how do you feel about the use of the N word\nThe M.

have ... she chased after me grabbed my full stainless steel water ball a bottle and smashed it on the ground and grab my backpack yanking me back and forth yelling get away from me\nThen she came

[noise] um get tried him I'm ... I'm your lengthening the Glenn Beck program [noise] All right and\nThen a quick uh announcement to make a for the blaze the blaze radio network is I'm a very fast and growing or a very big and fast growing a network of people that are are are listening all around the country\nWho would like a you know sometimes I'm a a a a strong look at the at the news and also a funny look at the news ah and today we're announcing a couple of changes\nIf you happen to have listened to the blaze radio network you know that we always had the morning plays with the dock Thompson ducks been with us for a long time\nIf you ever listen to them you know his entrepreneurial spirit and he for a long time has wanted to start his own thing a and he has and he built it while he was working here and we all knew about it it's a mode Joe I thing ... ... and it is a it's something it's his own say\nWelcome to the program so glad that your hair returning with Steve Day pat gray a do a steeper gear or executive producer and of course\nMy charming so uh we're talking about uh the Democrats in what they have done this week just with Hillary Clinton coming out and saying you can't have a civil conversation with these people\nI don't know who these people are that these people used to be a sign of racism uh but you can't talk about these people are and then Eric Holder in the week that we have a video of somebody actually kicking a protester mhm um we have Eric Holder saying a kick them when they're down\nIs this is this the or is this the\nBeginning of the and for the Democrats or is this the end of the beginning\nUh um I I Hope it's the beginning of the end\nBecause um I I think most Americans with the ... with many sensibility left in them\nUh are being turned off by the Democrats right now I think they you know we talked about this many times I think maybe now they have overplay their hand we thought maybe that would have happened a year or two or three or four a goal but um I think after the Kavanaugh hearings and all that's going on now with the stability thing\nThat they're completely uh uh issuing I think I think people have had enough of them\nSo is it important for us to change that say I think people have had enough of the Democrats because of that blanket people who vote Democrat think wait I'm a Democrat or is it better to say I think people have enough of this leftist movement\nI I think it's the latter mhm and I think that um you're you're watching I Know it's a popular term in another context these days but you're watching a transition ...\nAnd you know we kind of pretended as if on the right that just surrendering I'm America's youth ministry known as our education system to cultural Marxist for forty years um wasn't going to have any repercussions whatsoever\nAnd now you're watching the first fruits of that harvest are coming home to roost at the moment\nI and we are we're we're not even I don't even think we're polarized anymore I think we're Balkan I\nGet the reference dynamic here so okay let's let's pick it up there\nHow do we um how do we come come back and and how do we start reaching out to the people who actually do have much more in common with us because they do believe in the bill of rights even though the people in Washington may not backing them in a\nThere's nothing new under the sun you know when when St Paul is looking back on the time period who himself a Jew so he grew up in the Jewish schools he knows this history very well\nWhen he's looking back at that time period is when he writes forward thinking in a New Testament world and Romans one where he's when he's when he talks about the wrath of God revealed on the world anybody I used to think when I was a baby believer that if if cultures did that stuff it would cause God to act\nThe more you study Romans one I think it's actually the other way around I I think we do bad stuff\nBecause we deny that God is acting meaning it's a it's a self reinforcing mechanism the natural law uh it it kind of been forces itself and so you're dealing with people that with the wind in the in the New Testament there when you exchange the truth for a allies but there's one Big Mac Roach truth in the universe\nAnd there's a lot but there's lots of eyes right or to buy supplies so when you exchange that truth for ally you're given over to the base to mine and that's what you're talking about\nAnd I go back you know one of the my favorite movie ranch when I was a kid and it's probably a terribly placed analogy\nBut Donald presence ranch in the first Halloween movie about Michael Meyers can be killed it can't be stopped they can't be reason with right when he's going off without him when he was like in the insane asylum\nThat's what you're dealing with here there's no talking look at the guy who ... who kicked drop kick the woman in Canada when he's wearing a ... around his neck you to go look at his picture closely okay I mean that's just self awareness is dead in your face kind of stuff look at the way he talks to her piece really polite he's asking her what she thinks\nHe's totally Lou city's not craze he's not raving roving mob okay and then when she said when she when she refuses to ... to the same idol that he is all he is worshipping\nThe total countenance changes and he dropped kicks or\nLook at this her own a woman from Hawaii that's on TV all the time now I mean her counting the way she looks she looks like when you take your ... to Hawaii for a vacation or a honeymoon and you get off the plane she there with a plate of sweet rolls ready to welcome you to the island she just looks like the sweetest oh woman doesn't she\nThen she starts talking about politics mad and she opens her mouth and it's brutal bipolar stuff comes out yeah that is this is I this is this new sit sanity\nThat culture produce which I ...
