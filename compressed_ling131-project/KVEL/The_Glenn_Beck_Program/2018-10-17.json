I mean getting remember this print took his own you know family members other princes\nHostage in a hotel and likely you are as\nTo make sure we're looking at where this stuff is coming from right now it's coming from people with incentive to make though to review look bad might get it because I think Saudi Arabia they're not our friends they've done a lot of really bad things I'm ... ... ... I mean get remembered the print\nTook his own family members other princes hostage in a hotel and likely a stole tons of their wealth\nIncluding plane and these specific planes are the ones accused of flying in and taking their remains out in suitcases\nSo these are the planes the prince confiscated from other family members [laughter] I mean as he held them you know in the Ritz Carlton prison\nSo it's a legitimate worry that this guy is an absolute Kim Jong own style maniac\nAnd if that happening with Saudi Arabia is a lot worse than it is happening in you know in North Korea and a lot of ways I mean we already have a relationship with Saudi Arabia they're very influential in that region we know they do this but we know this stuff goes on in this region already in there with all these countries that that do it right but we just have to make sure that\nThere's no reason to feel pressure to not go through and intelligence you know full look at this before you start making public proclamation\nAnd you better take this tape seriously because if I were holding the tape I Would hold it until I see exactly how the United states and Saudi Arabia kinda finagle around and Tom to everybody down\nAnd then what everybody says okay this is over and they're not such bad guys and this was a mistake that's what I read the tape if they don't do what you want them to do if you're a turkey that's when you do you do the tape because it's that that destroys\nThe what credibility Saudi Arabia has ever had and with me they've had very little they're not\nFriends of ours they are not friends of ours they are selling us crap that quite honestly I live in Texas we don't need it we don't need it\nOpen up the fields here in Texas start pumping again and bring the price of oil down and let's get off of Saudi Arabia we don't need it\nHe also went so far as back in twenty twelve try you try to ah joined the Hispanic caucus in the Congress\nAnd you know [laughter] she didn't know he did yeah he tried to get into the Hispanic pocket\nBecause some of the El Paso residents his district is Seventy seven percent Hispanic so some of the residents were upset that Sylvester race was no longer going to be in the pretty powerful Hispanic caucus so he tried to join it they're like Mm no the nicknames not enough\n[laughter] real I mean if we go through the intersection analogy of a Beto or nobody's intersecting him no nobody's intersecting him he is still at the top of the hierarchy in the patriarchy\nPyramid I think one of my favorite parts of the debate last night was when Beto tried to make this case that every decision Ted Cruz makes it's about money so like he supports the second amendment and that's because of the n._r._a. and heat and\n... and it's like you're you've brought in thirty eight million dollars of nations rain were outraged then cruised by what for two one five to one night and of course at Cruz pointed out he's had plenty of special interest money come in and it just coming in through other names\nThat's coming in through a pack the heat quote unquote doesn't control which we all know how that game goes\nI mean the idea that you're going to come out and making ... an argument about how Ted Cruz is about money when the entire story arc of Beto is based on the fact that he can raise money will keep not competitive in this race he he has never won anything yeah they\nShe is only in the race to run for twenty twenty\nI bet if he loses how is he has he run for ... I don't know but they're still talking about an hour under the euro was talking about him you know she is she is that he's there John F. Kennedy ...\nDemocrat hope yeah right now and other may I say the great white hope yeah\nYeah yeah it's a it's been fascinating to watch this um he also tried to a pin head up against Donald Trump says they have the big rally coming up what is the next\nWednesday or Thursday in Houston\nAnd by calling him lying dead like like Trump did and he said that's why the president called him lying dead and it's why his nickname stuck because it's true\nWhich is never it's never stuck and if it ever hits were never stuck it's never been true and what prompted him to say that about a battle was that he had voted for Bill\nThat would raise the price of oil twenty four cents a gallon to put a ten dollar surcharge on every barrel of oil\nWhich would raise the price about twenty four cent parents have gas depressing yeah yeah so a federal said that was a true but he voted against a bill that would have stopped that bill so it really is true that he did he\nBoil twenty four cents a gallon to put a ten dollar surcharge on every barrel of oil\nWhich would raise the price about twenties for sent parents have gas depressing yeah yeah so a federal said that was a true but he voted against the bill that would have stopped that bill so it really is\nTrue that he did he but they ... they can both kind of claim that they have the truth on their side and that particular case\nUm but it was interesting to me because the CNN fact checking Beto on some things that he's been lying about during the campaign one being that his mother is a lifelong Republican loves this life long Republican right now you know because he's so wonderful and use\nSo uniting yeah she's going to vote for him for the first time or the first time he's a life that is law on that first of all your mom is get them old for you was\n[laughter] at water ... how you got your mom\nRight and then it helped me out because I think C. N. N. even looked into this way you did yeah yeah I voted\nFor a hard core Republican named uh Brock Obama in two thousand eight primary Obama yeah yeah\nNow here very very ... [laughter] okay so here's the interesting thing I Love this part of the expos aid from CNN\nAnd she can't remember who who she voted for twenty six he remembered ten years ago but not to [laughter] we're really you don't know who you voted for you know in order for Hillary and just didn't want to say\nIt didn't want to say it\nShe couldn't if she voted for it if she voted for Trump it wouldn't work to\nHis advantage yeah\nShe was she was there so it was part of the Trump saying yeah you know she wanted change she wanted right as they would have worked ... voted that she voted for Obama in a way this lifelong Republican and then she can't remember in sixty and\nThe other interesting aspect is that this life long Republican has voted in every single Democratic primary in Texas since two thousand\n[laughter] not at all and even went so far is donating money to the Obama [laughter] I I I Love\nThe federalist on this to a I don't I Know a lot about better but at the same time I don't know much about Senator Kennedy Josh Hawley who is thirty eight years old meaning you know around eight years younger than rising star Beto the attorney general Missouri and the Republican nominee for the U.S Senate\nWhen I Do know is Holly it slightly leading McCaskill a two time incumbent in the in the ... the average pull\nIn a race that could decide which party controls the Senate O'Rourke who was up against Ted Cruz and incumbent is down seven points and falling he wouldn't be completely surprising if cruise ends up winning Texas by nearly the same marketed in two thousand twelve\nI think as as with Holly I didn't know much about Arizona's GOP sending a nominee Martha McSally either I'm probably not alone she didn't get to keep its with\nStephen Kobe or or the generous maybe if she used a nickname she was given to her as a teams you have a better luck getting attention from the national media\nAnyway what could one of the highest ranking female pilots in the history of the air force and first woman pilot on a combat mission possibly have to hold the line Josh and her on the air I Want to talk to her on the air I mean after all that or did skateboard through a lot of the last\nUm Mick Sally by the way also has a chance I think she's going to win in Arizona\nI'm I think she has a really good chance of another really tight race I Would also bring up John James into this conversation we talked to him before he's a ... a Senate candidate but with a great military back row yeah Michigan yeah he's got a much tougher race but he's another great story these guys get no attention but federal because\nI don't know he's he's I guess a good looking guy and he's you know a neck muscles he's gotten their muscles he's very shiny as you may have noticed in the debate I mean\nWe'll he's almost like I said you'd never painted on into it and I look at a shiny thing looking at shiny thing [laughter] [noise]\nYou're listening to the Glenn Beck program am nine Twenty one oh four or five gay media [noise]\nOkay you're a busy business person you're trying to hire somebody and you've got a job site that it's just overwhelming you with tons of the wrong resumes that's not smart here's what he is smart zip recruiter dot com slash back unlike other job sites zip recruited doesn't wait for the candidates to find you it goes out and find them for\nYou zip recruiter dot com slash back has powerful matching technology that scans thousands of resumes identify people with the right skills the right education and experience for your job and then invites them to apply so you get the quality candidates and the qualified people through the door\nFirst and you don't have to sort through things because they already do that and they highlight the best\nPeople it's no wonder that zip recruiters rated number one by employers in the U.S right now you can try it for free at this exclusive Web address it zip recruiter dot com slash back that zip recruiter dot com slash ... dot com\nSlash ... fry it today it's the smartest way to hire\nYou if you've ever experienced heart racing shortness of breath or dizziness if possible you could at atrium relation one of the leading causes of syrup might not be forced to late\nWith cardio mobile the FDA cleared personal EKG device than just Ninety nine dollars to order with a cardio dot com K.\nR.

the school opportunities but for community and\nAnd uh you know we're just appreciate so many people have been so much interest in helping a good things like that happen and then I'll tell you what it's it's amazing everyday to walk through the halls and see the room that the kids have and and the facilities that we have just gives them every opportunity to succeed and that's what works and\nNow James um there's there's a time I saw things going on over and and later on the shelf for those that are listening by the way I Want to mention we're gonna be covering a lot of the events that are

got quite a bit to go over\nAnd just say that uh right now we have a heck of a lot\nThat is just ... but for most or job here and what we doing this show is we make it where um it's it's all about what's happening in our in the human race and and so we like to focus on that and that's why we have a lot of our listeners come on to see what's actually going to happen this week so they don't miss out on us before a\nBrick and Sheila they're here because they've come to talk about an important subject and that's a community matters Congress is coming up and I'm so Rick and Sheila I just want us to just go ahead and tell us give us an overview of what this a conference is all about [noise]\nOkay um this confidence actually came out last spring when we were working with that pack\nThings like that but we had a ... you know we had recent stuff happened I'm at the school and and that we want to go to too much detail about that but there were ... kids that were affected and things that finally somebody spoke up and\nYou know it's important to that not only that you share on social media what's going on about what's happening in your community what's happening around you the bowling they can happen um you know being asked to do things you shouldn't do and what window identify when there's a problem and who to go to\nBecause they didn't largely and I think this is a large part of the school can play and you're already doing um which is apparent by the last that um is getting involved as quick as possible protecting the children keeping them safe and let the parents know that were on top of it and I think it's important to credit you guys\nYou know I think another thing is is I think it's starting to take place at younger ages do you know there's a I Know I Know in junior high and they were I'm doing some smoking and stuff even back in the day but the but I think that just that technology just advances everything in may and accelerates\nWhat I Want to do is on this

I'm Glad you brought up then that plane of local resources because that's one of the biggest um highlights of this community event is we want people to know that we have a lot of local resources right here available to our parents and students\nAnd I will tell you that I personally wasn't aware of all the resources we hadn't yeah community until I started to attend not prevention advisory coalition and there you have represent and representation from\nTri county northeastern ... from the school district from law enforcement church tendencies I mean the the fs you I'm Indian alcohol and prevention is with issues so there's a lot of different entities that fit on that and when you sit\nAnd listen to all the available resources it's amazing what our community has to offer super lucky what\nWhat I thought was really neat is is our number of years back our son I'm needed to go in and and and get some support he was struggling with relationships and you know ... speaking up you know having an opinion and speaking out\nAnd uh the school immediately recognize okay we we we need to find a resource available and the wonderful thing about it was this is the northeast or counseling works very closely with the school\nAnd we took advantage of that and of course now we just catch 'em up um he just he's always speaking his mind but but I but I one thing I really appreciate was was seeing that that that that you guys working together the organizations working together and make it a possible where\nFamilies can can rely on the schools and not knowing that was available and then finding out about it was was great it was nice then with the schools and schools were aware of what\nWas happening and of course he's no longer shy um which which work so um but I think that that's such a wonderful thing for the schools though to work with the counselor so that's part of what you guys working with the coalition\nYes you're absolutely right northeastern counseling has been in a very important stakeholders to the district there therefore if they have ... money that they are ... come into the high school into the junior high and\nI Believe either dishing out we're also has when available to them and so we appreciate our partnership with northeastern kill me\nBut I was just going to say that's what's so great is it really is a community um everyone takes part in\nYou know making sure that her kids succeed and have the things that they need the tools the um the mental tools and it's just awesome to see the resources available for all of us to use and how how much they offer and concerned about the wellbeing of our kids\nWhat one of these uh subject matters is is gun safety now you know that's an interesting thing 'cause you know right now over the past year guns is in the schools have been a huge thing you know and everybody's trying to avoid it and put their head in the sand like us or just you know and in reality is is education is power\nAnd the more we uh you know I I Know that's where the adults you know to come in and to do that but uh\nThat's what we need is that education needs to be in the homes and they understand the safety and how important it is to uh be safe with those and so\nI think education is so powerful that it's very um enabling it helps people to understand I mean whether it comes when it comes to safety on line or is it like you talk games talked about fire safety is is if if the individuals where whether it be a child or in a parent or an adult or a teacher understands that you know why things happen\nAnd um understand clearly the importance of safety or to be on line or like like James is talking about with firearms\nI think that that it enables them make decisions where the lock\nRight the lock or the um the software that prevents them from going somewhere isn't needed any more that we we curtail our our way of our with what our children see through through net nanny or whatever it may be\nBut really the best a filter that we could put on our lives is is education is understanding how things work in and and how to deal with him I Know that from a very young age talking about firearms\nUm our kids uh we we ... we introduced him to fire him from a very young age so they understood what they were all their hands if they weren't strong enough to to to pull the lever back\nAnd they're not big enough to hold it and then we moved to transition of okay now you're strong enough now let's let me show you is is loaded or is that not an educated and I'm On a gun is always loaded unless you check it yourself\nAnd and then if you're not sure don't touch it can get your mom and dad and then you know treat transition to make an age appropriate then when they get old enough they understand how to comfortably work on farms they understand the safety of it and it's not like some of the situation with the kids that have never brought a better on their whole life they think it's a toy gun and something traumatic happens\nAnd so it's taking that excitement away from it and teaching them that it's a tool like anything else like everything's a tool everything we learn the knowledge we acquire the things that we use of social media tools but they could also be used for something that's necessary is\nThat's right you know on on a a couple of more names you're Robin hatch I'm within powering parents in fact she just\nTalking with Rob a little bit uh they've been working really hard for\nA hundred team drinking in a few things that way and has been reducing over the years I think the the statistics you gave us is in the last ten years or under use drinking was dropped by fifty seven percent that's fantastic so that's a great thing and then again I think that just proves the parents like you're saying need to be involved\nWhen you didn't know what our kids are doing when you've been involved in their lives and support them and the things the good things that we want to see him do and be successful and and if we don't then they're going to find other areas to go spend their time and and so\nYou know ... life said the toughest Tucker's during the the gun safety we have a Jacqueline Humphries uh with the diabetes dietitian she's talking about health and good things that are for just optimal helped\nUm let's see we have also a Marcy Tucker's doing um a break out with the vaping the ... the cigarettes are\nInteresting that when she's been a great resource the last few years of you know with our students I'm doing is\nEnric what what's the Julie\nOkay yeah I Am a little lost I Can't even find any reference to what that is\nI Know and it seems to me and that's why we need to come to this conflict [laughter]\nI'm from what I understand it looks more like a flash drive kids can actually plug it right into their computers to charge it and so this is what's wrath is us as educators parents we don't realize our kids are doing because we don't even know that that's what that is and what they can they have the coolest last strike\nThat they're working hard wow and so then I found it on\nThey being you know the the things that way so we actually about a couple experience of this year already with a different items they come in that just hides the\nThey ah ah nicotine and tobacco and all those different ... and it's just amazing what society again comes up with to hide\nThat aren't they being and all the different things that way so we actually have had a couple of experiences this ... year old ready with a different items that they come in that just hides the\nThe ah ah nicotine and tobacco and all those different is a good ... and it's just amazing what society again comes up with to hide right in right in\nYou know we talked we talked last week we talked about this on the show about um the the the we have the proposition for you know they want to approve marijuana use in the state of Utah\nAnd we've spent so much money I mean you guys are in the system you know how much money's been spent on anti smoking anti tobacco campaigns and now we're like well let's say let's just to prove it now obviously the question is what are we approving and and how is the use I mean I'm not a fan of any kind of blowing any smoke in my face or being around\nYour winter basing healthcare has over seven hundred employees who make a difference

the human race in today's show of your host Mike's thing going with James Costello and this is a K V E L I wanted to talk to you I'm a little bit about some of the jobs that are available course with the market James\nI'm getting better there there's obviously there's more jobs out there there's opportunity about some of the areas where people are when they're concerned about looking for a government job of looking for looking in the government sector have a difficult time\nFinding employment a ... year considers is joined us or to be on the show to talk\nAbout the top got top government jobs dot com welcome like\nSo I Want to talk a little bit about how the psych started 'cause I'm you know I talk a little bit about it and I'm ... I think that the the difficult thing people go to they have all these different near your career builder and and different sites you got to go to you got to sign up in a crate profiles hum it some people just get frustrated I just want to find a job they want they want to have to go through the set up and\nAnd kind of the the the\nThe difficulty of getting for all that the the process of finding work if someone's looking for a government job but what tell us a little bit about the site and how it's built in and how that benefits someone is looking for a job within the government's after\nSo when I built the site I set out to um it was initially my wife was working in a public sector HR and um\nShe was after a report of um [noise] different government entities that were hiring and what they were hiring for and um she asked me if I Would uh\nBe able to produce this I'm a I've been an IT for a while and um she thought that I might be able to put together a pork ah that might be able to give us information and so then [noise]\nAh I I went ahead and tried it and then she immediately regretted asking me to do it because then I spent all my time or on the weekends and uh uh when I should have\nBeen helping her do do jobs around the house I was helping her do this so\nI'm the idea behind it is that um [noise] government Web sites don't change very often and job I'm dumb pages on those sites [noise]\nUm he was eventually are usually presented in the tabulation Honda format and soda that data is pretty easy to scrape by on the scene so what my side does is it goes out and uh the technical term for it is it's a real time content aggregator so\nBasically I'm ... anytime the site of loaded I'm I'm pulling data from the specific um entities that are in our database and right now there are fifty two in the state of Utah [noise]\nUm and so we go and we pull all the um data in real time and\nNickel term for it is it's a real time content aggregator so basically I'm ... anytime the site is loaded I'm I'm pulling data from the specific um entities that are in our database and right now there are fifty two in the state of Utah [noise]\nUm and so we go and we pull all the um data in real time and\nUh we don't ask for any user information so anytime I'm you get on our site and you look at a specific job in a in a county that you're looking at you're looking at the information directly from their website a with a with a linked directly to if you don't want to if you don't want to look at our site you can go directly to their so\nMatt just there just to clarify so you're not like monster or career builder where you're you're collecting information and using that information for that business you're you're separate from that you're just basically saying get to get straight to the job we're not going to collect information here's the information that's available\nCorrect yeah I'm not a I'm not interested in ah in saving are storing personal information or selling not to other ... other third parties I'm I'm merely ... interested in the information that's about it\nSo so obviously we know why you did it for your wife for\nThe job she has but why continue to support this or why what because you're not getting anything out of the so what is it you you gain from this\n[noise] well um it's more\nIt's more about what I don't lose so ah the way that I've set it up is a it it's pretty automated um and so I I only spend a couple of hours a week um\nBecause the only time that a link would break with the would be if a a government entity change their their Web site\nSo substantially as the as the break my scraping mechanism um [noise] and that doesn't happen in government very often you know usually in government if you find something that works you stick with it and and it it rarely changes on a whim\nAt least they're consistent right [laughter]\nYeah so um I use that to my advantage and and um so I don't I don't really have to spend a bunch of time I'm fixing the side of it pretty much just run\nSo let's talk about some of the jobs that are available on top of the topic of jobs dot com right now what is the only ones you've seen trending\nUm so the biggest trend um that I'll see public sector hiring is\nI'm of the fifty to instill that that are currently reporting on my site um ... about sixty percent of them are looking for um law enforcement whether it's um whether it's corrections for their jail or whether it's a patrol officer or whether it's\nUm administratively in their sheriff's department are those are the big things that people are recruiting for right now I'm statewide a\nThose are generally pretty good jobs um as far as pensions a salary and opportunity for advancement\nYeah and um benefits are amazing um\nSo ... it's all desert more so as we see a lot of administrators physicians come up are those are the more you don't see those too often or what what do you see on the ministry of side\nUh those don't come up quite as often um but they but they do um\nSo what area what your how far does this site covers so the top so to talk of ... jobs you actually have to go to the sites each of those government entities and add those and to aggregate that information so is it just restricted to Utah or does it go beyond that ... what's your reach what's your borders\nSo we currently have I'm close to a thousand a government entity in agencies 'em over a twenty states and that's mostly the western us\nIt's fantastic case so I'm so for use or just simply just go on there and just put the area they're searching for and it just goes outlooks for positions those specific ones queries that they're looking for right you just put a search field in\nUm ... just a pull up the state they are looking at\nWell okay well we appreciate your coming on explaining that Matt I'm so ... uh the site to go to just wanna make sure that was correct so its top Gov jobs dot com I think in the beginning I said government but at the top ... jobs dot com um and if they have questions on there is there a way for them and say questions to send a send a ... a link or an email back to you from the site that questions\nYes there are um contact us links all over it\nAnd understand that you're not hiring person you're just simply there to help administrate finding the jobs are making those available\nCorrect perfect well thanks for for being on the show map appreciate you explain how the site works um obviously what you're doing is you're donating your time to the community and making it easier for people to find jobs we appreciate you providing a service and that's really what the shows about is providing\nCommunity resources to individuals and families so thank you so much for

journey I basically went on last year a humanitarian work I did in a in a in northern Iraq to help 'em with the fight against ISIS so as a former seal it was a natural fit for me to go and um and help but now I originally thought I was just going to be doing\nYou know the the standard humanitarian thing of handing out water bottles doing a little bit of medical aid\nWell when I got in there um the emails with a group called the free Burma rangers\nWe we ended up in vetting with the Iraqi Army and um basically becoming their frontline medical support because they just don't have the resources to to do that themselves\nAnd so and I was not a medic as a as a sniper and uh but I had pretty good medical training for my time is a seal and so we actually ended up being involved in the direct assault into Mosul um to open up the um to open up the western front in Mosul and finally collapse of the caliphate in in Mosul\nAnd we were in the city for about thirty days from from the data we entered the city to the day that I ended up getting shot on a rescue mission was was exactly thirty days and what happened\nIn in Mosul was just it was something I thought I Would never see in my lifetime UC evil you see pictures of World War two UC Killing Fields use you see these black and white photos and you think I Will never see something like that you know there's a certain amount of denial that you have well I saw it and it was real\nAnd so in the city of death I talk about my experience of going in there and sort of being caught off guard um with the amount of violence and the fighting that was happening but more importantly the acts of heroism on on that on on the\nOn the side of the Iraqi Army and the other guys I was with it was it was amazing um to see these guys laying

not to blame if GOP loses but who cares I mean CNN ... can you just get over it for ten seconds is there nothing\nElse important going on in the world they're not the only ones guilty of this but there is CNN in particular a treat\nLike Donald Trump ...\nLike almost the reverse of a teenager and a boy band it's like the obsession level is he's incredibly high now they're looking at it as a negative instead of a positive but like they just are\nNo not the only ones guilty of that but there is CNN in particular a treat\nLike Donald Trump\nLike almost the reverse of a teenager and a boy band it's like the obsession level is easy credibly high now they're looking at it as a negative instead of a positive but like they just are up with this person yeah I mean it's\nSeemingly there ... all that matters are dominated by him yeah we all that matters the whole thing about living\nRent free in someone else's head I mean it's so on display with CNN right now they can't talk about anything else even when they're talking about other things\nSaudi Arabia yet from Saudi Arabia now Saudi Arabia he's in trouble you know toward the Trump have ties to Saudi Arabia he's talked about his ties to Saudi Arabia\n... somebody up a lie alive the butcher him a lie caught him up and put them in a suitcase and you're looking for a way an angle to get Trump what is wrong with you people that's wrong with\nIt like legitimately like a sickness for some of the ... if nothing else you know but I mean it is it as a network\nAs a whole they can't\nFigure out a way to discuss any other topic it's really incredible I mean he really doesn't dominate their lives every aspect or at least it at least they're public like I don't know maybe they go home and don't talk about it I don't know but when they're on TV they're talking about it all the time that there's got to be something else interesting in the world there's got to be\nWell just look to the headline at Fox they're talking about Elizabeth Warren and you know are Cherokee heritage\nReally\nAgain like all of the story like Elizabeth Warren thing is is interesting 'cause she's gonna be running for president it's a day or two story um I think it's at this point I'm I'm done with it but it was interesting to see her I mean a real flop eared we're talking about when the all time political flops yeah she's tried to\nGet ahead of the story in getting it is a ... it's an important\nBut still it's surprising I Would think that that would be more in the positive in a state like Texas have it this way try this on for size or a\nDonald Trump is everywhere and he is either blamed or excused for everything right\nAnd it's dominating your life just like Iraq Obama was dominating everybody's life um and Donald Trump has a really good side and a really bad side and it depends on what day\nLike ... you know if you support Donald Trump is some days you're like yeah other days you're like oh yeah that can we not talking about today and I know in talking about the ... you know so she is such a big figure in everybody's life\nTed Cruz was a very big picture or big big force in everybody's life two years ago but he's just kind of falling off the map and he's just doing a good job okay mhm I'm\nGreg Abbott is just doing a good job and nobody's talking about nobody's talking about because the state's running great everything's going really well he's a great governor he's not controversial so I think the poll numbers or just\nHow much is this person impacted my life\nIn a kind of in a bad way of oh I got to deal with this again today I got to talk about this again you can get you get older you get into it but the ... yeah yeah yeah and it's not a bad thing about any of 'em it's just like\nOh I'm so tired of this ... you know it's like the closer you get to Washington gravitas here Ted Cruz's in Washington but you know really the epicenter now and with the last president is the White House\nAnd so the closer you get the more you're like oh enough\nYeah I it's it's a it's an interesting thing I mean I it's nice to see I think\nYou know especially if cruises holds onto this race which it seems like he will at the moment or it's going to help a lot of other candidates in really close race but there are six tossup races right now or Arizona Florida Indiana Missouri Montana and Nevada all of them are are very tight I'm a you know\nThe fact that the thirty eight million dollars is not flowing into a race in that group is a real positive for Republicans I did Democrats are very excited about better but I mean his chances of winning are very low\nAnd they've just thrown money at a candidate who has essentially I mean a very small chance of winning I Would say it's no chance but a very small chance of winning and you know that's only benefiting Republican chances of keeping the Senate\nBut they are we here's what's happening they've made him into a national figure ... you know they're already by putting him on Elena y y and Z on that one\nI wouldn't be done to get done he's he's responsible for absolutely nothing right not he's not some like up and coming outsider right like he's the guy who's been in Congress for a long time or he has been in politics for a very long time he's the whole life has basically been politics outside of his early banned years I Swear it's just because they think he's good looking\nBy putting him on Ellen White wine CNN when huh I Wonder if he doesn't get done he's he's responsible for absolutely nothing right he's not he's not some like up and coming outsider right like he's a guy who's been in Congress for a long time or he has been in politics for a very long time\nHe's the whole life has basically been politics outside of his early ... I Swear it's just because they think he's good looking guy and he can he can get a good speech\nYeah I think he's I think it's it's the bronco bomb a syndrome of two thousand for what is this guy done he will he gave a good speech in two thousand four well it should be president what is this guy done well he's been on Allen\nI mean it's it's it's not just that he's good looking I think that there is a\nPart of the Democratic party that does not want to go the Democratic socialism anti capitalist sort of way and Beto doesn't look\nLike that you don't like his ... his power game as Alexandria Ocasio Cortez correct I mean they went ... went through them in the debate yes last night I'm sure some of these young yet but first of all let's start with a hit a Beddoes opening and how you may know\nBeto is a a Hispanic no Hispanic voters name is\nRobert actually ran says here from a Central America I Know a very recently Irish and he uh and he came out and make sure you knew how Hispanic he was ... last Hispanic than war than Elizabeth Warren is chair and I don't know what you're talking about here's a here's the battles open\nFirst case let me thank you and Sarah from moderating tonight's debate tens five for hosting us the people of San Antonio for being here and the people in Texas for watching this and participating in one most important decisions of our lifetimes as ... or ... that is both of us okay I'm In San Antonio\nYes the powerful see how it's panic he is he can't even stop himself from speaking Spanish ... he was trying to speak in English that entire time and just slipped into it because it's so natural for him coming from his deep Hispanic groups and that's something I Want you to make sure you understand unlike ... old white guy\nOr she had gone through knows it on white or who is basic I mean it's so ridiculous Ted Cruz's old a white guy who then they can shoot a year and a half to two years older than a ... ... or Robert Francis Oregon or he's not my palm\n... um anyway so uh this is it was interesting to watch just because you know like as you pointed out crews runs for president he doesn't win a and he's been\nYou know you don't hear from him as often as you did and but he's been doing a great journey through his voting record is very solid I think you know anybody whether you like Trump randomly like uh like the stuff he he votes for\nThe stuff he's doing behind the scenes with the judiciary and I don't mean just the Supreme Court I mean the ah the ah the federal courts is remarkable and will change the course of court decisions for\nVery long time yeah he's been very involved the very involved um however Beto I don't I don't know I mean I get the idea that maybe he's a younger and good looking and can speak coherently I think that's the only thing you can as attractive to a lot of neck muscles yeah a lot of neck muscles a very shiny and well very shining\nBut he um talked about\nAbout Cruz and his motivations remember this is a guy who's brought in it the only story about better off of any note if he's raised a lot of money that is his entire the entire region anyone would ever discussed him because he has raised a fortune but of course he goes after Cruz over money lesson\nSpeeding balancing budgets I'm only one of us has with good friends in El Paso started a small business ... met that payroll every week balanced the books made sure that we deliver for our clients only one of us who served at the local government level every single year balancing the budget thing until they're not as Republicans and Democrats\nBut at the council members entrusted with a ... responsibility to deliver for the taxpayers will pass every single year we did and for Senator Cruz to say that this isn't going to bust the budget at a time of Twenty one trillion dollars in debt when we're on track the deficit spender the tune of a trillion dollars a year\nHe voted to add two trillion dollars and those tax cuts just proportionately will flow to corporations who are already sitting on record piles of cash for any already wealthy in a country that has ribbons with income inequality unseen simple last you'll today why\nIn the days just before and just after that vote Sen Cruz accepted one hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nFrom the political action committees who represent the corporate interests benefited from this sucks 'cause that's why does it go for this why does he vote for Internet companies to sell your private browsing data to the highest bidder without ... why does he not vote for universal background checks in a country that loses\nThirty thousand people to gun violence every year follow the money in each of these cases if you look at the political action committee contributions to Senator Cruz it helps to explain the reasons for his vote and how corrupt Congress has become\nNow again unbelievable hundred and twenty thousand dollars really it's Ted Cruz changing and opinion over a hundred and twenty thousand dollars it's ridiculous if cruise dropped out of the Senate right now he get a lobbying job at some for him and make millions without even thinking about it\nHe was ... I mean he's highly educated his wife worked at Goldman Sachs if we remember this is not just not a money\nIssue or for crews are beyond that of course Beto O'Rourke\nHas accepted or as had many ads run on his behalf ... from ... from PACs and superPACs and he's got that\nLittle uh you know that little line of ... you know I'm not telling them to do it so therefore I'm not responsible more in but again he's raised thirty eight million dollars he's complaining about one hundred and twenty thousand dollar\nDonation to cruise it make some changes opinion was thirty eight million dollars do what does that make you\nI'll tell you what it does I think thirty eight million dollars uh for some uh makes you into a national candidate for another race not this one mhm for others who have given part of that thirty eight million dollars a in large a chunks\nThat just his his them off because I Want results are results I gave you told\nMe that this guy had a chance this guy was going to do it I saw him everywhere and you still got\nBeat and a and a beaten by how much\nWasn't even close where's my money where's my money\nAnd I you know I think that's how people would react to that but\nI I Know people on the Democratic side who have given money who are absolutely that they have given given given and they're like you know I have to tell you\nYou're you're off the deep end with crazy radicals and you're putting up people who do you have who do you have this guy this guy he didn't win I I think that there are some that have given a lot of money that are going to be a little test when a when\nRobert Francis or or [laughter] or has to go back on the you know the night shift of walking the walking the beat like all the other cops in his family [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Vernal", "day": "17"}
