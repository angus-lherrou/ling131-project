spend time in the mountains out on the late ... and having a good time for me the best way to end a good day out in the\nForest is to come home and to relax enjoying it nice comfortable furniture that I've gone from western living we also loved to enjoy spending time out in the backyard at western living we've been able to find nice outdoor furniture that makes us comfortable while we're there and makes us so we feel like we're enjoying our family time and a better quality environment inviting friends over and enjoying the time\nWith family and friends while we eat food that's been prepared on the trigger has been a great highlights or summer Lester living as great furniture\nWe're talking about Google and Larry I've never I've never believed\nIn you know those dystopian movies I've always made fun of them and said yeah there's just this is crazy the you know the corporations out\nTo get you because of their algorithms because they are so all encompassing that is the world were headed towards what do they tell you when they say algorithms that we have to keep that top secret because\nYeah they what they argue is that is for reasons of of a state secret\nUm and and you know that they need to protect their trade secrets they need to be a a you know making sure that nobody gets access to it\nThere's some truth to that but there are a lot of things that they could do to demonstrate um that they're offering a fair product in service to people and here's the thing that they have lied about this before you know ten years ago or so you had other companies like trip advisor and Yelp\nWho are saying that Google was artificially suppressing their rankings in Google in favor of Google owned companies which okay you know Google has the right to do that but here's the thing\nGoogle flat outlined said absolutely not we don't do that our algorithm is pure it's true the best results are regret or our organically at the top well here's the problem the Federal Trade commission the European Union\nProfessors at Harvard University looked at this and said yes you are fiddling with the algorithm you are screwing these other competitors and you're lying\nTo the point is when Google says you can trust the algorithm you can trust us they've lied before and they're lying now and I think the only question that remains really is how are we going to deal with this\nUm you know there's old story that Henry Kissinger said when he was on the national Security Council you give a president three choices do nothing\nTake my solution or thermonuclear war those are your three choices in this case it's kind of like that we can do nothing\nWe can try to deal with some sort of the regulatory issues related with Google or we can break up these companies those are the three options that we have and I think we're really at the point of point number three\n'cause this is not a monopoly like standard oil sands oil that's going to dominate the all marketing business controlling the news flow in the United states\nIs in the end this is in the end theater controlling everything yes Google is ... the most likely company in the America in the American world\nOr to come up with a guy yes who ever\nWho ever gets to a I first\nControls everything there is no way to beat it once you have a guy yes this company is the most likely in the free world to come up with it if we don't have them ... contained in some way or another when they get to a I worked host yes\nYes that's exactly right and here's the thing it's not just\nGoogle the company a lot of people don't realize is I didn't realize this if you use safari on your apple product you're actually using the Google algorithm and that is Google information on if you're using if you are using um Yahoo\nYou're using Google the point being Firefox is Google the all these entities are using the Google algorithm so even if you say I Am not going to use Google dot com you're using unless you are making very specific choices for other options if you using any of those others\nGoogle is the one that's dominated by the way Google pays apple\nNine billion dollars a year Google actually pays apple\nTo be the algorithm of choice for safari that's how much they value this information and want to dominate the space\nSo I Want to talk to 'em a little bit about um what can be done um with the algorithm or I'm\nConcerned about things that I think are really dangerous and deep platform ing and erasing voices right because Google thinks that that is you know that's that's not right that's eight speech we'll get to that when we come back [noise]\nAnd more importantly I think they are analyzing all of us look\nThere's ... this is just at the beginning let me tell you the story mhm you go to Beijing there are three concentric circles of security in Beijing okay this center is the main city of Beijing how many people that you just look it up for and we used to how many millions of people are living in Beijing\nIn the city proper that is the inner circle\nThere is so much monitoring going on they just did a test they release the guy they they uh took a guy mhm pick somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide\nGuy [laughter] they had a picture of the guy and the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then after like an hour or two they gave the the system the picture of the guy and said find him in\nThey uh took a guy ... pick somebody said go into the center of the city just go hide okay [laughter]\nThey had a picture of the guy and the the Chinese tested this new brand new system and then\nAfter like an hour or two they gave the the system\nThe picture of the guy and said find him in eight minutes he was in the back of a squad car\nUnbelievable in ... minutes yes city of twenty two million yeah twenty two million it's amazing in eight minutes yeah so the existence with out AI right this is the kind of stuff that is coming that people really need to pay attention to that's right\nAnd and Google is at the forefront of that they they take a position of pride that they are the forefront of exploiting future technologies real quick though on Gmail this is very important for people to realize that just shows you how far Google goes\nI used to have a Gmail account now what ... does they scan every email that comes into your Gmail accounts and ... ... email you send out you know what else they scan\nIf you ever written the draft email let's say you're mad at your cousin and you know I'm sick of you know cousin Chris and all the crazy stuff he does and you write in late one night you write a draft and you say you know what\nI don't think I'm going to send that to Chris that's just me\nBeing on just a second I Want to make sure this is writing a draft but that's not saving it as a draft correct It's just you ... it counts the delete delete delete delete delete delete it might not even saving it as a draft\nRight correct that's correct scanned by Google so Google knows more about you than you know you can have a very open and completely transparent relationship with anybody in your life your spouse\nYour best friend or whatever the Google knows more about you than they do\nAnd they are very aggressively going to retain that information but they're using it against you here's the key thing it's not just privacy it's manipulation\nBecause they want to take that information and not just sell information advertisers they as part of their mission wants to steer and move your life in a certain direction that they deem is the way the direction your life should go\nThere to be your choice or the ... documentary as the creepy line or ... let me push back in a couple of sure or at least problems I have 'cause I'm with you on Ninety percent of the\nOne issue I have is Google is awesome it all of the products that they make are better than everybody else does products that have similar ... and it it would eat ... incredibly inconvenience me to give up Google because all of their products work better than everybody else's\nJames doesn't know [laughter] more easier because I mean yes they're everywhere but they also do a really good job yeah ... uh when it comes to designing an easy to use\nProduct right how do you break away that that's a great question and it's not easy I mean there are alternatives search a systems out there um but none of them are as good as Google\nAnd it's not really that I don't know I think that a a a road that people will go down that you shouldn't go down that what we should go down is we should be talking to the people in ... no no no\nWe should be sending people who understand this right to Washington because by the time we talked to Washington it's already over we need people who understand the ethics of what's going on with high tech\nIn Washington because they need to have this conversation right now it's not about us changing our behavior right it to the point we must corral Google\nAnd break them up or corral them in some way\nNot just little litigation because I'm a ... litigation but are not with just little simple laws were going to cut because they'll go around that that fire\nRight okay let me ask one other one yeah you said this earlier and it made me very uncomfortable and my suspicion is it makes you very uncomfortable to which is your solution we see we're leaning towards breeding of these companies and\nAs a capitalist as a person who does not want the government involved right or in private business\nI mean how do you how do you how to bridge that guy no I mean I I think that's a great point and I came reluctantly today says I looked at all the possible things to do with Google here's the problem in this space\nThe way that technology is moving how Google exerted some market dominance it really we really do not have a free market in search\nUh it's really impossible in fact one of the guys we\nWe interview the vice president of Yelp or in in our in our a film a and the founder of Yelp said he wouldn't start up today because it'd be impossible Google would smother them the only reason that Yelping these other entities\nHave survived as they have built up enough brand equity when they were founded what Fifteen Twenty years ago to where they can exist so we have a situation where they're truly is not a functioning\nA monopoly and by the way Google's market dominance it's partly related to its political alliance in Washington they pass laws and rules all the time to squelch competition a veteran in Santa Fe and to\nDo things like the platform me yes we are not a publisher we're a platform right then they go in and they edit will now you're a publisher you're not a platform so they play it both ways and they're they have the money to do it\nYes and that's a hugely important point because when they first wanted or it was set up the regulation for the Internet it was if your publisher you're treated as a media company if you're a neutral platform which is what Google and Facebook claim they are they say we're not going to any content they even use the analogy were like a telegraph\nWe're just taking a telegraph message from Peter and we're sending it to Glenn nothing else is happening well we all know that's not true now they're editing a they're censoring so they are acting as publishers but unlike other publishers they don't face the legal or regulatory burdens that they do so twice competition\nOr even the public scrutiny even the public you sound like you're crazy if you talk against Google ... editing\nI Know that they are frightened the when one solution be to make their algorithms transparent\nA and yes that would help but the algorithm is changing constantly and and I do get I Am sympathetic to the argument that this is a trade secret that they work very very hard to develop and they have um I think by breaking them up\nInto pieces and by the way I don't think it's just two companies I think it's several different from your cell so bad [laughter] um I think it would be would be extremely helpful in the way to go on this um because otherwise they're going to continue to re exert market dominance ...\nThe other thing I hear conservatives talk about and I find this terrifying is to make them a utility oh no no [laughter]\nTerrified I don't know what the utilities are like here in Dallas oh no [laughter] we don't really have a we have to open the energy yeah oh that's all we have that good vibe different energy company as in yeah we don't pay anything here like the notion of\nMaking Google a public utility room which really means you're making it a government utilities now means\nYou've got the government controlling the search no I live in a no interest in that whatsoever and what you are seeing is this merging of Google which used to be generally out of politics very little lobbying very little interaction when Brock a bomb was elected in two thousand age\nYou saw this enormous influx of Google people into Washington DC and they stayed so it is now one of the most plugged in if not the most plugged in corporation in America so\nThis notion that there are kind of these wild cat or\nYou generally out of politics very little lobbying very little interaction when Barack Obama was elected in two thousand eight\nYou saw this enormous influx of Google people into Washington DC and they stayed so what is now one of the most plugged in if not the most plugged in corporation in America so this notion that there are kind of these wild cat or out in Silicon valley that are like independent from government is just totally ridiculous I could\nSpend two days with you um I really enjoyed this I'm going to take a hard\nPass on that show where if not by a flower [laughter] yes\nPeter ... is the president of the government accountability Institute the documentary is called the creepy line how do you see it\nOr it's going to be available shortly on Amazon I tunes there's a trailer on the Web page and we love to get feedback\nFrom then it will be it will be on a YouTube I\n[laughter] I think is so much [noise]\nIf you hear yourself saying feel\nPretty good to see somebody rubbed their nose in it who may be addicted to outrage we've expressed are outrageous\nEveryone and everything that is different every thumbs up it's
