from a man who mock sending flames hatred and bigotry is not the root cause but he's spending the flames\nYeah Cathy are you two are you doing that as well is CNN is as anybody else in the media doing that is Twitter fanning the flames\nUh watches rallies and tell me how he leads us into a unified a nation I tell you what Allison in Kentucky I'm going to take her in a minute she was just that one

as maybe my struggling today do you feel like I'm struggling today 'cause I don't feel like I'm struggling to damn I'm a little frustrated at er at the new nation I Would say that and I will I'm frustrated that we concentrate on all the wrong things\nAnd I think that's kind of what you're saying here\nUm let's see these aren't the things we should be concentrating on you know the the the president\nOr being an anti Semite she's his daughter is Jewish\nBut uh you know how many Klan members are cool with that I I don't think any\nRelatively few yeah how many how many Nazis were like oh you know what yeah okay so my daughter's gonna marry that fewer sky she's got to become Jewish that's great that doesn't happen\nIn ... when you're talking about uh American Jews one of the main things they've asked the president for for how many generations what's the mood the capital package Ruth alum\nAnd this is the guy that did it I mean he you know look\nOh you know what yeah okay so my daughter's gonna marry this Jewish guy she's got to become Jewish that's great that doesn't happen\nAnd when you're talking about uh American Jews one of the main things they've asked the president for for how many generations was to move the capital package roost alum\nAnd this is the guy that did it I mean he you know look it's insane it\nBoils down to these ridiculous ah summaries\nOf what a person believes they are you telling me you can't criticize someone on the on the left\nThat you disagree with politically because they're Jewish because then you get called an anti Semite the same way like a liberal should be able to criticize without fear of being called a racist Clarence Thomas they should be able to say I think he's wrong on the on the constitution they should absolutely be able to do that without being called racist\nBut this this bizarre thing and this is carried out today not by\nYou know a mother Jones in the Huffington Post read expected but every mainstream media source asking question after question every question what part of it gave me a percentage tell me please how much of this is Donald Trump's fault so here's let me let me do what\nThe Allison just said let's make a tangible here is Joe Lieberman on a very frustrating interview with CNN listen to this\nWell it's just shocking moment I mean I we view it all through our own experience I I have had a life as a Jewish American which has been his not only free of anti Semitism\nBut I've had the opportunity to be elected senator from a state Connecticut where the Jewish population as well to present and then our board gives me the chance to run for vice president first Jewish American on a national ticket\nOr that really didn't know I face no anti Semitism\nA and the forgive me required by the end of the ... election we actually got five hundred thousand more votes than the other ticket ... which is a reflection in numbers that people were voting are based on religion so when something like this happens\nIt's shocking and it changes that reality but I Believe the reality is that the American people are very fair minded not bigger than you saw it in the wholesome reaction of the neighbors who are not Jewish ... Pittsburgh and then the elected officials there it was very genuine\n... and of course this is not please CNN this is not what they want it had a job and they didn't bring him on to say that he had a good experience as an American and they bring him on to say\nPositive things they brought amounted to clarify exactly what portion of this is Donald Trump's fault\nTell us so we don't have to say it say he's responsible so we can have plausible deniability that that that this is exactly what we believe we don't want to come out and say at five thousand times we'll just have to wait you say it OK\nIs essentially the way they lead into this next question and again he is not giving them what what they want to hear some\n... believe that there are those who received those to be anti Semitic dog whistles when you see them at one of the closing ad campaign George Soros a Janet Yellen more Blankfein from Goldman Sachs with dark ominous pictures and talking about the money and the international banks question okay is that something that that sends a message\nThere all the first thing I Want to say is that in my opinion this brutal murderer in Pittsburgh really had to wear was committed by a\nHateful loner who was probably more stimulated by a a anti Semitism then a social media than anything else going around um he ... he was against a President Trump but it's a real a real I I was glad to see that this website as big an so down\nA for a while and and all the social media people have to ask whether they're becoming vehicles\nFor this kind of hatred but more generally I think all of us a half to ... beginning with the president democratic and Republican leaders in Congress people in the media financial media and the more of\nAn unconventional social media have to ask ourselves to what extent are weak contributing\nTo the division in our society Charlie Dent that I work together in a group of No Labels trying to overcome or the way the parties have become like worrying tribes\nBut this goes beyond yet which is ... and then the one that is a what would I say\n... when the president makes a a sort of statement about unity ah let's presume for an urge them to build on it and then think about ways in which a he can act so that no one can ever say\nA ... he somehow was responsible for violence or or hatred again that the\nThe the Joe Lieberman forty seven minute response ah but I mean you get the summary there I mean first of all this guy was not pro Trump\nNot I mean he was viscerally\nAnti Trump in a way of\nHe you know what I don't like about Donald Trump is he's too nice to Jews that is essentially what the guy was saying on a\nSocial network over and over and over and over again and so he was not a pro Trump guy to shut up this or the synagogue\nA and you know like if it's important to make that distinction and how do you bring people together the exact opposite of what CNN is trying to do in that clip ... I mean without ... just in the nicest Joe Lieberman possible way right but what are you saying is what you're doing right now\nBy trying to make this into a situation where Trump has blamed what we should do it wrong what we should do instead is when he says something that we think helps the environment we should praise it sure certainly generally speaking we have an issue with our discourse I think I think almost everybody would agree with that\nUm but when it comes to the shooting it's not related right\nSo here's what the media should have done this weekend the media should have said okay so what role does rhetoric on social media and from the president and from the press and everything else what role does media play in in in the life\nOf a guy who as we saw this non white male um ... tried to commit with a with a pipe bombs\nThe guy was nuts the guy was absolutely nuts he was a loner she had finally found the cause that he could you know rallied behind she ...\nYou know was

apparently a you know as Ron ... rightfully said uh this weekend on Fox News that you know these very ill and anti Semite can come from any side of the political spectrum\nAnd if you look at the persecution that has taken place and this was something that the president writes the Jews have endured terrible persecution over the years\nWe've read it we've studied it they've gone through it all

guess it was on news busters of home the dump the\nOh I understand that CNN doesn't like fake news and they don't like being called fake news but they are fake news and other news organization anymore\nThey have gone fulltime destroyed Trump every second of every minute pretty much of every day\nThat's what they do so they have this panel I guess if they put together\nAnd they're talking about what happened in the synagogue shooting and we have to look closely at the poison being spread sometimes on television sometimes out of the mouths of political leaders and often times on ugly dark corners of social\nMedia yeah it can be pretty ugly and it goes on the first panelist as Bill Kristol or never Trump her he attacks Fox News\nI'm like hello what we can't have conservatives in my I support mainstream conservatives a bill I don't know what happened to you\nI support original is on the Supreme Court I support lower taxes less government burdensome regulation I support energy independence\nI support legal immigration I support border security I support peace through strength and the tough national security posture with a strong military to defend the values that we all believe it\nAnd I support you know a free press even to be wrong even criticize the media for being role at a Washington Post columnist comes out some woman I've never heard of Margaret Sullivan\nYou know her praising or analysis in the Democratic threats et cetera et cetera reads like a list of Sean Hannity's fried broad ... broadcast crib notes\nAnd that is asked point blank if she blame people on the right like Kennedy for the violence\nAs a martyr about this this week uh with regards to the bomb attacks or the suspicious packages you said you know looking all this target city this reads like a list of Sean Hannity's pre broadcast ... notes that was the way you put in your washing postpone getting are you blaming the hands of the world\nI think they have a share of I'm sort of the you know revving up of hatred um without regard for a life of fact my feet and without much regard for the truth I mean the way things are being patch\nOn Fox and and a pro Trump right wing media is

targeted\nConcessions have perverse incentives to gin up their base for elections\nI think a cable news has incentives to a gentleman anger and anxiety and passion for ratings same thing with websites with clicks and tweets\nUh I agree with everything that we've set so far today the only thing I Would add is tomorrow it could be Sean Hannity who was targeted for a Republican congressman who was targeted\nAnd while I agree with the condemnation of what Fox has done in terms of getting off this anger over the caravan I think that this is a much more widespread problem\nWell it is more widespread than I have had far more instances and I'm willing to talk about a real credible threats towards me and my family including the one that I did share last week with white powder purported\nTo be anthrax sent to a my office and one of my employees having to spend an entire day in isolation scared\nOut of her mind and it's been worse but obviously these people are not listening to what I'm saying\nBecause I have been saying we've got to know what what do I advocate I'm like okay I Want I Want these principles stood up for\nI fight for the American forgotten men and women I fight for lower taxes less pure bureaucratic regulation energy independence Supreme Court nominees that believe in the constitution\nI Believe we should secure our borders legal immigration these are things I I Believe that my entire life and career a strong military security for the American people a strong stand against evil in our time\nIt's not that complicated\nI Know what the democratic agenda is if they win it's gonna be okay we want to impeach Trump endless investigations they said they want their crumbs back we know they support sanctuary cities open borders and the elimination of ice and they think Obamacare works and it doesn't\nYou know you had an MSNBC you know literally pressing the Israeli ambassador termer to blame Trump for the synagogue attack that's how sick it's gotten\nYou know ABC Trump is at the center of all the political violence no he's not but I guess it's an easy blame game\nSo now we've taken the predictable every two four years Republicans are racist and sexist and massage therapist and Xena phobic Islamic phobic homophobic and they weren't dirty air and water and they want children to die and they want granny thrown over the cliff and now it's that they are somehow inciting violence in the country no they're not\nIt's not true it's never been true and it's not any conservative\nI Would ever support and then the case of this guy that shot up the synagogue it was a very ill an anti Semite who also hate and Donald Trump but that doesn't stop them from saying and literally advancing\nThat narrative\nThis is you know watch watching

something when the media lies twenty four seven and they get called out that's too bad that is not a call for violence\nUnbelievable the times that we're living in\nNow here is um where we are the Senate is interesting 'cause there's two races you can add maybe to the let's watch call and I would say\nThat would be West Virginia where Joe Manchin is down by two in the latest poll and Menendez is barely hanging onto a lead in New Jersey by three now do I think both of those races are going to be won by Republicans\nAh maybe West Virginia New Jersey it's hard for possible people in New Jersey clearly\nFed up with Menendez then I think it's too close to call in either the gubernatorial race I have no idea why\nFloridians are flirting with Gil almost got a radical agenda in Florida Rick Scott's done a fantastic job as governor and he'd be a perfect complement but the Republican majority in the Senate\nI think Marsha Blackburn hangs on we got Josh Hawley now in the lead in
