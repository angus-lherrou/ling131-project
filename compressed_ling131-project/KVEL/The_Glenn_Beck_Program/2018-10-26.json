times is saying about this I can now there's of course we all know we all know let's rush to judgment\nKavanaugh was of course a gang rapist and these bombs are clearly Donald Trump's fault\nOkay here's the New York times or none of the devices harm to anyone and it was not immediately clear whether any of them could have weight\nBecause these are ... are very dangerous yeah I mean in fact uh shows the level of sophistication I that's what I heard from CNN these\nPipe bombs show a level of sophistication ... what's the New York times say now I'm One law enforcement officials said investigators we're examining the possibility that they were hoax devices that struck did to look like bomb would not have exploded wow now you may uh you may have read the story from the New York times\nThat well they never gave us really any details on then\n... ... well you probably didn't get to a paragraph thirty four\nAh that's where ... you know you know how you know how like Jewish people read from a right to left we read left or right\nMm okay mhm I with the New York times it's like reading a foreign language I like to read the bottom up a lot of good stuff towards the end when you get to the bottom you start with the bottom it is funny because usually the headline doesn't matter I mean\nUh some bomb technicians who studied the\nPhotos of the device that circulated on social media suggested the bombs that the CNN had the hallmarks of fake\nExplosives ha kind more typically depicted on television and movies rather than devices capable of detonating almost like a Wylie coyote kind of almost a digital clock was taped to the middle of the plane of feature that experts say is typically shown on fictional\nBombs in an attempt to ratchet up dramatic tension ah but I'm very in real life\nI'm ... in fact the fact that go on the New York times in fact bomb makers generally avoid attaching visible clock and to their devices really cheap\nFrom tipping off their target and you know about when the bombs are that to explain it was just it like a nice little clock they were sending to these people for their debt [laughter] that's what I thought it looked at that and you're like that's not a bomb years ... years of bone is if you survive\nAll it it got an handler was one hundred percent survive abilities so far on these bombs one hundred percent survive ability\nWe're is weird now look it could it be a ... I think here's a plausible scenario that somewhat on the right did this okay someone on the right who really does not like all these figures decided that they wanted to send a message to all these figures but aren't actually or murder they want to scare the hell out of them but they didn't actually\nWant to kill they wanted to let her they pull you want to know when you could be doing to this country let let me show yet and they're crazy they were wrong elderly horrible despicable and every letter words murderers and so they built this to look like my boss\nThese figures decided that they wanted to send a message to all these figures but aren't actually murdered they want to scare the hell out of\nThem but they didn't actually want to kill they want to let it all you want to know what you could be due into this country let let me show yet and they're crazy they were wrong elderly horrible despicable and every what words murderers and so they built this to look like Bob\nIf you look on I mean you get the example of it on social media all the time I mean if we couch it all the death threats and horrible things that you get on social media as real all the time\nYou'd have to have a staff of salads and checking them all out mhm instead you know most of the type people the crap on social media that goes way too far and that they're actually intend to do it they don't intend\nOn a you know you thought that that happened to for example Dana lash right like have to take all those things seriously when she was on TV uh she got all sorts of threats on her family and they did take them seriously but like\nAs far as I Know at least no one actually\nActed on those things thank God\nRight do you have these serious threat that come into public figures often and sometimes they don't wind up panning out most of the time right and even ego to look at terrorists I mean the the amount of people in the middle east who say that they would uh execute a terrorist attack on on people who are\nOn you know people from another country for example you know just take it is so high it incredibly disturbing you almost would never walk outside if you really how many millions of people will tell pollsters that yet I Would kill American citizen\nHowever obviously they're not doing it right whether it's because they're not capable of doing it or whether they're a in reality they just want to send a message or they really don't like them but I'm not going to go kill someone whatever the reason it and that could be the situation here could be the same thing from a someone on the left\nWho wants to make the right look bad a week before the election or sending me things around with no intention of killing anyone but wants to make me big media circus you things are all plausible possibility we have no role and know that other than the fact that these were all political figures and none of the bottom seem to work in the really all that all the information we have right now well\nBut the issue here is on the freaking NBC yeah you can spirit us ally early for mentioning it but you know like Jimmy you're going to give Jimmy Fallon the top but placing your network so what\nShe said was weight but if you are if you are holding somebody up if you're if you're making fun of them okay but if you're holding somebody up like this woman who you know with\nDiana Ross she liked Diana Ross you unlike Diana Ross for the night and she's not making money and she's not making fun of Diana Ross\nWell isn't that what Fallon did actually didn't asked the question he just ... yeah ... ... ...\nYou brought up a great point yesterday and I thought about that says we're getting close to we're getting close to Halloween\nThe ... the biggest deal in the world was made of finally African Americans have a superhero Black Panther\nFinally they have one finally after all this time we have in them super hero and one that actually people want to meet with the white kids and like he might not want to be so if you're white\nSun decides he wants to be Black Panther um and I think that it's\nNow of course as a father I Would be like sorry dude you're going to be surprised to hear this but knew you could not do that like we have no awareness of race but I mean if it what he's\nTrying to do is to you know the the one of his heroes who happens to be African American and he obviously notice the difference in characteristics that I mean is that a\nA horrible horrible thing for a child to consider some of course not to be horrible of a black person dressed up as Superman\nNo no no no but wait if they put on white face that Superman no I mean it seems it seems ridiculous you wouldn't do it\n'cause you don't ... I don't see a Superman is white or black he's just as Superman it doesn't matter but because of the name of the show was white Superman plaque Lance and try to game I just got this from a an African American a friend of mine who I'm not going to name because I'm afraid that they will be targeted\nJay Lynn what about white face literally this\nMorning my son in eleventh grade said he and his friends want to be white chicks from the movie white chicks\nI thought it was funny but I don't know especially as soon [laughter] people will take what's supposed to be funny or and there'll be overly offended by it and start this back and forth drama that none of us need\nUh we live in a white community ah and I literally said I think this is going to come back to bite you later I never thought I'd have to tell my kids that\nFrom an African American [laughter] ... amazing\nAnd you know it may not they're not may not be a backlash for going the other way for blacks dressing and white faces\nThe white community ah and I literally said I think this is going to come back to bite you later I never thought I'd have to tell my kid that from an African\nAmerican [laughter] miss a thing [noise] amazing\nAnd you know it may not they're not may not be a backlash for going the other way for blacks dressing and white face\nThat movie came out different things on their hands on the political climate now yeah there would have\nNever been before everybody thought it was funny yeah there would have never been but because of the political climate because people are you know you can't even talk about it this is Ken so what did we learn from Megan Kelly\nThe only reason for even ask that question ... chair even asked the\nQuestion here is a woman who is one of the smartest people on TV she is as sharp as the sharpest razor we all worked with her we all know\nYou screw with Megan Kelly and she will connect you to ribbons she is wicked wicked smart agree oh ... okay yeah so here's this woman\nWho is working at a place that hired\nHer and then my theory is they hired her because they thought oh she's a great investigative reporter she's great as an interviewer 'cause if they get at the time they were getting more yeah she was a huge get\nAs soon as the end they all thought this was going to be great\nThey put her in and then the social justice warriors all in the network it outside of the network oh my goodness how could you possibly she worked at Fox News and then they realized no crap\nWe're ... we're in trouble now with all of the fringe that we thought would be cool with anything that we do now all the social justice warriors and so they needed a way out they have\nPersecuted her persecuted her all the way through so what happens they see this opportunity she's asked\nA question that's it she's just says well wait a minute is this wrong so here's what we learn that even one of the most powerful celebrities one of the most powerful educated women\nIs so frightened by the social justice mob inside NBC but the very next day this very bright woman\nWho knows who she is goes on television crying literally you can see it in her face crying she's so frightened by these people that she says\nI'm Sorry I I I've learned a lot well what did America learn America didn't look at I mean this sincerely mean this absolutely sincerely\nPat stew can either of you give me a note on politically correct reason why this is so offensive to wear black face like Diana Ross if you are not making fun of\nHer you're not you're not you're you're an inspiring to be someone you admire right can either of you give me a non politically\nCorrect answer in other words you can use a political correctness well because people will be upset nope nope no tell me why ...\nWell the only reason I have is is the one from our ochre and uh which is which was that this was used to sort of as a battering ram against blacks in the twenties and thirties\nOK okay middle hang I may say on of right sure apps and it was the ... top impersonated exactly right exactly right and that's the twenties thirties ask any millennial ask anyone under thirty\nWho's Mr

you ask people who've Mr Bo jingles if they don't have any idea didn't may have been in the twenties and thirties but it's not today\nAnd again that your broker still inserting\nAnd older pop impression they really were not followed by making ... wait a minute left in\nOver at the top impersonation like Sarah Silverman did with giant cartoon lips mhm uh you mean like ... like what\nUh what's his name distributed him I mean chemical or Damien foul and we're going to study in Philadelphia a Robert Downey junior\nA in a in a Tropic Thunder I mean the blackface is not a ...\nIt's been

matter how\nUgly the speech is the first amendment a member of the press is being silenced by you for asking a question now you may not\nOr you may not have agreed with this question because I can see

[noise] no\nCrime bomb bill O'Riley [noise] I Want to start a with something that John Casey a said yesterday because he was on CNN and boys and he the voice that we should all be listening to listen to what John Case it said about the um\nThe caravan coming from a Honduras\nThey're marching north and you know what it could easily have been all of us that we're in the caravan there were marching north trying to save our families and save our children\nWe got to start putting ourselves in the shoes of other people we've got to start thinking about the consequences that others suffer and we've been spared those by the grace of God let us be let us be appreciative let us count are blessed say stop I let us take\nThem anymore bill we're within six hours my crack\nTeam found out who these people were what the real intention was a and the the press and John cases still or just say no no no these are good people want to talk a little bit about uh the Caribbean\nYeah I'm a first of all I Know case it's a long time he used to a sub from me once in a while on or a factor on a Fox I'm a good man a very sincere Shabab running a Ohio\nBut John ... is a theoretical guy he's not a real world guy and people want to know that\nSo you basically saying Americans we have to put ourselves in the position of somebody in Honduras\nWho uh is poor and oppressed because the society down there as violent and out of control okay but then what is the point of that exercise is governor case that we allow everyone in Honduras to come to Ohio\nEvery one\nAnd the same thing with all the poor countries in the world because that's what your spouse thing by saying that the caravan people should be allowed to seek asylum in the United states that's what you're saying everyone can come here and do that\nWe wouldn't leave for a night now California would be a foreign country within Eighteen months\nRight for a year backlog right now of asylum um [noise] uh hearings and if you apply you are in the country you're here\nFor three years at least okay what do you do arrows fifty percent of all immigrant families both illegal and legal are on means tested welfare so there's a warning to chance that the American taxpayers are going to have to pick up some of your bills\nTwenty two trillion dollar debt right now for the usa\nSo if you look at the unintended consequences of John ... six\nVision of compassion it's not compassionate all you're basically wrecking a system that does provide true opportunity for three hundred and twenty million Americans should they\nDo what they need to do to succeed you reckon that system governor case it do not understand that\nSee I can and that's the debate I mean I just crush them in the debate because he would have no answer for any of that\nBill tell me who's behind this who's financing this\nWell I Do believe it's the progressive crew um the George Soros people um because\nThat was done it in the past that we did a big thing on Bill O'Reilly dot com last night about\nOr any of that bill\nTell me who's behind this who's financing this\nWell I Do believe it's the progressive crew um the George Soros people um because that was done it in the past that we did a big thing on Bill O'Reilly dot com last night about sorrows after CBS glorified and we said no\nI'm he's pumping in two thousand Eighteen this year alone tens of millions of dollars into the worst organizations and by that I mean\nThey attack and smear anyone they disagree with David ... runs one of them that's the media matters guy and I don't tell me that's you know this was a bit Evelyn man so I Believe that these\nKinds of people I Can't prove it because there's no accountability and on doors but I Believe they're behind a big ... big money the idea is everybody knows\nA bill I and I invite you to read what even the president of on tourists as saying I'm this is this is backed by a cube of ah Venezuela a and ousted president of Honduras\nAre that are blaming the United states for all of the unrest\nAh the former president says that ah America's gonna have to pay for all of this uh they'll have to accept our citizens this is just an ongoing internal battle\nA in Honduras that has quite honestly lied to many of their people um and said that America's gonna have to take you and they're going to because they're responsible for this that this is a Marxist a revolutionary\nUh that uh has tried to take Honduras by force the Supreme Court two branches of their government\nFound what he was doing to be unconstitutional and kicked him out and he's been causing problems ever since and now he Venezuela in Cuba are together and what was formerly known as all but but they are is that the United states and they're the ones financing at least the beginning of it\nThat's how it started now sorrows or others may be involved but I haven't seen any evidence of that yet but I Would not put it past them\nRight and and it would be interesting to see if there is a pipe line of cash going into your kid to goose ago so this is what I say I'm skeptical of everything and I agree with you there has been no hard evidence put forth the George Soros or people like him do this but if\nYou know it's it's one of his things they've done in the past yes but the the government of Honduras should be able to trace foreign money coming into that country back they should be able to show people this is what has arrived here\nSo\nI Hope they do that if they if they believed Cuban bed as actively involved in subverting their own country on doors and and by extension hiring the usa may have the ability to find that out\nThere or let's go there are two other groups that are being formed now are two other waves that are supposedly following this one uh and I would love to hear when we come back what you think the president should do uh what do you think it looks like\nIf they do arrive at the border are and how the press is going to treat this and what do sane Americans do to counter that when we come back with Bill O'Riley [noise]\nThese people only facilities that they are the water they need food Mexican people are poor\nThere's not the infrastructure to support their so yeah so how do they\nWould love shanty towns there with a mothers and babies and look at the United states they're rich and look at these people and what the man sure but the Mexican government I'm telling you is under tremendous pressure by the Trump Administration not to allow any of this to happen\nSo so um how do you move seven to fourteen thousand people and just find enough water how is this not a humanitarian crisis\nDisaster but they have it set up where by there are tens who paid for those tense\nYou know you would raise the media would care now [laughter] you\nDon't want to you know pictures of the poor baby and you're older and you know but the mother no no no building you\nKnow they care so much about the humanitarian side of this you ... you might think that they would find out is there enough baby formula yeah who is paying for it\nOr I look we've been all that isn't over this over this we don't have a a a on us press in America anymore which is enormous story that is not being covered by the ... is president going to cover themselves so these guys like you and me we do it but\nThere are enough baby formula yeah who's paying for it\nRight or ride it look we've been over this and all that it's been over this we don't have a a a honest press in America anymore which is enormous story\nThat is not being covered by the decide this president going to cover themselves so these guys like you and me we do it but you know the most of the American people feel that we do have a functioning on us for us and we don't\nLike any level let me ask you this there was a story out this week and I know you touched on it about the um one in for college students were in Korea all distress I ... in response to the Trump election twenty five percent said they felt like they had P. T. S. D.\nYeah this is at Arizona State university um and the intent pay 'em and and look it just an ongoing indicator\nThat there is a\nSegment of the American population are under the age of thirty who cannot cope with life and that's why you're seeing the rise of opioids are opioids you seeing this whole thing it all plays into\n... we just can't handle it yep\nWe can't handle any stress no stress so I didn't have any you know we we have Mike Rowe aggression I Know I'm offended by a fine I'm offended by a speaker I'm offended by a hat I there's a frog over there yeah offends\nMan [laughter] can you imagine when they have children like Josh they're not going to be able to get up in the morning\nOr it's for those people will fail they will fail in our system is our system not going to change is going to be competitive it's going to be self reliance that the progress has would love to change it\nBut it's not going to change in our lifetime and these people who have all of this anxiety about Donald Trump being present or whatever else it may be are going to fail in the marketplace\nGoing to give you an opportunity to address Megan Kelly anything to say about making Kelly\nI think I

very nice person to me and many others at Fox many others and went on her way and now it's not looking so good but\nI must say between how young are wants\nTo revel in anybody's a discomfort\nRight I

this specific case about a woman who loved Diana Ross when is Diana Ross how is that offensive and losing your job\nIn our PC culture now and this ties and it was it so ironic because ms Kelley one of the biggest boosters of meat to um which of course um does not\nUh take into account uh due process so now did she get due process no she did not know her comments may have been a ... to her in offensive but if you know your history\nI'm black faced entertainers in America we're used to denigrate African American\nAnd she she she knows that she should have known it you know what she does um\nNo I don't know about that back I really don't know if she if she knew that or not because you could have easily pointed that out and a couple of paragraphs before going into any kind of defense of it and she did not but in our in our media society now\nIf you say anything out of the PC line and then that work arena or if you're attacked by me to situation in the network\nArena your career is over there is no due process no presumption of innocence no benefit of the doubt you're out\nIs it around and get all that there are so many people on the left in the journalism that are celebrating her demise or\nNot all of its celebrating as much as\nIt's a virtue play you see this is what has arisen all these left wing commentators see themselves as virtuous oh Meghan Kelly or did you see what

Trump responsible for this as any logical person that ever seen anything to do with our legal system would be able to do it um but you know again we were not going to know enough about this this is but this is a product\nOf the world we are creating now and that is all of us all of us are creating 'em and you know it's not going to stop until both sides realize it until the media says\nThe holy family ... and the pope and all of the pro life activist from all the time right and you could drive\nOne of those crazy anti abortion bans into your driveway and those people are going to say you know we have standards yeah you're not\nThe most anti ... you could be living in a neighborhood with the holy family mhm and the pope and all of the pro life activist from all the time right\nAnd you could drive one of those crazy anti abortion bans into your driveway and those people are going to say you know we have standards yeah you're nuts\nI just really hope if Jesus comes back or he's not in the van [laughter] you know if he comes in a white van with you about your bumper stickers people are not going to buy it they're just like I don't believe this guy there's no way of like that and again you're not supposed to know what's coming\nRight oh maybe that's how he met us how he does he comes back maybe that's how the anti Christ gums [laughter] that I Would I Do [laughter] well no no no because I wouldn't be slick enough he would have you know he'd\nBe oh my gosh well\nPlug yours too okay he's the guy who would try to say we should round up all the people of hand the anti Christ would be the first one and go [laughter] you know these people are nuts I Would\nBe a good suspects I don't know why such a irrelevant particularly I don't care if I used to live out his views the driest what why will surely a settlement wow I didn't see that one coming that's like what like the really bad like\nLifetime movies where they're trying to give you the big the big switch through and like it's like a it's a you know it's a rape case and you know the whole time they put you to this one person and it's a very last second you know a guy she walked by for three seconds in the grocery stores the guy\nWho did and you're like come on of course we didn't see that coming it's a nobody [laughter] well You're welcome on the anthrax there you go wow same plot twists\n[laughter] I don't know if I feel comfortable employing the anti Christ so I'm just going to concentrate on the mail bomb suspect that's just been arrested in Florida\nYeah I ... I cannot believe there's not a journalist who was taking the high quality photo disadvantage\nHouse it's possible they're all zoomed out from you know the helicopters and you can't quite see exactly what it says I Will say you know by all appearances it does appear to be a pro Trump propaganda and now it's it's sort of difficult to see\nYou know like for example a\nThere's a shirt that was around in the elections are a lot that looked like a a Hillary a presidential shirt and then it said a message on dirt that said something like a lock her up twenty twenty or twenty sixteen\nThey get could theoretically be alive anti Trump stuff but I don't think you I think that I'm just reading the fish in pretty deep picture I Do this all the time for the uh for the level after you know like you're trying to find okay what is the\nOne circumstance that we can be missing here and maybe that's it but it does seem to be\nA a his face and the presidential seal pretty clearly on one of the windows but again you know\nThe the media can and try to make this out to be well Trump supporters were you know evil bombers ... you know and and again we didn't do that with all Bernie Sanders support no they all people who have ... we didn't say that I was ... going to shoot someone on a on a on a field yeah\nAnd that guy was successful that guy actually almost killed people this one didn't assume didn't and we didn't say that when we could have with the Bernie Sanders guy\nAnd you know there's a couple of reasons why number one this stuff happens right right wing people do crazy things to there's there's plenty of them on the right as well that there are plenty of crazy does not go to one party when you get these fringe levels there are people on both sides who do it um there's a there's an ideology and we've talked a lot about this that affects many on ah the very harsh left\nOf going back to you know examples like Bill ... weather underground and we saw this with the Occupy Wall Street where there is some ID ideological reasons why certain types of violence come from the left more often but still there's crazy people\nAll over the spectrum you just said you don't want to do it because your size probably need some dumb leader and you're gonna get blamed for it but beyond that it's just ... correct\nWhen people people are responsible for their own actions when you were an individual you act as an individual and the person who says something that you listen to it was not responsible for how you take that information and how you deal with it not to mention it may or not may have nothing to do with that at all\nYou know just because you happen to be a the he happens to be a a a Trump supporter does that make ... make Trump's making Trump's fault that he's doing these terrible thing no and the same thing would apply as it did apply to a Bernie Sanders by the way that just a fan but campaign volunteer\nBut if you're working to get the guy elected who then went and tried to shoot twenty five Republicans on a baseball field but again not Bernie Sanders fault at all not his fault at on his fault zero percent ... and the same thing would be it would apply here if this is how this thing turns out a little more to find out\nI I Will tell you this think how fortunate we are\nIn a couple of things um\nGo back to the bombing of the bridge in Cleveland you remember about that you remember that and even remember anybody Mueller dealer you remember when Occupy Wall street was taught by the FBI on their way to the bridge I think they had part of it even why or did they have any of it wired\nBut they were going to blow up bridge in Cleveland ah and they had the capability of doing it\nAnd thank God the FBI caught them but that never made any news you know they would have made huge news of the Tea Party would have been doing at rice for what they didn't they you know Occupy Wall street all those are just crazy kids you know they're just they're in the Scooby Doo van there just crazy kids\nUm let's see how fortunate we are that that didn't happen how that could have torn apart think about the blessings that\nNot a single bomb went off that this guy may have been so damn crazy that he really thought\nWell I don't have any gunpowder by I'm pretty sure ... sand gets hot\n[laughter] uh you know this guy is is I mean you want to talk about incompetent um how fortunate we are that none of these bombs went off if any of these bombs would have gone off and hurt or killed or maimed people from the other side\nThe world would be a different place today the media would be going crazy because look at how they're going crazy now well\nGood news looks like we may have caught the guy yeah it's interesting and now they're starting to you know we're getting to that point where people are starting to share pictures of what appears to be the van which does appear to be very pro Trump also very pro soccer\nAnd [laughter] it's an odd combination of things to be I Would I Would I Would not assume John's a big soccer fan but who knows a but will ah [laughter]\nI Will say these things checkout again everyone roasted soccer people well we said how long have we said that yeah I think we are I think we blame the world were up [laughter]\n[noise] oh my gosh the world cup for routine there it is a higher it is all going back to the
