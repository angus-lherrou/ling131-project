I'm\nSo that was pretty out there um that one was was really out there I think it's I don't know maybe the one about the the feminist spiritual spirituality meetings in poetry it's a little more out there but\nIt's probably close to the most\nWell live list finished the dog park this one was accepted and reviewed uh some of the reviews is a wonderful paper incredibly innovative rich and analysis extremely well written in organized\nA yadda yadda I Believe this ah intellectually and in Paris in ... exciting paper must be published and congratulated the author on the research done and in the\nWriter a and in the right yeah yeah\nThat was that low to the most disturbing parts of this I feel like we can see it again it wasn't like these ... these journals looked at this and didn't really go through it and kinda just it made its way through the process there are very specific comments from dozens\nOf reviewers who are on the ... who are doing peer review and saying specific things that you wrote that are completely ridiculous or ... amazing new accomplishments in the field I mean that had to be while funny and it proved your point had to be really disturbing as well\nOh yeah that's by far what we consider to be the most important evidence that were gathered in the process of of this project with that the papers it got published or that they are award in some cases are one case and all of this it's fine and it says a lot in a disturbing\nBut the reviewers comment show that the ... peer reviewers which it worked out between two and four or five or paper so we ended up with something like\nForty five or fifty total a set of comments\nThey they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they\nSaid our analysis was good winter analysis was terrible they didn't raise an eyebrow\nPeer reviewers which it worked out between two and four or five or paper so we ended up with something like forty five or fifty total a lot of comments they they really did engage with what we did they really looked at it they\nSaid our analysis was good winter analysis was terrible they didn't raise an eyebrow about the data we gather the idea that um you know the dog park paper contains\nA bit of a completely irrelevant evidence about where dogs go to the bathroom and unauthorized ways as we were today and that completely irrelevant to the paper but nobody raised an eyebrow about\nHow ridiculous that is um they were concerned however that we indicate that we're human not dogs so that we can be sure that we don't claim that when a dog that was a ... hunting of another dog whether or not the dog they go home to want it or not because how could\nWe know that as being ... and they were really concerned as I Hope everybody seen in our little video we put out an ounce\nProject they're really concerned with the fact that we respect the dog's privacy in the process of inspecting their genitals um\n[noise] and going out and what what specifically were they concerned about I mean the ... the the dog but what I mean\nYou got me man\n[laughter] that it was done in the privacy of a of a veterinary office I thought\nOkay um let's see you did fat body building which quickly is what\nThe the idea that what needs to be added to the professional sport a body building is a category in which that\nIs displayed politically so that that it was just considered another to issue a equal with muscle and say that that's not true is to be mean to fat people phobic as they call it\n... and that was accepted\nYeah that was expected that was a pretty pretty exciting acceptance um\nEspecially because the we actually had a real scholar lettuce uses identity who wrote that reclaimed grow the paper and you actually as a professional body builder\nOr Mr northern hemisphere in Nineteen Seventy eight or something I mean this guy Seventy years old and just stack and the picture in my mind of this guy being the author of this paper for a body building or just kind of all areas\nBecause that was another thing to do a lot of these papers you had a completely fake organizations you had completely fake scholars coming from colleges that I think didn't exist in some cases I mean some of this would have been easily just provide basic checking would it would it wouldn't have\nI think so I mean there's kind of a tricky point and I don't want to get too far into the into the weeds here but honestly scholarship should stand or fall on its merit\nNot on who did it and so a lot of people are making that point and we deliberately chose name that would be hard to find in a Google Search in ... which was very common names on purpose I actually used\nA a a I roll dice to pick up off of a list of\nMost common names for certain years and more that way that would blend in with lots of people\nSo all events is a really complicated I'm there would be people who try to take this out in fact we got the idea from a news article about somebody at University of Pennsylvania who was employing a similar but less extreme version of this in her classroom they got in trouble for it a late last year\nSo this I didn't come to us out of the vacuum this was actually something that people are attempting in classrooms and so there would have been some sums are educators primarily working and social justice\nSide or the fields topics\nCourses I get the best way to to say that but also probably into some of the general at stuff would take up some degree of the suggestions as you know experimental but but legitimate to use in the classroom and this was being submitted to\nThe gold standard journal this wasn't something springs journal in education this was the gold or tennis philosophy journal Asia that we were working with here\nWhich is where a lot of the literature that like this already exist which you don't mind me going on a little bit this this kind of what's happening I'm we think that what's happening here is kind of in the equivalent with ideas of money laundering called idea laundry\nOh so they take they take these these that idea of some of which are just opinion some of them are prejudiced some of them are genuinely terrifying like this educational thing\nAnd then they wander them through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge so you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or we've basis\nTake these these bad ideas some of which are just\nOpinion some of them are prejudiced some of them are genuinely terrifying like this educational thing\nAnd then they wander them through the academic process and they come out with the stamp of academic approval that makes them look like they're real knowledge so you'll hear people say oh well there was a study or we've basis program on studies that show well that's fine when the studies are good but when the studies\nAre coming from a place that can't tell a truth from from prejudiced and opinion it becomes a real problem\nTeams one of the other ones I found um disturbing or was the uh the Joe H. two ... two was\nWas accepted can you explain ... explain this one\nYeah that paper was accepted by high pay showed the singer and I was just mentioning that the\nPatriot stood for hoax on hoaxes so it was a hoax paper we wrote that was about writing academic hoaxes just the code\nNamely gay for convenience boy they argue is that that you can\nOnly properly criticize things that go against social justice and in particular you can only use humor to make fun of or or do satire to deflate\nThat which goes against social justice if you use humor against social justice if you criticize both will do that what that means as you never really properly engaged with it therefore we don't have to consider your criticism and that's one of the huge problems going on in this this set of of\nFields is that they don't accept criticism if you tried to criticize them they say that it's a\nPrivilege preserving epidemic pushback that a scholar named Allison bally hoos huge in the education literature they say it's white fragility that's Robin to Angelo who has just had a big book published on that this year but it's introduced the concept in twenty eleven\nWhich says that if I'm somebody was privilege\nIt's been particularly white people for her work uh is challenged so that their privileges putting the question that they are fragile and don't know how to deal with it because\nTheir privilege made them weak they don't know how to psychologically deal with having that challenge and they act out in anger or grief or something like that and trying to maintain their privilege and so\nThese ideas are already getting out there and we just took him to step further\nAnd then you know it's interesting guy because the one about hoaxes is interesting and that is to to criticize what you guys did they would almost half just cite your paper and that was\nThe idea yeah it was definitely to put them in that position and I've asked ... to stand by the\nPaper that they accept it and publish in our right names they haven't responded yet but we'll see what they do I'm that way indeed people who want to criticize our project from a position of interest I can all salmon has some will need to cite cost in order to criticize us\n[laughter] I could we could one more to ... on the you turn on the scary front that the feminist mine comes a\nBoy you also did the white man my income if you did to one of his was accepted in the white man was a fright\nCorrect correct tell me about them\nSo I'll do though the white one first because they didn't get in it was much more frightening it was written in from the position of an auto West Nile graffiti where the researcher is reflecting on in the states her own experience\nAs a white lesbian women coming to hate her own white mass and it was rejected partly because the scholarship wasn't quite er which is the case in all of the papers but also because the position that the author as a good white\nRather than being sufficiently ... or whatever to critical race ... ... so there was there was an explicitly political reasoning behind why it was was rejected and it was that the the author as a white woman was trying to make herself look good by criticizing her own white\nWas was one of the main reason the feminist one was\nWell hold on just a second hold on just saying then that took mind the parts of mine Tom where he was talking about Jews and replace the words Jews with a with whites\nYeah in that case it was either whites are white and this and then we edited the text around it and added a whole a whole bunch of literature and rewarded things so get past plagiarism checks and things like that so yeah that was a\nIt started with ... scanning through my income picking out passages about the Jews and replacing Jews were whites are white miss\n... than editing around it uh the some of this one didn't\nDo it quite the same way as soon as one was not about it didn't take Jews out and replace it with with men for example that actually has a chapter in my income where Hitler explains the need for the Nazi Party that chapter twelve and what its members would be expected\nTo a whole to and including especially the sacrifices that they have to make to be Nazis\nAnd we replaced our movement the party et cetera he doesn't mention Nazis specifically in that chapter or we're replacing tat was intersection of feminism or solidarity or ally ... something to do with with the feminist movement and criticize the idea that\nUh some feminists do what they called choice feminism which is the idea that if a woman is living her own life the way she wants to and considers that to be a statement of feminism than she is doing feminism it's salmon is for women to have you know full agency and make their own choices in the world that's what this paper was criticizing\nSaying that no no they're responsibility if they really want to consider themselves feminists is to be to make sacrifices him stand in solidarity with other oppressed people particularly of you know women of color or women of other marginalized status is\nJames [noise] couple of quick questions um they\nJust had to be one of those things that you entered into and hope that you were wrong and when they were accepted you had to celebrate and then short time later going\nGood God this is bad am I right\nThat's exactly that is exactly right so especially the ... paper I think the one that got accepted um the idea there was that we were trying to it's very different from mine ... of course still I mean as you you know you're the one to one thing uh\nBut the ... the the politics of grievance through I really am glad I get to talk to you about that if I can\nBecause politics the grievances everywhere and it's certainly being used in the academic left as we were trying to demonstrate we called this stuff grievance studies we see it everywhere right and I think this is why we're so divided\nA politically right now I was really happy to talk to you because I mean I don't want to get in touch with you but you're a real dude and that's why I wanted to talk to you thanks you know you had this whole May of ... about\nHow things were going where you under Obama's time and I thought that was huge and I was like you know this guy Glenn Beck is is is a bridge she's looking for reconciliation is on your on your Twitter bio we need to be talking to each other again\nSo our project was you know where people on the left were left liberal so I'm not ashamed to say that I Know you consider yourself a classical liberal and conservative on the right\nThat's great I'm we're on the left me to take responsibility for our own lunatics and so our project was kind of that you know we're left wing people who want the left\nTo come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people in general I get a lot of sense\nThe liberal and conservative on the right that's great I'm we're on the left needed a responsibility for\nOur own lunatics and so our project was kind of that\nYou know or left wing people who want to come back from the from the edge and we hope that you know the same things happening on the right and we can all START I think you know people\nIn general I get a lot of things that people send me emails about this now all the time especially um\nWe're all kind of sick of all this nonsense all the fighting all the polarization and we can't get anything done I think we want to get back to production all attacks and as long as we're relying heavily on this grievance stuff which clearly the academic left is I think we see a lot of it coming out of the right wing media here as well from my perspective\nI think as long as we're focusing on that we can't have productive conversations we can't\nReally remember you know you're an American I'm an American your person I'm a person with most of the things that we think\nIn common even though we have some probably pretty serious political differences but I think we also have in common that we want to have better conversations we want to move society and a direction that benefits us all and it's just a matter of working at the details\nAnd I really hope that you know\nThat our project at a reaches reaches that point does that make that\nIt totally does I I I Am I I hate to say that too I'm Out of

numbers look like\nSue ah depending on what you're looking at a you can find a lot of good and a lot of bad if you happen to be a Republican or ... or rooting for conservatives to to have a chance here to pass anything I'm obviously the both to really have a good chance of passing anything and as we've seen over the past or the past couple of years even that is no guarantee you have to get anything done\nUm but ah what you're seeing now is really good polling or\nFor the GOP in the Senate a lot of these races that were close have moved the geo peas direction um to get to fifty is which is what they need of course to have control with Mike Pence was the deciding vote\nYou need to have a a there is about ten races there um and they've knocked out most of the now just the ones that lean in their category get them get them to fifty there's an additional seven tossup races where they could get all the way up\nTo fifty seven if they were to sweep those\nUm you know maybe even outside shot at something dramatic maybe even getting to fifty eight most likely you're probably in that area of fifty\nThree fifty four right now which is an improvement over the current situation in the Senate but if they lose the house that doesn't mean anything is that yeah you know it doesn't mean it means something but it doesn't mean a heck of a lot 'cause you're not gonna be able to pass anything you know the house is going to have both the other way and the houses where it looks real things look very bad for Republican\nUm it's interesting the way that they're looking at this is\nNot whether he usually it's like we'll we'll ever will the party loser gain seats right that's the way we usually typically look at these things and then there's the control language as well who control the house will even notice you haven't heard a lot of talk about whether Republicans\nWill will didn't gain any seat largely because it looks like it's not even possible at this point in fact\nUm the the polling models that they have working right now uh five thirty eight has one which they have um the I the chance of\nRepublicans maintaining their current amount of seats at less than zero point one percent and you might say oh well they've gotten you know there was issues with they didn't get Trump right which is the best thing every time I talked about polls are like oh well they didn't get Trump right well first of all the national polls are almost exactly data for Donald Trump\nOr it just it didn't get the ah electoral college right but that also wasn't what they were pulling in right in the states were were obviously wrong\nBut for example uh five thirty I Believe had about thirty percent chance that they thought Donald Trump when they're saying there is a point one percent less than a point one percent chance that the Republicans will maintain the same amount of houses\nA seat in the house in fact they're saying the equal chance that Republicans maintain the same amount of seats as Democrats gaining eighty three seats\nNow both of those are ... street outliers right like I don't think either one of those is going to happen right but the chances of of\nOf the of the Democrats just controlling the house are about eighty percent again more certain if you want to use those words are are more probable was the right way to say it than Donald Trump or being elected\nOr ... more probable than Hillary Clinton being elected right\nAnd order march ... showed up for the law and order march because they of course in Portland now or the law suit browns shirt stuff started beating\nKicking\nBurning flags whatever that's pretty scary and the mayor\n... released a statement at a press conference where he said I was appalled by what I saw in the video but I support the police's decision not to intervene how how how can you how can you support that decision out I I don't I mean I guess the the just the idea of look this is wrong but we want to make it any worse he's trying to make it\nSound as if um the police this is his angle for the mainstream our police Hindu no right but they act and they're just sucks they don't act and their do nothing's\nSo they have no way to win it's a great observation there are two a political parties and whatever you do one of them might criticize you\nYes that is that the job of being a mayor right if you're the job of being a leader yeah it's supposed to actually have an idea and do something in which I think he did by the way I think you're right would you would not speak is just being right when you say for public consumption that is exactly what he's doing yes hit these opinion is oh jeez where we're damned if we do damned if we don't\nBut in reality what he wants is a is much more on this side\nBut yeah the ... more on the end of a side and you can back that up with how he reacted to the FBI the FBI building in Portland is is under siege for him and so far I mean think of the balls and these guys\nThey take the FBI building and block it off so FBI agents are are now trapped inside the building\nThey call for police police say ah we've got a call the mayor why I'm calling you dispatch police we have to call the mayor the mayor goes on and says if the FBI thinks that this city is going to back them up there in the wrong city\n... excuse me what what ...\nSo the FBI had to get federal officers to come in and get everybody out of that building and into safety\nSounded nothing Portland did nothing to these guys that I mean whoa what is this\nIt's a I mean it's it's close to anarchy right it's certainly the way that you think it would come if it does it say you know the idea that you the FBI can't depend on police officer forget the FBI just these are people that these are actual real individuals who are in danger or and\nThen I was a woman who has the food carts across the street from the FBI um she was a a threatened with an inch of her life\nThat I think they've had to move out of the city her and her family um they took her stuff destroyed it or threatened the neighbors who are coming down trying to you know stick up for\nI mean there are just that they've become animals they become animals and their claim these are they're streets no they're not\nThey're not punk have you paid for them\nBecause I think a lot of the people who are trying to make it to work for the ones who actually paid for it your streets since when\nBut\nRead enough history usually people\nAre who are um\nYou know national socialists or Marxist radicals of some sort they're in power and they let this\nThey let this stuff and go until the people have had enough and then they do what they want with those people and they you know use those people as cover to seize even more power that's the way it works on a national scale I have no idea what this Portland mayor is doing\nBut it's insane meanwhile Alex ... that Alec Baldwin who uh has a new show on where where is this new show starting to you know\nA head Sharon top the top of my head\nI think it's yeah it's got a new show NBC ABC jeez yeah so he's got a new show on ABC had of course he's on NBC all the time a he's a he was just giving a speech or over the weekend and he was talking about\nYou know ... you know the elections I Want to make sure it's clear it's elections but he did say we need to overthrow this government and the government of Donald\nTrump maybe we should watch what we're saying\nAmerican your home is the biggest investment that you will ever make and that's why a real estate agents I trust dot com is working right there with you\nThey'll make a significant difference in the outcome of buying or selling your home with over Fifteen hundred agents nationwide who have who share your sensibilities and we've all been personally vetted and hand picked for their knowledge their skill and their track record\nA there these are the people that are going to sell your home just saw a report today that the number one job that people have as a second job of you know I'm just going to do this on the side is real estate\nYou don't do don't work with somebody who's doing this part time they're doing a part time for a reason find the person who is the best at selling homes\nI become desperate to hold on to something I thought I might be losing and I thought I had to do something special to keep it I started doing things out of my comfort zone like presenting and the truth is that had been a while since I've been having fun\nI become desperate to hold on to something I thought I might be losing and I thought I had to do something special to keep it\nI started doing things out of my comfort zone like presenting the truth\nIs that had been a while since I had been having fun it started I started to worry about ticket sales for my tours what the critics said what the perception of bite me might be I felt like I was living with this over my face and near a and the reality I was seeing was all blurred by it\nI decided I never wanted to read my name and print again never read a review and I never have I decided I'd never use social media again and I never have but the diagnosis made me realize how stupid I had been to worry about all of these unimportant things I was embarrassed by my ego\nI was embarrassed that has allowed this in security\nI realize that for many years I couldn't believe I was on the same stage as my heroes I couldn't believe I was looking cross somebody like Paul McCartney and saying things like it's hard to get here but my God it's harder to stay here\nThan I woke up and sought after ten years of trying to get here in five years of being scared that it would go away I think I can enjoy it\n\nAfter his son's illness he says I just don't have the stomach for it anymore the celebrity narcissism it started I started to crumble but then I started to wonder why I wanted to do it in the first place\nI had forgotten that it was all about souls connecting because I become so anxious there were people in my business life saying if you hadn't done this or that you've written a better song tickets might be selling quicker\nThey started to take all of that on board and no one wanted to take any responsibility is just so much easier for people to pass the buck to me because I was since insecure enough already I Would digested and say it's my fault time rubbish it affected me and I started to think it's all going to go I'm going to lose everything\nIt is\nFascinating to read these things from him because what I've always felt about Michael boo play was she was just having fun\nHe was just living a dream and I wondered and I never spotted in him I just wondered\nIf it was ever going to get old to him because what makes him I think the best performer I've ever seen on stage is that joy she just has a joy of performance and it is a it is so in ... yeah he loves\nIt I mean you can tell them when you see him why if you can tell he just absolutely loves doing it or at least did at one point but they're starting to talk about I mean there's conflicting reports that he's actually thinking about stopping it\nCompletely he says I was learning with passion that I was afraid I'd become a mere poor photo copy of my heroes\nBut when I come back from this terrible time I realized I'm not a mere photocopy of learn to everything I can from them taking it\nFound my own soul my own voice my own style and now know critic can take that away\nIt needed clarifying now I've just seen the music I Love maybe when you let go that's when it comes back to you it's a lot like love\nHe is um he he I think he's joking\nAbout he's because he says I miss the guys in my band so when my wife had to go back to Argentina I said to the guys come on over to the house let's have a drink order some pizza place in video games and jam they came over and we partied and I said let's play some music and I thought wow\nThis is fun it was then that I realized I missed making music I didn't even know I missed it that was about a year ago so why would he possibly be saying that he is now\nIt seems like it might be one of those situations where the Internet has taken\nA somewhat a sarcastic comment and turn it into reality has is focused people\nAre coming out today and saying that he's not actually going to retire because he's in the middle of a tour in a book or their album released and all that\nOther stuff so here's what he said here's what he says exactly to the reporter he pauses there are three reasons I wanted to do this album one because I felt a debt of gratitude deeper than I can explain to the millions of people all over the world who pray for us\nAnd showed us compassion that gave me faith in humanity to because I Love music and I feel I can continue the legacy of my idols and three because of the world was ending not just my own personal hell but watching the political turmoil in America and watching Europe breakup there's never a better time for music\nThen he suddenly stops quote this is my last interview he says quite solemnly I'm retiring from the business of made the perfect record and now I can leave at the very top end quote somehow though the writer says I don't think he really means that\nIt's unbelievable because you know that it was put all over the media as if he was retiring well he said it was his last interview he got other interviews scheduled right like he's had a whole press tour for this album is just silly and most important thing though is is looking at that and saying\nThat that is really the type of thing that ... that changes your perspective completely right you go through something like that\nAnd you stop and you examine all the nonsensical idiocy that you you participate in every day\nUh and you can re prioritize you don't want to have to go through that to do it but sometimes it's the only thing that makes you kind of re prioritize the things you're doing in your life\nOr and and he seems to have I mean he he gets making thirty five million dollars a year if he's out there a touring and stuff and he's able to walk away from that um\nBecause he just wants to spend time with his son how many times a week here goes excuses um according more time with my family that was completely real guy yeah it's nice to see somebody who actually you know and it's nice to see\nThat he he got through it and has made it into a good thing you know I have I have ... probably more respect for Michael boo play than any other professional that I've ever met in the entertainment industry because he has\nFound a way to keep his feet on the ground and he was not afraid I mean when everybody when everyone it was very popular\nTo hate me she didn't\nMean it ... it you know by the heat but he and he was never taking a stand for me he just wouldn't\nHe just didn't understand these like look I'm I'm not in politics I'm Canadian\nWhy do I care and then you get out of it and then again a fight at a ... yeah he said the guy turned around and said I could believe you'll look back and he's like I'm Canadian I don't vote what what does it matter what they are to you\nAnd the guy for real posh and he said I threw punches back and he's got to do it I got into a hockey fight [laughter] you got to do a hockey fight and [laughter] I Am\nSo happy to hear that his ah family is um is doing better and his son has made this miraculous turn\nAnd ah Michael will play you've given enough if you want to give more we will certainly take it but uh do what's right for you do what's right for you\nStern and ah Michael Blue play you've given enough if you want to give more we will certainly take it\nBut uh do what's right for you do what's right for you and for your family and your real fans\nWill be thrilled no matter what you decide\n[noise]\nI mean let's just leave in music business than they're pissed off [noise] yeah [noise]\nBy the way his new album is out

say this to a to a father he did\nOr that lost his son to opioids a cause he's saying there's no reason for any of these opioids we shouldn't have any of them oxycontin Vicodin none of it should be available at all\nAnd um I just think that's ... really wrong or because we have a lot\nOf people certainly understand the position he's coming from from his position yes but I mean look at pat\nPat if he didn't have drugs I don't know what drugs these odd but if he didn't have dry heroin there are many heroin yeah there are many days he wouldn't he wouldn't make it to the middle of the street to
