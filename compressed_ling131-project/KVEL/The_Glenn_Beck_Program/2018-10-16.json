importantly I'm getting a lot\nOf mail about depression and I'm a and suicide yeah and I don't know why this is happening but suicide is a huge spike\nAnd I don't think people understand it a and I want to share some of the things that I have seen in the mail and some of the things that I've heard I don't know if you saw a star is born\nI did not know Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga yeah it has to be a an Oscar\nContenders oh I think they're both gonna win Oscars they should it's it's it's fantastic um but it is um\n\nI don't want to own wreck anything but uh it um it deals with alcoholism uh and and suicide and it's a it's a very powerful and his portrayal of that\nAnd um\nI don't know suicide is in our is in his eye Diced\nRight now um and uh\nSo we'll we'll talk about possibly tomorrow you mentioned you signed a book or for a for him and the book of course it did to the outrage we talked about about twenty five million times in the past couple of months you may know that it is available in bookstores however we want one thing we don't mention often is subtitled and ... you know\nIt's about how treating the country right now and then meeting that we have a problem not like us but like the country as as as a whole as a whole has an issue with the way they're dealing with problems\nUm and if you if you look at that because it's about what do I don't have it in front of me so yeah it's a um a house thinking like a recovering addict can help you heal the country yeah I mean if if if those principles that are helping him get through that alcoholism right\n... ... a lot of those same principles would work at a on our country no they definitely would and I ... you know you get into some of the ... addiction issues in the book but also how that applies to everything we have to deal with an entity that basically ... you know once a cure for Michael ... like this is it that's what the book it's about\nRight it's about being able to apply apply those and it prints opposed to other situations\nIt starts at the ... and it starts at the beginning it's not just admitting\nYou have a problem that we all have a problem that the nation has a problem and I think we can all admit that um but it really it really\nIt it's just got a I think there's a section in here that in the book that really came before as an alcoholic I had to decide is life worth living\nAnd in the book there's a chapter of are we good or are we bad is this Republican is the American experiment worth saving and we're not\nTalking about that we're seeing people tear it down but nobody who's talking about is it worth saving so how do we answer that\nQuestion and the book goes through that and I think the road to recovery of of our ills in this nation start there\nYou know you you can say Hillary Clinton can say well I Can't compromise with people you know I Can't even talk to those people because they want to destroy everything I Believe in what what is that you believe in\nAnd and really believe in don't tell me the trait little things tell me about America tell me who you are now she can't do that because I don't I I just don't think that she's\nA she's honest enough to tell me she's this is a politician sees of\nCalculating and and so are most politicians right and left it's up to us we have to say that to our neighbors that we think we disagree with can we just can we talk about politics for a second\nIs America worth saving is it a good place or a bad place and the book shows you how to have that conversation and gives you some some facts both on good and bad\nBecause both sides have to have to step to the plate both sides Republicans generally see rah rah all of the good things red white and blue and were patriotic because we believe and we don't want to hear the bad things because usually the bad things are being told to us by people who have the country\nWe have to go out and learn the bad things about the country and those people who just know the bad things about the country you have to go and honestly look for the good things\nBecause\nI don't know about you but I'm both good and bad and my struggle every day is to be more good than bad to be a little better than I was yesterday and if I let myself go I'll be a bad guy well we've let ourselves go we're not trying to balance that anymore\nWe're saying we want to save this well why why what's worth

be going in the right direction right now there's a couple of like Florida\nNevada which are really close to easily you know total tossup races he's a very close right now but you could easily see a scenario where Republicans can get two fifty\nThree or fifty four seats it all comes down to\nThe this question in my mind mhm do you want to shout your abortion\nOr not do you want to show your abortion I'd rather do you do you believe that it is a healthy direction for the country to be to have representatives and senators who stand right next to people who say shouts your abortion be proud of your abortion\nNo no no no what happened to save and rare what happened on that debt that rare part of it is dead yeah ... shout Europe or should be proud of it let's make a comedy of it\nAnd I got news for you by the way all abortions are not safe in fact there are a hundred percent effective at killing something yes or no I never was safe it is currently legal but they don't care about rare anymore that one that got out the window and it's not just\nThat it's the extremists on all fronts if you if you look at what's happening in Portland and you think this I you know I Want more of that well you know who to vote for it ties\nYeah if you want I mean look at all the things we've seen over the past few years in from everything occupying Wall Street occupy Scott Walker's state house ... occupying a big the Keystone Pipeline FBI buildings in Portland you want that to continue there's a way to get it\nThere's a way to get in ... in fact turn the volume up a Spartacus and his friends will do it All right we uh we wanted to bring them again [noise]\nA Gavin a is a C R TV host get off my lawn which is I think my favorite name of any show a guy and he's in trouble now because of the press has decided he's he's very very violent he's a Canadian writer actor and comedian he is the cofounder of vice media and vice magazine\nA and now and see our TV and we welcome him to the program [noise] cabin I really appreciate you coming on\nAnd I'm really happy to be here for a few places telling the stories\nBut it it the Proud Boys fault or the right wing so\nHave you noticed or they're just exercising I my favorite is they're just exercising their\nFirst Amendment right of the assembly and Patricia of course of course I'm curious if you just heard of the difference recently\nI'm In the approach from the media is trying to make your group\nThe real a village the real villain in this because I mean I ... you know there was a ... a tweet string going on about the alleged violence by Proud Boys members in retweeted by people like ... like the big time reporters were going after the you become I think it's central target in this is that you feel that\nDefinitely I think that the DNC put their uh hate is not hate has no home here that the only thing they have to say to America and it's an idiotic thing to say that's like saying well we we are sick of albino violent like me just well it's\nReally weird concept the evil Nazi and they said we're going to rid America the land and not you know there are not\nSo they go ... uh we got to expand the net here so now anyone who disagrees with them as part of this evil hate that have stop and I unfortunately on into that that definition\nAnd it it's it's amazing that and pizza and the media and the DNC are all in who like Cuomo was saying it is it's like a a match and put it on dry dry grass and then the wind just takes it I think the match it then\nThe wind is the media and against the are starting fires\nI go I I I have to tell you I have a hard time disagreeing with that I'm seeing the way the\nUh the left has just consumed the DNC I mean there there's you know when you when you're into a an organization where you're starting to say you know shout your abortion and\nUm and and that kind of really despicable kind of a a behavior you're bound and determined to start just going way off the rails and they're they are they're they're the extremist party now\nIt is it's getting great I mean they used to and the thing that they're Britain by the way the way that it in the ... the paramilitary kept paramilitary wing here\nUh the media uses the jihad it's over there and and the attitude in both cases the enemy of my enemy is my friend\nAnd then he says language and the DNC language getting more and more similar just like that that would have said we're not all that is what Hillary said when we go low when they go low we kick them\nOr Maxine Waters saying no no freedom no peace or whatever go to their own attack then we've got people on CNN saying that there should be harassed for the rest of her life that's alleged that it it's at the same thing about Susan Collins they're setting racing\nTo Republicans got Rand Paul's white sleeping with the gun\nWe've got senator it's getting a text to be heading cabinet comes in I mean can you tell the difference in all those stories between you and the DNC they sound pretty similar to me\nGiven get us thanks brother appreciate it shares Douglas Kevin McGinnis a firm see our TV get off my lawn uh [noise]\nThose are the people you need we need to unite with with the easy ones to get or the ones on our own side\nGetting the Guinness and I may disagree on a lot of things we disagree I Believe that it would be much more helpful to take the Martin Luther King's pledge\nAnd go and walk through ... singing hymns and let them club you wouldn't have had go ahead let them club you in the head I Know that's not fun I don't want that\nBut that video of not breaking ranks and not punching back that video will speak to eighty percent of Americans\nThat video will cross all barriers and people will say okay look at these ... they're not even defending themselves look at what they're doing to them you put evil versus good side by side and people in America at least still at this point we'll choose good\nBut it has to be really good it has to be a shining example of good it has to be over the top good\nThat's why this is where we disagree I understand you know gather in in in ah the Proud Boys what they're doing I don't think they're wrong for wanting to do it\nAnd I don't think they're wrong for thinking that it's the right thing because how is it right so how is it wrong to stand up to bullies how's that wrong\n\nHow was that wrong if the police won't stand up if the media won't stand up ... who's going to so I completely understand that\nI think they're wrong for thinking that it's the right thing because how is it right now how is it wrong to stand up to bullies that was that wrong\n\nHow's that wrong if the police won't stand up if the media won't stand up ... who's going to so I completely understand that\nAnd I can't blame you can't like I get it I just think it's not effective\nBecause what happens is the media event just takes the piece of the video that they have\nWhere somebody's swinging back and then they say it's their fault so it's just not as effective do I want to get clubbed in the head no no\n\nBut if given and I can come together even though we have big disagreements our disagreements are not on the things that actually matter\nWe're not talking tactics the things that actually matter or the principles bill of rights constitution declaration of independence Judeo Christian ethic\nFundamentally the left as you talked about this before shouting they're ... they're proud of their abortion and they're heroes the Proud Boys are proud of the west right ... and they're the villains\nOr you know I think you and Gavin ... would agree completely on on what to to be proud of the fact that ah you know what you are in the western way of life is something to cherish it's a miracle it is\nAnd and there's nothing wrong with with defending that at all or you know tactics are attacked technical side we have to if we don't defend it it's going to go away\nYou know we're all at the you know we're only one generation away from losing that says we all know and maybe it's a generation it seems like it could be a week or two away at this at this rate\nSo we have to sit there and defended it it's just you know what's the best way of doing it and I think that there's a there's a discussion there um because I think you know I think as a ... um Gavin would acknowledge we kind of talked about it in the interview they're going to be they're gonna be under the microscope now they've got to be on the absolute best behavior as when the Tea Party was going on right when we went out and do these rallies\nIf there were you said don't bring sign\nBecause we know if there's one sign that's out of place if one person makes one sign that has any chance of something bad it will be the entire story don't even brings on main street clean up when we when we walk away we want to we want this or this area to be cleaner than when we got here and time after time after time\nThat happened and they weren't able to show that they would any evidence that they were violent so here's the thing\nI think we were way ahead but Roger ales told me once he said you're so far ahead of the parade you're about four blocks ahead they can't even\nSee it was going to be walking by herself when they're horrible like the head of the parade you're just so that was his point we're on a stroll that was his point and he said you're so far ahead and I said well I I don't know I'm just doing what I feel is right and he said slow down your way too\nFar ad that was the best advice he ever gave me I never listened to in a a ... who is good advice and I think you know when we were talking people used to say all the time why you're talking about Martin Luther king why are you talking about Martin Luther king when we went to Birmingham I said I Want everybody here I Want you to sign that that Martin Luther king thing\nWell there was nobody shouting us down there was nobody doing that and I said on stage there will be there will be\nThere's going to come a time soon where youre going to have to decide there will be these times in our future and you have to decide now\nWe're just ahead\nImagine doing or imagined doing a rally now we were afraid of the restoring honor rally because if you remember right the black Panthers were going to come\nAnd they were going to engage us well the black Panthers joined with ah with Al Sharpton and they tried they just marched through they didn't cause trouble they just marched through and we let them go\nAnd there's video of people saying good things as they're saying bad things to us we're saying good things to them now at the time it wasn't like ... in Portland\nAnd the answer if I wasn't there\nIf you do a rally and is peaceful and answer fall comes to attack and and we're the ones and we don't oh my gosh what am I saying good God\nAnd we don't turn away we don't raise a fist\nThat's a different story now and one that people want to hear\nBecause people aren't believing the media anymore and they're seeing these words come out of there are Democrats I'm telling you all over the country that say look I maybe I Believe in abortion but I don't believe in that\nI don't believe in partial birth abortion I don't believe in hey abortion should be you know you should be proud of it go shouted it's great there's nothing wrong with it no\nNormal people look at that on the Democratic side I mean the voter that lives next to you they look and say look I don't want to be involved in those decisions but you know I I'm I don't agree with that\nI don't agree with that out of compassion medical because I don't know people's situation yes but if that's your version of the pill and your proud of it that's a problem\nThat's who America is and they're looking they're looking for a movement they're looking for someone they can stand with who just will call balls and strikes who are not going to say yeah that's right when Donald Trump tweet something stupid to say if it's stupid\nI don't agree with that but when he does something right yeah he did that look at that ha ho balls and strikes that's where America is the first thing we have to do is come together\nFind those principles I don't care if you are on the Democratic side of the Republican side or the independents ... ... I don't care I don't care who you voted for in the past I don't care what you believed in the past\nWhat do you believe now do you believe we're on the ropes\nDo you believe this system of government is worth saving do you believe this this capitalism is worth saving do you believe the the scientific method is worth saving\nRate than let's stand together and put our\nOur differences of approach aside because we've got a lot of work to save this thing right now\n[noise]\nThe way Kevin has already been silenced on Twitter and invoices don't start coming together a more are going to be silenced what was it five or six hundred in\nA worse island last week from Facebook and I don't see anybody talking about it I don't see anybody talking about and that kind of came and went to the days no big deal [noise] sixty million\nAnd has already been silenced on Twitter and the voices don't start coming together a more are going to be silenced what was it five or six hundred a worse island last week from Facebook and I don't see anybody talking about it we'll see anybody talking about and that kind of came and went and got ... days no big deal sixty\nMillion followers just disconnected from the voices that they were following last week sixty million nothing [noise] All right let me tell you about\nRelief factor relief factor has been helping me a ... a a or a alleviate pain I'm starting almost a year ago now is in December I was getting ready to go on vacation\nAnd uh we almost didn't go because my pain was so bad and I was just so desperate and an basically give it up it seems like I had just resign yourself to this is just your life ... and I was starting to resign\nI was like I was at the time saying that's what I consider my wife I was a time saying I Can't live this way anymore I just can't do it I Can't do this every day\nUh and so I started taking relief factor and within three weeks\nUh I saw great improvement and I thought okay well maybe this is maybe this isn't it I don't know I started taking it every day I continued one hundred per cent drug free created by doctors for key ingredients\nQuandary or resources confirmed that plans to go ahead with the ... product for action operations that its shale gas exploration side in northwest England and oil and gas drilling hosted according to data from BA trying to you as a recount picked up a loving units for a total of one thousand sixty three last week\nThis has been energy today on ... by\nThem might want to have be fertile Roosevelt sushi where the basin comes to talk news starts no\nNews is our town hall topic huh [laughter] [noise] I'm going to the promise of [noise]\nA high level of Turkish officials claims that police in search of the Saudi consulate in Istanbul did find evidence of the missing Saudi journalist had been killed there and all of U.S officials did not elaborate according to the gate the meanwhile President Trump is offering his own theory about what might have happened to that missing that\n... is feared dead since he has not been seen since walking into the Saudi consulate in Turkey two weeks ago Turkish officials say they believe Saudi agents killed ...\nThe president says row killers maybe responsible after saying Saudi Arabia's king told them during a phone call and he has no knowledge of what happened to the show ...\nWe're going to try getting to the bottom of it\nThe presidents that secretary of state Mike Pompeo is going to Saudi Arabia and anywhere else necessary to find out what happened ...

journalist he was the Saudis citizen he is not you know despite what the journalists\nWill tell you they they leave out the part that he is actually a Muslim Brotherhood and uh his problem with Saudi Arabia is that they wouldn't you know a protector sanctioned the Muslim Brotherhood well you know Saudi Arabia knows who the Muslim Brotherhood is um and uh so we had a falling out with the kingdom and then\nAnd despite what the journalists will tell you they they leave out the part that he is actually a Muslim Brotherhood and uh his problem with Saudi Arabia is that they wouldn't\nYou know a protector sanctioned the Muslim Brotherhood well you know Saudi Arabia knows who the Muslim Brotherhood is\nUm and uh so you had a falling out with the kingdom and then he had to go get a a you know divorce certificate he divorced his wife and Saudi Arabia had to go into the Saudi embassy in its than both turkey\nAnd he disappeared his fiance was waiting for him outside it appears as though the Saudis came landed a jet on the tarmac\nCame with a bunch of empty suitcases and bones saw chopped them up and put them in the suitcases took him out of the embassy put them on a plane and he's\nProbably scattered over some desert in Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia said that's out land dish that's crazy yadda yadda Turks went in ah apparently there was a massive cleaning crew that went in right before the Turks could go in and investigate\nAh the some more things were leaked by the FBI or sorry about the CIA et cetera and are now our secretary of state is over with the king of Saudi Arabia and it looks as though they are going to admit\nThat yes they did kill them a but it was an interrogation that just went horribly wrong and we're going to punish all the people that were involved\nIn it so now the twenty four episode oh it's it's crazy yeah ... is is I mean this is honestly rear window Alfred Hitchcock is exactly Alfred Hitchcock with somebody said it's sitting outside going\nWait I I I think they stop her up in that case the woman I think they dropped her up and took her away in the middle of the night\nAnd it was like no that's crazy mhm well it turns out it was and uh and it's the same thing here somebody sitting outside going I think they've chopped them up and took a mountain suitcases that it is\nThe Hitchcock rear window and it is obviously going very arrive for the Saudis because you don't do things like this and expect to admit to and interrogation gone wrong two weeks later\nLike this is something you do and you deny me Russia does this all the time they're constantly killing journalism and like I don't even know who I don't even know where that was what is ... I've never even heard of the thing and you know like ... that their pattern and they never admitted if Saudi Arabia actually comes out admit\nWe kinda killed that journalists that's a big moment\nOr in you know geopolitics that's not a it's not a tiny thing today\nOr how today or tomorrow the way the president answers Saudi Arabia when when they admit to doing this this is an ally\nA this is one of our bigger backers this is probably our best friend next to Israel in the middle east they stand against a lot of the stuff that we stand against there are a big supporter now of Israel\nUm we're in a proxy war in Yemen with most people don't even know that but we're fighting a war in Yemen at their request and they're fighting with us\nUm they keep Iran at bay we're about to sell them a whole lot load of arms they also don't money into our tech industry yeah ... right now because of this um they also dump a lot of money into our banking system a\nHillside that cool orb that we should pay nuts or pretty sweet shore okay the or predict just do we know that and how they don't ask the or why hasn't anyone interviewed the or about this incident north out the orbit\nOr shows she stuffed inside of it [laughter] he dropped it inside of connected how they ... they hide so um what is the president do what do we do\nThis way you don't get involved in these things 'cause it's none of our business I mean I don't want it to be any of our business I don't want to have our whole economy and everything else hinge on what they just did we don't like that we don't want to endorse it we don't want to be anywhere near it\nCertainly feels different but the ... helped me quantify the difference here for a minute\nThese regimes are killing people all the time\nYes we know bad things are happening all the time and you know Saudi Arabia is not innocent of these things yet is it just because it's a journalist is it just because it was on foreign territory in an embassy\nIs it just because you know like the Washington Post really cares what happened to this guy so therefore it's become a big issue can get it can go after a cushion or and and and Trump because of the relationship ... what do you think\nThey say yes on all of that I'd say yes to all of that um I don't think if this guy was a preacher\nA and I think uh you probably wind up\nAs a president with everything that you have to a deal with I mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know then I remember all over the world\nUh and I think uh you probably wind up as a president with everything that you have to a deal with\nI mean I think it's okay to take a stand and say you know the sort of stuff can happen anymore we still have relations with a lot of a lot of countries who have done much worse than having killing one journalist as sad as that is I mean this is you know then I remember\nAll over the world this isn't this guy is not just a journalist he is a he is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood that's really the problem here is that uh they believe that he was um\nYou know helping the Muslim Brotherhood against Saudi Arabia and possibly even helping the Muslim Brotherhood here in the United states so he's not just a journalist this that let's let's\nLet's clear that up this isn't the Saudi Arabia on this really yeah and it's not that they were killing him because he was a journalist but because of his ties to the Muslim Brotherhood\nRight I think I mean it's you know it's literally impossible\nTo be able to judge all the moving parts behind the scenes that we don't know about right and you know that's why you have this is why you hire a president that you trust and and you know this is why you vote right because it's the situations that we noticed with Bush I mean you you met with him during the war\nAnd he informed view of nothing a top secret or anything but a lot of the different uh things that you had to consider when making these decisions\nAnd you know it's easy to say well we should just never talked to Saudi Arabia getting thrown out there is a lot of things behind the scenes that they're doing for example helping in the fight against terrorism they've been a while obviously we as we all know nine eleven or many of the people came from Saudi Arabia and there's been all sorts of questions on that\nAnd we talked about distancing ourselves for a long time and this is probably a great a opportunity to do that a little bit\nUm but you know there's there have been they've also arrested and kills a lot of terrorists or that have assisted us over the years as well I'm a on those efforts so\nI it's a tough one I think you have to you have to send a signal you have to make sure I think probably sanctions or something if this is actually a proven um you have to you have to do something publicly but you look at I mean Russia's done terrible things like that and we have in uh we haven't uh acted a anymore\nNot selling arms to Russia no no it's not selling arms to Russia and\nYou know the idea that OK well arms sales help jobs is not a great argument and this is the one thing that we have to we can't really consider the economy first when you're talking about arms sales yeah um\nBut I yeah I think taking that step of of probably sanctions and maybe that's what it is maybe it's arms um is this going to be an important\nReally really important\nDecision for us for the president Glenda [noise] um first I go back in history and I look at uh the Archduke Ferdinand moment\n'cause this is the exact kind of moments of the world thinks it's no big deal that could spiral out of control so quickly mhm um I send my secretary of state over which is exactly what Trump did yesterday\nUm like gather all of the evidence and then I Am as strong as I possibly can uh understanding in weighing everything a that is currently going on trying not to\nWeaken them but not necessarily empower them a as well and try to get myself out of it in a long term strategy of getting away from the bad guys\nAnd I think you know we're both going back and forth a little bit because we just don't know what's going on behind the scenes but not enough information to make this decision logically but will say is that while I Am not a fan at all of this slogan\nAmerican America First and I think it has a terrible history I'm In this situation\nThat is your priority here is to make sure that whatever happens is whatever is in America's Best interest you can't start a war you can start um uh you can't go crazy and to just to make a statement if the long term effect of this is a negative\nFor the United states we seen this with uh North Korea right like I mean North Korea you could I think make a serious argument that ... I don't think\nTrump wants to go out there in the eye and talking about how he loves Kim Jong moon publicly I think he thinks that the best way to avoid negative consequences and if we're\nIf I got to pay a bunch of words you know it's better good we were saying you know last night on the news of why it matters again the south Korea of the time to take care of that was under the Bush administration we didn't\nFor Clinton your Clinton now we didn't do it and now you're in a situation where you have no good options well welcome to the world that we ourselves created or allowed it to be creative force same situation in Saudi Arabia let me go to Chad quickly in South Carolina Hello Chad\nMorning how are you doing good very good do are you doing good how are you doing great\nOr just let it you
