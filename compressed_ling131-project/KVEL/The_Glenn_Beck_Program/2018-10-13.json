actually hurting ourselves\nYou talk about our God really kind of being identity no you explain that at\nThe globally we kind of as a nation moved ourselves into factions and what I don't want is Christians to be a faction in a world of factions [noise] um I think that's the part of the problem but\nBut I think you know people identify themselves as you know I'm I'm this or that I've got a social media community and and and then that factions sort of becomes identity becomes a faction the faction becomes an echo chamber and then ultimately are we the volume just goes up up up up and the anger just goes up up up up and\nAnd we can't survive I think as a nation factional ... at this level eventually you'll Balkan eyes use a term for history and we're looking at a break apart and so I think the ultimate thing is I I Can't you know I Can't solve all the political things here you got much bigger platform talk about politics than I Do\nI'm just trying to help Christians to say All right how do we react and how do we respond and the answer is is not to take her identity from anything other than king Jesus and and and again I Know that's over at least\nThe story will will kind of break apart and so I think the ultimate thing is I I Can't you can't solve all the political things here you got much bigger platform talk about politics than I Do I'm just trying to help Christians to say All right how do we react and how do we respond and the answer is\nIs not to take our identity from anything other than king Jesus and and and again I Know that's overtly spiritual but we're talking here in this\nThis focus I mean so it's to take out any for Jesus Jesus is not coming back on air force one he's not riding a donkey or an elephant when he does\nAnd to acknowledge that I'm only all in as a Christian and following Christ and everything else is shaped around that my identity is more to Christ in his kingdom that's kind of our motto here we can college my identity is more to Christ and his kingdom than anything else\nSo I explain this yesterday that um you know the the so called Christians of the Westboro Baptist church\nYou know they they hold up signs you know God hates this got hate that blah blah blah they're just despicable\nYou don't win by by holding up signs no God hates view and shouting things back you win by listening by understanding by him racing them as a soul or a brother and sister not to do what they're doing\nStanding up but people have been changes one woman in particular that actually left her own family in the Westboro Baptist church that's right because somebody spoke to her with civil civility and said let's just reason here for a minute\nYeah that's okay I got on my desk actually right every front of me a name played because they actually protested at my church we went out and serve them coffee and doughnuts and they called me and the national news I Can't use one of the words probably on the radio but all lying the false prophet\nAnd so it's actually one of my staff made into a name played it says it says lined Blanco false prophet Westboro Baptist church which by the way it's neither wrapped in his either Baptist church but but in doing so I mean the question is how do we respond well somebody reached out actually interviewed one of members of the family as well a Christian Today\nTo somebody reached out and I will tell you I think that's what\nWe can do right now with the blue deeply disagree with us in the book is filled with examples of Christians who actually build relationships with people who radically disagreed and in the process we're able to come to maybe a better understanding of what examples for example is a is the president viola university which is a Christian university in California\nAre met with the kind of the leader of the uh the party has the legislature there in California that was trying to change the laws that would make it illegal for ... to live their Christian beliefs about marriage sexuality and more\nWhile he ended up getting to understand each other better the will of the bill was ultimately not moved forward but dropped and and and now we're at a very different place now I'm not saying you can always do that but I Am saying\nThat Christians need to try to do that and I do think that in doing so will act a lot more like Jesus or even this how about a lot more like Christians historically because of the moment we're in\nIs not time for us to join in ratcheting up the outrage and and as you said earlier to your caller I'm calling people to arms\nYet that's not I mean ... that's not an uncommon of you know some of the some of the worst\nThings I see on social media I I click on a lake and I find go to the bio and it's the first thing to listen to thing is Christian and I'm like that's not what it's supposed to look like and I think that's what we need is a change in a lot of hearts\nI Will tell you this the ones who can teach us this right now or the the victims of ISIS and the ones who were were literally chained as slaves or you know story after story after story of these Christian\nWho I mean I Know one family that actually wrote to ISIS after they said you're all dead were coming Saturday to kill you\nI'm a I think it was on I think it was on Sunday we're going to come on Sunday and kill you or if you don't submit and we're gonna crucify you the family sat down kids at all and wrote a letter and said we understand we forgive you for that\nWe're not we're not going to leave we'll be here you can come at three o'clock we only ask that you do not crucify us it it it is we're not worthy of that kind of a death and they lived because they stood up with pita yeah unbelievable what's happening\nAnd we can learn from global Christians are also historically there was emperor fascinating ever called Julian the apostate I write about this and the book and he he actually he's called the apostate 'cause you know victors right the history and the Christians eventually became more prominent\nAnd and here's what he writes because he's so angry about uh trying to hold back the events of course that he's a pagan\nAnd he says this a while the pagan priest neglect the poor the hated galleons devote themselves to works of charity goes on and says these imply us galleons empire galleons that only feed their own poor but I was also welcome them into their adopt by\nThat's how big this company is wow they're going to be the largest clothing retailer by twenty twenty\nUh they're already so more books than in\nOr they're already sell more votes than anybody on earth they've driven how many uh book retailers out of business um and they're they're about to spend more on the original programming than even
