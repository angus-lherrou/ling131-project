Mm\nWhen [noise]\n[noise]\nI don't know about you but I'm tired of the same old politics\nAnd uh Larry sharp is joining us now he is running for governor in a New York and I think his ideas need to be heard and he needs to be a he needs to be introduced to a larger audience how what is your organization like what's your ground game\nYeah we have we have probably the best um libertarian ground you have seen the longtime um if probably ever we have over seven or eight directors campaign manager\nAbout thirty five to fifty people who are actively working every day on every aspect of the campaign to include things like a scheduling setting up a van ... ethics are calendar\nOr making sure people show social media we have a a team on Twitter or team on Instagram a team on Facebook where we have a team when everything's YouTube we do video production\nWe're not and you don't have but you you're lacking money you're up against people who have tens of millions of tens of millions of dollars absolutely we\nRaised almost half a million but to be to be clear if these last couple of weeks if we raise another fifty thousand dollars hundred thousand dollars this becomes winnable I Know it sounds crazy but it is and the reason is name recognition is my only issue\nThe last poll we put out I was at about one third name recognition and with that I pulled that Thirteen percent so you can do the math on that one three times to get to a hundred percent equals thirty nine percent right through time Thirteen or ... percent this defy way race\nThirty percent when this thing so I'm nine points above victory but to me I get a hundred percent there is the hard part right the math equation can I get to a hundred percent and sadly that's not my message I've got that down to the media can I get my name out to enough people to where I cross over that barrier which gets\nMe over thirty percent I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to win\n... ... ... ... yes really is that well again you can remember as third party in general the system is stacked against you\nAnd some of the day was telling me they said you know only someone who has like a marine mentality could do this\nBecause every day I'm up against failure but the marine corps taught me take the hill the captain shot take the hill the machine guns broken take the hill radios don't work take the hell are stopped giving excuses take the hell I get it and that's what I Do have to take the hill as a matter\nI get I I literally deal with failure everyday this woman every day and when I say that that's not an exaggeration that's every single day is as I mentioned earlier there's going to be a debate coming up here tomorrow WCBS\nAnd they're only going to include the Democrat Republican even though I'm On the ballot even those thirty one thousand New Yorkers signed a petition to get me on that ballot\nWCBS and they got him him shall I think his name he decided nope Larry shop dozens of the on their he's decided that the establishment as all that matters this is what I'm up again it's not going to stop me I'm Still taking the hill but it's yet another obstacle to get over\nSo if you're a libertarian or you're hearing something that um that uh you think should be heard than you should probably\nUh maybe tweet storm what's his name again at CBS WCBS radio eight eighty radio uh it's I think the ... so this is a radio debate yet\nAgain and they're just deciding no we don't want that don't me wrong there are three other people should be me should also be the Green Party and also the damn party they should all be there but this is the norm and we put up against this Web against is constantly and here's the the worst part with all of this where you know roaming and they're still going down\nThat that does that but they don't they don't\nThey don't realize that when a sinking ship mhm I mean they don't care\nIf people want to donate how's he doing Larry shop dot com slash donate and to be clear if some of you want to get forty five thousand dollars you can't the maximum as forty four thousand [laughter] by New York state law say if you I Know what I Want to get by forty five thousand dollars sorry you can't do it forty four you only can get forty four thousand that's all you can get a okay\nLarry sharp a dot com that's with an e at the end of sharp um I Want I Want to talk to you about some of the issues of the day and and how we solve some of the things like for instance healthcare yes how do you solve healthcare will do that\nComing up in a just a second a standby\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they are pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent the New York state they being spent in Florida we're lily we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes\nSo let's take pensions don't shoot pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's no way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises young people who worked their whole life and were promised ally yep what do you do\nYou see here in Texas would you believe for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you ate already already happening and we have all the time you're in New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation ... show painted a critical right now pending or about Fifteen sixteen percent of our budget and a budget as a hundred and Seventy billion dollars it's double Florida and Florida has more people than us\nYes for like eighty five billion and they have more people than us and we have a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget how about just massive and it's getting bigger the budget getting bigger and so are the percentages of the other pensions but on top of that a New York state has about a three hundred million dollar debt and about a ...\nSo it's a bad bad bad and they were you at the people I was telling me about Lowry the pension fund as good their right to fund itself is relatively well some of the upstate up into doing very well some of the city wants or disaster but overall sorting well they don't realize it's being also funded\nBy our tax base our budget that keeps putting money into it the problem is in the fun right now that's great the problem is the actual budget\nAt one point it gets so big that we simply can't pay me more as you're seeing in Dallas and my response time is not Larry's in the constitution yeah and I get that asked Detroit\nRight asking Puerto Rico right at Venezuela ... it was all legal for them to one there's no money it doesn't get funded when it doesn't get funded that eventually will collapse if that collapses if our pension fund collapsed near state we become Somalia overnight\nI don't want to become a Somali overnight I Want to stop it I'm the only guy talking about negotiating our pensions into the right which is some type of four one K. for three be something like that and I'm going to go she with every single union that will take forever I Know that's why I say it's a four year plan\nIs to for you plan to make as to what New York state is paying either a flat fee and or a ... percent is sustainable because the issue we have is a lot of people who have pensions who no longer paying it any more mhm so we just have to keep paying them until they don't need any more so we have to do that also\nUsed to be like ten firefighters reporting one now it's one supporting\nTend to correct I think actually supporting for ... I think that's right I'm not sure but I was making that I think it's I think are supporting three or four or so yeah it's bad so now we have to make that change and the funny thing is people are attacking me saying live wants to get rid of our pensions I'm like I'm the only guy trying to keep them\nI'm the only one talking about reality I'm Talking I was actually happening if you ever if you're ready for a pension now it's ten or Fifteen Years from now it's probably not going to be there for you\nBut why deal with that I mean it's human nature why deal with that if the two on the other side GOP and the Democrats are saying oh he's an extremist sees he's trying to spoof you your pensions are fine it's human nature to follow them\nAgreed but I have a problem Glenn I care\nI have a problem I'm human I have a problem I Want people to stay in my state I Want people to stay in my state because if they don't my state's going to collapse and I have to move\nI don't want to move I'm born and raised in New York state my family and friends were in New York state I Love my state ... ... people love New York the heat in the U.S government New York state is very special it has served the largest city in the entire nation\nIt has an amazing waterfall in Idaho Falls it as mountains as\nCool as Colorado and has farmland in the middle as yes I'm In New York you know ... I Know farmland as cool as the mid\nWest it has amazing rivers and lakes and every you can imagine in New York state is there is a beautiful diverse states and what destroying it because wedding one said he run the entire state\nMost of my my ideas about happiness of the other part is like the central station it's about letting counties ... counties in regions be regions in towns be towns right people upstate tend to get upset with people in New York City saying well they're running it and they are bad and cut them off\nIf you ran your own county you wouldn't care and that's what I Want to let people in New York City be New York city like isn't right under the rug Rochester\nIsn't that though what we're we're debating now over the electoral college you're only reason why we're debating the electoral college is because it's the original debate I don't want New York city yes just tell me in the middle of the country\nHow to live my life yeah jolt led to San Francisco bay San Francisco and one of the loop on the streets that's fine yes what we're different here\nYes and maybe you want to visit them once in a while right then ... look at the poop refine whatever whatever your thing is\nAnd they shouldn't be allowed to do to their city their county but they want to do\nA hundred percent true and it's not happening and the issue as we're getting more and more centralized control it happens in any large organization as I told you I'm a business guy right and I'm the guy who I Will come in sometimes and try to help businesses and fix it and make things better and the last thing I say as iron fist\nIt's the last thing I say I hear all the time I go to a business owner and he goes my my leaders aren't doing with them what they should do I take it to innovate ... to take because you're taking charge of things and the last thing I say it's iron fist\nI say give them actually more freedom here's what I Know it's it's literally an equation personal freedom\nPlus transparency plus accountability equals innovation that happens all the time you give the people have more freedom let the leaders take charge some will make mistakes but ... as long as you ... you learn from them you become humble by them which is fine we all make mistakes\nBut then which are the ones who simply want to make a mistake blame someone else\nNow you see that these leaders you don't need which are the ones who will not make any mistakes there doing nothing those elite as you don't need you need the ones to get up try do well hit a couple of home runs strike out sometimes get better become humble to become better leaders in the long run that how you make a better organization we don't have that\nLeary is going to join me for a a podcast you'll hear a about Ninety minutes uninterrupted a and we'll put that out on Saturday um Larry sharp is his name and ah you you need to you need to listen to him I have a feeling\nIf he doesn't win New York we're going to be seeing him a again a perhaps the elsewhere but he is um he's worth your time to listen to and if you're in New York\nConsider voting for cancer imagine can't imagine what would stop you because it's not working as it is but that's just me Leary sharp\nA S.
