kind of have\nA you know they're going to the closed debate and I'm Benno boat tomorrow and I do believe a cabinet will be confirmed um nobody wants to be on the wrong side of this and the winds are blowing against the Democrats\nNow the way things have shifted\n... on the on the winds shifting don't you think I mean this the first time I've ever seen this tactic by the Democrats backfire on them\nI don't know the Clarence Thomas stuff was pretty rough\nUm and I think that a African Americans at the time will pretty angry about it but it that of course a dissipated once he got on a court the question is if Kavanaugh is confirmed more or less all go away we'll people just say okay the good guys one and then we're not\nReal are interested in punishing the Democrats I don't think so anymore I don't think I I just think people are so furious I think they're gonna they're gonna check it out on the\n... I think the Democrats think that they can for all these these um activists they really think that they can you know half of them you know turn 'em on and turn them off no I Know they do but I think they're approaching a time when they're not going to be able to turn them off\n... a ... I don't see it that way is that there is very well organized you're going to get individuals that confront people in restaurants\nOr ... like that you're going to have that and somebody might get hurt but are they organized for these people are very discipline and there's about a dozen organizations now where money is flooding into disrupt the process on the part of the far left\nThan by um there's some news Iraq\nYet with um one thing a couple of things here are Collins one of the big ones are yes ...\nSo yeah and in the ass so\nI'm sure Murkowski was a yes and mansion I don't know that that's an interesting\nOr in the middle of looking at that right now ah and bill do you think that they just overplayed their hand oh yeah and I really like they could have had it they could have had Murkowski they could have had Collins if they really played that seriously but instead they overplay their hand to an incredible the worldly\nAbsolutely and they didn't have what they didn't have 'em look I went through this and and all the all of a sudden I Everytime I turned around there was somebody else and a ...\n... it wasn't true mhm\nAll right so what they thought would that more people were going to come out and\nAnd for the finger at them and and or somebody was going to bolster Ford's party state but\nAlthough yeah I was at that party and I saw this happen what do they have to lose they threw it out there the less accepted it as fact and made it easier for people to come through and then you add an avid ... and all these other crazy people piling on and and the and the left said look this is what usually happens\nBut here um you know with the FBI involvement and you know pretty strong statement by Kavanaugh capital I saved himself yeah did you know what are the things that I couldn't do\nIn a way to save myself because they didn't want they being far we need to address it just\nA minute I couldn't say myself cabin or did\nYou uh we had a ... I Lived with turned it does look like a Joe Manchin has voted yes on Kavanaugh\nSays that means that habit or the mansions going to vote to confirm and ... and the reason mansions doing that is because if he voted against Kavanaugh that he might lose the election\nOr the people of West Virginia now do period we\nDo have one no vote from Lisa Murkowski the Murkowski it out a mansion in in playing in calling it in a this would just should be enough for him to get confirmed\nYeah because if it's a tie with tens breaks it correct or Murkowski if Murkowski votes against Kavanaugh she's through in the Republican Party she's finished yeah we'll get a nickel\nI'm from any Republican and I believe that she her Senate career will be over I think the people of Alaska very conservative state will throw her out\nDo you think Joe or do you think a bill that we have with a um with Murkowski the situation where she knew it was going to go through we wanted to vote no was able to vote no because she knew they had the fifty votes\n[noise] doesn't matter it's just a no vote going he goes to every single one of her\nColleagues mhm\nIsolates her and puts her is a poli a word of the day\nPariah uh in the Republican Party saying that that's an amazing situation\nI didn't think Murkowski was put her entire career risk ... over this but um or at least yeah\nSo she could vote yes tomorrow\nHow how though if she's voting not to advance the nomination to the floor\nWill now as an Irish vote yes I Want to confirm it\nBecause I didn't think that it should go forward but now it's gone forward and so now I'm going to because a lot of people are calling my office and I'm afraid I'm afraid for my career I ... I Am going to vote yes\nMaybe but uh I uh that's a pretty tough line on\nYeah I don't think I'm going to do it but it is interesting point him in that one of the most shocking vote results of that I can remember my entire lifetime was Lisa Murkowski beating Joe Miller on a write in ballots are in that Senate to campaign in several years ago does Alaska reward Murkowski after this with another election I mean I don't I don't\nThink so I think so no they are very independent they are conservative but they're very independent and uh and we'll wait and see Bill thanks so much Bill O'Reilly dot

with um [noise] oh shoot from the five he's a friend of ours a bone ... did the first interview with him about his son and opioids and everything else is a ... hour full powerful interview\nBut his stance now is those all should be banned they should not make them at all the old opioid any opioids should be banned that should not be even a veil of all to anybody I disagree with that is so wrong yeah it was summer example a ... minute ability to live in\nIt it makes life miserable yeah you can you can handle getting through your daily activities\nOtherwise you'd be curled up at a ball and

not care yeah\nYou just don't care you're still in pain you just don't care as\nManaging and there does seem to be a legitimate medical use for a lot of people to use opioids in that if you if you get a different than you you can get addicted\nTo oil they can't hit and you can do your body it's only normal your body gets addicted and it's held to get off of\nIt I don't know about you but my doctors

about it and I I always bring you up 'cause he's always when I bring you a piece of that because I'll always say pat isn't so much pain he's like I think he's one of the worst\nPain patients that I have he's like I I don't know how he does it um and so we always talk about it and he's told me that his his the government is coming down on opioids too hard you know it's like I don't know how people like pat are going to really I mean yeah it's going to be hard it's going to be hard\nAnd they're you know you've got to do drug tests to get almost every time now almost every time you had to
