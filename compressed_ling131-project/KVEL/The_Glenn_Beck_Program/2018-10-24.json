have written you're not surprised and you are way ahead of the game of what's going on with this caravan let's give you some additional information because it's it's\n... it's very important what Mike Pence said yesterday Mike Pence came out in the oval office and said this is being funded by Venezuela now the mainstream press they're not going to do anything but ridicule that but this makes sense\nIt makes perfect sense of it does sound crazy when you first hear about it like if you're not if you don't know the back story here like Venezuela you know like oh here we go again as I said well they can't afford anything yeah there's blaming something in the country so we can get involved or whatever you know or yeah or the how do they even have the money to do this\nBut um it makes perfect sense when you hear when you put it into the context of the relationship that Honduras had with a book Venezuela in Cuba it makes absolutely perfect sense in particular\nThese this group that SARS started this caravan they are the group that is that backed the ousted Marxist a radical a president that was ousted in Honduras right and there they\nStill have a populist the avenue to go to like their goals are stated goal is still to restore that President back to power and he was and they do have kind of a case there and an international case because he was democratically elected\nSo really if they can make such a firestorm\nSuch a big media uprising over this get international support and backing they could technically eventually may try and get this guy back into power but that is their goal and that's where this started I think that's where Honduras that this party these people in Honduras while they originally organized this but Venezuela also has other\nReasoning reasons to be behind this now have you I mean you think about it just was a few months ago\nUm Venezuelan president ... uh with just survived to a an assassination attempt and he blamed the United states people in the United states for um we're backing those people he blames nine states for the economic or her basically ... all the things that are wrong with them it's not socialism if the United states has fault that it that social networking not the theory behind and\nUm so he blames us for all these things so if you are my door oh you want to strike back they just tried to kill you and his words how do you do it when you can't compete with the United states in a conventional manner you have to go non conventional way and\nYou have to understand too that\nIt was the ousting of the Honduran presidency the guy this caravan support when he was ousted the first thing the new government did or one of the first things and the government did was get out of the ... agreement which was agreements of hey we're going to prop each other up\nSo as soon as Honduras pulled out a way from Venezuela that hurts them economically big time so he's got a double reason for doing this ...\nThis is huge and this is huge so you really need to look at it through that lens they have a gigantic political and future economic reasoning behind all this was a very big plan it you know in place to do all this\nI mentioned before that um Iran and both Syria were big time observers of this economic union\nAnd a lot of people have been focusing on what it would have ISIS gets into this uh you know to this group or whatever you mentioned the possibility of Cuban intelligence Venezuela intelligence was I think it's probably Ninety percent likely that they are part of this caravan\nUm but also a through I uh Iran Hezbollah ... could be all in this uh care of it I I have no information on that no no intelligence behind it but because of all the actors because of everyone involved the because of the people that are are are still ... Venezuela Iran\nRight now that you could be heads below would be my ... if I'm In a U.S intelligence operative I'm looking for Hezbollah links you know inside this care of it and I guarantee you the U.S intelligence uh agencies are all over this I I'm sure we've infiltrated this\nThat's why when when the vice president United States said that oh the Honduran president told me this\nHe's not reporting on here say like that would be here say\nBelow would be my ... if I'm In a U.S intelligence operative I'm looking for has the links you know inside this care of it and I guarantee you the U.S intelligence agencies are all over there I'm sure we've infiltrated this that's why when when the vice president United States that that oh the Honduran president told me that\nHe's not reporting on here say like that would be here saying let's say seriously have something behind it\nI bully thing that he no I think I heard your interview with a gun or having yesterday yeah he knew he knew as well he knew and of course that's something he would not come out and say oh Venezuela behind them and the governor of Texas is not going to say that but I Do think vice president and his hand on that I really think that they're behind it and the question now is\nHow does it escalate you mentioned the waves but acts we already know there's a there's a caravan forming an El Salvador there's a camera and forming in Guatemala and who are they form who's forming them that we don't know the organizers yet but those are all they're all in the same border\nAll with ... so the same people that liberty and re foundation party look that up when you're looking at these things up and doing your own homework\nLiberty and re foundation party and Honduras I Would not be surprised if we hear more names\nIn El Salvador in Guatemala forming these\nA caravan because the ah Honduras border was a shutdown pretty heavily they crack down on that border so they can't send more people on doors anymore\nSo they're probably going there those are their allies in El Salvador Guatemala are probably just forming them in their border country\nAnd the press won't look into this in fact the press is downplaying this now and the reason why is because they know this is a nightmare for Democrats and the election this is an absolute nightmare the build up to it\nWhat happens on the border may actually work to their advantage politically because you'll have the big bad Americans soldiers standing up\nBut the builds up before the border they are saying this is a conspiracy we don't know where they're headed yes yes we do yes we do we know what their intent is to cross our border\nAnd math you need to start demanding and tweeting the press looks into the humanitarian issues of this caravan who's providing the water in the medical care because we're\nThe diapers middle guy driving all alone with the infant\nThis sanitary conditions must be strong how are they sleeping how are they moving with somebody if I Want to help I Want to help I just I didn't know if ... Smith\nShowed where they were sleeping they're sleeping on the pavement and it's burning hot pavement the beaming on yeah and uh\nWhere where are they getting the water because you can't take Seventy five hundred people into a small town\nYou know and and and go into the seven eleven and say hey we need that you know fourteen thousand bottles of water you can't know no one for right now because I'm a little Thursday we haven't we haven't had a drink and two hundred miles and so I Want to take one for the\nRoad one for the road for everybody and one drink now yeah I just\nNeed fourteen thousand bottles of water I'm sure the stuffy\nThat they're stopping get probably has fourteen arises bottles of water okay yeah so I'm sure it's they just stop it Stuckey yeah OK along the way ... um\nYou keep saying something about a political stunt or you keep talking you know there's the funding funding funding hands light Gene Wilder right here\nOkay oh all these questions about where they get there they got them from a who organized or cause the caravan\n... ...\n... initially organized it and then October force Facebook post he shared a graphic promoting a migrant march\nThe graphic told migrants in protesters together on October twelve at a bus station in San Pedro Sula one of the most violent cities in the world quote we don't leave because we want to violence and poverty

probably hasn't read this political\nArticle yeah well he's ... he was also a liar we know that for ... yes\nThat's what happened right when people watch videos generally speaking they riot generally speaking that's what you do does just a riot starter yeah yes it is yes it is so I'm fights I'm Glad you're finally admitted I why would Mike Pence say that Venezuela is behind you probably hasn't

Will be stunned he thinks Mexico will stop will stop them when is that going to happen\nI don't because I don't know I don't have my crystal ball or my connection to the Mexican president ... article to tell you what's happening you know they have that right haven't yet\nThe locals in Mexico are saying it's the caravans grown to fourteen thousand people now and they continue to head north but I'm\nHopeful bill there's two others the news that we've broken this morning there are two other caravans that are forming behind this one\nWell because they've seen you know the seriousness of the countries along the way that they're just well no they're not going to be stopped so yeah [laughter] they continue to come and can\nYou imagine if we allow these people all all fourteen thousand or however many are there and then the caravan after and the one after that what does that say to future ...\nNo you're over so many foreign land is over it's over California will be a first a collapse a yeah even if they\nAre or what the Democrats are saying they are they're just all downtrodden people who just want to come to America and find jobs well okay but are we going to get fourteen thousand at a time month after month after month after month\nThat's not going to work out well for us I I guess they think we can just accept an infinite number well into our country the good news is they're all good people yeah they are right except for the fact that all of them no no I actually well we're not according to the people in the care of him\nNot if we hold assume [laughter] away and well you know do what do they know Raul it's a good point not according to those in the caravan yeah and they they talk to him I heard in a\nCaravan found asked them about about the criminal elements mhm listen\nTo him in those everywhere [noise] okay ah [noise] his criminal saying here for I mean it is but my guess is not that many I mean this is a good people hear signs of getting through\nAh

due to that so\nHis ... rate has historically when we look at a we look at elections how much does that play into it when you have this concern of potentially a change in the house with the the only hear a lot of these people saying hey the Democrats have an opportunity to win back the house\nWell how much of that does that play in the energy markets as far as uh the concerns I mean do you think that that's playing into part of us\nUm I don't think that that's going to have much effect even um even if there's a real concern that Democrats are going to take over the house there's in the short term there's there's not a whole lot but how can really do to throw him after French\nAnd oil markets um in energy production mhm and so I don't think that that's really playing much into a it's a rich price action\nYou know ah when we had a change before they tied up below the uh public lands up there and so I Know in our area and the base and there there was an effect because they couldn't get all those leases or to produce at that time is that you think you were on top of that are\nTechnically take a technically takes off the table and so that pushes price that would potentially push prices up right so locking up federal lands um is technically good for\nThank you much into a it's every price action\nYou don't know uh when we had a change before they tied up all of these are public lands up there and so I Know in our area and the base and there there was an effect because they couldn't get all those leases or to produce at that time slowly that we're trying to answer that meant\nTechnically take technically take off the table and so that pushes price that would potentially push prices up right so locking up federal lands um is technically good for oil price but potentially bad for kind of local local areas\nWho is production is pretty focused on federal land so it's a it's a double edged\nSword on a macro approach it would be good for the market and the micro approach for market driven here and you get for the basin exactly\nOkay yeah so let's talk about the locally the the the ... 'cause we talking about W T I and and there was a difference between what what is the WTC irate right now the bench rate that what we're getting here out of the Salt Lake area because we're looking at a who were were not necessarily exporting were just shipping to local refinery what what does that mean\nRight now because there's obviously there's there's a transportation restrained so we're only pretty much have one customer so we're shipping to the Salt Lake refineries so what does that mean to the base in\nUh for the cost of the where the price of oil that we're getting today for producers in the ...\nUm well we uh are marketed limited for Black Sea cruise specifically when we're ... we're having this conversation black secrete to have a real problem\nUm we do have a single primary market which are the or by a north Salt Lake honors\nAnd or any time we reached Pasadena the refineries um and we push over on production um the excess barrel have to go somewhere um if there's no room stores now in the short term\nSo uh that supply demand imbalance will obviously Bush or the discount the WTO by a wide now\nAnd I'm not exactly sure what postings are right now a ... and Fifteen dollars could be worse I guess a discount to\nWest Texas intermediates so right now I think WBAI straying about sixty seven or just shy of sixty seven this morning so a Fifteen dollar discount puts it up fifty two dollars net back\nTo at least I'm so in in short ... terrible but yeah I just wish that were still make money and we're still making oil but it is\nNot a very good place to to want to be really a big fight 'cause you know that it's just going to be a struggle to get your your oil out\nSo to this discount we're talking about it on the sea it's not a good thing it sounds like a good thing but discount ... yeah it's not good it just means we're getting less for oil and largely because they know that the only place you can shift to Salt Lake I mean it's my truck well plus yeah and the only only\nReally act now place but that it can kind of includes the costs of transportation out you know to to other further out market ... so it really benefits fine or you know big big way you know to have a supply and demand imbalance\nAnd so that Fifteen dollars kind of in ... the cost of transporting and getting to market that are outside of Utah\nSo what does it take to to balance this imbalance that we have right now does that lead us to the Rio\nIt's going to be a rail but also an increase in markets Soviet loophole refinery that we are talking about the last while that's going to help a lot it's supposed to be the I think the Packers\nA box ... going to be about forty thousand barrels that is going to provide some relief or until it's full of course uh soon as that comes on a lot of barrels can come online new production and\nThen we're back to where we started but still good um we really just need more cost effective transport outside of Utah and to a kind of what I Would consider it kind of foreign you know outside of Utah markets\nBefore we go into the year to send it to the Gulf\nYeah I I Want to talk about the real project but real quickly there are there are some people they would say in in some that have said that the rail project would hurt jobs as far as trucking what do you say to those people that have concerns are are that are concerned about their spouses with jobs and trucking in the trucking industry\nWell it it would definitely take trucks off of the road is as far as the trucks that are kind of the medium hall they're taking from the base and um\nI I guess you're you're routes will be short and you'll be you'll be trucking from the lease to a real terminal as opposed to from the least all the way up Salt Lake you know the benefit of that\nThere will be trucks trucks coming off the road but the overall economic activity will\nSoon and so those truckers will either find other things to move or they might just find themselves doing a different a different job but I really don't think it's going to be hard for them to uh to find something productive and uh uh economically beneficial to do\nSo we're talking shorter trips right so you instead of these ... can be short hauling 'cause you still have to pick up the crude and even the water you got to where you still can always have water hollers they got to go to the injection facilities and then you have the crews that are going to be moving that that oil to the rail to be transferred down down to Salt Lake or to other area so they're just making short shrift cripple\nAre never going to triple our production from eighty thousand barrels black watched it you know two hundred and forty thousand ... rap the triple do short haul on water and fruit and so you know they maybe they're not the routes might just change it's possible that none of them really lose their jobs they just kind of change rapidly\nSo not as long they more more trips back and forth between the transportation and not as long so that means the net result of that has maybe their home sooner in earlier in the day they get their ... their rather down\nWhile they might just be so hopping busy that uh I mean they're they're even busier than they are now and making more money than they are now you know\nI mean I listen to that interview after that and rail doesn't just limit this then not just transportation of oil a transportation good services could open up for other industries for the area as well\nOr we're going to be moving frac sand with the rail that's going to be really big so it doesn't really the same industry but it's a different product um hopefully we can get this new or as manufacturer that we're kind of\nWe're hearing about to come out to the base and obviously that I think they're going to be able to make good use of rail um and so yeah we'll we'll be able to move stuff in and out and it it is\nFor its primary use is going to be for oil and gas but uh I think when it is\nThe very existence of the rail is gonna is gonna really spur other ideas and other opportunities to make you the same ss\n... let's talk a little bit more about the maximum capacity that we've been talking about we may be a at max capacity at the Salt Lake refineries but what about the rest of the the ... all the rest of the refineries rather go\nI'm really hard to say what a [laughter] ... you know just how much of our crude the other areas take that's really a price I kind of a price thing um our crude black watches really good because it produces a lot of metal pistol it\nI'm kind of the high dollar fine product\nUm and his low sulfur so there especially in the Gulf a lot of those big fat refiners are interested in being and being able to pick up our crude and because it works well for them economically and if we can get it to him in that and again in an economic way\nUm so I I think that we're going to end up limited by our own assay to produce to be honest\nSo what what what's ... ... ...\nA lot of those big fat refiners are interested in being and being able to pick up our crude and because it works well for them economically and if we can get it um and and again in an economic way um so I I think that we're going to end up limited by our own ... to ... to be honest\nSo what what what's arising nine\nRead what drives that um the the the value of that wax the crude that's coming is that more because the lowest awful because the EPA standards are what where is it just it's easier to process through the through her conversion just\nNaturally it just naturally lower soap or and so for the production of ultra low sulfur diesel it's it's easier to produce you will I be when your feet stock is already low naturally low sulfur kind of makes it\nNice and you're and you're processing equipment for processing sour crude Z treats lots of suffer are expensive those ... trains are expensive to to put together and maintain so it's really good stuff um and again it can be tracked into high high value middle just to let 'em refined products\nAnd we talked a little bit of a we've talked a little bit about the rail but really the the real service in the basin would stabilize the local economy and then enhanced our local tax base um of course 'cause you're gonna get more revenue out of that and then create hundreds of local new jobs 'cause you know not only is it just\nA job that the existing jobs but you can have additional support in industry supporting as well as other industries like we talked about potential of having a manufacturing coming in and ... what are your thoughts on that\nUm it would it would stabilize this to the degree\nThat we're still come we would still be completely tied to nine that and so if ever

[noise] because hell has\nFrozen over a ... a member of the media\nHas now actually admitted that he shouldn't have dismissed Juanita abroad Rick's accusation against the bill Clinton now this is coming from a columnist for the Washington Post whose name is Richard Cohen he's worked at the post in Nineteen sixty eight\n[noise] and he just wrote an opinion piece titled I thought Juanita Broderick was incredible\nI was wrong\nJuanita Broderick is the woman who alleges that Bill Clinton raped her when he was running for Arkansas governor in Nineteen Seventy eight\nBut since the me too movement exploded over a year ago there's been a title shift in the culture culminating in the tug of war over allegations during the Kavanaugh hearings now what are the biggest takeaways from those hearings according to those on the left is that you always must believe the victim\nDuring the hearings Anita Hill was once again in the spotlight brought up over and over again\nAnd then exploded over a year ago there's been a title shift in the culture culminating in the tug of war over allegations during the Kavanaugh hearings now one of the biggest takeaways from those hearings according to those on the left is that you always must believe the victim\nDuring the hearings Anita Hill was once again in the spotlight brought up over and over again and her accusations against Clarence Thomas universally believed by the media yet somehow some of Bill Clinton's accusers still haven't been extended the same sympathy as Dr Blasey Ford and need a hill\n... that's really why is it so unusual to hear a Bill Clinton supporter admit that they may have been wrong about Broderick it's Twenty years later\nNow this has been obviously influenced by the me too movement\nBut Cohen now admits to dismissing Broderick claims during the Clinton presidency is just another wild accusation made by twisted Clinton haters\nNBC's Lisa Myers recently told slate I tested Broderick story every way I could again and again and again I'm quoting and no detail ever changed it never got better it never got worse it was always the same and quote\nCohen now wonders why Monica Lewinsky is now totally characterized as a victim while Broderick is ignored\nIsn't that interesting Monica Lewinsky who has always say she says she wasn't a victim\nIs now the victim and Broderick who is always claimed it was not consensual I was raped\nShe's ignored Cohen says it might have something to do with Broderick bring being a Trump supporter come on I couldn't have anything to do with it though and writes\nI remember refusing to deal with the Broderick allegations because I simply chose to believe Clinton was not a rapist my position has proved naive\nMe ask you a question\nUnlike Broderick who had all of the evidence had witnesses unlike the Dallas who the witness is very credible has nothing to gain everything to lose the evidence is overwhelming\nThose two things you can look at and you can say there's evidence there you're shoot you chose to ignore it with Kavanaugh there was no evidence but if suddenly there was a bunch of evidence and it was presented\nI Would be fine with saying wow okay new information looks like Kavanaugh did it why is it that no one on the left as willing to do that\n\nWhether dealing with Clinton or the Kavanaugh cases all political camps should tread carefully and their certainty about the truth certainty always seems to get us into trouble\nRequires a huge dose of something more elusive than the truth to be able to survive today\nAnd that is humility Cohen\nSeems to be exercising\nHumility and for that\nI think the Washington Post columnist\nThank you for being willing to step out of the crowd go against maybe some of your peers and say you know what I think we were wrong about this one thank you Richard Cohen\nIs a pretty big moment we recently went over the details that Broderick accusation like to have her on\nYeah she she would come on I think um she it was interesting to see that because I honestly the same thing had a similar reaction to it at that time in which a lot of the accusations about affairs and stuff seemed to be credible but you know rapists I mean the the\nThe accusation was really brutal or by the time she had five corroborating witnesses that she told at the time or she talked about seeing a I think it was a prison\nOr in the outside of the window ... um which was confirmed that prison was there she was confirmed to be at the nursing cameras that was there he was in town like I mean there was a lot of it was on like the she knew that she knew what hotel it was at\nA and she knew the time period I don't know if you know the exact date but everything else you had pretty much locked down pretty ... I Will tell you I\nAlways found her credible I found her more credible than anybody else you know Paula Jones you know I don't know\nThey view it as a morally acceptable choice or indifferent to it a majority so so what can I tell you something\nI mean you're a guy you're being told you can't look at women are sexually you can't notice what they're wearing you a\nRape is completely undefined I mean you know I asked you out you said no I asked you out a second time and now I'm a rapist yeah I'm a racist I mean it's it's crazy and confusing\nAnd I don't know you know as a as a twenty something boy or a Seventeen year old boy well anyway\nWell it's in there who would argue its consequences for it right like this just yeah I don't I'm not getting real that by anybody I'm not getting in trouble with anybody I mean it's really not quite spread it not consequence for it right yeah not\nAt all um I mean the the pastors that are in this or some\nYou may remember glad I don't know if you know Doug Wilson but he um he got famous because he was debating Christopher Hitchens he went around and he was the he was the Apollo just bringing apologies that went around with him and and so and so he lays that all out about how destructive this really is to relationships and how is the silent killer\nBecause there's a stigma with with pornography like if you go into you know your church into your testimony and there's some sort of\nYou know like a drug addiction or something like that you know there's a lot of sympathy for you and and people you know roll out the record but there's you know if you come up and you're the porn guy right now it's like you don't how many how many how many times have you seen that testimony your church how am I have never seen it right and so and so\nAnd actually the numbers in the study showed that even church leaders are falling victim to to this so I Know there's a reason why they're not bringing it up there there's a fear that they're going to be found out too\nI Know in you know in in in my church\nAnd you know my church is a good way to to you know [laughter] you know right now do we drink milk [laughter] and it's the number one reason families are breaking up is the number one cause of of problem is pornography you know it starts out as pornography and it just spirals out of control\nTo if you're if you're ... you know if you're having a porn addiction issue like you're probably not going to want to stand up in front of your rights because the stigma is big I think it's interesting about what he's done here is like ... that the same way that\nThe negatives of what has happened with porn which is the stigma has been taken away 'cause you could just do it on line in your own right like this course that you have is kinda the same it takes away the stigma of having to admit it necessarily you can kind of go through and and hear these things without having to stand up in\nFront of your shirt I don't know your neighbors of honestly I mean I Know you're ready you know I Know it's really I\nKnow it's I understand the stigma of but it's the same kind of stigma as you would have as a as an alcoholic twenty five years ago if you um there's it is this is a natural\nAs you said God gave us the sex drive and it is different between men and women and men are driven by their eyes he didn't we just are we're very visual women or not is visual as we are when it comes to sex and so there's\nThe it's it's normal media normal then you would have this Dr what makes us not an animal is trying to say okay some of that is good some of the too much of this is bad\nRight right and and what we're doing is like I said we're pressing the reset button and showing you where God has laid out because cultures gone so off the rails and that's part of that's been infused in the church I mean even the stuff you lead inside\nYou know the stuff we allow ourselves to watch I mean as you can talk about pornography and say oh hard core pornography yes that's pornography but where do you watch it on Instagram which feeds are you looking at I mean as in ... I'm not like\nThe women in bikinis showing their buttons and eat right now I mean like only when I got here in the rain when you're growing that all the way through I mean given that be considered part I think I think some people can make that case it'd make a strong case this is an\nArgument that it ... you know my wife and I have all the time a because there's almost nothing that you could watch on you know Netflix or Amazon yeah\nThat unless it's an old TV series or something there's almost nothing that you can watch that doesn't have this you know so you know is click click click and it was go ahead and and um you know fast forward through some of that crap and that's the argument is on my wife like\nDon't stop watching we have to stop watching it honey let's just zip ahead of this part\nYou know but [noise] is that right right is that right you know and it's not because it\nIs of course like how does it have our recommendations for filters is it about that type of thing with me we we mentioned those things because they're good like having Internet filters and in our town ability partners and you know things are good but what we do is we really just try to get to the heart of it because\nThose things are bandied they're they're right at the Bible says our hearts are deceitful above all out and so it's\nYour your heart's gonna find a way if you're still desiring that your heart's gonna find a way around your filter you're going to find another device you're going to know how to do this and that to get around it to me so we try to rewire your heart and show you what God if we give you a positive vision to shoot for you can't just say don't do it right do it right\nGive me some of the stats\nUm while I'm you know two thirds of all Christian men have you'd porn monthly they admit that I I Would assume too that's if that's the admitted number it's tirelessly either [laughter] it's probably not nearly just to hold on higher I think\nIt was something like I don't have one in six\nChurch leaders have admitted to struggling with this or that church one is six and so you know nine percent of churches only ... only nine percent of churches actually have resources dedicated and I and I believe because it is it's just you know me sort of projecting this you know I'm guessing this but because of that and the ramp and you know numbers that are here\nI think that there's probably a little bit of fear and some of these leaders because they feel hypocritical\nYou know coming out in and saying let's fight the same because they know they're struggling with with themselves but I'll give you one more um\nAh kids are being exposed to porn I mean my kids went on Syria the other day and actually said something and they miss entered Syria misunderstood and came back with like a sexual thing um and my son was like what's that all about and I'm so kids are accidentally or intentionally getting exposed to pornography as young as ten and eleven years old\nAnd they're getting married later so now think about that if you start getting into port at ten eleven twelve years old and it becomes a habit for you um and then you don't get married until you're twenty eight or twenty nine years old you've been poisoning your brain now in how you view women for ... you know two thirds of your life who thirds of your life and\nAn hour and it's I think if people to to really be a good husband and it\nTakes more and more to excite you\nYes I mean it just it is a gateway is the gateway it is you start with porn and and we we look at it fairs and that's the other thing that ... where does that usually start it didn't start just one day you wake up and say I'm going to have an affair with my secretary [laughter] started in the house\nAnd your

were not hitting somebody else I guarantee you there's somebody sitting in their car listening to this\nThe fares and that the other thing that ... where does that usually start it didn't start just one day you wake up and say I'm going to have an affair with my secretary [laughter] started in the house\nAnd your phone you know and like and we can talk about this but I guarantee our voices right now we're hitting the numbers don't live the numbers don't lie we're hitting you were not getting your neighbor were not hitting somebody else I guarantee you there's somebody that in their car\nListening to this at the end it's hitting home right now because it's the silent killer and you've been walking around with that would that shame and guilt and so that's why we made this course\nThat free course dot com because\nYou know God wants you to be free from the he he wants you to live it you know shame free guilt free from this and he's given you the tools to fight it and so

it and the Israel thing it's going to have to and if you have the ... documentary I was talking to them a little bit earlier today about some of the experiences of seeing the media as they cover the Palestinian versus the way they covered the so that wasn't as an adult to go over\nThe over the media and yet that's what this documentary became\nBecause the media was if you didn't stay with the gaggle\nYou actually you actually observed something above the gaggle yeah that they're just never aware of\nWall and and even more shocking going as when the gavel there they get the story wrong\nI mean it was unbelievable to me you know because we went there to watch from you know actually do what the other presidents didn't do in an open the the us embassy there in in Jerusalem and so um that's what we were therefore but then what we saw was how the media can talk to the narrative that's completely false\nI'm at ... I'll tell you a quick story of you know for some some context I downloaded it out while I was there called red alert and so you can try this at home and tested and see if I'm if I'm I'm full of it\nBut it's called red alert and what it does is it you know you know those annoying alerts you get on your phone within flooded at like ... like only allowed well it does that whenever a missile or rocket is launched into Israel because we wanted to follow okay there's rocket falling down right where we're going to go find where they are and so\nI downloaded this out and so I went off a few times over there\nAh I get home and you know\nAll of a sudden it like two in the morning like my my phone's just going bananas and like all day for like three days in a row like on and off I'm getting these I had to leave the app because it was so annoying that I was that these rockets were getting shot and Israel all the time\nAnd you know and then what is it might be a show so that that the picture like there's the contacts like their rockets are flying in from Gaza all the time that the media shows up and it's like look at these Israeli you know evil soldiers just gunning down innocent hapless\nAnd protesters there on the on the Gaza border ... why do you think the Israelis are taking it very seriously when they're burning tires\nWhen they're burning tires and they're\nTrying to break through the fence they're taking it seriously because all the rest of the day they're getting shot\nAt [laughter] damn thank you very much and they All right for more than a three or three years of software vulnerability in the Google Plus social media network gave third party developers potential access to users private profile information", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Vernal", "day": "24"}
