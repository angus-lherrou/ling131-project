graduate and a lecture I strongly disassociate myself from tonight to praise of Brett Kavanaugh with respect\nHe's a fifth vote to the hard right turn on voting rights and so much more that will harm the Democratic process and prevent a more equal society\nOkay so in July she came out and she let everybody know I'm against him\nThink he's dangerous now that was just three months ago she exercised her ability as we all do to to share with the world what our opinions are\nAnd then yesterday she shared with the world her independence or independent viewpoints\nEmily exercise the or other

there was a root beer have you made it very clear to me [laughter] ah so anyway\nHe's the only one that you could push through because if you don't if you don't have a plan immediately\nThen the Democratic plan works of delay yet that and that's the most important point\nTheir strategy is not to say that Kavanaugh is a sexual abusers their strategy is not to say anything about Kavanaugh

but there are several different scenarios on how this thing and that I Want to go through with you\nUh and and you tell me tell me where I'm wrong tell me how this is going to end in a you know in a positive way I I I think though that we should also get into a movie to this beforehand get into the idea that there are accusations that Kevin all light in his hearing\nYeah and you know the New York times laid them out in ridiculous detail yeah and we should go through each one of them because I I Would like because there's an idea that if there is let's say he perjured himself which is one of the things a lot of people are starting to throw around now they're starting to say well he perjured himself he lied\nAnd the thing he was trying to paint himself in the best possible it will keep perjured himself\nThat maybe he did I don't know I mean I haven't seen any perjury about sex doesn't matter we forgot about that yeah um but ... ...\nIf he perjured himself look if we perjured himself for me it's a problem yeah I I mean to me it would it would matter on the context of it I guess I I I mean if what you mean like the booth thing like one of the things we're talking about is the ... the word ... which is a word I have not heard that probably Nineteen eighty five\nUm uh but he was what does it mean and he said it meant flatulence and there's a I mean I'm pretty sure\nI mean to me it would it would matter on the context of it I guess I mean if what you mean like the booth thing or like one of the things we're talking about the ... the word ... which is the word I have not heard that probably Nineteen eighty five\nUm uh but he it was what did it mean and he said it meant flatulence and there's I mean I'm pretty sure\nI I I could be wrong but there was a word like that and I was ... that meant like smoking pot that you were smoking pot you you in your school had a different\nThat the number one meaning but that's the number one I have never heard of that blood funneling oh now\nI Know like you know highly technical terms I don't know who says you know what that is better if we drink beer through our bought\nBought apparently that's been done\nA [laughter] I didn't I didn't know you kind of I Know you can do that either and I don't recommend and it's not called really drinking if you do it that way now I'll just really learning here nothing no I don't know if you're if\nYou have bought blackouts if you know it was on your blood falls on an asteroid or not or okay okay\nSo there's a there's the there's the the number one or ... or the next one is something that is whack dumb or F up used to describe objects people or stuff you don't want\nTo do that like a you know that guy's a booth I feel like that's maybe also how I heard it now that you're saying it that way because it's just kind of like an insult yeah that may have been yeah\nRight I just know I I remember the words but I don't remember and connected to\nYou know sticking things in [laughter] anyway ah here's one that kind of makes me feel a little better a synonym for weed\nOkay yeah\nSo how is there a sense of smell to use it in a sentence was the bell that booth [laughter] mountain I assume that da see what you're saying yeah I smelled that boom yeah yeah yeah it makes me feel uncomfortable\nFit the active lifting the ah the bow out of a whitewater kayak well going over rocks waves are waterfalls white\nUh in order to lunch over hydraulics or rocks this entry sponsored by ... yeah is that what I never heard that before I Move the low tones noise a dog may okay typically when they are suspicious or unsure of whether they should actually bark or not\nI haven't heard a flatulence one but I have heard many things related to the ... uh which I think somewhat another term for having sex\nIt that'd be in the bud Bob [laughter]\nHe's a guy so I again I think this is the interesting point here they're trying to say this is essentially perjury there's no way that's perjury to me that it they bonkers claim\nThe idea that did that word probably meant different things at different schools at as mine and yours did right as there are seven different definitions on Urban Dictionary for it not not just because flatulence didn't make it there does not mean that low locally that was not the way people used it\nBut you do have the problem of people in Georgetown Prep now starting to come out and saying look I I was for him and I don't think he did this Ford thing but\nNow that he was saying that this is what these words mean come on man and and that he was never really fall down drunk yeah\nOkay well so we have that one too you want to go to an actual article as a\nAgain the lists of potential perjury or from for judge Kavanaugh um the next one is excessive drinking judge Kavanaugh portrayed himself in his testimony is enjoying a beer or two in in high school and it's a college student but not as someone who often drink to excess during those years I drink beer with my friends and\nUm then this is disputed this what they say in the times his statements are odd at a uh with some of his classmates and how they remembered him nearly a dozen college classmates have judge Kavanaugh said they recalled\nA him indulging in heavy drinking some saying so now it's not it's less than a dozen 'cause some of them said I'm drinking some saying a it was a beyond normal consumption ... parents that are going\nTo be sure a smaller number of classmates that his drinking was unacceptable\nSo again this is like judging yourself and how much you drink is notoriously difficult as I Would assume Mr alcoholic over here will be able to tell you a I mean the whole point is the toughest thing to do is it ... you're an alcoholic right yeah it's very possible and I would say likely\nThat most people who drink to excess in these periods would not necessarily say that they're doing something abnormal\nEven if they are here's what I here's how I take this I took that testimony what I watched him talk about drinking it was very clear that he was getting drunk\nAnd and he said look we All right Dr ... drink to excess\nAll did have you done that I mean I ... the on the drinking thing I don't consider this\nDrink to excess than these periods would not necessarily say that they're doing something abnormal even if they are\nHere's what I hear so I take this I took that testimony what I watched him talk about drinking it was very clear that he was getting drunk\nAnd and he said look we All right Dr actually drink to excess we all did\nHave you done that I mean I ... the on the drinking thing I don't consider this a problem because I\nI Believe that he was in effect saying\nYeah but there is a difference between a blackout mhm okay\nAnd maybe he had blackouts and didn't remember them I don't believe that at all you have a blackout you remember it you don't you don't remember what happened do you remember the ... I remember you were like oh crap I don't even remember now maybe at Seventeen you know your local ... remember or\nMaybe you're Seventeen and doing that but you have to consume a lot of alcohol\nI I I you know I got to\nThat man is gay or ... expert witness yeah in a Glenn Beck please come to the story of a\nYou know to me\nI don't make a generalization but with a specific accusation Ninety five percent of people who say they drank to the point of blacking out or like\nI Believe it's Ninety five percent I Believe that blackouts do exist but it is extraordinarily rare I spent a week and France which I Can't believe my liver returned with me for sure it was going to be like you know what I'm saying on the beach here I\n... I Would say I got to get back home to dry out\nMy voice though is that I had a lot to drink in my life you know certain times I've never even been remotely\n... another alcohol that you have to consume\nIn a very short period of yeah I Know I've done I have I've done my homework on it\nUh and it's not exactly the way I have experienced it um apparently you can have blackouts if you drink a an enormous amount of alcohol if you if you were ...\nOr maybe um even if an enormous amount of alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly you can blackout\n...\nI I have read places where they say it's rare someplace to say it's common I'm Sorry but I Do not believe I Believe it's a movie trick that most people\nYou know they're like oh we did was I was lucky we are six middle right\nShut up Ninety five percent of the Ninety five percent that's a lot I had a friend who had drank a lot in a very short period of time and blacked out a blackout fell off the stage and had to go to the hospital\nUm and that was a legit this was in college and that was a legitimate like he drank way too much nothing he didn't do anything wrong he just got to tell us they just don't was killed himself that didn't remember any of it but and and just remember being there but did not remember the falling or anything okay um and so I'm not saying it never happens\nBut like the idea that you would say to someone oh this guy's lying he did a blackout is completely absurd you can't you cannot\nYou cannot accuse someone of lying about the\nOnly they wouldn't know if it occurred you can say that the end this is what they are saying that he lied because he said you know he he gave the impression that he wasn't ever out of control falling down drunk well okay I don't believe that but I also don't I wasn't left with that impression\nNo he said I mean the quote is I drink beer with my friends almost everyone did sometimes I had too many beers sometimes others that I like there are still like fear but they're not drink beer to the point of blacking out he just said I didn't blackout in and say to drink to accept in fact he said he I have a drink to excess\nAnd you know I mean I Am not a big drinker and my life but I drink to excess several times but never I mean the idea of the games of black blackout drunk in the end of may be a different story like out trunk is\nI mean you've told me some of the levels of alcohol you had in your life\nThe levels are almost in human [laughter] like I Would definitely be dead\nAir near you I mean you're dumping poison into your system is all of it your body can handle it a blackout is shutting your body down ... saying I Can't keep you alive\nAnd to run all of these other systems right I mean that's that's you know that's intense so I'm\nA we have a couple of more of these and go through yeah if we need to but I mean I think you get the point this is the level of almost every one of these accusations so I don't think that ... thing I don't think the ...\nThing um what about the well let me take a break and come back there's two things that could pose a problem for him\n... ... ... ... ... ... and some people are asking like why are you given up on cabin on I'm not not all I Know there's a fifty percent chance maybe higher then you get through the issue here is if he doesn't I mean because if you have faith here you're having the not a cabinet\nCollins and Murkowski and ... if you have\nFaith in them then fine don't worry about it but if you don't like I don't know then you better have planned be set up by the way I just want to make that really clear I'm not giving up on him at all and I'm just playing this out scene where the Democrats are headed than we do\nAnd how will that affect those three senators\nBy July twenty Seventeen bitcoin was down forty percent secrets worry\nCame in and said Palm Beach in the Palm Beach letter a ... there's going to be some activity is going to bring enormous amounts of money individual going\nWhat's been going on today a bitcoin currently sixty five forty eight sixty five\nForty a bitcoin was trading around Eighteen fifty a coin at the time we all know that it went up to twenty thousand\nAnd his crash down to about five or six thousand and it's still kind of hovering there it's gone up and down but you know it's been ...

moving the goalpost now on Capitol and if I'm a let me just give me a couple let's say he is confirmed\nThat he is confirmed by this kind of perjury stuff is percolating and they just make hay out of it um we go back to normal and ... the GOP\nLoses the house to the Democrats\nThe Democrats than are going to demand testimony from Donald Trump to they're going to try to impeach him they're going to demand is tax records because we're going to impeach him and the White House responds by going to the Supreme Court and says that the president doesn't have time to do this yadda yadda\nUm and the Democrats than watch a cabinet to recuse himself\nBut she won't do and she won't do it doesn't happen a and the the house then moves to impeach capital guy so we've got a year a fun oh ... okay\nUh let's say he's not confirmed because flake or call in Missouri Murkowski or our guy they just don't believe him and the Republicans dropped the ball they have NO PLAN\nAnd they just like well you know and where do you need your vote because we're a repeal Obamacare do they lose the house and possibly the Senate worst case scenario is that don't get they don't get them through the ... the Republicans mhm and because of this week with Jeff Flake\nPeople are just like okay the Republicans are worthless I mean and they don't come out with a huge plant yeah I think you're right they'll try to turn that into a reason to get to the polls but if if it's the Republicans that cause it I don't know where they're going to I don't think it'll work okay\nMother scenario he is confirmed it was a house in peaches Trump the house or in peaches Kavanaugh on perjury I think that is\nThe day when the house you know they're gonna at least attempt and they will attempt Trump and probably Kavanaugh to correct if we lose the house and the Senate\nThese things are happening and there there's no chance of them being removed but you will have the next two years of non stop impeachment hearings of both capital and Trump\nOK mhm the only one that seems good to me is I'm a ... if Kavanaugh loses the boat\nAnd the only one that I think works out is Kavanaugh loses the boat which could be really bad because it'll be the Republicans that do it\nUm however Donald Trump comes out and while he says yup that's over here's the guy he ups the ante and you get a guy that all conservatives are rabbit about\nGay somebody who you just know oh my gosh that's a skill Leah\nRight now Brett Kavanaugh has not been a lot of people's favorites I mean they're okay with him but no I always willing to die in a sword\nFor em em remember remember cabinet was not on the initial list of judge right from Trump and there's lots of them the item leader I personally think the best course of action is to nominate let's say let's say flake and Collins come out and go\nYou know what I Can't do it I'm not going to vote on friday I Can't vote for him great Donald Trump with in ten minutes should be on television and say in my opinion Mike Lee is the next the nominee and you know what he's already been vetted for the FBI and every senator knows them\nSo we're going to be calling for a vote next week easy easy

yesterday we had Larry sharp on he's running for governor of New York now and you remember how he had these out of the box ideas you know like your nobody's talking about that yeah I got an idea OK okay we administer sodium pedestal\nToo a Ford Kavanaugh\nAnd the entire committee mhm okay okay and then we just let the cameras were all this has nothing to do with getting the truth I just want to see it by saying I Want to see\nAll that bad I was doing that and I still do that last week\nYeah [laughter] I thought it would you love to see these guy because\nNobody is talking about fines Feinstein really nobody in the media is despicable I mean the I don't want to just take one side 'cause\nI'm not God so I don't know what happened I happen to believe Kavanaugh but uh on forward and most of that is because Ford has changed her testimony several times a day you just did it or to there's nothing support it but maybe she's telling the truth I don't know I'm not God\nSo if I have to put them in a room and choose one or the other I'm going to choose him because I don't think she has enough evidence for me to credibly say yeah he's\nA bad guy and even if I kind of believe term I still would ... there was a ... there that it's not on him you know he's not a direct proven negative correct\nSo I Hope he didn't do it um and I don't think she has proven that he did by any stretch it out I don't mean beyond a shadow of a doubt I mean just\nA preponderance of evidence there is an inclination I mean I honestly I just want I Do not believe you did your friend I don't need to not believe I don't either I'm now that's not to stay on as you point out we're not God even though you're pretty cool um so it's possible okay but I I don't I don't believe that he did\nRight so we've plowed this field over and over and over again you know how come nobody is plowing the field on how much they've destroyed her life Senator Feinstein is just droid her life\nThey lied to her several times lied to her she requested anonymity they released a letter anyway causing a chain of events that would obviously reveal who she was\nUm ... obviously they lied to her about the Democrats are the Republicans not willing to come out and take her testimony in California yeah she was surprised by that I mean look to be Frank I mean she's told many lives in this process as well\nUm and you know I I don't have all those realize what low things like you know she'd ever fly that's why she can't make it through the hearing and then oh well yes I Do fly often yeah I'm not ready for that was her lie or a valve was ally coming\nThe hearing and then oh well yes I Do fly often\nYeah I'm not like that was a lie or of that was the light coming from her attorney I mean I got her name on it so yeah but I think there were those around her that were also\nTime but but but lives in I mean you I mean you don't have videotape well it was yesterday or\nTape now we haven't seen it yet though uh-huh now there is allegedly videotape that exist some one of these physical altercation we ... we have not seen it yet I'm of course there's no video of the calving off thing because you know that wouldn't be the thing that we have to take her word that there is video with the\nWith the el Valle and ... and we don't have that evidence yeah I mean we have a a a ton of evidence and in fact\nI don't know hundreds of times more there's really no evidence and the forties so we I I don't have any um out more we have a preponderance of evidence in the Alice in case the however um\nWhat's interesting about this is that fifty six percent of Democrats believe Christine Blasey Ford's allegations fifty six percent only eight percent say they ... they believe Kavanaugh fifty six to eight\nIs a split there so you assume that if you ask people and it wasn't a partisan situation what do you think about the Alison situation\nDo you what do you believe from her because she's got a more recent allegation she's actually brought it to the attention in real time to multiple people people around her have seen evidence of this there's text messages there is a there are medical notes all the evidence that we just talked about there's\nAn infinity amount times more evidence in the elephant case\nHe had only five percent of Democrats believe Allison's accuser we're told over and over again that women are to be believed it only five percent of Democrats believe the allegations against Keith Ellison\nAnd here's why this is really important I'm just like I don't want an abuser on the Supreme Court\nIf if there was the amount of evidence on Kavanaugh but there is on a Keith Ellison I Would not be for Kavanaugh would you if there was amount on cabin up I Would yeah I Would if if if the evidence was the same thing yeah what\n\nWe still have a standard here in this country um called innocent until proven guilty and preponderance of evidence is a slower is a lower level than that\nAnd I understand that um my issue here would be\nYou can once there isn't the legal standard because people will say well this is just a job interview or this is just that this isn't a legal proceeding once you have the absence of a legal standard you have to choose the standard you apply\nI Choose to apply a very high standard because people who are in relationships many many times when he relationships breakup or someone feels jolted say things that are not true\nHaven't done all that I agree with that I live by the way you know in this case\nI'm Keith Ellison should have the right to defend himself and he should we\nShould assume his innocence unless I agree point in which a ... he is and if especially with a case like this where it's very recent\nThat should just go through the legal system and when he comes down to he's guilty then he should get thrown out of that job and you can factor that in in your vote if you wish\nBut I don't think he should lose any job because of this at this point he needs to you need to be able to see whether this case goes through and and claims are proven someone has said they have video we need to see the video we see every one or ... in investigated we need to see an actual police\nAre investigation and go through and and and see whether the evidence leads us to a belief that he actually committed these acts if we do not get that\nYou do not ruin people's lives over it I mean think about the amount of times of evidence that there is a with Keith Ellison overall you're more which everyone I mean even if a lot of people on the right\nWhere like look ... really looked like he did these things his answers are really bad\n... you know there's much more evidence for the ... much more there's people you can interview right now yeah children who went through traumatic moments where they had to read about their mom being abused or you know sure her telling other friends at the time that being said however you\nDidn't you he went through this process with the presumption of innocence agree\nSo but what I Know about she fell assumes the evidence against him mhm okay assuming this was not current day and it was thirty five years ago if Ford would come with that evidence\nI have letters I have a photo of lead bruises on my arm\nI have um uh I can tell you where it happened I told my friends and here they are they verify that I told them after the party ... would you not\nI have letters I have a photo of the bruises on\nMy arm I have um ah\nI can tell you where it happened I told my friends and here they are they verify that I told them after the party\n... would you not would you not\nGo okay I think that's good yeah I mean I think that would be enough and it was the only way we can judge the situation erect right correct here it is with Alison and again this is why it's important\nJust like I don't want to have a Supreme Court justice that is an abuser or a liar or whatever\nI also think it's extraordinarily dangerous to have a guy who\nMay have beaten his girlfriend may have mentally abused his girlfriend assuming the evidence is real and checks out you can't have him as the as the the the chief law enforcement of the state\nRight and does anybody care no this shows you that nobody in the media\nCares at an iota\nFor this woman and her story they don't care if she was abused and they don't care about any of it would they care about is stopping Brett Kavanaugh if they care thing would be just as passionate as a guy let's not just thrown out into the Minnesota attorney general this is a guy who was second in charge of the ... what does he and the idea and see\nThis is not a a a a ... a peripheral figure in politics he's one of the most powerful Democrats in America\nAnd is now going to be a chief law enforcement officer for state\nAnd you could say oh well it's all you're what you're doing is what about is um no no it's not it's not what about us and I apply the same standards Alison that I applied to Kavanaugh\nYou weren't doing this to Canada I Would still be saying this about I'm I'm a about ... yeah I mean look at going back to the white bronco why was Brock Obama president\nRight brought about was president because he won a presidential election in two thousand eight\nPreviously he made a heck of a speech\nIn what two thousand four right\nAnd that two thousand four ... election he won a Senate seat a Senate seat that would have been incredibly close if he was going against Alan Keyes who they flew in the last week to to start a campaign but it was a Jack Jack Ryan but it might be thinking of junk residency at this point\nI'm trying to think too many Amazon commercials but uh Ryan was his last name and he was a legitimate challenger\nTo Brock Obama in that Senate race it was a close election and he may have won it\nAs a Republican in Illinois wow and what they did is they went through his divorce is sealed divorce or um hearings and hit and paperwork\nOut it it to the public and in there there were accusations by his wife the actress who said they went to swingers clubs and all this sort of shady stuff\nDo we know if that was true oh\nUnited divorce proceeding and the divorce proceeding people make all sorts of ... yeah and that's why you don't just believe them that's why they're filled because they went and got them on the old in a democratic state and they they they ... Brian eventually dropped out there was no real opposition for a bronco bomb and you've got eight years of him\nThat sort of thing should be always\nViewed skeptically every claim of a crime should be viewed skeptically by people on that side you're supposed to give the presumption of innocence and close to start with skepticism of a claim on any side on any sat on any side of all people who are accused\nAnd here we are in a situation where Democrats overwhelmingly believe the accusations against Kavanaugh with almost no evidence\nAnd they only five percent of them believe the woman who is a Democrat who does not want someone of a ideologically opposed to ... to Keith Ellison to have that job she's a Democrat\nAnd only five percent of people believe her the the platitudes you hear from the media and the left mean nothing on the story they do not care about whether Ford was abused or not they don't [noise]\n\nAnd this shows you how fast that standard is applied and how [noise] and how your life could be destroyed you are on the wrong side of an issue and by the way I think you've seen the issues change\nAnd a physician's what's politically correct changes and if you don't abide one hundred percent and you're not on the right side will destroy your life\nWhile they'll let somebody else be fine this is why we must have a standard we must have a standard getting dangerous to be an American [noise]\nThat's the frightening thing to say [noise] All right I've been telling about gold lines do silver maple flex bar that uh the maple flex\nBar here still can you open this up and and uh then break some ... pieces off what it is it's it's a it's a\nIt's a bar of silver um and it's it's made by the Canadian meant and what you do is you take it and you break it apart and it's in one tenth of announced ones quarter of an ounce I couldn't get that one open either and I usually use them and\nI think it's a tricky one I think the glue that once you get them the or the fake birthday candle yeah there you go", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "year": "2018", "city": "Vernal", "day": "02"}
