outcome or what a great outcome would be out of this in my opinion is that going forward or people like Phyllis\nWould would be believed would at least be taken seriously not paying you've taken seriously believes if they have the evidence really taken seriously and and then and then would not fear coming out because if you had a evidence and you had a real story to tell\nIt would be believed

pursuit of happiness and the the the ten amendments to the constitution\nOkay well let's start there that's what brought people here and that's what's being lost\nIn the conversation we're arguing over parties and personalities that sound with Kavanaugh is really about it's not about did he do it or did he not do it if she lying as she telling the truth he had his about\nAre you innocent until proven guilty do we presume innocence do we look for facts is there a system in society outside of the legal standards where did the legal standards\nCome from the legal standards came from a group of people are founders and prior to that here in America they came here and said you know what I can just be taken off the streets I can be destroyed if somebody just says hey I'm I'm I'm the king or I'm a I'm a lord rama Duke and this person did that they're\nBelieved it I'm not no matter what the evidence is that's not right I don't want that those are the big principles than those are the things that we need to slowly\nStart to re engage our loved ones with because that's where you find unity\nAnd so much of the media coverage right now is just trying to give a justification to someone for destroying Kavanaugh's life ... it's like hey well we think that there was a chance to this because of this have you seen\nRonan Farrow lighting his credibility on fire over the past couple of weeks on the story yeah he first came out and said oh well none of the New York times none of the other major sources would run the story about the woman who said that Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself with a

story you find out about two thirds the way through that they couldn't find anybody\nAnybody who had any recollection of this and in fact the woman who even brought it forwards said she couldn't remember who it was she couldn't remember it was Brett Kavanaugh she just remembered it a couple of weeks ago but it was Brett Kavanaugh\nHow on earth when no one would print that and no one did right now that didn't lumped into your multiple accusations\nThey followed up on it in one of the most amazing stories I've ever seen\nThey said Ronan Farrow again a comes out and says we found a a witness to the story to the ... exposing themselves because the party when you read the story what you find out is a it was all here say they don't have anyone who was there it was people who said they heard about it at the time\nSo it was one person comes and says I have a witness I Know this person they they'll do about it at the time listen to this quote from the story it's an incredible\nThe the the

I witnessed the incident so the source of this person coming to the New Yorker\nHe I Want to talk to that person to confirm it he said that he had not been able to get any response from that person despite multiple attempts to do so okay\nReally shady why would you put that in ... listen to the next census remember this article was printed\nThe New Yorker did reach the classmate and he said he

it will go away and I think it will become very bad however\nIt's not the battle that you think it is you've been convinced by media and social media that everybody is thinking this way they are not\nDavid has a David Barton is with us he has a book out called this precarious moment uh he's written that with the James Carlo was a just a great great guy and good thinker\n'em and they have the stats and the book and they have different things we've ... we were concentrating just for a second on millennials because I Know David has seen it and I've seen it 'cause we're doing it with mercury one\nAnd when you present the facts to millennials\nIf you're not trying to when they say wait a minute what\nDavid talk about a few of the millennials that we have had in for our two week you know training course and they have actually come\nA little hostile sense right yeah we have a number of\nColumbus skeptics that are here to disapprove of that show that we're all wrong and\nIt's All right you know we don't we don't runs in that situation would ... them and say let's have a conversation as long as you and gauge and the Congress right and so we start asking them questions and you know they have their opinions but we just ask them questions and that's kind of like they sit back and uh I don't know\nAnd so what you ask the questions that lead them to the information it's amazing to see that they didn't take those questions or go back to those that taught them and change that we literally we have a girl that came in that you know learned all sorts of stuff she went back to her professor started asking her professor questions\nHe got all befuddled 'cause he didn't know the answers he now has asked her to meet with him once a week and teach teach him what she learned in all these classes amazing it's amazing\nAnd and she said she wrote a report and he said you are either a liar and you're going to get an ass or this is the best paper see me in my office that's right and she he said okay I Want to talk to you about your sources\nAnd she had him nailed down and said he had never here's a professor but didn't know\nThis stuff and economics professor\nAnd he found out that founding father John Witherspoon had the greatest impact of any person in American history and American economics and he didn't know that and she showed him that and then show them the documentation\nAnd he said okay I I Want more because I clearly didn't but that's the thing of asking questions with relationships and we take these these guys that come in hostile or otherwise\nAnd just because of relationships but ... and as we tell them we have a lot of fun with them and quite frankly we tell them that sarcasm so love language and we don't make fun of us because we don't like you know I think there's the [laughter] so you know we we we kid and joke and I have a great great time but they come out transform and there's some of the most mature individuals and these these\nThings were not settled long ago and we have argued a common language\nHow dare you insist as if\nThis was just some idea that a bunch of racist had\nHad been Franklin is a great example because been Franklin talked about how so many Germans from moving into Pennsylvania and they were\nAnd he said the problem is they're speaking their own language there started to create signs in German they're starting to create documents and German you can't have a nation if you don't speak the same language so Franklin was one of the first ones out that Thomas Jefferson the same thing\nHe said we have immigrants coming in which is great and by the way they were so pro immigration than in the declaration of independence one of the twenty seven grievances was\nWere separating from Great Britain because he's trying to stop immigration we won't immigration it's just we wanted a simulation with immigration they were huge pro immigration\nSimulation I mean ... ... he was Thomas Jefferson they will bring with them the principles of the government they leave him by with their own early you involved in the early use\nThese old principles with their language they will transmit to their children the proportion to their numbers they will share with us in legislation they will infuse it into their old spirit warp and biased it's directions and render it uh as heterogeneous incoherent and distracted\nMass he says the solution is thought better to discourage their settling together in large masses and they should distribute themselves sparsely among the native for a quick or assimilation\nThis goes right with with this it seems to me necessary this is Franklin seems to be necessary to distribute the um the German is the Germans\nA more equally mix them in with English established English schools that are now where they are now too sick we settled I Am against the it I Am not against the admission of Germans in general for they have virtues their industry for galaxy blah blah blah they're great farmers\nHe's just saying we have to get them to be Americans this is the opposite of what we're doing a no Dearborn\nMichigan I mean we we want people to simulate and we don't want them creating a parallel culture where it's almost a no go zone now for for police\nSomalians in in um Minnesota exactly\nAnd we got groups in West Texas creating their own separate communities and that's not it it's assimilation you want to become an American you don't come to America to take over and move to whatever your country was\nYou come here to be an American now that's where the professors the elite groups really are into all America's really bad ... you know we need we need to be like you or for whatever\nOne way to lose it is is to not pay attention to what they did and one of the things we try to do in the book is we don't we're not into government solutions we tried to give things that every single individual can do because America gets healthy from the bottom up not the top down\nYou say that racial healing is fairly easy all we have to do is do it ... what what what is the plan for racial healing\nYou know the there are several things one is you've got to change some of your knowledge basis or find with millennials they are taught about race from the way the professor see it and we shut them seven things that everyone needs to know about race and generally they don't the historical\nBut remember oh stop you had with those are oh yeah there are several things of this the first permanent ... is permanent slavery was introduced in America by black man Anthony Johnson who sued ... on other black men\nTo make your dreams reality it's not my day and are friendly staff will be glad to help you find just the right piece of furniture to fit your lifestyle\n[noise] those hormones [laughter]\nThe right down by ... they stopped it was years later it was probably a decade later before slavery stopped in Indian nations although what we do a show slavery is a human problem it is not a black white problem despite what your professors say it has a problem and the way you view humankind\nSo we go through and and so for example Tim Scott and James Lankford in the U.S Senate have come up with with this thing where you invite other people from other races to come eat a meal with you on Sunday come into your house and you know learning and touch you don't solve racism institutionally you saw that one person at the time change in a hard time seeing people different\nAnd not having this black white polarization that we often try to make today\nHow worried are you David about the level of anger now level the anger is a real problem but what it what is derived from is is the bigger problem and the stereotypes and and and all these\nThings we really don't know each other\nAnd once you get to know each other and what you did this inter relational stuff like with millennials ... and like with folks of other races and other groups once you start doing individual stuff that's where it breaks down and that's where you're able to demonstrate that you know what you thought about may or what you thought about this group is not accurate where individuals were made in God's image we have equality\nAnd we can get along great if all sit down and talk to you if you're going to your book Len I'm an addict it outraged ... that's exactly it you you sit down and have conversations on bigger things\nSo real quick just one last give me the six things that you say are these are the six urging steps\nThat they're actually six urging areas what we've got to do an immigration what we have to do in our relationship with Israel what we have to do with millennials what we have to do with the people of faith doing a terrible job right now is when people of faith or so we go through those six areas and\nLet me lose touch on Israel our relationship with Israel is pretty good ideas are now your concern in the book about Christians are starting to become anti Semitic\nThey are becoming anti Semitic or wait what has changed just last well we don't know the scriptures well anymore and that we have the highest level of biblical literacy of any generation American history and so we're ah we're seeing sixteen hundred anti Israel events a year on college campuses\nUh people don't know much about the Palestinians but they're told they're press people in Israel is doing it so we have a real\nIndividual turn against Israel and a lot of denominations are coming out against Israel the nomination as it used to be very pro Israel now you only yes absolutely absolutely\nYeah these are the more liberal churches though their their their water called mainstream the nomination so that that you know it's kind of like the United Methodist Church usa those\nSo they had never been anti Israel before but now they are they're they're coming out and they're wondering due to BBS kind of stuff to boycott the best ensure and sanctions so there is a growing anti Semitic movement among people of faith and America which is certainly a problem\nNow this administration is an ... job on restoring things it's just it's it's an absolutely amazed yeah but that doesn't solve the individual problems we have a college campuses and at churches and people say\nDavid Barton and James Carlo the name of the book is this precarious

I see\nA we have that screen the strata\nUm uses if you'd be icy to just huge and we'll have a crane there to lift it up and ah can be a ... we were trying to make this a annual event and this is kind of the even though we've had watched parties in the past this is a this is a whole nother a level\nWe're trying to me that are really wired line they involve the and a half\nTo stop yourself because it's hard it is hard when you have little kids your tired\nYour patient says one so I think that's fun it really is challenging that they get older than you can kind of reflect back and you\nKnow you're getting good night sleep ...\nYeah you're you're feeling you maybe you've practiced on the first one that you know what you've done wrong I don't know you know just I'm just saying I think\nThese young on out there I think it's hard with these little kids to stop sometimes and and really be in that moment when you're just ... yeah so\nAnd I think that's part of the goal of this this program is to is to reach out to you always say I think in this particular case if you\nIf you had had identified the main audience we were\nTargeted we uh probably young moms and dads and and you know encouraging them to to be a little more thoughtful mindful about their interaction actions with their children so so so that's kind of one of the key pieces\nA that we want to emphasize Barry is that is parenting is a ...\nA thousand small moments ... it's not it's not a summer vacation you take it's not the Christmas or get away to some place where you spend a lot of money it's those daily events how how you get sent off to school\nSize Barry is that ... parenting is a thousand small moments ... it's not\nIt's not the summer vacation you take it's not the\nChristmas or get away to some place where you spend a lot of money it's those daily events how how you get sent off to school um how you agreed each other you know when the school the school days done it's the bedtime routines it's it's the reading it's playing catch in the back yard\nUm it's it's a sixteen year old that ah went out on her for a first date and comes home and wants to visit about uh you know the the day's events and and things so it is these thousand small small moments is not the\nIt's not the big thing it's it's the daily the\nThe daily grind of daily interactions the daily daily patterns that are that are critical critical um so as as we as we kinda lay some of the foundation for our radio program this fall we're really going to be focusing\nIn on three different areas\nIn the in those areas or the title of the book love limits and latitude or the Tricia tell tell us what kinda as we focus on love what can the audience expect us to to to be covering their\nThoughts on this is this portion all about building a relationship and bomb between you and your child so that you can go on to that limit and\nYou know create like it'd be kits setting limits I Know a lot of times people are like I said is that they're not doing it and that and we watch like ...\nLike this child is broke and they're not listening when really it's coming from like it has to come from you okay and you're listening to you or want to limit their respective than it is there's no relationship there so that's a really\nImportant to focus on is that he's speaking it really that that that takes half of the other piece that without having a relationship with your child and you're lugging you unwind you listen to the a lot then\nNone of us were you know the restaurant was more [laughter]\nYou know and Barry Barry we've been running this uh program for a number of years in a different different sites and some of the early research the that we did on the program\nI'm about I'm about about\nEighty five percent of of the fathers who who've taken this program ah when when we asked the question before they took the class about what was their major concerned about their child\nAnd and in about eighty five percent of them are said that you know my child's disobedient or my child doesn't mind mind me and um [noise]\nSo so the we we would have these dad's coming to this class and we would be talking about OK you really\nYou need you really need to work on being nice to your child you need alert you need to work on you know knowing how to play with them how to give them attention how to how to have conversations with them and you\nCould just tell by the look on their faces that they were like you know you're telling me all this warm fuzzy psychological bully you know baloney here what what what they need is some discipline and and they need some structure\nThey yeah yeah [laughter] and they they ... they yeah they um they they need to respect\nWe and and so is it it was important for for for for these dads that as we talk to that that they understood we're we're going to address discipline issues here\nBut will be a lot more successful early if we can actually increase the the feelings of of love your child has a towards you\nAnd and if they can start to experience more of that from you they're actually going to be in a better place psychologically to receive the discipline when when when that is appropriate and and so our first five sections\nOr Todd ... focus on a you know how to love a child where we're going to talk about\nPlay tension in praise of conversations and then then the daily the daily routines and so in our early ... research\nOr the next time we surveyed these are the the parents who were taking the program was after the love section and and for those eighty five percent of the fathers it went down to about thirty five percent who who who continue to be\nConcerned about their child's discipline and so for for about half of the fathers and the class their child\nWas starting to be more respectful to them as they increase that relationship with them and so we knew going into this program as we dealt developed at the literature is is so supportive\nAnd and and you know we don't call it it's not called loving the literature it's actually called attachments theory [noise]\nUm but it's love and and the ... when a child when the child feels like they're cared about it in and they have at least one primary\nAdult in their life that cares about them it's really critical for for for their development on on a number ... number of low levels and so\nSo that's that's one of the reasons that that we focus on the loving for first is to um really help\nAh the parents understand that this is the first step and the good things will happen in the ... in their relationship with their child as they ... implement a ... some of these ideas [noise]\nI I was just going to say I I like this because I think that um when you spend time with your kids it gives you an idea of\nMaybe why later they're acting out or or maybe something will happen at school or or just\nTaking an interest in their life and so I you know when when you're talking about ... and ... and ... phone concerned that this plan I think\nI Love the research on that because it it does it comes right down to if you spend time with them that helps you to understand really what they need and so I and I kind of live\nAnd they say it's not like it quick and you're like no I was talking and then you know trying to do that and they're like well I did play with\n[laughter] you know and the last minute\nAnd then the next day they're not listening and [laughter] you know when I wrote down the these relationships so it's certainly not going to happen overnight or one day a plane of a sudden they're going to respect you and be like hey everything's great stuff ... ... take time\nAnd and I think you know related to that the Trish I think um I always encourage parents that you'll take this class to\nKind of think of it from ... you know kind of assess it one month at a time or you know give give yourself you know four weeks of practicing this and and and then kind of assess your relations your your relationship [noise] um\nI I I like you go to like you're going to and like you're going to be with each other every single day regardless so do you want to make it fun or\nBut from ... you know kind of assess it one month of the time um you know give give yourself you know four weeks of practicing this and and and then kind of assess your relations your your relationship I'm\nSorry go ahead you go to like you're going to and like you're going to be with each other every single day regardless no do you want to make a positive or negative you know it's just kind of like you have to spend the time and then you have to be anyway and we\nFound that the holiday is that where it's hockey right yeah\nYou know my wife my wife teaches ah surely she teaches a lot of the early childhood of course is here with us you and she's always listening to two books and\nAnd TED Talks and and on on young children in particular and and she's reading this book right now and I it she listens to ... to it also\nIn the morning when she when she was getting ready so I can hear some of the content so I've been\nLike oh this is pretty good ... I think it's called the the boy in it from the woods and and it was this this young boy did they actually found a it was over in Europe somewhere that had you know just all basically had been raised as an orphan\nChild and and even was out it was literally a it in the woods when when when he was he was discovered\nThat there are members of a larger society that\nTheir members of the family visit they they should have chores they should have responsibilities or they should they should work they should do things that help the family function they should do well you know give their best efforts to in in in their schooling or they should\nEarn their or you know have opportunities to burn or earn money and\nAnd and those are all skills\nThat parents help that child developed through a limits guiding them teaching them discipline\nGiving them consequences and consequences aren't about being mean it's about teaching them appropriate and inappropriate ways of of of doing things and so that's the limit peace\nAnd then towards the end of the semester\nVery we'll talk about latitude um latitude latitude is basically respecting the child's individuality\nGiving them wiggle room to not not just giving them wiggle room to be themselves but pricing them that their their differences and and when you look at a home environment that has these three elements love limits the latitude first of all and and if they're instill installed in that home the child is going to feel secure\nThey are going to learn how to be a member of a larger society\nThe family but also they're going to learn how to be independent that's what latitude does latitude helps the child grow and to become independent so that\nWhen the when when when it's appropriate to launch them they they can leave the home system and and in and do well in and they don't need to\nYou know they don't need to come back and stay with mom and dad after they graduated from college so [laughter] thoughts\nI Know I I mean I really like you thought about like not everybody can\nAnd we're now more than ... people and you have to each other just like adults we all had differences and the like and like a ... definitely\nYeah trying on their unique qualities I guess so\nSo so today we're going to talk about the first step in developing a love for your child and that is through play\nAnd and play play players play is very unique to children and and you know just just thinks it and just pause for a moment and think about what what a child looks like when they play\nUm there are so engrossed in what they're doing there there's no trace you just said they're so they're so happy\nAnd it's just pure joy [laughter]\nI feel like we need a plane and they don't tell you with that thing around you know this isn't that where we play and taking levy and things like that and so they you know I mean is clear that that plane like they have better brain and\n... and early development there more than that or impulse control and so some elation emotional regulation that stuff just gets there's like so many great that is to play but I think the\nAnd so we're going to encourage that we're we're going to encourage parents playing with their children in in in a pretty specific ... very very very specific way but the play play\nEmotional regulation that are so says there's like so many great things is to play but I think the church and and\nAnd so we're going to encourage that we're we're going to encourage parents playing with their children in in in a pretty specific ... very very very specific way but both play play is is really\nHow how children learn how the world works around them and and uh what one child development developmental theorist\nHis name John ... he's he's passed away many years ago but he uh he he he studied his own\nChildren and it came up with this model that that really is the model that even though it's years old there's it's it it's very accepted that this is kind of how children\nLearn how the world works how they develop these ideas about how the world around around them works\nAnd and so play play isn't just important for their social development that's also very important for the cognitive development 'cause that's how they figure out the ... the rules of physics and and things like you know things things like that so I have\nLike thirty minutes everyday life is rough and tumble play actually I'm like I said there's brain derived ... factor and thirty minutes after they actually change the genie sessions or brain is now released you know encouraging that and stuff and not that you know people with um\nThe tiger be DNA is are less likely to have like Alzheimer's Parkinson's and all that stuff like that so it's really like\nThat something is important as a child and then to go on and then don't you know\nAnd I know and I think it's important that we that we really do you take the time now to do that because sometimes I think we just\nGive them a pile of like ... [laughter] and say you go you know and now I'm going to go off and I know it's a ... that was kind of a saving grace that and at the same time when you really do sit down in\nAn interactive kids respond so much better um my girls are older now that they're playing volleyball and so we just we took him to the gym or the other day and we spent\nForty five minutes just forty five minutes just kind of plain and helping them but it was still family made it fun and just the way that the night went after that I just felt like they responded to last they felt close to us and I think it's it doesn't have to be that's\nAll they play lawns so don't panic that you aren't going to get anything done I think it's just taking some\nYou know it's not snap at the time throughout the day to do that and dad's\nYeah and and Kim my light you know I Want to comment on\nYou know you're you're yeah what you said you know so sometimes moms you know the lego set sit down and play with lego set for ... you know a half hour why go do this is necessary right right they they need that to get through the day but but they're but they're but but we are asking them you know to be\nI'm mindful and encourage them to set aside about twenty minutes a day and we'll talk about this in a minute here where they are\nPlaying with their child they are interacting with their child ah one one one on one with their child and then I like how your you know you mentioned your your twins right now they're they're playing volleyball now\nUm and that's that's how play of falls you know ... ... in in a four year old\nIt might be it might be the lego set it might be a maybe not yeah four year olds they can do leg goes up picking up my grandson can do leg goes um ... those patterns get established early and then uh my as they grow and as they develop it might become\nYou know spending time with them in the volleyball\nCourt you know serving to them or whatever you do are hitting back to them and you're still those same principles of of being together and and enjoying enjoying that moment so go ahead no shift your mind\nI was just thinking of that remind me of time when my third child like from six to nine here which downplayed them and we always called the game like you can't win because it was some rules and so you could never win and it was like a like a card game\nAnd no matter what he believes you make you know it was just so funny 'cause we didn't change the rules or anything but we\nYou know as adults who are like let's say you can't and you know but he did that so much fun doing it and he you know it was of all that at the little tiny plane differently and so [laughter]\nSo a treasure you want to go over um step one\nSure so just so did you need to step one is sending that tying\nSending you a chance to Fifteen to twenty minutes a day for that is just very uninterrupted no distraction play with your child that you're going and it's going to be at ... um\nChild met so this is not going to be you to hang up and a Half Men are you changing thing so this is the first [noise] you know at this time with your cat and\nI I mean is that men everyday but obviously you know we think that if you have six children that would be what you might have to schedule or something\nRight now I I had the child led play um one thing that I like about that is that it doesn't touch stress like we're going to do it my way because then it really takes away the the whole plane to that so so they're leading you're getting what they want to do not what you think they should be doing\nAnd it's more you're just letting them take the lead which I like\nTo find the time when you know and you know your child's going to be in a mood to play and not you know like right before lunch or you know during lunch or right when it's not famous something mean time where they're going to be in ...\nIn that and I can picture you know young moms out there going you know maybe I have three children and how how do I what what do I do there that I I Would say you'll pick pick one the one of your children and probably the one that you probably you're most concerned about that may be\nYou know the one the worries you the most and in in focusing on them and try to play with that one child ... every day for for for\nTwenty minutes and so that's step one and then and then step too is letting the child leaders you guys as you as you guys have said no this is easier said than done", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Glenn Beck Program", "city": "Vernal", "day": "04"}
