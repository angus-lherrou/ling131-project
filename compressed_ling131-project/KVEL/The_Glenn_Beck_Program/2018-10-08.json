moderators could face considerable risk of defamation lawsuit by anyone's name they mention in connection with the criminal behavior or sexual assault that gives rise to civil liability\nPersonally this is why I Believe anyone\nWho falsely accused and I do not necessarily include Ford I don't believe there's enough evidence to say that she did it but I also don't think there's enough evidence\nThat she wasn't telling of is saying an event that she thought Brett Kavanaugh was involved in\nHowever the gang rape and the boating uh it'd be a boating weekends from hell those people should be investigating\nMe I've probably primarily the person who made an accusation and then later recanted it on Twitter\nUm you know here's someone who actually admitted that they were lying about it\nA ... I mean should you face repercussion for that and that is yes you should gimmick false allegations like the bigger deal in our society\nOr the or the moderators of the site said we hope that anyone

false\nAnd these things stick with you for years they ruin your reputation for ever\nAnd you know this is not minor posting on verified things like this should not be the way our society goes there yes there have been issues this is a problem I mean you talked about that with the with like sort of pendulum theory before Glen when swings back one way and so in fact the other even further\nUm you know there are a lot of things that we've seen that have come out of this I think everyone in the art in the audience would agree are are positive\nRight like people like you know Harvey Weinstein right with tons and tons and tons of evidence going down or at least having he still has not been charged and should be um but the idea that some women actually did go\nAre are positive right like people like you know Harvey Weinstein right with tons and tons and tons of evidence\nGoing down or at least having he still has not been charged you should be um but the idea that some women actually did go and one of the reasons we know about Harvey Weinstein and we can really all kind of come together and say yeah he was\nActually doing these things is because a couple of women went to authorities and got him on tape doing it yeah with the authority which the authorities and that is why it's a lot easier to feel good about a saying Harvey Weinstein is guilty\nThen it is about a

think Syria gets his answers from\nIt gets his answers from both Syria is is you know Apple's personal assistant so I mean I could go on and on and on but taxi\nAs the institutional level there are things that he has to be done uh\nOne of them which I'm helping to work on with people now and we need money so you know if you if you guys have money out there you know step up a but we we are building monitoring system is is that you know basically filled with people's permission to look over people's shoulders and see what\nThese companies are actually showing people and how they're manipulating people\nI Would love it but I'd love to be a part of that um how can people donate to that\nWell they can go to my Google research dot com my Google research dot com that's a very simple way to donate that supports\nThe research shows that I Do but also a that's helping to provide funds to build monitoring systems which which must exist they don't exist I did build one or two thousand sixteen but\nWe need large scale permanent monitoring systems to keep all these these creepy arrogant people under control\nSo I Am very I'm concerned\nI'm about the GI and a a sigh I'm and I'm I'm concerned that in two ways\nI feel as though we need some sort of a Manhattan Project to make sure America is the one that gets at first\nBut on the other hand I don't know who I trust to have it I mean you cannot put the genie back in the bottle but when when we had a GI we are in real trouble are we not\n[noise] ah ...\nHave no idea [laughter] if if if if no seriously if you if you ...\nBut on

back to bed though I've I mean I've I've I've read a lot about it\nSo what do you suggest what do you what what what should we be what should we be as in I mean I mean Congress has just useless our government is just they're not paying attention to this at\nAll and it's moving so rapidly by the time they would enact something it will be too late\nThat is correct so regulation in law is not going to help us too much because I just moved too slowly and and ... it was extremely fast so uh you know that doesn't mean we shouldn't you know contact are are are are are kind of a congressional representatives correctly should\nJust try to keep the pressure on ... I've I've been a speaker uh at at meetings of the attorneys general the state attorneys general in there and those guys those guys and those women can move they can move\nFast they do things so [noise] you know a lot beyond that\nYou know you you've got to start at the individual level I mean if you're using Gmail right now that's insane\nIf you're using chrome that's insane if you're using an Android phone that's that's all Google the ear nuts you're crazy\nTo use product because those are all just surveillance platforms that's all they are that they're they're they're just gonna see up surveillance platforms they're just they're just excuses Google has come up with a for us to just tell them everything about ourselves you know how much information Google has about you\nKnow\nThey have 'em just based on your age which is I Know roughly a they have the equivalent of about three million word pages of information about you oh\n[noise]\nSo I I mean\nI I guess I mean I guess I made a point to where you don't get up out of bed like you I mean I ... so it's overwhelming so what does that mean what I mean how do we\nThere's no way to get it back are you familiar with solid let me go here you familiar with solid and interrupt\nYes\nIs there any chance that that is going to play a role in the future is that a pathway\nA ... ...\nI it's hard to tell I ...
