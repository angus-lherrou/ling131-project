the way who was a who was leading that at the time or or at least commenting publicly there are a lot on\nThat now we're hearing from the same media people that we should be jumping immediately to we absolutely know what happened and how can we haven't punish Saudi Arabia yet yeah and I think that that's been the transformation of of the news is that everything now is seen through a Trump prism\nAnd clearly the you know the Saudi Arabian explanations have been suspect there's first of all they didn't know anything about it first of all while he was gone and he left\nA we we don't know where he went hoops while we never saw him leave out the front door did you have another yeah he went out the back window I I don't know and then and then well okay yeah he's he's dead or a we killed

U. I. D. A. and Q A ETA all different spelling I don't understand it so I heard ... ... cars shockey initially they could show the\nA and now on the way in today I heard in New York Times a person they cause\nCause showed G oh you really a show gee\nIt's a whole new one and now we're like a week into the store and there's already three where your pronunciation this guy's name ... can we fell on something\nWe want to call them Bob I'm fine with that you would have I mean what's interesting Jamal Jamal Jamal was killed at the embassy we can all say it was ... and what does all know Jamal\nChris Yogi ... or ... ...\nAnd then whatever the pronunciation is tomorrow but\nYou're right we got to get together on that because that drives me out of my mind it really is irritating yeah it is [noise] it is\nI I I never understood that Osama Osama thing how did that happen why why did\nThat happen because it's even less explored couple\nRight the here you have a situation where it is the name it's spelled the same but were pronouncing it different at least you can understand that\nOsama went to summer they shouldn't be a letter [laughter] they just said no no no no it's a it's a you know the guy went from like mid range pick in kick false elastic I [laughter] like ... when this happened you're studying German the guy is dead\nAnd you know whatever ... you know no one ever said you know Osama's wrong it should be Usama ...\n... why no no it just started and if people just started using it\nVery strange\nBut it is very strange uh and like some of it I I get to understand like for example ah here we say the tiny little country that James Bond goes to the casinos Monaco\nRight ... ... if you're over there they call it ... ... everyone calls it Morocco now I've never heard that I Will say here's another one here we say Mazda for the car ...\nIf you listen uh as as as a Canadian sports celebrity I Do quite often to Toronto blue jays games on the radio they the mad though\nIt's mad of Toronto ... really really I wouldn't get to that I Would say I mean would you be pissed off of you also yeah they'll call us ... that were not bad stuff\nThat we are I've also noticed the jaguars are being called jak you are you are all the commercial on a jaguar\nWhat it's like they like if you come up with a name on your\nOwn maybe you can describe to us what how how it's pronounced\nBut what does the word we already know and so you were a hundred years yeah stop it it's an animal yes and it's just a car it's an animal to write a buddy ever says jak you are\n[laughter] the Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that yeah I think that\nHow it's pronounced but what is the word we already know and they were here we it's an animal yet\nAnd that's just a car it's an animal to right now what do you ever since you are [laughter] the Jacksonville Jaguars or no I think that yeah I think that jak you are trying to seem fine\nRight like it was like if there's something nothing a little new to you about the way they pronounce mhm er jaguars like at the at the stupid animal over they're ripping up my dog walking or\nWould you be gone\nOr they're ripping up by a journey into my dog a terrible I've but luckily I felt with my bones on top of it though everything's going to be okay but you know ... three times last week alone for me and it was fifty some for you over the last three weeks okay okay no wonder [noise]\nThis come from Miami [laughter] healthy just torture her with an ad for the rest of her life [laughter] 'cause then you can I can understand\nThis you know sometimes I I think even you know ... like conservatives get made fun of when they do these types of things are like when you watch uh you know that there's a there's one cartoon the kids were watching at one point that was and it was just it was just like a nonstop commercial for recycling\nAnd it was like I Know it was a captain planet or what ever do that that is an actual that one is actually a legitimate effort to change kids' minds about environmental is a minute yeah they you know people who created it actually talked about that but I don't know what this bill would not have been a pig or something it's usually pepper pick I like to have to pick a lot\nA and a pet but it was talking about you know recycling or something I don't know how important it wasn't looking Muslim recycling whatever like I don't have any\nPassion for recycling I think there's some some ah there's some conflicting evidence as to what good does a there's been several studies that have shown not\nMuch not much if any clearly you work for all caller i._d. apparently\nNot know but uh yeah like I don't know do I really need a giant a commercial about environmental wisdom on my kids programming I and I feel like no no but I mean he also can get a little bit worked up about that stuff\n... you know I mean you can get a little a little fire it up with trying to find the political messages and these things even if they're there I mean kids\nGrow up into you know adults second thing for themselves\nAnd you know you kinda have to at some point I realized that you're not going to be able to control every little bit of that you can just you can do your best and I guess with her values probably the most important thing is to point out I mean she's probably doing you know I'm very worried about\nUh you know she thinks Brett Kavanaugh's are everywhere and and at any points or they're going to be an assault going on and\nYou know what I mean maybe this is this is consistent with what she wants to pass along to me it's just\nIt's a lot of it is and I remember when people were concerned conservatives were concerned mostly uh about some of these Disney movies because of the things that they put in the Disney movie like\nI'm In the is it the rescuers are the rescuers down under one of those\nUh there's a scene where the character is going down a street on I don't know some type of vehicle and there's a woman or on the ... in one of the buildings they passed that naked for justice\nSplit second I remember hearing over that yeah yeah so conservatives who would talk about that and it would be oh whose job it you can't even see that that's a it's a limit will you don't even know it's there and then there was the lion king a scene where a\n... as simple as as a grown lion\nKind of plop down on the side of a cliff and the dust shoots up informs the word sex\nIf you ... [laughter] remember that or this yeah ever that but we were in saying for talking about any of that yeah oh\nPlease that's nonsense but you're supposed to tell your kids or you need to ask where's that apple is from why why do I need to eat the apple where the ...\nCentury she's saying that rape culture is happening yeah Disney yes and that's a terrifying message I was ... or send the children [laughter] ... although we we've had this before I mean the ... the one I always think about as Willie walk on the chocolate factory\nWhich is a movie African love I mean I Love that movie but what happens at the scene where they're just going through the tunnel and I and all of a sudden like a really quick like subliminal things you see like a chicken get its head cut off\n[laughter] and a good one this children's movie it's terrifying that whole scene is terrifying\nI like I remember that yeah oh my God like they go through the tunnel and it's like really like psychedelic and weird and like it's that I remember that being yeah well I live close to what's going on in there it's not good [laughter] it doesn't really ... she gets his head cut off like this like a career out\nOf this is why I'm bringing them making me think I don't know I think as opposed to the scene is supposed to set the like off putting a like if it's supposed to give you an off putting feel like it's supposed to be like things are all everything's twisting around and like it's dimensions are almost changing and like all these strange things are happening and you see like\nHad cut off yeah like there's like a real up of this is why I'm bringing up making me think I don't know I think as opposed to the scene is supposed to set the like off\nPutting a like if it's supposed to give you an off putting feel like it's going to be like things are all everything's twisting around and like it's dimensions are almost changing and like all these strange things are happening and you see like\nThe scary or what was the guy's name uh with the with the ever left alas he wanted the everlasting God stopper they kept harassing the poor kid in for it and then he worked for Willie won't get the ... I don't remember a cat once they've Woodward but that's about ...\nI got a lot of things messed up my mind and maybe that does happen now and then he's going through and it's supposed to have that weird\nLike you're almost did the feeling yeah and they flash like a bunch of really fast images and want to like like they're just\nTrying to get chickens head off in the ... and she very strange yeah so we've been tortured with is up for a long time and look how well we turned out the world's fine right everything's going really well I Can't see how there'd be any\nDownside [laughter] I I guess you can get to that point where your over your over parenting right oh definitely and that's\nCertainly yeah it'd be the way uh you know that things are going now we we um we recently started a letting our son ... cause I listen to Lenore Skenazy a lot she's been on the show before she started an organization called let grow\nAnd a free range kids and basically hurt mission in life is and you make kids do some\nThings like you don't need to helicopter parent over them all the time she's famous for uh she lives in New York still doesn't believe and she let her nine year old to go on the New York city subway system by himself\nAnd she was called the worst parent in America and Europe ... honestly my immediate reaction when I read that story initially was she's the worst parents in America right like you're you're you're all of a subway by themselves like I Can't even imagine the amount of panic I Would have\nBut then you you kinda have to do it I don't think I could do it either um what'd you step back and he said well wait a minute like George Washington was like I think he won the revolutionary war to eight years old or something like this in the ... we went through a long period of time where people were\nAre supposed to be as kids are much more self sufficient you know I Know when I was a kid like we would leave the house and we would go play at a friend's houses that all the time the time with you on the whole day yeah and that whole thing about us coming back\nAnd um you know you come back when it gets dark or when the streetlights come on ... and I like it\n... we use that a lot of times to signify things were safer and better than it wasn't even true I grew up in the nineties this is like in the eighties and nineties more the eighties but no I was getting my wrist in America by far\nMore dangerous than now this is a much ... I mean the crime rates were higher ah murders were higher kidnappings were higher everything was worse school shootings were ready to four times what they are now when I was in high school and I didn't have a minute of panic over a school shooting in my entire life\nI think we get to that point where we're just we get so freaked out we recently had our you know we have her son like walking walking her dog with a little shore and he's doing it by himself or just up the street a little bit and back and I can tell you just that\nFreaks me out like I ... and everything in me not to walk to the end of my driveway and spy on him to make sure he's okay the entire time and I don't know why that is that certainly is and how it was when I was a kid yeah uh and I I I somehow live through it\nI think that the the the instinct there is to just make sure you're mentioning every little thing that you think could go wrong in their life so that if that thing does go wrong you can't blame yourself\nYou know it's like it's almost a selfish instinct where you're just like wow at least I told her I ... I remember telling my kid five hundred times not to go down a dark alleys and they went to a dark alley and well it's really sad but at least it's not my fault that's a that's not a really healthy instinct for parents I I Do feel like that is that the basis of it because of course you don't want no one wants anything bad to happen to their kids\nBut if additional that like you don't want to be the person who let your kid walk down a street and were something terrible happened because everyone's going to look at you and say what the hell are you doing allowing them to walk down that street why were you there yeah um so it's like a double whammy and I think that leads to a lot of that over parenting stuff and ... and I'm sure\nThis is the boat she's in her ... right like she's trying to protect me look you're not going to ... you're not going to say anything\nTo a four year old reading Cinderella that's going to protect them from rape culture that's not going to occur\nYou're never you're never going to be able to solve this problem you believe is so prevalent ... by a story you tell them after a while I was reading Cinderella or watching it\nOr the Little Mermaid um or any of these uh Disney movies because they're already going to be a messed up from Simba falling down and blowing\nThe word sex right of the year from the dust ah that's going to mess them up a lot of teen pregnancy is causing a lot on Tripoli Seventy seventies decay [noise]\nAm nine twenty and F ing one oh four or five came he um [noise]\n\nYou know that feeling when you just know you're experiencing a whole new level of excellence I have felt it a few times a first luxury car even my first iPhone you're experiencing a game changer that is exactly the way I felt and you will feel the\nFirst time you sit in an ex chair I knew immediately the generic chair the suck and we spend so much time in those stupid chairs get a great chair\nAnd ... chair most of us spend more time in our office chair then in that that's why the ex Jerry's so important ex chair now on sale for a hundred dollars off they'll do X chair back dot com right now that's the letter acts share back dot com or call one eight for for for\nX chair ex cheer comes with a thirty day no questions asked guaranteed just go to ... dot com use the promos go back that's B.

E. C. K. you can join a meat for pack released immediately preceding a this particular program will wake you up and get you ready for a Glenn show every morning Monday through friday\nAnd Kobe Bryant is the latest victim of the me too movement or apparently he was invited to a a an animation film festival to be a juror or about some of the some of the new animation films that were coming out and they invited him to to be part of\nThat because he just won an Oscar actually for a his basketball movie\nAnd so he agreed to do that and then the me too movement reminded these people that do of course now that he's been accused in the past and a Fifteen Years ago he was accused of rape now those charges were dropped\nAnd so the whole thing was adjudicated no you get used to be that if charges were dropped you were considered to be not guilty write them whatever\nInteresting I charged with you're bringing up where did you come up with that I Do um I was in a un planning university constituted humidity then or could it be ... that the yeah [laughter]\nNo no no it's now a scotch I'm not familiar with it yeah the thing that you don't really need to pay attention to any more 'cause it's really old that really old he was really seemed to be a high priority\nOf NATO founders yeah to make sure that people weren't accused of crimes and punishment for them with no evidence or and or no way to give someone due process due process seemingly important to the founding of this country seemingly\nBut it's no longer important because how good just the accusations enough to I guess ruin your finding Kobe Bryant went on to have a really good career and he I don't know just a few years after he was accused maybe even the next year he signed a hundred and thirty six million dollar deal so his life was okay um\nHowever when it's affecting them now Fifteen Years later and it's already been worked out in whatever way or the Nineteen year old to group refused to testify against him\nAh they dropped the charges that used to mean okay he wasn't guilty but now it just means\nI'm your tainted for life if you've ever been accused of anything\nYeah I don't know I don't know if it's like this constant barrage we've had for the past few decades of CSI and law and order but every institutions that supposed to be investigators\nAll supposed to be able to solve crimes that the police can't solve\nTheir all supposed to know more information and yeah this happens in the NFL the time in the NBA it's like there's a crime committed and there's an accusation and they'll just released the player like well wait a minute don't they get a chance right I mean it's one thing I maybe if you have video or something that really proves that something went down just these accusations many times before trials\nWill be enough for them to just you know throw the player to the curb\nAnd over and it's like ... ... you know and and that is not the responsibility nor should it be of of an employer employer should not be investigating an alleged crime of an employee we have a legal system to do that and you really got in trouble by going down this road with the Catholic Church\nThe Catholic Church kept investigating their own or accusations of pedophilia instead of bringing it over to the police and saying hey there's some real situation going on here can you check it out they tried to handle it internally\nBut it's so bad they'd even Trevor Noah who's the ... I mean I I thought John Stewart was on funny this guy is on funny too about the one million to power but\nI'm Trevor Noah on Comedy Central the other night took on Hillary Clinton and you know to his credit actually said some some accurate things are about her and and whether or not she's the best person to be speaking out on sexual allegations here's what he said\nIn retrospect you think [noise]\nPhil should've resigned in a way the Monica Lewinsky is can have certainly not it wasn't an abuse of power now now there are people who look at the incidents in the nineties and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship within the power imbalance as to why in and out\nBut let me ask you this where's the investigation of the current income than ...\n[noise] I'm Sorry man look here's the thing that's not cool maybe it was different in the nineties\nBut today I think we're all understanding that this massive power imbalance between an intern and the presidents of the United states right I mean forget in trying to present with anyone as a power imbalance by President Obama texted me I have proper you up a [noise]\nLook here's the thing that's not cool maybe it was different in the nineties but today I think we're all understanding that there's a massive power imbalance between an intern and the presidents of the United states right I think we'll get into an apartment with anyone as a power imbalance President Obama texted me I have proper you up a [noise]\nI'd have to let him slash [noise] and then he'd be like I actually I just don't know if you're watching the game and I'll be like oh yeah I knew that I knew that of course I did yeah [noise]\nAnd also someone who was hitting refined to deflect that make this about Trump like you're not in a position to be throwing stones at someone Henry especially when you literally sitting in a glass house\nUm other than the power dynamic thing where he is saying there is is really amazing because nobody takes around like that on the left\nUm but I don't buy into the power dynamic that nobody can say ... or no to the president of the United states of course you could I mean don't you wouldn't you certainly tried to raise your children to grow up to the people that would say no different than the United states yes absolutely yeah you don't you don't let him do whatever he wants to because you're the he's the president and and this is a side thing may maybe longer conversation\nWith Monica Lewinsky is not a meat to victim she is not right ... ... she was a willing participant in an old fashioned affair is what she was\nAnd could have said no could have said no she absolutely should have said no he obviously should have said no and and from his perspective you know he's depressed the United states he is doing things that he should not be be doing but like it's totally different than Juanita Broderick or Paula Jones\nThat they always are totally different stories she was the way she was in love with the guy\nShe told a liberal trip she was in love with him\nLike she thought that they are actually we're going to be together and be married but this is not a situation in which she was like oh wow I'm I'm I'm scared for my career for example like that's the thing though that was a power imbalance well\nThere's an implication even if the person doesn't do it there's an implication that maybe they'll ruin your career if you don't hook up with a a which first of all is prosecuting a crime before it occurs like you get your just assuming the person's going to commit a crime and ruin your career over sexual stuff up but that's a whole different story that's not what happened here\nShe was she was a willing participant in an affair she was she was into it and she was also by the way in the one point is that is valid from Hillary there she was an adult we we should not be excusing all action by twenty three year old women\nRight or

in Pennsylvania I hate that you're on the Glenn Beck burger\nHey got how you're doing good uh I'm laughing when you were talking about kind of the her reading the stories and how we how to make\nFun of the reaction mhm believe it or not\nThat kind of stuff really impact I'm uh I'm forty two great my bird and birthday and I when I was an episode of the ... and ... it it's right\nSocialist cartoon and I'll never forget it because the opposite of what the village and rainy and declared himself like a murder and the other ... rebelled and there was a war among the murder because no one should the heat\nAnd that's the center of the allegation that he didn't do it he didn't force or to do after that he didn't do it and then they had that conversation she asked her to do this thing which is ... obviously icky right yeah but I mean again he asked her to do this thing she said no reminded him of his wife and child and so he said oh you're right I have I've I've issues I'm Sorry\nBut that is is that sexual assault what I mean the accusation there are no amateur washed and what she answered a diet and he did not pursue it after that it's unbelievably there's you know so ... he admitted to being a dirt bag writing and he admitted in such a\nGeneral way that people kind of uh making people he admitted to these things and he did admit to I I've done a lot of things wrong I've tried to figure out a way to make that make them right and I think that\nThat would I just described you is obviously wrong Garret Lakey so yeah it was a wrong thing for him to be doing how is it a crime is it a crime I think the answer to that clearly is no\nAnd and they and the idea that you know Lucy K because he's a famous a comedian\nCan affect other ... other comedians careers is theoretically possible but that is that enough for a crime and the fact that he wants to have he wants to hook up with someone who theoretically he could hurt their career if they say no but there's not evidence\nOf that he did this to anyone so it would even do it to anyone right I mean you know again just making a weird assumption there yeah and we just assumed the crime like this isn't sort of stuff that Minority Report was the folks who scares away from right you're not supposed to just as the other and people will commit crimes in the future\nSo down and listen to this this is the guy who runs the comedy cellar and the comedy cellar is famous New York comedy clubs like it's a tiny it's like a hundred people can watch comedy there and they're the if you go there you'll see a lineup of comedians every day\nAnd and but it's famous for people random people that are incredibly famous just stopping by you go in there to see some comedian you never heard of they're probably pretty good but you got like a one in three chance maybe Chris Rock walks and it doesn't set for Jerry Seinfeld comes in is that our Lucy gay woman and it doesn't sit well apparently this is the first place he went\nAs he's tried to do this he's found strength to several clubs around New York since and they let him on stage so the New York times or the exhaustive report about trying to talk to the club owner about why you let him on stage\nThis is a clip about how he's trying to determine the decision was some\nOther people were just upset that he should ever work again the one guy said he's a comedian and I'm like okay when do you think he could come work that he's like never mhm might never say never\nWell could you imagine any court of law handing down such a sentence and never work again he says I don't care never misses admittedly provocative question but I Wonder as the owner of a place what you would say particularly to a female customer who was somebody else on at but but you know I Know when Bill Clinton\nWas credibly obviously accuse in Juanita brought her I mean I think nobody will expect a warning before he shows up somewhere ... nobody\nLike why were they sharing Roman Polanski as they were the years why were they giving standing ovation with ... they were after accused of sexually abusing ... he did it\nBut behind all these people you're mentioning Roman Polanski the film director Bill Clinton the president Lewis became a comedian is someone who gives them a stage and in this case that you rub on had nobody cares\nThat Mike Tyson who rapes are convicted of raping somebody performs and looking only controls the venue you control yes but but it's not unusual to\nExpect some consistent wow and you see wildly inconsistent demand if it's so obvious that the guy who Nasser ... in front of women and explode and stuff and women should never work again\nYeah I I ... I mean that's amazing meet your rationale of\nOkay you but you let this guy on who did much less than they are and you shouldn't you shouldn't have let this comedian perform on your stage fright and the fact that nobody cares about these other people the same people right by the way\nWho want him to shut out Louis CK didn't care about Clinton didn't care about any of these\nOther circumstances but he's supposed to\nYeah and it you know I I Will say he he was really smart about this I mean he made some great points in this interview and and the New York times reporter was just constantly trying to stay well yeah but you did this thing and you allowed and tried to put it personally on him as to why he made the decision which is an interesting part of the story but I mean he made the point is well\nOf look what it's aligned\nWe don't allow him ... to work so what does that mean does he go on the governmental\nDoes or finding work at other jobs any work what if Louis the cake hired by Walmart would that be okay\nI I think it's it's a fascinating I ever support himself in life yeah again and the idea that this guy had not been punished for this English sanity yeah the Manhattan was making ten million dollars a\nYear and he's probably now making a movie making at a comedy cellar appearance fifty dollars maybe five hundred dollars I don't know nothing\nI wouldn't be surprised if he just walks in and does it because he wants to do it\nOr he has you know paid for this and in a large way\nUm and you know it it certainly affected his career in a big waste last movies he's lost jobs\nBut I mean we saw this with Charlottesville there was a guy who can again we're talking about a consensual act 'cause if I can yeah I can central time he actually did it yeah it was it was interesting you will and will there was one case in which as we discussed the woman to them no another case on the phone where we don't know what happened another case where he started doing\n\nEvery

twisted are are behind her back squeezed it bruised her jammed her upside a door people had to pull him off of her\nA just a little disagreement there over\nYou know the candidates and he was just expressing himself in a loving way um sounds like it yeah\nAnd then there's a the Minnesota Democratic Party has suspended a spokesman for calling for violence against Republicans or even is to GOP cat as candidates were assaulted\nIn suspected politically motivated attacks what were they wearing though what was the GOP wearing probably something that provoked and probably uh the attack me up\nA maybe a red hat yeah ah one of the staffers also called for bringing Republicans to the guillotine think Glenn talked about that this week I'm you know it's\nWhat do they do to deserve to be it's you

Need to say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so oh it's so weird it's\nSo weird because you know you should be able to love a violent group like that who is a you know rioting around the country that should be fined and say you love them he said I'm Glad that we have people in this country stand up to fascism and bigotry and are willing to confront\nHate face to face thank you and so that's a beautiful um and then\nYou know it spills over into people like uh like Ted Cruz he and his wife Heidi ... of course at the Washington DC

[noise] I mean that's a that's not bad yeah and if you went both ... [noise] now you're talking now you're talking life [laughter]\nI guess your life with five hundred and Thirteen million would not be that great but if you could add on a couple of million dollars [laughter]\nAnd I even started now you'd be right now you're some vacation value or oak hill and you're like\nYou know I'm gonna get thirty percent when I go out to a restaurant that's not always have that time when he gets like nine hundred yeah you know nine fifty and I'm speaking large\nIs it time to stop that the author of the waiters expecting tips is it time just to the restaurants pay the waiters a decent wage and then I don't have to worry about paying that tip unless they do an outstanding job because now they expect expect me to pay them a lot of their salary either\nThat or I or I had a very high level job as a a Chili's waiter ... a couple of years ... uh and uh the minimum wage at the time I Believe was four\nTwenty seven an hour and you got for what two and I got to twelve I remember getting thank you well move in our lives with my with my two out really well of course that wow reason is because you're getting tips and you're going well over the minimum wage right\nAnd like you said and you get of course I mean yeah you know it was not hard to get two dollars an hour in tips\nOr even for me and I was a crappy waiter or buy a twelve hour the check would come in after two weeks it'll be like sixty dollars\n[laughter] I didn't cash it it's not even worth it yeah it was almost something dumb ... it looked at my probably spend sixty bucks to get to the to the the ... yeah\nYeah that's ridiculous it is it's got a bad you know there is also a for you to I was thinking of you well as I was reading this new study\nThe burger chains are having failing grades with their antibiotic use in their ... oh I Know I Know I'm not sure one eighty five burger James reveal a very different pattern now there's a new study the chain reaction burger edition and if he thought it was going to be slanted ...\nKnow that are produced by Consumer Reports along with the center for food safety friends of the earth owed animal concerns trust that Chinese roast the end of the failure bounce\nOff by us public interest research group ... those are some of my favorite agents thank you for the earth and the ... the the the resource defense counsel those are two I mean you want to talk about all full environmental organizations\n[laughter] those are the top of the list but the use of antibiotics in the beef industry is\nA terrible scare people ... terrible right so there's ... there's only two\nRestaurants that uh you know fast food chains that got the essays are in their belief that they don't use any beef with antibiotics burger phi which I've never been\nTo never heard of that and shake shack oh really extreme right I Know she got him at all that yeah I'm On a guide hell let's check let's go to Chicago right now runs the U.S [laughter] leave right now you know it's just I just kind of put the microphone that [laughter]\nWhat kind of the studio and go to ... now good all the other\nFast food restaurants failed except for Wendy's who got to the minus because they have now committed to sourcing a small percentage of beef they've got to intervene millionaires who minimize\nDon't they don't limited by producers will minimize the amount of medically important antibiotics so once in a while you're going to get a burger with that doesn't have anybody and what is\nWhat is the antibiotic and the burger doing to us is it is making a link to claim their claim is that it's making us resistant reasons you had to change the way our core a left wing environmental groups are saying there's bad things in their\nRight or watch I that means absolutely nothing to me I'm guessing there's worse things than antibiotics in there you know like you know cow poop and that\nKind of mixed in based on ... because some of this stuff is not done\nReally well yeah and you can just report on la Croix water that came out I think it was this week you know yeah water sparkling like oh yeah I Would say it's fruit flavored but if not if you've ever had a drink of it like you would be like ... what is that oh I can sit on the line it's not an immense leave for like ... ... ... in my opinion not not a fan\nBut they tried to come out the same thing like oh well there's an ingredient\nHere that's included in this terrible thing and and you go through the course\nOf course at the end of the day there's absolutely nothing to the report because that is what you know medical journalism has come to it especially about food ... they just try to say like well this ingredient is included in some other thing that sounds scary\nUm of course you don't eat nearly enough to come close to any problematic area where you are constantly you know we can't miss some of us why\nThey shouldn't say that would just be in the room to point John [laughter] of us need to be concerned [laughter] if you're eating as much as nine horses would eat well okay I can be ... falls into that category so\nThat we get so scared about these things and and Ninety nine percent of it is nothing like it you go and you can have all the things that they say you could never catch you can have as long as you go crazy with them as long as you're not constantly eating them all the time you're going to be okay and honestly most of the stuff even if you are eating it\nAll the time you're ... you're probably going to be okay and then we have a pretty resilient creatures here I don't even tell this from a guy who's who's in the past drank round up yeah so you know\nCommercial my viewpoint but yet they had a [laughter] around here and there\nTo prove that that as well I didn't ... I ... on this planet I Am still alive other making headway\nWith the chicken a company with with the big companies that are using chickens because you've got a AAA for their own chick fillet number one they they use it you should is without\nDid you go to the Al Sharpton pronunciation of ... elected so except in the ... call it anything I I don't\nOh I didn't know you I I ... on the planet I'm Still alive directing headway\nWith the chicken a company with with the big companies that are using chicken because you've got the triple a pioneer and chick fillet number one they use\nIs without antibiotics that you're going to the Al Sharpton pronunciation of ... like ... elected to accept it\nBut I don't call it anything like that I'd certainly I'd really I Can't see it on the sign ... its AAA because they said that it was it about Romney went to a ... like two and a shareholder would ship a leg like\nThat that was the montage sharp and can't read the ... I Can't call everything else but that though oh sorry that's right that's the name okay but\nUh it's good that a ... you know subway and Taco Bell they're all trying to play along with their chicken you know they they using chickens with less antibiotics or zero antibiotic ... so we're good there but my favorite story as we talked a little bit about this on that show a week or so ago the gluten free\nUh dishes that are at restaurants now that everybody does so well there's everybody is has to be\nYou know yeah but everybody has renewed everybody was nobody on if you're a secretly ac\nOr whatever that is ... that's one thing to have the disease\nYou probably should know glue and look and there's there's very few people that are out there you\nOut there and I know that gray there's approximately\nOne percent of the U.S population with that disease I\nKnow why or mentally three percent of people avoid\n[laughter] there's a\nThere's a weird like a happens with a lot of these issues where like people are mad at you for accusing them of not\nHaving [laughter] that's a great thing you don't want my daughter because for a while she was on that ... oh yeah I'm like well you\nDon't have to learn [laughter] like having a hearing\nAll these people come out and they're using cabin on like how are you not believe them and they're fighting like what are you better if it was true what women weren't\nAdult like would it be great it was in killing at least\nConsider these things and not get defensive of doom right their dinner I like I Know I ... you must do believe that we're all going to die in ten years you might\nLike I'd rather I'd rather look at the facts and try to decipher it but I I I there is that passion people really hate it if you\nDo and the guardian or going to live [noise] [laughter] [laughter] good news is when you order the gluten free of\nThe restaurants are odds are it's not\n...\nAt least a third is that true or are they good studies and went to the restaurants and ... uh is not good that shows how ... how the nonsense that is right on I mean if it were real and people really having these allergies can be lawsuits ones yeah I mean they'd be breaking out you know they've had the if you were making it out\nYou really have it and you I mean you could not breathe and you know a serious thing for the ... yeah it's just that for whatever reason everyone wants to lump themselves and the new victims that it's like ...
