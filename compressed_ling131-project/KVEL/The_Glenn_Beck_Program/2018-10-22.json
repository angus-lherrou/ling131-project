course it's not\nThat it's not no no it's different that's different that's that's the people who are tweeting and saying oh oh so he deserved it I no no no no this is a horrible crime committed by a

making him out to be he's not some freedom loving guy\nHe's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nThe Muslim Brotherhood that he was pushing for was an Islamic state he wants an Islamic state in his own writing in the Washington Post\nSays yeah we have to have a an Islamic just rule\nIf you dismiss as Islamic rule under surreal law then you'll never have peace in the middle east well wait a minute\nI'm not against Islam I Am against Islamic rule sharia law tell me where it's working out so to me where is that working out where is it protecting human rights\nIs the kind of people that we are dealing with the crown prince you\nAnd I are not going to like this guy you didn't say oh\nLook what he's still he's he's making it easier for women to drive without their husband yeah okay yeah\nSure sure sure he's still a hobbyist\n\nLet's look at what both sides in this country have done\nWe're currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia we are involved in their war in Yemen did you even know that\nPresident Trump announced a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia last year it was President Obama that vetoed a bill to allow the families of nine eleven victims to sue the Saudi Government\nSo\nBoth sides everybody is in protecting these guys when the crown prince came here to America he met with Donald Trump\nOh my gosh but he also met with Oprah Winfrey bill and Hillary Clinton Chuck Schumer\nDwayne the rock Johnson for some unknown reason Brock Obama John Kerry condo Lisa rice George W. Bush Henry Kissinger Michael Bloomberg Thomas Friedman from the New York times\nBill Gates Madeleine Albright Rupert Murdoch Jeffrey Goldberg from the Atlantic Tim Cook eagle on most Peter teal Alan Garber from Harvard Bob Hi gr and Jeff Bass though so\nThey're all meeting with him there are all meeting let's not pretend we don't know who this guy is\nNow the guy who went missing he's a reporter for the Washington Post is he is he\nDoes he have a point of view that Washington happens to like about a a Saudi Arabia and that is the Muslim Brotherhood perspective\nSo you remember the Muslim Brotherhood founded in the Nineteen twenties in Egypt the only reason for being was to reject the west and establish global surreal law\nThey exported this organization all over the middle east anti Semitism towards a Jews their biggest and most effective tool and harnessing the Arab rage Muslim Brotherhood they're the ones who invented modern day\nIf tool at harnessing the Arab rage Muslim Brotherhood they're the ones who invented modern day jihadism they are the ones who inspired Osama bin Laden and the other founding members of al ... to\nDo any administration a member from the Obama administration\n\nYou cannot call them a largely secular organization when you read\nJust their motto Allah is our goal the profit our model the current our constitution jihad our plan and death for the sake of all of the law for the U.S of our wishes they're not primarily a secular organization the Muslim Brotherhood of calls jihad the industry of death\nAnd they mean that in a good way in their own words to a nation that protects the industry of death and which knows how to die noble e God gives proud life in this world okay that doesn't sound secular doesn't sound like somebody we should be in bed with what\nThe Muslim Brotherhood ran up against a problem and that was one of them the kingdom of of Saudi Arabia\nBecause it was backed by the west any of these kingdoms in the middle East that have been backed by the west Jordan will be next anybody who stands in their way\nThey had to destroy but these were democracies so how are we going to do it well the Muslim Brotherhood decided to switch tactics and weaponize democracy\nEnter the Arab Spring the Arab Spring\nPraised by everyone we told you their goal is a caliphate while it never materialized ...\nNo no not there it materialized from the chain of events with ISIS\nWhat you were talking about the Muslim Brotherhood right and what happened to the Muslim Brotherhood\nDid they just choose not to do a caliphate oh no no they were overthrown\nOh\nThe Muslim Brotherhood still wants their caliphate\nSo now you have two of our allies turkey Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis\nWhile hobbyists who are both ... chasing the same exact dream a Middle East and the world dominated by surreal law both of them Ewing using jihadism\nAs a as a means to their ...\n\nSo ... show or whatever you're calling him today\nNow when you look at him he\nIs he is a guy who is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood I Want to say this no one deserves\nThis kind of death this is not to excuse the Saudis they're bad guys\nBut so is turkey and so was he\nHere all it's a Saudi progressive fighting for democracy no\nNo no no\nHe was fighting for the Muslim Brotherhood\nIn the Nineteen eighties and nineties he was one of the king's main allies he edited several Saudi newspapers which he was basically Winston Smith in Orwell's Nineteen eighty four sitting in the Saudi version of the ministry of truth heading editing out all thought crime\nMakes sure that there was never anything hospitals said about what hobby is him or the king\nDuring this time he'd cozy up to Osama bin Laden he scored several interviews while al ... was fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan Saudi intelligence the employee to him to be the middleman between bin Laden and the Saudi royal family will in two thousand three he fell out of favor with the Saudi royals\nWhen he allowed to be published a an article critical to the ... hobby is\nMovement why did he do that ... because\nHe is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and they were at odds with the hobbyists\n\n... show he was cast aside\nAnd that's when the western media fell in love with him an active member of the Muslim Brotherhood not us to smear or conspiracy theory in his own words yes I joined the Muslim Brotherhood organization and I was not alone\nAnd quote his Muslim Brotherhood friends in clerics were all in prison in Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring he got out he came to the U.S\nHe established a political party while in exile called democracy for the Arab world now party\nThe liberals the progressives the press loved him because they heard the word democracy it's the Muslim Brotherhood plan to subvert democracy like turning it against itself\nHe wants wanted to establish sure Rio law in the region\nHe was also a wicked anti Semite who wrote quote outside the context of history and logic the Jews will have to die by force\n\nOh Israel's outside the context of history and logic so we're going to have to kill all of them\nThis is not a smear campaign when you hear somebody say that you make sure you ask them where are you doing your homework where are you getting that why is that a smear campaign to say that he was a\nMember of the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly was in his own words so why is that a smear campaign because I thought the Muslim Brotherhood was largely secular\n\nAsked people how much do you know about the caliphate how much do you know about the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood how much do you really know about what this man wrote\nThis man wrote that he ... it was a mistake\nTo think that you could have any kind of state in the middle east with out some form of Islam assists\n\nNow that's different remember then Islam and his ... believes you have to use sharia law\nThat the constant wow it sounds like the ... the Muslim Brotherhood that's our constitution that is our law sugary a law\nSo\nLet's just begin to tell each other the truth and here's the truth turkey is not a friend of ours turkey is in with the Muslim Brotherhood turkey would like to have a caliphate run by them Saudi Arabia not good people\nSaudi Arabia huge exporter of ... and has done it here in the United states has spent money building mosques that are very dangerous here in the ...\nThe building mosques that are very dangerous here in the United states true\nThey kill him could be probably seems like it\nI don't trust the Muslim Brotherhood in Turkey but I also don't trust those guys one of them killed him\nProbably Saudi Arabia did he deserve it no does he deserved to be called a freedom fighter\n[noise] only by either

each other and how to heal Ben Sasse a welcome to the program senator from Nebraska how are you sir\nI'm doing well Nebraska's got a winning streak going again so we're up\nIn the heartland um men I Want to talk to you and I I I Want to ask you the questions basically that everyone asks me because we are\nOn on some things in the same pocket a and I'm I just want to hear your response to this um ... you know some some line of questioning that usually comes my way\nWe have a situation to where people have felt they have tried to do the right thing\nThey have tried to do the Tea Party and they were accused of being racist and they were accused of being violent which they weren't meanwhile the press and politicians excuse people like ... and it's getting worse and worse\nNo we're not anti capitalist we're not anti American and then Hillary Clinton says one of the reason she lost was because she was for capitalism you have Cortez coming out and Bernie Sanders\nStating with a D as say that they are I danced capitalism you have and to taking over the streets you have Republicans being shot and the uh on the ball field the press is still ignoring all of this blaming everything on the right\nThen Kavanaugh they're willing to take over with the two ... piece of gang rapists and destroying people\nWhen is enough enough\n[noise] [noise] well so first of all the way we consume politics is a mess and lots of our political discussion itself is a mess\nBut I think it's really important to distinguish between two dimensions one dimension is a continuum from right to left and on those issues I'm as conservative as they come on on anybody score card on the second or third most conservative senator or in the United states at it um but the second dimension\nYeah pollen we spend most

wintertime there's a local civic leader who understands rural issues his Democratic opponent he's a resident of Park City who grew up on the east coast with a much different opinion on issues like management of our public lands\nLet's face it the interests of rural Utah are vastly different than those from the ... it just makes sense to keep our representation local before by Ronald winter

talking to a Ben Sasse [noise] and I have so many places I Would like to um go with you I'm In and talk to the senator about we're going to run out of time\nUh I Would like to invite you to do a um an hour and a half uninterrupted podcast with me sender when you have time um because I think your voice needs to be hurt and understood\nAnd parts of it challenged I'm sure but uh I I Would like to just pick up on this point so the number one driver of happiness is vocation your one guy that will understand this if that's true in the next ten years we're in deep trouble\n[noise] we're headed toward a really interesting time in human history it's both scary and fascinating so somebody some people's shorthand for this of the ... the economy I think the simpler way to think about it is just\nThe average duration of people's jobs or their relationship at a farm is going to get shorter than ever before in human history so let's go macro for a minute hunter gatherers throughout most of human history\nYou don't have any conception of what your job is you pursue that buffalo right and then ten thousand years ago people settled down and started planting and harvesting and we we enter farm on a on a regular cycle and from ten thousand years ago to a hundred and fifty years ago nobody had job choice if they just did with grandma and grandpa mom and dad and aunts and uncles had ever had done forever\nEternity past with the industrial revolution we get job specialization and it was really disruptive but when people took a job\nThey still kept it till death retire but not everybody graduated high school at the beginning of the industrial revolution by the end almost everybody does\nBut you still get one job at some time between Fifteen and twenty two years old and you keep it for all of your life I was born in the Nineteen seventies average duration at a farm for a primary breadwinner then it was still twenty six years now it's four years and getting shorter and it's got to get shorter forever more McKenzie a farm I used to work with\nBelieves that fifty percent of the American labor market by three years from now this is not Twenty years in the future\nThree years from now they take fifty percent of the labor market will be primarily freelancers meaning that most people will cobble together a bunch of different jobs not all of them are going to be ap enabled tech jobs like being a new driver with the right software that makes you more efficient than an old school Gabby but\nWhat's really going to happen is we're going to head toward a world where people are gonna get disrupted out of their jobs at age forty forty five and fifty and fifty five forever more\nWe've never ever done that in human history and so it means all of the ... of what's often called now the quarter life crisis\nThe sort of late adolescence crisis of trying to figure out your your role of life and how do you go from just being a consumer and mom and dad's house to be in a producer that can not just put bread on the table for your kids but can actually have a sense of meaning that you're serving your neighbor that disruption that most people do in late adolescence working experience that again every three to five years for our whole life\nAnd that means there's a lot of new potential for upheaval and frankly for unhappiness there's going to be more economic output\nThan it's ever been produced before in human history but it's not at all clear that it will redound to the median family and the median household and the media and worker or going to have to become a civilization of lifelong workers\nAble to get retrained when you're forty nobody's ever done that before\nOkay so there's about an hour of questions or just on on that one uh but I've got about three minutes left can you give me a is your take on\nThe first real political upheaval that we're going to see that I think by twenty twenty you could change everything could start global wars the fakes\nYeah so one of the reasons I wrote them is because I spend a lot of time on intelligence issues and I'm In the intel community there are people who talk about the perfect storm of deep fakes that we have gone back and the storm is these three ingredients number one\nNew technology makes it possible to sort of narrow cast a world with fake audio and fake video where lots of people can be susceptible to being sort of\nUm a spoof or persuaded the things that are real are real there's always been enemies doing malicious actor information warfare since the beginning of ...\nRight I mean I you know if we're not\nWell we know what this which we know a Republican you can keep it right and if we if we don't choose to keep the republic well then of course it's going to fall apart we knew this was an experiment and that was the risk of it\nAnd I think we are seeing some some of those risks pop their heads up but I mean the whole foundation of this country is to let people\nCome out and make their arguments and we have to make ours back that does not mean I'm a ... thing and I was so encouraged I Hope you are too so encouraged by the ... a reaction from conservatives\nShe Nancy Pelosi shouted down a and I did not see a peep\nOf support from conservatives over the actions of the people protesting hunting I didn't see I was disgusted by I was disgusted by it as well and I didn't\nSee any I didn't now I'm not saying\nThere were none I'm sure people will show me a tweet if some new job it was like I think they should harass Nancy Pelosi at dinner but I didn't see one prominent Republican or conservative support those actions not one you could see if we can we played dozens\nOf Democrat and you know here's here's here's one from Sean King\nI've said it before but I Need to say it again I'm grateful for ... it's weird that it's politically incorrect for me to say so but I'm Glad we have people in this country who stand up to fascist and a bigotry and are willing to confront eight face to face right and you can there's nothing on the left their\nBaby prominent politicians yeah I I have not seen one prominent conservative support what happened to policy and that's right and I'm Glad they mean that that shows that there's still you know even though we're divided and even though a lot of things come down to the minute you know emotional politics like a minute to minute I'm Glad to see that there's still principles there\nSo here's where I think than was wrong when he said to deal with an so far\nUm he was right when he said you know it's a small group so small groom\nShe's right it is a very small group and they become very very loud because of social media and because of the media but it is a small group where I think he's wrong is ignore it\nIt's a part of the solution is ignoring yeah and I think you know because you can't get to the point where like I Would say the same would apply to the ... right right you know the Charlottesville situation um you know\nThere's obviously a crime committed there that um you can't ignore right um but generally speaking when well bunch of Nazis or KKK members that's been happening for every person go back for a broken bunch of KKK members walk through your town like ... you know largely speaking it's great to ignore them because they want attention and they run\nThey but that's not what we have now we have NASA FAA breaking laws you can't ignore them now can you know you can't ignore them I don't care if it's the Nazis or ... you can't ignore\nAnd I don't think that's what argued nor the right I mean like I think he's saying that we get a little bit too wrapped up in the back and forth of viral videos and people who are not even really engaged in politics\n[noise] getting freaked out over things that they're never going to have to necessarily deal with if you just missed a group like as if though that's how they grow\nA and a ... at least arguably that's how they grow their own oppose you're seeing it happen in Portland right in the mayor is largely just ignoring what they're doing and it's getting worse and worse and worse and worse that does not mean our lives have to be ruled by anti though and I think that the generalize argument he was going for\nWell the the the key here is what do you do about it and\nThe solution is to not to do what people did in Florida with Nancy Pelosi\nYou don't do that\nBecause that doesn't give you a side to run to yeah you don't do what the Proud Boys are doing I'm Sorry but it's so I just when you talk to Gavin about that yeah and I think Gavin is even you know looking at things going\nAgain you know look we were we were doing things because you know it's funny a media yeah he's a comedian um but you know this\nThis will grow out of control you just don't do that because there's nowhere to go when you're watching that you're like well I don't like Well Nancy Pelosi is doing but I don't like what they're doing\nSo who do I go to and look at look how the press is treating Donald Trump because the press treated Kavanaugh\nEverybody kind of hard and their physicians didn't they\nEverybody just hardened their positions and got more outraged\nThe only the only thing that might have happened is independence looked at that and ...\nIndependence looked at that and said you know what I don't want to be with those people left the left and and I don't want to be with the I don't want to be with the left and then look over to the Republicans they weren't misbehaving during that\nBut\nWhat are we doing to welcome people in if your kind of saying I don't want to be with those guys and then you see [noise] you know you ... get out get out there pounding on ... and like okay I Know\nWe can't we can't get to a place to where people disengage because if they do completely disengaged then it's just run the country is run by radicals\nWe need to be a safe haven we need to be a place of real thought real actual timed this um and real principals\nAnd we have to present a rational logical alternative I mean that that is one of the reasons I'm a conservative right right I saw the left you know early in my life as a group of people who made decisions emotionally yeah and that's not something I Want to\nBe part of snow and we can't be a part of that we can't do that ourselves let me go to Andrew in Florida hello Andrew you're on the Glenn Beck program\nGoing good morning first time caller longtime listener I out during the day very good oh right yeah and you know what I wanted to let you know I mean I'm here from Florida I'm In an independent uh most of my adult life and I'm\nExactly what you guys just said if a tree all on both sides it's so ridiculous I think a lot of the independent just stay out of it because it's\nSo immature and it makes everyone on both sides but fat because they just can't talk to each other mhm anymore it's\nJust far God now that being said every one that I Know that's an independent in the state of four will be showing up for the conservatives\nNovember really and I and why are you\nA simple reason it got people in the office it off just right now out there that are fighting for lower taxes I might I'm bringing home over three thousand more dollars this year than I did last year which is a huge\nDeal for me I've got two little girls and I've got one more I got my first uncommon in a\n[laughter] uh yeah I mean yeah\n... ... there's there's things like that are going on and on and I'm a conservative Christian show when you're when you're talking about\nWhat these people represent and how they forced themselves into a restaurant it can hurt people when they're eating with their family or most depend and then think exactly the way I just so disgusted with some of the rhetoric on both sides\nWe just ignore it and we always been independent thinkers or we're going to stay that way we also know what's wrong is wrong and what's right is right as far as extra concern I think a lotta people underestimate that\nWell Andrew I'm you if what you say is true ah than people are um then the Republicans will keep the house most likely\nA because it is so close at levels we've never seen of interest in participation in the mid term election ever a and it's it's within the margin of error between the two that if the\nIndependents come out and they are that they could be the ones that make all the difference on which direction we go next so much Andrew [noise]\nSo fills your mind is our sponsor and I and I brought this in a last week because do and

ago over the phone and uh\nI I was fascinated by you because you ... you think completely out of the box yes you're not thinking like a politician which is exactly what I think what we need a hundred percent\nYou are not being heard because for instance tomorrow they're having a debate and ... and you're not invited that's correct right they don't like me I don't know [laughter] it over the lifetime of my gun right so um so how does somebody like you get elected\nLook it's it's just that Bush meant to be with establishment right the the established the establishment media stays with the establishment candidates right so that's what winds up happening when it comes to debate they stopped they do that so\nLook if you mentioned the idea that I have a copy of court as right literally she's going to be my Congress person she's she's my district yes in Queens absolutely and I said this is a good thing and this is a good thing because it shows one thing it shows this is an anti establishment world right now\nShe didn't win because she was amazing and smart and knew everything she wouldn't because she said I'm not the establishment and people ran to her\nThat's one of the reasons why Trump one that's one of the reasons why even Obama ones I was an eight I mean anti establishment is a thing that people tend to like now the advantage I have is I met his abolition\nHere saying how am I going to win if I Can't get the mainstream media by doing what I'm doing now doing ... doing Facebook look Trump one of the reasons why Trump won was Twitter right that wasn't the reason but it was one of the reasons he use that tool and they didn't see him coming\nI use the same tools right I use Twitter I use Facebook I use podcast I use the same tools they don't like it makes them angry\nBut it's where I'm using they didn't see them coming they didn't see a clear cut me either and then we'll see me coming out\nHowever with court has um she was she's been a real embrace by the establishment on the left the Democrats have become democratic socialist which is just because you can put\nThe word Democrat ... democratic in front of it doesn't mean that it's a ... a really wonderful thing\nYeah but that's the thing you need to notice now here even though of course has one Nixon didn't and Nixon actually calls herself a socialist what happened one state that oh this protest person to a different person great let's vote for then they heard what you had to say\nAnd you found a lot of New Yorkers went you know what maybe this isn't right and people who voted for Cortez shifted and voted for our current governor\nHis magic sticking Andrew Cuomo the second ... so they voted for him again so they went back to establishment after her so I think that there was

seen the longtime um if probably ever we have over seven or eight directors campaign manager about thirty five to fifty people who are actively working every day on every aspect\nOf the campaign to include things like a scheduling setting up a van ... ethics and our calendar or making sure people show social media we have a a team on Twitter or team on Instagram a team on Facebook where we have a team when everything's Youtube video production\nAnd you don't have but you you're lacking money you're up against people who have tens of millions\nOf tens of millions of dollars absolutely we raised almost half a million but to be to be clear\nIn these last couple of weeks if we raise another fifty thousand dollars a hundred thousand dollars this becomes winnable I Know it sounds crazy but it is and the reason is name recognition is my only issue the last poll we put out I was at about one third name recognition and with that I pulled that Thirteen\nPercent so you can do the math on that one three times to get to a hundred percent it goes thirty nine percent right through time Thirteen or ... percent this is a five way rate thirty percent when this thing so I'm nine points above victory assuming I get a hundred percent there is the hard\nPart right the math equation can I get to a hundred percent and sadly that's not my message I've got that down the media can I get my name out to enough people do I crossed over that Barry what's kept me oh that\nThat it was I Can't believe that there's I mean it's like libertarians don't want to when\nYou look at it as ... as well get to get remember at at third party in general that's just the\nBut every single aspect he fails I'm a businessman if I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years and I should be fired mhm that's what he's done we've lost over a million since he's attended thrown over a million ... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand\nIf I lost a hundred thousand customers every single year for eight years I should be fired mhm that's what he's done we've lost over a million since he's attended thrown over a million\n... problem leaving leaving New York state over a million over a hundred thousand every year for eight years the total was over a million\nLook they're voting with their feet when it's just it's so bad it is so bad that Rick Scott the governor of Florida was teasing and said thank you Cuomo\nBecause older retirees we have are going to Florida and they have pensions that New York state residents are paying for still and these pensions now aren't being spent the New York state they being spent in Florida we're lily we're literally writing checks to Florida every single month\nHorrible that's how bad it is yes so let's take pension stone true pensions are ... it's a ticking time bomb yes there's\nNo way to pay for it yeah you've you're going to break all of the promises to people who work their whole life and were promised ally yep what do you do\nYou see here in Texas would you please for oh yeah you see it right here in Dallas Dallas you said already I already happening and they have all the time you're in New York state we are the most unionized state in the entire nation ... cell pensions are critical right now pending or about Fifteen sixteen percent of our budget and a budget is a hundred and Seventy billion dollars it's\nDouble Florida in Florida has more people than us wow yes for about eighty five billion and they have more people than us and we have a hundred and Seventy billion dollar budget how about just massive\nAnd it's getting bigger the budget getting bigger and so are the percentages of the other pensions but on top of that a New York state has about a three hundred million dollar debt and about a fortified deficit\nSo it's a bad bad bad anyway you add that people I was telling me about Lowry the pension fund is good they write the fund itself is relatively well some of the upstate up into doing very well some of the city wants or disaster but overall certain well they don't realize it's being also funded\nBy our tax base our budget that keeps putting money into it the problem is and the fun right now that's great the problem is the actual budget\nAt one point it gets so big that we simply can't pay me more as you're seeing in Dallas\nAnd my response that goes on his about Larry's in the constitution yeah I I get that asked Detroit\nRight asking Puerto Rico right Aspen is Waylon ... it was all legal for them to one there's no money it doesn't get funded when it doesn't get funded that eventually will collapse if that collapses if our pension fund collapsed near state we become Somalia overnight\nI don't want to become a Somali overnight I'm going to stop that I'm the only guy talking about negotiating our pensions into the right which is some type of four one K. for three be something like that and I'm going to go with every single union that will take forever I Know that's why I say it's a four year plan\nIt's a four year plan to make as to what New York state is paying either a flat fee and or a flat percentage that sustainable because
