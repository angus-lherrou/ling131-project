today\nThan it was two years ago when you the American people elected Trump by every measure yes\nAnd look at the trade deal that no one's going to spend any time talking about today are at all which oh the president who's going to start trade wars were the rest of the world actually got a better deal for American manufacturers you know those jobs that are never coming back\nThat we now have a thirty year high of those jobs coming back\nCNBC Trump North American trade deal is a new dawn for the U.S auto industry this is great for American farmers is great for American manufacturers it's great for our auto industry you know a lot of my conservative friends they don't say the same thing I don't like his position on trade and I'm telling you I said to them all\nYou don't know I'm like I Do everything in Donald Trump's life as a negotiation\nIf you don't say to Canada and Mexico that you're pulling out\nIf you don't take a strong stand to make them believe it you know they walked prime minister Trudeau to the final our last night grabbing concessions so that America got a much better deal than we had with NAFTA and the St nobody thought it would happen\nWith the new president of Mexico and nobody thought that we can get NATO to step up and pay more considering we paid over Seventy cents of every dollar for defending NATO or the NATO alliance and nobody thought that our Western European allies that we're talking and complaining and having an hauling that\nDonald Trump wants better trade deals with our partners\nNobody thought that can happen if you don't say you're going to start at the start of a trade war if you don't say it and act\nLike you mean that you're not going to get concessions and the fact is no American president prior to him even dared broach the subject and meanwhile we see manufacturing jobs leaving states like Michigan Ohio Wisconsin Pennsylvania\nAnd for all the talk and hatred of Donald Trump style the fact that he breaks a lot of dishes to get things done and he says a lot of things to negotiate\nAre we better off than we were two years ago are Hispanic Americans better off African Americans women in the workforce better off\nYouth unemployment fourteen states unemployment low unemployment records his old records\nConsumer confidence Wall Street fight every objective discernible measure with doing better end result shouldn't matter but in thirty six days Democrats are hoping that they've created enough smoke and enough mirrors what did they do in eight years when Obama was president\nTheir policies failed on a spectacular level and oh by the time I get back into it\nLet me tell you it was never going to be limited in scope this investigation ever it was never gonna be you know just a week this oh no that's not what they want and when the FBI comes back\nAnd all they do is real from what under penalty of of a felony the four people and the professor Ford case it said either they don't remember or it didn't happen like the case of the one I witnessed she said was in the room when the alleged incident happened\nThey're not going to be happy and they're going to try and stretch out even further and ask for more investigations they're going to find one little nugget that says because the FBI doesn't get recommendations the ... the FBI is is not gonna give they're just going to give okay this is what they\nSaid because they don't have any authority in this particular case you know and now we've got to look in all three claims even the ... you know you wouldn't believe thirty six years ago routinely on weekends the boys were drug in girls and and then lining up in the halls waiting\n... you know raped gang rape these young women because that's what the woman said\nThat's what they want to investigate now\nUm it is seemingly having an impact according to the Remington research group forty eight percent in Missouri likely voters planning to vote for the Republican candidate Josh Hawley forty six percent said they plan to vote for McCaskill but\nThen the question of McCaskill's opposition to Kavanaugh whether it's impacting their vote forty nine percent said it made them less likely to vote for McCaskill I think Democrats are going to be watching those kind of numbers very closely look their hope is is\nThey they hope they've created enough smoke and fire over Russia\nStill no evidence whatsoever\nThey hope that they create enough smoke and fire here\nThat they can make this all about election day and then you'll forget\nHow awful it was under Obama and that you won't get up and he voted for Trump most people don't go out and midterms mid term elections are about those people that show up motivating your base to get out there if you want\nNancy Pelosi as speaker and Chuck Schumer as your majority leader you all get the government you deserve if you if you wanna tune in on election night in thirty six days five weeks from tomorrow\nThen the Senate a professor Ford and she did a very strong analysis of the case you said in the legal context here is my bottom line and he said she said case\nIs incredibly difficult to prove but this cases even weaker than that she said Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event and those witnesses either a few did her allegations or failed to corroborate up for the reasons disgust below I Do not think a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case\nBased on the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that the evidence is sufficient dissatisfied a preponderance of evidence standard even and you know I that's a pretty powerful statement now we have what else do we have here so\nWe got some other blue state numbers that are really interesting to watch um there's a lot of reasons why in New Jersey this was surprising to me\nDemocratic Sen Robert Menendez is having a tough time getting re elected this is not a state anybody's been paying a lot of attention to 'em it didn't help him this weekend when he used professor Ford's allegations to bash Brett Kavanaugh and he tweeted out Sunday\nOr Saturday the details of professor Ford's testimony or heart wrenching to hear I Hope every single senator not only watches but listens\nAnd two days later the political had a headline shock poll shows a dead heat and Menendez Senate race in New\nJersey and by the way you know think Christie
