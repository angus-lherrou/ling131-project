doing it again they're not shooting from behind so you don't see the crowd and Obama is out\nAnd he's in you know these these rooms that are like four hundred people maybe\n... maybe tops two thousand and they're shooting it so it looks like a big crowd but it's not they did that in the midterms because he's crowds went away here we are at the midterms and Donald Trump still has these gigantic

how the rallying point blank and then I came in when it's not uncommon for helping make America great again\nI Can't believe we have to have those\nAnnouncements are but we we did\nUm and the crowd was more than enthusiastic if I was a Robert Francis a O'Brian or what's his name\nOr ... or running against Ted Cruz I Would be a little concerned um because it was an overwhelming response from Texas where Texans\nI thought were a little um\nI don't know calm about this election and it didn't really realize how much money Soros and others have poured in to make this a blue wave here in Texas more than any other Senate candidate for any quarter and history thirty million dollars for Beto just for him that's not all that and\nThat's not including the Soros money that is going into the state in the outside a pack of money and tons of that um so uh we're going to talk to the Governor Greg Abbott we're going to talk to them a little bit about the care of and and also about what's happening\nHere in our state he's also running for reelection but his he's so far ahead of any content or he is really the greatest\nGovernor I have ever I've ever lived under I mean I've never had a governor of a state that I've been more proud of a than a Greg Abbott um\nAnd obviously a lot of Texans feel the same way because it's a it's a run away campaign for him but the state of the state and the election when we come back then Governor Greg Abbott American Dream\nUh the you know unbeknown to most people is Soros has dumped millions of dollars into this state for a long term plan of of turning us into California\nWhere you're writing in so many of your listeners need to understand that lead as George Soros has been involved in Texas elections for the past couple of cycles are two years ago he gave a half a million dollars\nNot directly to candidates in Harris County down in Houston but this year we paid a million dollars directly to candidates in San Antonio on top of that ... has funded these ground games to get out the vote\nAnd so he is trying to turn Texas a into\nCalifornia and that's on top of all this money pouring in from California for killing us like that so uh but let's go back to the first part of your questions and listeners think about this all the large cities where the population basis or the state of Texas or really\nBlew cities in blue counties yet that Dallas year after year and we have started turning do you have all that and you have to El Paso and so you have these massive blue regions across the state of Texas that makes it\nSo much harder for people who are conservative people\nAre who are Republican to be able to cobble together the votes that are needed to make sure that we keep Texas the fashion of rate them back to the liberty or in the fashion of conservatism and so\nUh every vote counts in and we really need to get people excited enthusiastic about this the same way they were ah it last night where we were from Texas I'm I'm tell you what people are fired up and they are ready but we need people to go vote\nTell me a little bit about the caravan is there do\nWe have any idea other than the you know political leanings of this group or when it was\nBack in Honduras do we have any idea just the logistics who is behind this and what we're prepared to do\nSir I've had the opportunity to speak with both the secretary of homeland security as well as the president about this\nAnd I I can tell you what I can tell you publicly that and that is or if you think these are people who are leaving Honduras Guatemala or wherever that coming from a just trying to escape violence and income seek asylum or that is incorrect\nOr this is very well organized it's funded has a there are there are others who are behind it and very importantly a end this caravan are not just people from Honduras Guatemala a we know that some of the leaders of it are are involved in their midst Thirteen we don't we know that some of the people in it are from\nCountries across the entire glow a there are what we use in the lingo ... which are a special interest ATMs or who opposed a a very real dangerous threat or to the security of the United states of America where in bed at these caravans\nRight on the Univision just reported this morning that there were people with terrorists ties ah from Malaysia involved in Internet it in this\nIn in a hurry the same thing with with regard to a terrorist coming from countries other than Malaysia and and think about this if these people really were trying to escape by horrific life and whatever country they're\nComing from why is it that they are marching with the flag of the country that they're coming from mhm you know that they\nThey are not coming to the United states of America to make the United states of America a better place they're not coming to the United states to ... a ... style him from the dangers they have in fact ... there were multiple reports on TV last night in economic would have shown that\nOf the interviews are these people in the caravan and they were talking about what was their strategy or when they get us and they said it's very simple when those are numbers for overwhelm United States' ability or to uh go through the salad process for all these people so they they have been taught him know already\nThat their strategy is to basically rushed the game so much that the U.S loses consult let me tell you something that we lose control of our border they released lose control of our sovereignty\nWe're no longer a sovereign nation and we must step up and use every tool that we can to make sure that we put an end to this care and because I understand this clean also when that is this maybe two or three or five thousand\nPeople but they make it in right behind them and the caravan of twenty thousand people behind that will be a caravan of fifty thousand people and the United states of America as we know it will be forever altered who don't who simply to stop this\nYou know the press is going to treat us like the Israelis and the caravan like the Palestinians um is the president leaning on the president of Mexico and threatening to cut off all I mean if\nI mean I think this is the time to really lean hard and say this is not our problem turn them around or we'll cut off all aid with with Mexico is there a chance of this or\nWhether the president has been outspoken about cutting off aid to Honduras and brought them out right now that the the United States is working collaboratively in in in this might be hard to believe so I Want to emphasize that ah the u._s. is working collaboratively with Mexico\nMexico has made a decision that they have not made over the past Mexico is working with the United nations or to try to work on\nA temporary settlement of these care band members in Mexico\nEl Paso Mexican Mexico's is is actually playing a ... a very beneficial role in this whole process with us right now and we applaud Mexico for what they're doing or at least as of this moment in time\nOr they headed towards Texas no no invasion plans of the United states with the former Soviet Union every included Texas because they knew Texans would not take kindly to the invasion force or they had in ... California\nI Will tell you what are what was reported publicly last night and I will not disputed and and that is a early on before yesterday on there was great concern that they were headed for Texas\nAnd it was reported last night that they are headed toward California now that makes sense because as you know a California is a ... state yeah and and they ... they would welcome this caravan and Tim or caravans like it\nAnd and and these care band member to end the leaders of this caravan they understand one thing and that is a if they try to reach the gates and Texas or we're not going to tolerate it and we're going to be very uh you know protective of our sovereignty here\nAnd so I I Can't tell you for certain to right now where they're going or I can tell you what was said and what makes sense and that is they may be headed to California\nLast question that one\nIs doing the same as you know what was there in the United states there in the United states' rights and once they're here they they can migrate anywhere\nRight um the your campaign is going really well you're a great governor and um and I don't think your election is a is a going to be um a in jeopardy at all\nHow is how is a Ted Cruz how how is Ken Paxton how is Dan Patrick\nWell listen all these all these races are closer than what people realize\nAnd it is because uh we we need to understand\nRadio on news talk one oh four point five K V E L World Series is sending nights game number one Clinton curse are well beyond amount for the Dodgers ... will go for the red Sox are a couple of a left\nHanded pitcher is in that match up her Sean Floyd is breaking balls master fully one winning game five in closing out game seven of the al ... cells been battling\nInjury should be good to do at home meanwhile some areas Thomas responded to trade rumors yesterday that the Broncos are listening to a handful of teams who reached out to Denver about himself\nSaddam Hussein yesterday quote it's football man is a business that's what happened it happened before and the leak I never thought of what happened to me but now it has Utah Jazz looser the grizzlies yesterday Ninety two to\nFour I met ... with the sports flash presented by Ellen al motor on news talk of four point five K V E L [noise] one of the whole point five and\nAnd you might want to do is talk of\nRoosevelt sushi where the basin comes to talk news stars now\nIs is our town halls on average Thomas [noise] as he campaigns around the country\nFor Republican candidates for President Trump's approval rating moving higher the head of the midterm elections\nThe latest Wall Street journal NBC News poll shows forty seven percent of Americans surveyed approve of the president's job performance that's up three points from September ended up his best showing in this particular poll during his time in office\nThe poll also found that Democrats are the party most preferred to lead Congress and voter interest in the mid term elections has hit record levels within both political parties rank lodged in Washington\nAnd wants to the dust settles from the mid term elections president says he'd like to see Congress approve another round of tax relief or the middle class\nCIA director Gina Haspel in Turkey now reviewing the ... to show you a case of Saudi columnist killed at the Saudi ... or ... president or the ... parliament they could show he was brutally murdered in those responsible must be held to account\nThe information and the evidence\nThat we have so far collected [noise] indicate that ... was slain in a vicious violent emerges whitewashing such firefighter team will of course in June and booms the conscience of old humanitarian\nOne speaking through a translator a man who believe say fatally shot University of Utah student outside and on campus dorm last evening has been found dead or leave a self inflicted gunshot wound University of Utah but at least with Janet Brian ball and says a victim of female students and the government work quite\nWe know there was a previous relationship and that's all I Know I don't have any more details about\nHe spoke with K.
