I think there are a lot of people like you who just don't want to call attention to themselves 'cause this is an insane group of people and they're showing a willingness to a salt and a timid data intact anybody and you're right to think that violence is just around the corner\nAnd who wants to bring that on so your point is that there are a lot of people like you who are going to vote but white Trump would want them to vote for him I ... for Republicans coming up in this election that nobody maybe counting\nYes um you know nobody that I find in a yard sale everybody I talked to is a hundred percent mad though Trump and now they talk about it and it's almost like you know we we are about it like ... or you have a ...\nOh yes it's out in the old in the old Soviet Union people would go to the bathrooms in their house to whisper to each other what they really fought because they were afraid that the state if the regime was listening to him\nAnd so you're basically this driving the thrive in the same thing the difference is that in in twenty six team there were Trump yard signs everywhere you went in states across this country they're not there now without Trump isn't on the ballot leaders\nSo you you might not be all that many Trump signs to be put in the yard but but your point is the outward support for Donald Trump\nIs is being suppressed by people to not call attention themselves right\nWhere you're concerned about violence to share it let it grabs soundbite number nine listen to this ... this is Rand Paul was on Fox and friends that I\nAnd a a mostly easily Earhart\nOr you have a big fear about this rhetoric your fear is that somebody is going to get killed\nSomeone almost did I was there at the ball field when Stevens police almost died from a very very angry violent man who is inside and really by rhetoric on the left and this hasn't been reported enough when he came onto the\nField with a semi automatic weapon firing probably close to two hundred shots at us shooting five people in almost ... he was yelling this is for health care he also had a list of conservative legislators Republicans in his pocket\nBut he was willing to kill so what happens when Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence there is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down and I think the other side needs to really calling the rhetoric down\nPretty much what you're saying you're afraid of violence being visited on you and here's Rand Paul fearing that an assassination is going to say the Democrats are not going to call their people back the Democrats are not going to ask them to calm down I think some Democrats themselves are afraid of these\nPeople but privately I think the Democrats are encouraging this privately I think the Democratic party wants America to think that\nThis in unhinged behavior is\nPretty natural pretty normal that it is representative of of a majority of American people like if Democrats want that perception out there they want the anger\nAnd the on his behavior justified on the basis that Trump is somewhat acceptable Trump is so bad so dangerous so sick so whatever\nThere's a lot of reasons they're not going to tamp down there's a lot of reasons they're not going to distance themselves from it and there's a lot of reasons why they're not going to ask these people\nTo back off a little it'd be more responsible they don't think it would help them\nThey think this kind of unhinged I'm Sorry for not having a better word but I don't know a better one\nHow many times can you call them insane or not right or\nMentally disease or what have you but regardless what you call them the Democrats think there's value in these people doing what they were doing in the Senate office building in front of people in elevators and basically frightening thing\nWhatever it takes what ever it takes to get done what they need to get done that don't don't think that they're going to get a dose\nSensibility or responsibility and ask for it to be dialed back and part of it I think is that some of the Democrats themselves are afraid of unleashing misbehavior on themselves\nWhen I was not going to be said Russia ...
