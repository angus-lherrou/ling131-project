C. today\n[noise] uh see what it is really the river [noise] then I just put it the bottom of the stack it's about somebody I very rarely comment on 'cause I don't care phoning folk conservative is named Jennifer Rubin\nA yogurt is Jennifer Rubin it's amazing transformation this woman has made the Washington Post hired her as a conservative blogger\nDuring the Obama years during the Obama years for the most part she came across as a conservative blogger then when Trump gets elected she became I think what she's always been just the died the cast in the wool liberal and now she has the the still the conservative\nColumnist or blogger at the post but she's not conservative and MSNBC reversed or that way but that's not the point\nI couldn't tell the story without mentioning her name\nShe says that GOP senators are behaving as if it's their time of the month\nNow\nThat to me he goes to the deeper than what it just sounds like you're on the surface\n\nImagine a conservative saying on MSNBC the female Democrats senators were being so emotional almost hysterical behaving as if it's their time in the months does anybody think that would fly\nThere is no way\nA male commentator anywhere could say that about women senators are women witnesses or any of us or for the here's Jennifer Ruben and by using this this this analogy\nThese Republican senators behaving is if it's their time of the month is that not acknowledging that there is such a thing as their time with among\nAnd if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election

known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that is the\nCapital circumstance in her mind the conservative populists coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms other words in her study of things\nJust continuing to vote for a Party Republicans do enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there don't know why\nI Would think it would be but she says it's not Kavanaugh however has provided the catalyst\nBecause of how Trump voters that person and specifically the conservative populace coalition perceive the way he has been treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nThat the Trump conservative populace coalition is tired and worn out\nThe way they edit things they believe in are treated by Democrats the media and Hollywood and her point is that\nThe targets of range have somewhat diminished until cabinet came along and re awaken these beep and fired the backup\n\nSo she says this is what I see in a nutshell what happened to Kavanaugh has served as a reminder Anna highlights to the people that voted for Trump why he's successful\nThat it's all about being strong it help remind voters why they supported him\nAnd the other Republican president would have walked away from the capital by now energy would have been lost but it's not energy as high now that's\nAgain that Salinas veto and her analysis of the electorate\nToday\nHeading into the two thousand sixteen or two thousand each in midterms now where I\nWill she knows what she's talking about I find it strange that people who I think that people voted for Trump by deeply involved with things\nNow maybe there are some exceptions and you have some people to vote for Trump to just set up with Republicans and Democrats and found Trump interesting but for the most part I Am of the opinion\nThat Trump voters did so for very very very specific reasons related to Trump's agenda which he\nHounded every day multiple times a day Donald Trump told everybody when he was going to do trade deals the wall immigration rebuild the military bring back the economy\nI Would think people have voted for Trump knew that that's what he's going to do and I would also think that people who voted for Trump would realize that he needs more than two years to do it\n\nBut is her insistent know that kinda stuff it evaporates and wanes\nYou know people's lives don't want the news changes but at this camp on a circus has re ignited the coalition that elected Trump\nAnd this is to the detriment of the Democrats or don't see this happening\n\nShe says the Senate could indeed see a red wave the house she's not so sure of\nIowa I found it interesting analysis and I I'm One of his share it with you she points out the Democrats
