I voted for Trump Madden Trump voter and them America First and most historic sense\nAnd I'm an American patriot so take that in contact with my question your ... how can the United states the allies with countries and you mentioned this in the first part of your monologue we're allies with a Saudi Arabia and Israel\nHow can we be allies with Saudi Arabia when the Pentagon papers released and twenty six team showed that they funded nine eleven\nAlso Israel has attacked us in the past like a used his liberty\nWith all of unfair can you clear that are forming\nWell on the Saudis side yeah the uh the the Israeli spy on us to everybody spies on everybody you know Jonathan Pollard\nIt was an Israeli spider got caught and the Israelis wanted it back on harmed we said screw you you know where your benefactor spy on us and I said yes we do and we're going to continue the spike us we can't trust anybody where Israel\nAnd a particular when Democrats are in the White House that's a factor now when it comes to the Saudis I Want to share with your question here is really good\nI remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned\nThat he was either all Nineteen or white Ninety percent eighty percent of the Nineteen hijackers were Saudi I remember I was talking to William F\nLuckily junior about number thing not just this and I brought that up and I remember him getting frustrated with me about it\nHe said what does it ever doing anything I ... I don't understand the Saudi Government supposedly is an ally and yet these hijackers come from Saudi Arabia are you saying the Saudi royal family is behind this\nI said how can we say that they're not\n\nThat is when I began to try to learn about the relationship to the Saudi of the Saudi royal family to Islam and that's what I started asking experts are at at\nOne of the people I talked to was Andy McCarthy again because he has tried\nAs a United States attorney assist the United states attorney southern district of Manhattan he was the lead prosecutor on the blind shake case and it was Andy who said that he thought the blind check was just acting out\nAnd being a radical inventor of various\nAspects of Islam as part of his technique to mobilize and create even more membership and his group and then he he started reading the things that the blind shake believes and he found\nOut none of this is made up this this this call for terrorism dealing with infidels it's right there in the car on if you read it right this\nIs exactly what what is in the book and he was stunned when he he told me was so\nWhen you then realized that the Saudi royal family is\nIn charge of world wide Islam because the holy sites or their mecca and Medina Medina I found that it is absolutely true that the Saudi royal family\n\nIs essentially the the shield and the impetus behind when white Islam well in Saudi Arabia\nThe branch of Islam that is I for just to make it easier here and being understood terrorist Islamic comes from ... her nose you heard me say this yesterday beg your indulgence\n... hobby Islam is where they really radical clerics and the moms are who are welcoming\nAnybody they can into their in their mosques and just literally converting them into\nSuicide bombers terrorists than what have you under the auspices of Islam and the Saudi royal family stood by and let it all happened whether they were instrumental in advocating it don't know but Saudi funded charities all over the world promoted\nWhile hobby is and that's what I went back to Mr Buckley aside I don't I don't see how the Saudi royal family the Saudi Government can be separated from these Nineteen hijackers\nWell that's why it's interesting to tell the story of the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont Mohammed bin ... wants to if we didn't believe him\nHe wants to reform the Saudi Arabian peninsula the whole country and its relationship to Islam\nAll because of money economics primarily he doesn't like the fact that Saudi Arabia is solely dependent on the sale of oil for all of its wealth\nHe wants to branch out he wants other people investing other industries individuals investing in Saudi Arabia for things unrelated dollars in federal dollars oil\nSo he sought out the interest in Hollywood Silicon Valley than the typical places in other countries as well\nAnd part and parcel of his reform is the\nI don't know what word abandonment orange me a distance thing for more ...\n\nAccording to have been some on Saudi Arabia cannot modernize and cannot achieve his reform goals if ... is still\n\nThe branch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family\nWell\nThis brings us to show me again and the Muslim Brotherhood they don't want any of these reforms they don't want any western influences\nIn any Islamic country much less\nSaudi Arabia where mecca Medina they do not want ... watered down they do not\nThey want the Arab Spring they don't want secularism anywhere and Mohammed bin ... among represents a bit of that that's fascinating that he's been brought to a screeching halt on these reforms\nWithin Africa shaggy this has brought to a screeching and now\nTo a screeching halt on these reforms\nWith the ... this has brought to a screeching and now there's a story today that the royal family they they have a council you might I often wonder well who determines but these kings have countless sons they've got Fifteen different why they've got kids with every one of their wives\nSaw Saudi king could have twenty sons\nHow do you determine which one's the crown prince allergy determine which one's going to be as air it's not just first in line they have a council they have an inter family council a royal family council that\nDetermines the when the edge of the crown prince the heirs and in what order\nThen sell them on Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of the current king\nSolomon\nHe was chosen largely because of his reform ideas but now a story out today says the widow of his true or not the royal family is having a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad bin saw him on as ground friends\nKnow many people think that this is up to the king the king determines what your his sons is gonna be the next king but it's not the case so all of these plans for modernization if they were true I have to throw that I was a cavity up all these plans for reform\n\nHave been brought to a screeching halt by the

not\nAnd we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for it\nYet not serious money and certainly not serious construction there for\nHis theory was
