that\nWell I'm curious about something and I'm very flattered I'm I'm vibe to no end in mind flattered year that that you would want to be something super and accepted all having listen to this program why journalism\n[noise] ah well I like journalism and I want is a way maybe one day have my own organization for military families who have had servicemen um killed in action by journalism because\nI just I Want to get my voice out there and change 'cause I don't like the way I mean Trump is making America great you know I Believe that\nBut what about if someone gets in office after him and then I go in there Twenty years later it's maybe going to be a huge mess because of the way America's millennials are going like my sister and I just want to be one of those who gets up there and says\nI'm done with this I Want to change it\nGood for you um there are a lot of people a lot of parents who have kids your age and younger who are really scared about the future of the country has always been the case I my whole life I have heard people say\nThroughout my life but they don't want to have kids who would dare want to bring kids into this world that some I remember hearing that when I was Fifteen myself so it's nothing really\nReally knew that I'm sensing today when people say there is a people who have kids not so much do than are thinking about people who have kids were really really worried about their futures because of the way the west\nHas become more radical and more anti the general concepts of America it's scaring people what kinds of the country are the kids going to grow in June\nThere is a people who have kids not so much Dolgen are thinking about it people who have kids were really really worried about their futures because of the way the left\nHas become more radical and more anti\nThe general concept of America it's scaring people what kinds of the country or their kids\nGoing to grow into I mean there's always going to be an American but what's it going to be are they going to be free are they going to have to conform to some of this extreme wacko leftist them in order to not be hassled build up their lives they're sort of genuine fear about is if you want to tackle that\nMore power to you and journalism needs people like you limit\nWell and I don't think that's like what you're saying I don't want my kids are my younger sister to grow up in America where\nThere's just a bunch of people that don't even belong in this country hurting and citizens going around trying to do that stuff to you I don't want to grow up in a country where you can't even have a guide to protect yourself or to last for\nA country where veterans are ... behind legal I mean I just\nI that's the one that makes me so angry as they\nWhy do you think that's happening why do you think so much attention as being lavish on uh\nThe people you referred to as illegals coming here who are not citizens but yet\nBeing uh granted access to so many things and given so much why do you think it's happening\nA well there's a lot of reason for one thing Obama invade at all just come our way and you know um but I think just because they think they see what we're going to go there and nobody's going to stop us you know well maybe the military's gonna stop in this\nI don't know I understand why there a couple of why do you think there is so much a tolerance for it why do you think so many people are wanting them here and and and want to do nothing to stop them from from getting in why do you think there's so much tolerance for the illegal well aspect of this\nI don't well a lot of the people who are voting they don't know anything about why [noise] I don't know where is that why would they ah I don't know why the people are wanting to give away their money to them if I think that they're saying oh well poor people you know their country's war stricken\nWell you know America has to help their people to they can't just give away money to these illegals coming and they're like well that they may bring jobs here\nHow are they bringing jobs here when they're going to go work at I mean they're going to go work in agriculture agriculture or something 'cause I Know there's a lot of illegals that live in California and there's a lot around where I left but\nI don't know the answer is that they worked cheap number one for the people don't want the river cheap labor cheap labor is to answer the other side of it\nAre you you're talking about\nThe people that don't want to give the money the people who are behind these policies are damn wells making sure that you and others are going to give your money they're not going to be giving there\nBut the answer the answer the question is because the left wants\nPower and power to them is more and more people in capable of self reliance\nMore and more people in capable of helping themselves and the best most concentrated group of people that fit that bill are a bunch of poor you'll educated or uneducated people don't even speak the language flooding the southern border you get 'em in their human\nBeings we're a compassionate country they have to be fed they have to be taken care of the Democrats want the credit for doing all that\nThey want to get these people registered to vote as quickly as they can they looking at him purely and simply as voters it's not about compassion and it's not about giving them a good life it's not about any of the things that they want you to think it is it strictly about creating\nLet me put it this way rarely the Democratic party and do not doubt me on this when you when you do your research or journalism career you will find that this is the case the Democratic party needs a permanent underclass\nOf uneducated or poorly educated people who are not capable of economic sulfur lives because they can't speak the language\nBecause they don't have any education does our crime democratic voters\nThose are the exact kinds of people to Democrats want to build a majority around because they will be for ever grateful I eat dependence on Democrats and will constantly be voting for Democrats no matter what else happens that's\nThat's the reason behind it nobody will ever own up to it nobody will ever admit it\nBut what they are really is just on a documented Democrats it's not that they're undocumented citizens or aliens their undocumented Democrats that's their status right now and the objective is to get them documented to get them registered and to take care of them\nGive them health care make their track here make their trip you're worth it\nBy giving them exactly what they're coming for no some of them are going to be able to take care of themselves some are going to get here and I got to run rings around people some in any group of people that large are going to have a wide disparity in some of them are going to be quite confident\nBut those are going to be the self starters and those are not that people Democrats are interested in I just really hideous I guess I just I guess really hideous because Democrats what people need people who are\nIncapable of self reliance and that's not helping those people at all that is not compassionate Democrats want you to think that's all they are and they are none of it it's the exact about they're using these people and hoping that they never amount to much\nThey don't have much faith in them anyway but they are great voters great dependent voters and thereby eyes so\nThat's what this is about look I'm Glad you called rail your exceptionally well spoken your home schooling is working in your I Hope that you are the hope you do get into journalism is journalism needs the bulls that that are interested in the truth\nI also want to thank you for

watch Fox News but I always try to watch a network program every day just to like it legitimately compare the two\nSo on the ATC news reporting they quoted a study showing a rise in anti Semitism in this country now when they step is neither my wife or I can remember there ever recording this or even after the\nFerret on tour my comments I'm also during the report when addressing the issue of armed security for places like the synagogue\nMore than one person commented that if we start it this way and I couldn't help but think what a classic liberal response that we can't do anything that might make them because of their fears about what might happen on my own thoughts were about arms security for\nThe you know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more interesting they never worry about where is this\nGoing to end but if you were if you do things that give people more safety more control if you give people a greater feeling of security that liberals can't lay claim that all of a sudden my fear where is the leading to where it's absurd what are you worried that hadn't\nYet my thought is people are getting killed armed security if you think about that issue my thought is working we START I mean if it's true that anti Semitism is on the rise maybe synagogues or a great place\nHere we are two weeks before the midterm elections the Democrats\n[noise] half way and that\nThey've told everybody to the American people are tired Trump and they want to get rid of it and they realize their mistakes have been
