they wish they could get their vote back that became a noted that's been the narrative for two years that narrative is what led them to hyping this blue wave\nThat it was the only commonsense view and a half now that now that people have seen trumping action they've seen is bad manners they've seen whatever is about in the left taste now everybody's seen it now they regret it now they can't wait to

cycle\nWas all this down for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and it was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd\nThat's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys assuring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's gonna be curtains for Trump curtains or the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge\nAnd guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton the lead drum but\nFell sharply in the last two weeks of the campaign although the polls pick that up\nOr at least some of it it's a good reminder that even mid October surveys can miss late change this story written before the bombs\nCould it happen again you probably won't don't worry about it Bloomberg's but it corny corny corny maybe going either direction Democrats because no one bag or they could lose make it go in the ... what what is this decision all\nOf a sudden versus all of this on a logical certitude of just a month ago\n\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the ah the Swedes here it's really strange ah ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up as a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats the step up and be strong on border security we cannot\nOnce again be painted as a week and then lose there is a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here\nYou Democrats have got to stop\nPosing Trump just to oppose Trump's\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and paid for it is if that if that's true\nThen Venezuela also means Iran and the ...\nFolks that are a\nLot of people in our side them jumped St George Soros yeah maybe but if Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying as Venezuela if it's Venezuela it's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe had this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates in let those people in for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not one of the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore ... he is saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong border security this doesn't help\nUs a modest\nSeven thousand ten thousand people starving to gauge demanding to be let in\nThat doesn't help us whatever\nNot say all this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickled kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\n[noise] my point is [laughter] none of this is panning out the way it was planned no blue wave\nI ... don't misunderstand I don't know what's gonna I'm not saying that the Democrats may not win the house but\nI I don't think that going to I\nMy point is [laughter] none of this\nIs panning out the way it was planned no blue wave I ...\nDon't misunderstand I don't know what's gonna I'm not saying that the Democrats minute when the house but\nI I don't think they're going to [noise] I I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it because I never fall for left wing media conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary group think narrative of the moment whatever it is\nBut it's more than that there is nothing happening in America right now the argues electing Democrats\nNot in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in mass\nThere is no reason to vote Democrat even giving people reasons to vote for the ball they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump because Trump's what he's aboard each week sees a bad guy is whatever whatever is\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying Kevin on his family sending rice didn't look like rice and the Susan Collins all these monsters not for the Democrats are doing\nThat's the kind of thing you do to build a movement in a decent society and I still believe that we have one\nI Believe are decent society is under siege everyday are decent society standard good old normalcy is under assault every day led by pop culture leftist in Hollywood\nIn Silicon valley and the drive by media were under assault every day but they have not overturned that yet they have not gotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal\nThere's just nothing out there to me that would have people excited about voting for Democrats because the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republican\nUh I just I don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the charts or not in less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you flip this scenario what\nSense does it make for a conservative Republican the gum up the works here by sending a bunch of bombs that are not going
