way um you know she's admitted that she shows up at the state of the union speech is having a little more time to get through the night why she just didn't falling asleep at of course is nothing wrong with that uh I'm\nElena Kagan was there the Harvard law school dean way back when hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard you lay the Kagan who now says I don't think he should be on the court I I'm not sure that they're going to do the court any good\nA Justice Thomas was there a whole bunch of people Anthony Kennedy who is a cabinet replacing\nAnd here is the president of the United states and started hearing audio soundbite seven he is apologizing Kavanaugh ought be half of the nation\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who step forward just serve our country deserves a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nJust calling them out this Trump is right this is not done normally when you get to the ceremonial swearing in\nYou follow the script and all of that is not ... not to be referenced again by just over everybody acknowledges that the result is the result we're moving forward except that's not the way it is anymore the Democrats are not stopping fights not over to them\nThe Democrats are openly promising to impeach capital other openly promising to continue investigate cabin on\nThey are openly talking about packing the court if they win the house of representatives to nullify the or the power capital has asked the so called conservative justice on the court they're not pulling back at all this isn't anywhere over\nAnd so Trump is calling them out and I told you folks this is crucial we don't I I Can't think of any former president would ever do anything like this in defense of his nominee in defense of his principal I Can't think of one who would do it\nAnd it just as important the Trump do this and it was important when Trump at a\nRally explained to the American people what the American media had not told them when he resigned the essence of her testimony\nThat when the drive by that that he was mocking Dr balls e for he wasn't mocking he was simply and warming the American people what the media was holding from that she couldn't tell anybody where it happened she couldn't tell them when it happened she wasn't sure where about ...\nShe didn't know how she got home and she didn't know who took her and she didn't know what she said after the event that the only thing she remembered is that she had one beer that the poor people she said were there in the house all the night at the press and told nobody that\n\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required if you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do\nIf you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says buddies believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nThen that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nThe rest of it the history onyx that child's life wailing and immature the is the result of the liberals socialist mindset on people young people immature children that don't get their way already suffering psychological disorders of one way one kind or another\nVideo video of these kids\nOn Saturday afternoon literally calling up the doors of the Supreme Court they get in\nTo try to stop a real swearing in they were literally calling after doors\nThere wasn't any humanity and miss this was just raw hatred and fear\nCoupled with massive site disorders all of it promoted\nNot denounced all of it promoted and encouraged by the powers that be and the media and the Democratic party and the ... of the left\nAs I've been saying what a decent people do in response to the different people are when we're not going to become them\n\nThey may have as an objective with a real one nation and total human destruction of their opponents that's us\nDo not doubt me on this that may sound a little extreme to those of you that are here on the periphery but do not doubt me that is their objective total destruction and ruin nation\nWell how do we find that these people are not going to try to ruin their political opponents going to try to beat them but we're not going to be humble who they are we don't have an interest to become who they are so given that how are they stopped\nIf a serious question\nIf they are willing to do anything including the fact so career and life political murder\nTo stop things\nThey don't want to stop people that they don't want how do you how do you oppose them how to you beat that back\nDo you do it with decency to do it with politeness do you do it with ... I'm Sorry I'm going to cut it\nSorry never Trump or is it the right manners and ... and so forth isn't going to cut it\nSome people might say Russia ... the church is rock solid the churches where in during the violent [laughter] uh not anymore the churches are like every other institutions sucking up the people they hold power everybody needs money\nChurches need money all kinds of people need money and if the people are going to give you money demand that you be a certain way and be open to certain things and you're going to do it this is half a take a look at\nYour papa\nAnd what's even happening to the Catholic Church in places serious serious\nProblem when talking about the preservation of what I call our way of life underneath the umbrella of decency\nSo we're very lucky we have somebody willing to push back against it from the highest\n\nLevels of power in the country Donald Trump fearless leap pushes back on it are caused amount identifies them\nThey're not used to this they don't know how to react to it media is the greatest illustration of that not knowing how to react to being called out for what you really are\nI mean everybody's accused the media being biased over the years but nobody accuses them of fake making it up\nParticipating in the open and want to ruin nation of people do that he ever accuses them of that not not I mean we may hear but at the highest levels of government never happened before there's Donald Trump doing it and from the East Room of the White House here is more Trump last night\nThis really triggered him when he declared Kavanaugh innocent\nWhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\n\nAnd with that I must say that use are under historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank\nYou saw [laughter]\n[noise]\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness and courage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens\nYou know what that is I'm Sorry never Trump or his but that's just pure class\nTo take the time to look at those two little girls and tell them that their father is a great man in the midst of all of this the president of the United states taking time out to tell those two young daughters\nOf breath and Ashley Kavanaugh your father is a great man every father wants to hear about every father loves having his children told when he was a great man few ever are afforded that\nOpportunity but Trump did it last night\nThen proclaiming Kevin O's innocence I mean that is I can to taking all of poison the arrows at every Democrat launched it Kevin all the past two weeks and firing them back at once right down the throats of every Democrat Senator on the Judiciary Committee and every member of the media tried to ruin Kavanaugh\nTo openly proclaiming him innocent\nHe can't do that that wasn't a corner law he doesn't know but they had him guilty didn't say he was guilty simply on the basis of the allegation\n\nI Want to say one more time I don't believe anything that we went through the past two weeks starting with the realization that Christine Blasey Ford and written a letter to die on science I\nDon't think any of it was spontaneous and I don't think any of it was happenstance I think every bit of it was an orchestrated campaign just like every other October surprise in politics is\nI think the Democrats were in on it I don't know whether ... privacy\nYou know whether ... forge privacy was violated I don't know if she was in on it or is she was also a storage\nBut somebody suggested she write that letter Monica McLean her buddy who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara who hates Trump yesterday and why the United states attorney as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump Russia collusion\n\nI don't think they ever expected it to get as far as it did they thought Trump would pull back withdraw the nomination or the Kavanaugh would\nPull out and they would never get as far as ... as it got very was\nClearly\nIllustrated she had no evidence no cooperation no nothing in their strategizing of this event they never thought I Would go that far\nOne of the reasons is there used to Republican presidents caving nominee gets in big trouble pull the nomination residents don't want the grief starts\nReflect poorly on them they go to the nomination look\nMore work to nominate we can't sustain this you got to pull out nominees inside damn it's my one sorry nominee up pulling my support nominee president get together for the good of the country blah blah blah blah blah but he pulls out didn't happen here Trump repeal is pullout withdraw ghetto
