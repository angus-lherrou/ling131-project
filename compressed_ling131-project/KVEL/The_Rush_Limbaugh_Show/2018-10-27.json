liberal they'll do the right thing\nWe had a similar situation in Missouri was Claire McCaskill directly or own words and she's ... she is as liberal as Brock Obama but she's hiding her positions as it relates to Planned Parenthood the second amendment\nWhat do I keep saying Democrats can't run on what they really want to run on so they weren't on Trump paid\nThey tried to be quiet ... don't talk

it's not fraud for me to record people but it's certainly approaches fraud for her to misrepresent in such a awful way\nAnd and thank you Claire McCaskill for doing that an asking for me to be prosecuted because now every TV station in Missouri every single one has covered these videos and I think the same things that happened in North Dakota this week\nYou know I think well it shouldn't happen in North Dakota I mean if she planning to be a super liberal I think the people in North Dakota and fairness to them they need to know 'em why can't you do it in Pennsylvania and twelve other states\nThere's twelve states that prohibit what they call to party consent laws and I think that these laws basically it means that you know if you're if you're talking to someone you cannot record them without their permission whereas an ... like in New York and DC in North Dakota and\nMs ... as long as I'm with you I can records you know I think these laws are unconstitutional I think they had to do to fight the guilty and I also think\nSean they give the guilty away out\nThey give them a way out they give them a way to say why didn't say that when in fact they did and and and unfortunately

Paterson who memory he carried the nuclear football under the Clinton Administration\nWrote the book dereliction dereliction of duty a welcome both of you Brandon tell me your story what made you decide you worry I guess pretty left to a Democrat and you started this campaign and this whole thing for you is gone absolutely viral what happened\n[laughter] so it's great to be our son thank you um so I you know my whole life I consider myself a liberal and my whole adult life I considered myself when I was the Democratic party voter I always voted Democrat\nUm and that was true even in two thousand sixteen I went and voted for Hillary Clinton and I was\nOne of these people who was devastated by the results of the election for numerous reasons first of all the media has\nBeen telling me for months and months that Donald Trump didn't have more than a three percent chance of winning and they also had been telling me for months and months that he was a racist in a big ... and ... and a monster and basically the second coming of Hitler at that his followers were no better and you know they I think that the liberal media did\nFor me as they did for millions of others have very effective job scaring people making people believed the stories in this narrative that they're trying to push so when Trump got elected I was terrified and I was one of these people going on social media\nRanting you know screaming sometimes crying you know saying you know I'll never understand how people could vote for for this monster and on one particular day\nI posted about um you know I I'll never be able to understand how people can vote for a man who stood before a cheering crowd and mocked her reporters disability and it was on that day in January of two thousand Seventeen but somebody\nReached out to me after reading my Facebook posts and said listen\nI'm just asking have you seen this and what she sent me privately was linked to a Youtube video which was entitled debunking that Trump mocked the disabled reporter\nAnd for anybody who hasn't seen this as a compilation of footage I'm much of it is on the campaign trail but some of it even goes back ten years ago of Donald Trump doing that exact same voice in that exact same gesture as he did that day when he was quote unquote mocking the disabled reporter\nBut what's clear when you watch this compilation\nIs that this is a a voice in a bit but Donald Trump does when he's imitating someone who was caught in a lie or doing something shady or\nGrumbling because they've been caught doing something dishonest and I I Know some stupid now shot but it's like it was the first time in my entire life that I really realized that the media was capable of creating a completely false narrative\nAnd then isolating a moment out of contact to push that merits if it had nothing to do is news or the truth\nBrand that let me ask you something now once your eyes are open and once you become aware of their bias and it's like you you you ask yourself but I ... instance myself but it's even worse than it's ever been how did you not see it before do you ever say that to yourself\n... yeah yeah it's absolutely the kind of thing that once you see it you can't see it and what you just said it's actually kind of the next part of the story because then I went back to the beginning of the campaign and revisited all those other moments like Trump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women\nYou know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same time and again that's not what happened that is not what happened but they made a decision after he wound up\nAnd what you just said it's actually kind of the next part of the story because then I went back to the beginning of the campaign and revisited all those other moments like Trump calls all Mexicans rapists Trump advocates for the sexual assault of all women you know I went back and revisit those moments and found the same thing time and again that's not what happened that is not what happened\nBut they made a decision after he won that primary where it was clear that he was going to win the Republican primary that it wasn't funny anymore that he was running suddenly it was scary and that they had to turn this man into the the scariest candidates at the world had ever seen so\nLet me ask you this when I when I tell my audience\nTo expect and I showed a lot of the ads that are out last night and I've been I've been showing these instances people that are in the public eye that are conservative or support the president you know they're being run out of restaurants I'm Talking about women and children good luck to anybody wants to try and run me out of a restaurant I give it your best shot\nYou know I noticed that it either happens to a guy with his wife or or an older person or women you know what when there are a bunch of cowards the when they do that because I'd never treat anybody that way but you know this is the narrative every two and four years in elections in America that Republicans are racist or sexist massage in is\nThat there are homophobic dino phobic Islamophobia\nThat they want dirty air and water Obama use those actual words\nThat they want children to die and they'll have some commercial with the Paul Ryan look alike throwing granny over the cliff because they want to kill your grandmother that's what they do that to their play book we're watching it unfold today even Thirteen Days out of the election um do you see now that all of that is not true there's not one thing\nThat is true about that look look at the stakes for African Americans Hispanic Americans Asian Americans women in the workforce um the lowest unemployment levels\nEver recorded for these demographics ever\nYeah no absolutely seeing that now and in fact I think a lot of others are starting to see it as well which is resulting in what you just said that even I think the most\nUh these minority groups in particular that I think the Democratic party for so long has taken for granted that does it oh these are just automatic vote well that's not the case anymore I mean people really are starting to wake up and they're starting to walk away because they're seeing so\nHow many people have joined your movement\nSo the movement began on Facebook and then that are rich in that first initial Facebook group we now have over two hundred and five thousand poverty impressive show me ... all social media platforms we have about four hundred thousand\nIt to be clear for anyone who doesn't know this is a testimonial campaign so these are just people who are going on social media and clicking follower clicking like\nThey are telling their stories about why they are walking away so I mean they're they're making videos are writing these stories down I mean people are there this is for me like a network of support and people are leaving walking away from the left\nOf uh let me bring in bus Patterson as we've been around the block a climber to a new around the Clintons a lot a Hillary ... we can't be civil with with people we disagree with his I'm like okay you know if you don't want to be you know I ran into what's that ... the senator from that we ran into Linda when we were in Washington\nBlumenthal I ran into him on the streets right when I was going to do my show one night and I went you know and this was right in the middle of the cabinet hearings and it was being a lunatic and I I was ... center and how are you\nWhat's going on man because um I have no what am I going to confront him on the street and didn't scream adamant that I mean I don't get this behavior I don't it's not affect him I said if you like to come on my show one day here's my number that's it why are people acting that way\nYeah well you know my story ...
