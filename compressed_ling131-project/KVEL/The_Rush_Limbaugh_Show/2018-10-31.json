... he doesn't go after the terrorists he doesn't sort of make a beat the drums or to go out and stop the terrorists all around the country tried to heal and it was a turning point as president say he was a battle the when he went to Oklahoma City that turned his presence around the very positive direction\nThis is how history revision as works there David Ronald Reagan's saying that Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma City in Nineteen Ninety five inhaled he didn't go after the\nTerrorists he didn't\nSort of America you know beat the drums to go out and stop the terrorists\nWell\nLet's go back and listen to what Gergen thanks was Bill Clinton's finest moments April twenty fourth Nineteen Ninety five ... in Minneapolis\nWe hear so many loud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up an upset with each other they spread hey\nThey leave the impression that there are very words that violence is acceptable you oughta see I'm sure you are now saying the reports of some things that are regularly says over the airwaves in America today it is time we all stood up and spoke against that\nThat's the basalt torn up and upset with each other they spread hey\nThey leave the impression that by their very words that violence is acceptable\nYou oughta see I'm sure you are now seeing the reports with some things that are regularly said over the airwaves in America today it is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech\nRight now who couldn't even talking about this Nineteen Ninety five there is no Fox News the blogger ends meet some of the airwaves\nOr this is where he attempted to blame me everybody you know what at the time and it was even applauded by some not everybody at the White House felt some have they have the issue of corrections and all we were talking about the Michigan Militia short wave radio network that's meant by angry voices on the right\nThe Michigan Militia was a media creation I mean it might have been some guys hiking around in the woods with some guns were in Campbell gear and the media had video of it but some Michigan Militia was a non factor in any of this\nYou get rid of it there's Clinton zeroing in on it when it's attempt to blame me\nBombed out some of the Clintons you didn't do that no he was trying to heal he didn't go after anybody he didn't go after the terrorist he didn't sort of beat the drums install cameras all over the drive to heal it was a turning this is\nAgain history revision is an extraordinary one more by this is Wolf Blitzer\nAnd judge Jeffrey children\nLast night on a Wolf Blitzer show on CNN\nI with the White House correspondent proceeding in Nineteen Ninety five are in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing or Britain was president he went to Oklahoma City was he delivered a beautiful speech and it was very very warmly received there were no protesters going on for you remember those days\nAnd how about you know President Obama who unfortunately had all these mass shootings on his watch in South Carolina in Connecticut and you know he led the grieving and all those places frankly wouldn't even occur to me that there would have been protests see\nSo now there were no protest for a bomb and there is no protests when Clinton went out but there's all kinds of protests when Trump goes out meaning what\nTrump's guilty But Trump's at fault that the protesters are right why weren't there any protests back in those days we'll take a look at who the victims were number one but what why we're there no protests\n\nPrecisely because the left very rarely protest its own people they protest for no reason at all other than a simple excuse for it\nBut it also was a

absorb it it's news\nThey think everybody does it to a certain extent and so they get all hot to trot about things and they see the caravan might be helping Trump and they like it or don't like it doesn't matter and then they said that Kavanaugh's situation that Democrats blew that sky high\nAnd sort of oh man this is really gonna help but then the pipe bomb in the Senate guy shouldn't come along and they feel like their motivation\nOr energy level focus on those two things is interrupted by it and I think everybody else's\nHas\nWell I don't know that it works like that with ... with with the people who are not in the news business but I'm going to\nTell you it's been conventional wisdom in Washington and that's the pipe bombs and the synagogue shooting destroyed\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh to hurt Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\n\nHere's another one if the Kavanaugh confirmations circus we're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul rape by Kevin ... is the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is justice\nNot being sought\nWhen we I mean if it was really the purpose\nAbout getting justice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul rate by Kevin ... is the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is justice not\nBeing sought any longer\nAnd they answered the question is it was never about the women because none of the women had any evidence\nIt was about one thing only and that was killing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh even if it meant destroying his family and his career his future

mean what does it mean that we're not getting any updates from the drive by media about all of these women were sold mistreated by Kevin ...\nWhat does it mean that the Democrats are not being asked by the media whether they support Kevin O's impeachment wise it's all been dropped\n\nWhy have the media given up investigating the story they obsess over for nearly a month\nFor weeks September and October that's all the median talked about [noise]\nWhere's the pollen if Kavanaugh was as they say that story should not have gone away the women still suffered the women did not get justice cabinet got confirmed where is the news where is the continuing investigation will it doesn't exist because it was all made up about Canada\nClassic Democratic Party media operation so is the aftermath of the pipe bomb story so as the aftermath of the Jewish synagogues story it's all media manufactured not the stories themselves in this case\nBut the coverage the way it's being covered the fact that Trump

Nineteen Ninety two years after the program I guess would be Nineteen Ninety\nAnd he's around Ninety these these are quite close to a hundred years old and he's asked me so what what are the big that was it was hard of hearing but it's not as you couldn't hear the radio easily one of the big thing is being discussed on your program say immigration we call the pop\nPop you would not believe it I mean I I I'm dealing with people who are just so anti immigration wouldn't when this was\nThis was folks this was all in back in Nineteen Ninety it wasn't just strictly southern border\nImmigration

was\nThis was folks this was all\nBack in Nineteen Ninety it wasn't just strictly southern border immigration and he said you know I remember those debates all the way back in the early Nineteen hundreds back in the days of Ellis Island you immigration has been\nA\nPolarizing subject to this country for as long as we have been doing it and he started telling me stories of the\nUh efforts to impugn new arrivals from western in Eastern Europe\nAnd he was telling me that there were so many people who didn't want any of those people from Eastern Europe Western Europe average people as his point was the arguments haven't changed\nThe issue has been something that is Constance but the one thing that has changed he was talking about even back in Nineteen Ninety when we were talking about he was talking about legal\nImmigration he was saying but back in the early Nineteen hundreds away they've you know the controversy was about legal immigration and even with legal immigration where people opposed\nTo opening up Ellis Island then preventing masses of humanity to come in\nAnd for reasons similar to what her stuff today the differentiating things today is that legal immigration is seldom even discussed and we have both\nPolitical parties in predominantly one of them now advocating for lawlessness advocating for illegal immigration and then using opponents of illegal immigration as examples of racism and bigotry\nSo forth so while the issue has always been around and it's always been a controversial thing\nImmigration and how we manage it the idea that illegal aliens should be automatically granted citizenship for amnesty upon their arrival that is watch new to this debate and that is what the uh the Democrats\nWhen the Americans left today are are advocating and they're doing something on the premise that America is responsible for the economic\nPlight of these people that we\nAs a superpower have taken an unfair portion of the world's resources\nWe've gone around the world and taken what we want and we have not compensated people privately we've tried to impose our way of life and so it liberalism economics is a zero sum game if the American people are wealthy
