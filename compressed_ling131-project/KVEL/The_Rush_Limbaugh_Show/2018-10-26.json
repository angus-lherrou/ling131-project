this one I'm Still trying to figure out somebody sent me this screen shot of a website that list this party is the Green Party which doesn't jibe with any of this\nI mean the Green Party would be all in on CNN the Green Party would be all in on a\nA bunch of things that are anti Trump so some of this that we are being sent and seeing doesn't make a whole lot of sense so we're still in the process of trying to track it all down now in the midst of this\nThere continues to be news reported about the mid term elections and there's some other news that was reported the discussion about the bombs before today when people were told the identity of the bomber in showing pictures of the bombers a\nVan a down in in uh in plantation Florida and one of the things that I had intended to share with you today is Chuck Todd was on the MSNBC yesterday we have an audio I lifted the ban on MSNBC to report this that Chuck Todd\nSaid that he was afraid the Russians were behind this scare\n\nChuck Todd said that he fears the Russians couldn't be responsible for the mail bomb scare that has targeted top officials in the Democratic party\nAs well as CNN and Robert De Niro quote I have this fear it could be some Russian operation out there are designed to do what's happening now and that is so all of this confusion\n\nChuck Todd added that we shouldn't rule out the possibility the Russians are behind this and the male bottom scare is dividing the country\nAnd that's what its purpose is this was on his show called meet the press daily now I ... the reason that I [laughter] the Russians what is\nNot worry about that is that here you have the moderator of meet the press\nF Chuck Todd who's now but we just might\nIs this is on his show called meet the press\nDaily\nNow I ... the reason that I [laughter] the Russians what is not worry about that is that here you have the moderator of meet the press ap Chuck Todd\nWho believe despite the fact that we haven't seen any evidence despite the fact that there isn't any evidence Chuck Todd operating under no believe the Russians stole the two thousand election\nSomebody whose mind maybe close and made up about something that did not happen and and and in fact the exact\nI so you think that as we sit here today the deep state makes their going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats in the middle of the interesting thing is not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is that the Democrats in the deep state laws as they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we can't dive democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that\nThe the deep state here set this guy up more than he is part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts cheering hates the left when in fact they orchestrated you think that\n[noise] do you do you set the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could've been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean like I said rush three years ago I Would have said I'm Crazy I mean I I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\nI mean you're talking about some very high profile people being out a lot of trouble\nTheoretically that he'll events eventually the gears of justice grind slowly but you'd like to believe that actually some of these people are going to pay for what they've done\nWell wait a minute why why isn't that happening now the Republicans around the house of representatives now why do why do they have to win it again in order to conduct these investigations that Jim Jordan says are coming up\nI think Trump will have more to do with pushing it forward once these elections are over I think there are deep state people on the Republican side who helped slow wrote this thing I really do\n\nI think Trump will be the one ram routing it once he's elected as are over if he gets the big win because this will be a mandate about him they if they really\nSorry I'm just a moment we'll let's discuss that you'd think Trump is essentially on the ballot in in this election there is no wrong answer who don't don't miss don't misunderstand my tone I'm trying\nTo learn what you think you you think that Trump is essentially on the ballot this these midterm elections in part or maybe ... close in total or a referendum on Trump\nNo doubt about it look at the effect us having when he goes in and campaigns for people in states that was supposed to be such trouble for the Republicans I think he's definitely I think these people on the left think this was going to be their big moment when they finally jam it to this guy and get all their investigation started I think they think this is the beginning of the ...\nNo I Will is something that I was I was reading a a tech blogs yesterday and folks I really appreciate you indulge me talking about this is my hobby not keeping up with the blockers meant\nKeeping up with the tech and to keep up with the tech yeah have to read the stuff and\nIt's all written by a bunch of young millennial journalist\nAnd they have ever since election day two thousand six day and they haven't been in various stages of panic\nAnd I I'm a\n... there was a reference in one of the tech blogs to a poll showing the red wave of the blue wave was not going to happen and it was not nearly as big and this particular blogger was in a mile to panic about it writing about you know what we all have been thinking that what happened in two thousand sixteen was an\nOdd confluence of events\nThat that gave us a one off result that's not really representative of America that Donald Trump\nAnd these Republicans is not who we are and then the guy says but if the Republicans hold the house of representatives and we're gonna have to come to grips with this is who we are and that we are not\nThe show in truth and it was it was um it was like I wouldn't say there was panic and end up reading the written word but it's slowly dawning on some of the the last two years they have live with the belief\nIs that what happened in two thousand sixteen was unusual irregular a one off that it shouldn't have happened it was an odd confluence of events of bad candidates with the\nHillary Clinton and so forth over confidence by people on the left but that um people have been waiting every day for these two years to fix this\nLive with the belief that what happened in two thousand sixteen\nWas unusual irregular a one off that it shouldn't have happened it was an odd confluence of events of bad candidates with the Hillary Clinton and so forth of overconfidence by people on the left but that uh people have been waiting\nEvery day for these two years to fix this mistake of the Democrats are going to storm the ballot boxes on Tuesday\nIn November and correct dismissing now they're starting to\nBegin to quite may be this is not an oddity navy navy we're not the majority and it kinda dumped tales of what you're saying here do you believe for example that a Trump\nVoters and Republican voters right now are actually losing momentum to vote because of his mom's now\nGo rush can I share something with you here I went yeah Trump rally I went out a Trump rally two weeks ago it was an I was in Council Bluffs right across the river\nAnd I think the uh mid America center seats for this event was sitting like twelve thousand I'm not exaggerating there had to about twenty five thousand people outside there in that line\nThere were more women than there were men there were ever going Americans and they were nice people but I'm telling you there were a lot of these protesters\nAnd my instinct was I Want to say something to these protesters one I got down there\nLike me and many other people we don't want to start trouble with that it's like we don't have the inclination to get in their faces an act like they do and so many of these Trump supporters are not the kinds of people that are wearing it on their sleeves right now they're just going to go in and out how how could you hold it against the guy is doing such wonderful things for the country I mean he really is\nAnd I think a lot of those people are just going to go in there and they're going to vote because they now realize that they got the momentum on their side but they're not the kinds of people that are out there wearing it on their sleeves like these crazy radical leftist they're all doing\nWell it is it is a ... it's it's standard old conventional wisdom thinking that\nPeople voting impulses or energy or desires and the and flow like this I mean the idea that uh this week a bomb scare stories can\nDampen enthusiast I I don't I don't think that describes the average Trump voter I think the average Trump voter is immune\nTo all of that and more maybe I think more than the average Trump voter I I I I don't think they have to be told how important the election is I don't think they have to be reminded to vote I don't think they need to be told the stakes and yet\nThere are people that continued you got to drive turnout Russia got to tell people how important it is I think they already know I I'm I'm\nI don't sense that there is a usual lessening\nOf enthusiasm or a gaming of enthusiasm based on the ebb and flow of news I think people understand how important\nIt is it that was it hits as important now is it wasn't two thousand sixteen\nAnd in fact it may even be more important now that Trump is in office and policies have been enacted the idea of this stuff needs to continue or maybe more important like Trump said at one of his rallies I think the ... the rally in Houston He was talking about how he he produced he's got he's got a track record now\nHe said two years ago in the campaign and I was saying we're going to do this we're going to be great again we're going to stop there's going to make a trade deals better but back then it was just\nWords that would just words but now two years later I produced meeting is not just words it's real now and I think from so supporters understand this I I just think they're immune to the um uh attempts that are made\nElsewhere to the spirit them a or to somehow weaken their enthusiasm so we'll see a it won't be long haired Jimmy I'm Glad you called thanks for the extended time we'll be back after\nThis doesn't hold back the news you need to know rush of leaky I beat Mitt

remarks made by President Trump he was very gracious tort law enforced\nIt was very gracious toward the work done to bring this vile just gusting make America great again bomber\nTo justice\nAnd I I I think before the day is out you're gonna see various panelists and pundits and commentators and the drive by media over the edge driven over the edge might Trump doing for two reasons one they're going to consider him a total fraud\nThat he's calling for unity\nYou might you might just going to happen maybe before this program is over there's going to be a panel on CNN or MSNBC or some leftist on Fox called Trump a total fraud calling for unity when he is responsible for all of the chaos and division they will say\nThat Trump was on will leave a bleak brazen for talking about this is if he's not complicit\nThey'll rip him for acting like he had nothing to do with it remember the old Limbaugh the rub Limbaugh the room was the process by which were rock Obama\nThere's no way that they're saying doesn't get noticed in doesn't have people reacting to it in in certain ways so you think what\nThen you you you you think this guy is being used\nYou know I Know like you know I mean

remember the day on the first time you did it safe to talk [laughter] I was I Lived in a suburb of ... and\nI was driving down highway eighty wait a minute I deployed where you live in I ... I was laughing so hard I have to pull over you lived in Rio Linda suburb of real into\nA suburb of ... I was gonna say nobody admits it yeah [laughter] no [laughter] safe to say you were laughing so hard you had to pull off the road\nI had to pull up Russia and I've been laughing ever since I really appreciate what you're doing and I really appreciate the opportunity to tell you when you got you got to tell us way back in Sacramento where you start and then you get all I Know um [laughter] it was real good\nI oh I owe a lot Sacramento it was first first place in mind to hire radio career where I had any any meaningful success at all uh and I I ... I Lived there three and a half years and I thoroughly enjoyed it\nI uh I did up before you go here uh you have any thoughts on what's happening here in the news with the with sales are say Ockun his a

pipe bombs to Democrats and CNN sucks and all that\nWell I just think it's going to be real interesting yeah really comes up because like you mentioned in here about the van and things things to look like a set up but we just don't know until we really\nYou know it's a sad thing is where we are in our country right they're going to be people not going to believe what they're told about this um anyway ah no matter no matter what law enforcement tells us\nOne thing for sure of this guy is gonna\nHe's never going to see the sun again he's he's gonna he's gonna go away to jail for the rest of

anybody\nHe's violated I Know I look I'm not exaggerating here is violated so many federal statutes with is that if he's convicted on even a few of them the number of years he's going to get here are such that he'll never see the sun again well hobbies eat will never be free\nHe's going to be in jail the rest of his life but my point is there are people can be terribly disbelieving of whatever we're told actually happened here just the nature of the ... what saved talk all safe talk what what's next talk well it\nWas a it was it was my way of illustrating absurdity by being absurd\nUm that occurred back in Nineteen eighty four eighty five and back then in safe sex was all the rage\nFor a number of reasons not spreading STDs and not getting pregnant and therefore not\nNeeding abortions a abstinence which works every time it's tribe was being laughed at ... ... as an unrealistic you can't say just don't do it does not going to you're going to do something so safe sex\nOr came up and it basically meant to use a condom so I thought that I Would ah demonstrate the folly\nOf this belief by demonstrating sex talk and what I did was\nOver a series of days I just do it once but first I grabbed a condom and I stretch that type of place that on the microphone we have photos of this thing take the proven as before they ever did OK I'm dreaming about\nBut the fact of the condom being placed the microphone was a mistake of all and then after the condom was in place to demonstrate safe talk I Would I'd asked what\nDo you think now if I say anything that offends you that this kind of them will protect if other profanity if I start engaging activities you don't want to hear as well this condom protect\nLife it of course it will because I Am engaging in states talk just like they are encouraging us\nTo the safe sex and that's that's what he was talking about and of course there were additions and a additional aspects to it as it happened it wasn't just a a one time that\nIt had a point to make so was ongoing and then that was followed by shortly after moving to New York the famous color abortions which if its own\nSo I I doubt I doubt I can get away with that even today
