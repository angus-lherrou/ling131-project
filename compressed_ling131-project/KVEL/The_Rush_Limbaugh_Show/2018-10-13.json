all said that that Rod Rosenstein or talk about surreptitiously taping the president of the United states in the hopes of getting something on tape that that might invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment those are the same Rod Rosenstein that is up to his eyeballs and conflict\nHaving written a letter and recommended the firing a James called me the same guy the signed the fourth and final buys a

there is real credibility with these witnesses that suggested that he not only wanted to tape the president but he wanted to use those tapes a to effectively have a de OJ who on the president of the United states\nWell he met with the president apparently earlier this week and blue on air force one does anyone know what the result of that meeting was\nWell I think the biggest thing is uh Shaun is is I let's don't read too much into a flight on air force one and I think it's the president trying to be reasonable and hear rod side of the story I think the president has been extremely measured\nI tell you who's not measured at this particular point uh you you've got Rod Rosenstein believing that he can hide behind the fact that he's the number two at the oj I can tell you got to people on the phone today\nJim Jordan Mark Meadows who are not going to let that happen\nOkay Jim Jordan why is this even an issue why isn't you you have the power to subpoena Rod Rosenstein who you're not and bring them in and put them under oath\nYeah I mean and this is why that should happen and I hope I hope chairman Goodlatte will do that we've already subpoenas that McCain Menlo since the kitten was or what the New York times\nCited that there were people in that room with Rod Rosenstein who set by the time was talking about recording to present the United states so we have the FBI former chief counsel a council Jim Baker saying he took that as seriously when he was told about that meeting\nThat Rod Rosenstein was thinking about recording the commander in chief of this great country and we have in the Cape metals that reinforced that we've subpoenaed it became memos and we ...\nYou come in and answer a question neither one of those things that happen\nSo that that you know Mr rather than it is leading that you played shot he talked about ... he he talked about facts and and the here and do this and how our our our ... our justice system works well one of the hallmarks of our justice system is transparency show what the document give her the Cape memos and more importantly comments or questions that's what bothers both of them\nWell why would the committee allow him to pull out of this\nWell I can tell you that the committee has shown weak leadership and I I I hate to criticize anybody a but we've had two weeks I can tell you this the speaker of the house the majority leader of the house\nOr Jim Jordan and I with chairman Goodlatte in the room and and two or three other staffers we all agreed that what we would do is move expeditiously to have him come into a transcribe the interview and if they did not if rod did not because I suspected that he wouldn't come in\nOr that we would subpoena him and compel him to do that and I can tell you that ah it's it's more excuses on why he should not be transparent and and I for one I'm tired of\nSo we're basically saying Republicans that have the power ... and could literally force him to come and testify under oath an answer these really important questions if there was a plot a scheme of plan now you've got three people corroborating Lisa Page Andrew McCabe but now James Baker\nAll saying that he talked about taping the president of the United states\nIn the hopes that it would provide materials that they could invoke the twenty Fifth Amendment he says no no no I didn't say I was just joking about it I don't see what's so funny about it and said sarcastically I don't I don't even see any sarcasm in that and they are saying that they all believe he was saying it seriously\nYes that that that is accurate and even if he was joking you ... that the guy who was in effect running Justice Department should not be joking with support it's about recording the commander in chief of the United states that\n... that even if it's a joke that's not something you do it particularly at the time that this was happening remember on this is back in May of twenty Seventeen when the whole darn cities in an uproar because on late night the president fires give them call me on seventeenth Rod Rosenstein named Bob Mueller the special counsel\nIs one of the things you enjoy the bill happen in between there remember Lisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was a media league\nStrategy so that they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of\nThe fires give them call me on may seventeenth ... bubble or the special counsel\nIs one of the huge already built happen in between there remember\nLisa Page set up to that point they never had any evidence of Trump Russia collusion but there was a media leaks strategy\nSo that they were creating an atmosphere where people were thinking there was some type of a reason to appoint a special counsel which now gets back to what the insurance policy was the page and struck we're talking about and it seems we got our answer now\nWell you're right I think not only were they leaking arid of gyms exactly right you know there's a whole lot that has gone into this you know where we got actually a memos that have been subpoenaed testimony that there\nAre a narrative that was put out there by the department of justice and FBI and yet they knew that many of the things that they were putting out in the media\nCould not be substantiated\nI I Would go even further than this you know you you did the lead in\nI'm not even sure that Rod Rosenstein red defies application many side you know when you start to look and here's some of the testimony is chilling the amount of documents that they fail to read and I I'm not so sure that Rod Rosenstein even well\nDid they fail to read them do we know they failed to read the more they didn't care I mean there's two different possibilities here\nI'm One of the big problems with all of this is every single item we're discussing here and the Grassley Graham memo pointed it out the Nunes memo pointed out that the bulk of information used to obtain the Pfizer warns that that they were literally committing fraud on the size of court they never substantiated\nThey'd never verified they'd never corroborated any of the steel ... of this of course the British deals you know dot CA and as a result that was used as the bulk of informational pain the warrants and the problem is not even seal agrees that there's any truth in what he wrote\nWell they that's correct ... even a steel and Simpson believe all the things that were given the Bruce or but here's the other problem\nIs is even Bruce or knew that some of the things that he was writing there\nWere not accurate and and yet somehow they get put in a a three oh two and they get used as a justification to actually a further investigation in terms of the president United States it's just sickening it truly is ticked me\nAll right so what's the next step why isn't good latte and Gowdy demanding that that Rod Rosenstein appear tomorrow under oath and answer these questions whether or not he talked about several viciously ... you know taping the president of the United states for the purposes\nOf of invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment we need an answer to that\nYes we do and the American people need an answer and that's what we'll be pushing a chairman Goodlatte indicated that he would do that so now with your time obviously to get that done and that you're Mr Rosenstein gets in there answered these important\nQuestions now that we know that there's there's actual documents that talk about what took place in that meeting back between may ninth and may seventeenth up twenty Seventeen where he allegedly said that he was going to record the president and now that we have a\n... individual who's come forward and said he took it seriously after talking with page and I'm Mr McCain who came right from that meeting so look\nWe've got to subpoena we've got to bring him into the gas the question\nI Will take a quick break more with
