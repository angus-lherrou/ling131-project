archiving and play it for you but it's it's a perfect illustration of of ah\nHow she speaks I have to tell you something even if you're not the only woman who doesn't believe her the female prosecutor to Republicans hired\nA Rachel Mitchell has put together a devastating for rent that can now offices of Dr forge testimony and it is and I've got that here but it prints out the eight pages\nI mean there's there's there's no way I can I mean I guess I could share various excerpts of it with you [noise] um but I mean it is just devastating on the substance forget the way she spoke and how she appeared and so forth a and the the Democrats are acknowledging\nHim as well she's part is you know we can't we can't take seriously the thing that dead woman's as in there so rejecting it but no

and to the store with yet another door and she can try and hit there she saw as if a judge yeah character that said that okay she said she went up to him and said Hi and with\nFriendly and how he just acted like he didn't want to have anything to you after you out why would you that he had\nDone what he's supposedly had done a few weeks earlier and it it traumatized you why would you go up to him

year ago six months I I don't want to go I don't want to see that person\nOr by the way to use her saying safe way is very very important folks where she saw judge the judge has written a book is part of his recovery therapy for a drug addiction and alcoholism and depression and he was told by the therapist or write a book not a memoir\nBut to write a book about his problems and he placed himself in Safeway stores as an employee so she just happens to say she runs into what a safe way\nUh and it's thought that that was strategy after having read this book than it would give foreign credibility\nTo cite the fact that she saw it on a Safeway store a since he had written about and it was it was it was designed to give herself proof for some measure but if you're not alone and
