Nineteen seventies as a an offshoot of radicalism in the sixties is where\nChanging premise of education for America's kids actually began but I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here in the details of the story\nDonald Trump and let me just give you the New York times version they're headline Trump claims he can defy constitution and end birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump property dramatic if legally dubious promise in a new interviewed ... unilaterally and birthright citizenship ratcheting up his hard line immigration rhetoric with a week to go before the critical mid term elections\nTrump's vow to enter the rights of citizenship for children of non citizens authorized immigrants born in America came in an interview with act CEOs\nThe day was always going to be noisy and it was going to be potentially violent and dangerous\nAfter all these are people who do not accept the election results anymore and you know what that means ...\nYou know was held this country together all these years is the\nHonoring of a lecture results yeah have a heated campaign you may have political parties and really don't like each other but whoever won the election decided who\nHad a chance at running the country and both sides acknowledge that and it wasn't that long ago\nYou didn't go back to two thousand two when the Democrats lost those mid term elections in shock George W Bush's first midterm elections after winning in two thousand a drive by is on the left what convinced\nThat they were going to sweep the house the way they were going to sweep the Senate away with people were fed up with the Florida recount remember all that Al Gore got jobs the Democrats got cheated and Democrats were loaded for bear out what happened the Republicans won and added seats in an off year election\nWhat the Democrats they accepted it for the most part and they started talking about how well we're gonna have to modify some of what we believe or auto values a basis because an\nExit poll showed that values were a large factor in why people voted Republican well fast forward it two thousand six than there is no knowledge with the Trump won they do not accept\n\nThe election results that's what these past two years have been about and are going to remain about they don't accept Trump's election as legitimate because they didn't want it\nWe've gotten to a point where the radical left simply because it doesn't feel good about this is willing to overthrow an election results and the way this happened\nTop levels of the Obama D. O. J. we're used to overthrow run a silent cool to try to throw Donald Trump back out of office and reverse those election results it's unprecedented\n... you can and has peace out today that uh reminds people Nineteen sixty eight featured even more violence on the rats that we haven't yet seen this year but we're getting close\nYou can always go back in time and find the period where it was worse than it is at present you can always go back and fight the civil war but it is a seminal moment when a political party\nHas its official position refuses to accept election results\nAnd that's where we are and that's why we're where we are they refused to accept it for whatever reason they hate Trump I don't feel good about it they just rip whatever doesn't matter why just the fact that they refused to accept the results\nIs a horribly dangerous thing because what if it keeps up what if the only time there is peace in America is when they win elections\nYou know I I predicted some time ago that they're going to figure this out at some point and the natural conclusion to figuring this out is well what's just eliminate elections elections or what's holding us back let's find a way that will lemonade or\nPeople laugh and combine why it's never going to have do not ever say the left isn't capable of anything ever\nSo now Trump rather than being intimidated by their refusal to accept his election rather than his feelings hurt Trump doubles down triples down every time they hit him he hits back\nWith additional energy and verve and I'm telling you this promise with an executive order to end birthright citizenship is huge and it's why he was elected when\nThings are going terribly wrong and they are in our country right now when things are terribly wrong and out of control\nYou have to have somebody willing to go outside the so called boundaries in Trump's doing it every day and willing to do so because this is what pushing back\nThis is what defiance this is what changing with the left as though it looks like it was never going to be pretty it was never going to be why it was never going to be clean\n\nIt requires a strong stomach and strong fortitude and there's I don't think any elected Republican other than Trump even if they had made the promises Trump made I think all of them would have caved by now\nBut Trump hasn't he doubled down All right I'm just I'm an additional executive order I'm going to end the birthright citizenship let me read the on the fourteenth amendment how it begins\nAll persons now the fourteenth amendment goes back to ... I think it was ratified by Congress agents sixty six\nNow it was passed by Congress ratified by the state's two years later so it's in sixty six it was passed by Congress to ratify the state's Eighteen sixty eight and its original intent was to grant citizenship to slaves and their descendants and it was\nPart and parcel of post civil war era of America fixing itself it was a good thing\nOr our constitution was written so that mistakes half the founding to be corrected vast majority of people do slavery of the founding was was on tenable but they needed the union in order to fight\nThe revolutionary war they needed the southern states they needed unity to do that so they had to accept slavery but they'd built in safeguards to wipe it out and have half of the nation sixty eight the fourteenth amendment begins this way all persons born or\nNaturalized in the United states and subject to the jurisdiction there of our citizens of the U.S end of the state where in they reside\nIt was clearly intended to be referring to slams in their descendants\nThe parts that birthright citizenship a freaks have to delete art naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction that Rob\n\nYou are not naturalized and you are not subject to the U.S jurisdiction if you're here illegally\nYou cannot be you're under some other countries jurisdiction if you're here illegally you cannot possibly be naturalized\nWell the birthright citizenship crowd which ones don't watered down American culture and destroy western civilization conveniently leaves out naturalized and subject to the jurisdiction that Rob\nSo you're born here child absolutely is not a citizen and this is what Trump is saying Trump has finally pushing back against an assumption\nThat has been made because it was the least half

the Nineteen sixties is when we started extending birthright citizenship to anybody\nWho happened to be born in the United states and it has become one of the primary reason is that illegal immigration happens\nFor only obvious reasons once an illegal immigrant family gives birth in the United states that child as a citizen and it's a hello citizenship everybody else in the family eventually and then you get into the thing is chain migration and and all of it and it's it's one of the force multiplier is\nGeometric a proportion advancement in terms of the numbers\nOf illegal immigrants so they'll laugh just saying that Trump is just doing this to rile up the base it's just a an issue for one week before the election then he doesn't really intend to do it that it can't be done that he doesn't have the power constitutionally to do it\nUh because it is a constitutional amendment and he cannot just reverse but he does have the power on the basis of what we just talked about the actual wording what what is illegal now is the way it's been adapted\nTrump does have according to constitutional people who I admire\n\nSay that all Trump is doing here is enforcing the

going to bring it to a screeching halt everybody knows that\nI mean that'll happen within hours of Trump signing the executive order everybody involved no it was that's going to happen that then begins the process and it probably will end up at the Supreme Court unless Congress does right legislation in dealing with a constitutional amendment\nOr it may take more than just the statutory act\nAnd the left\nAnd they've got plenty of judges out there are going to be using every damn one of them to try to shut down every effort here\nLet's see this is how folks this is how we ended up

the media\nGoes more and more bonkers because they know what's going on\n\nAnd it's it's forcing everybody to see that the media isn't the media the media is the Democratic party\nAnd all of these things are why the people I talked to who think that there's not going to be a blue\nWave think they think more and more Americans because the Trump are finally the liberalism and action as opposed to having been told what liberalism is and who liberals are there now see it\nAnd once that happens it's it's harder for the left to win\nI mean if they could win by being honest if they can win by being
