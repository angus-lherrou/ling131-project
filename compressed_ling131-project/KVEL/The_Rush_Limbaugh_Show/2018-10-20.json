George W.

George W. Bush\nUm when Elizabeth Warren talked about the criminal justice system being racist friends that she got so many people angry there's a lot of families out there that care about community safety ... here she is insulting law enforcement so this is a different race and I think most people are expecting and I think now that she's made it very clear that she wants to run for the White House and twenty twenty\nI'm In no focus on Massachusetts whatsoever\nOn this is a no brainer for a lot of people out there and and of course the integrity issue I'm not really concerned about her ancestry but the integrity of claiming Native American heritage is what I think people are most concerned about it and she says one thing all the time and does another she wants to raise your taxes Sean\nBecause you're a one percent her but she also herself detected fifty thousand dollars worth of closed in one year to lower her own taxes That's Elizabeth Warren\nFifty thousand dollars in old clothes that's like the Clintons you know dumping their use the underwear as if that's all true they did it as a tax deduction by the way I don't think anybody wants their old underwear\nAnd they put a value to it you know I've always said the Jeff that basically liberals are generous only with other people's money that we had the latest numbers from twenty sixteen come out and the bottom fifty percent of taxpayers in this country don't pay three percent of the bill just three we have redistribution\n... percent pays forty percent of the bill you know I mean so I mean I don't know what else\nThe tax cuts the fact that they want their crumbs back they want to impeach Trump they want endless investigation they want to keep Obamacare disaster they want to eliminate eyes open borders I mean that's the whole thing and hate Trump that's it\nYeah she wants to get rid of ice in fact it was a Cambridge a warrant supporter of about a month ago there was arrested for putting a five hundred dollar bounty on ice officers I mean you know her rhetoric actually is dangerous in when Republicans wanted to fix health care make it actually affordable about a year ago a she was the one that said the\nRepublicans want blood money from the American people now there's just right after congressman ... had been shot by that Bernie Sanders supporters so you know she really doesn't seem to be able to temper her rhetoric whatsoever and I think if you saw on Monday after the backlash of putting that video out\nA and she got a lot of backlash around the country including Democrats like David Axelrod even was critical or she went on a twenty six I Believe tweet a rant about Donald Trump just obsessed with Donald Trump and has no focus at whatsoever on Massachusetts and what's important here whereas a you know I've been a legislator here for eight years I've actually\nPut two billion dollars in tax cuts back in people's pockets and they know it and we've been campaigning pretty strongly I think that again you're going to be pleasantly surprised in November six with what happens\nIs that I Hope so are you may not notice about my background but I live five years in Rhode Island ah in Warren Rhode Island not far from ...\nBorders with Massachusetts and you know I spent a lot of time this is by the way when it was the greatest NBA time in history with magic versus Larry Bird and and parish McHale I'm DJ and Danny Ainge I mean it was probably one of the best teams in one of the best rivalries ever in sports ... annual\nHall been up I've been to Boston to lots of beautiful city but I Will tell you that you know if the people of Massachusetts don't see through this I don't know what to tell them\nWhat looked Steve grow in the former quarterback probably around the time you were there is not enjoy my race that Kurt shellings indoors but most importantly\nUnderway rarely home ready he needs to indoors [laughter] only need to get that ...\nIs the most hated man except for the New England he's the most hated man in football number one because he's a phenomenal football player and they just don't like the fact that he wins that much and they don't like the fact that they as you know a pretty wide who used to be a model they just hate him for it\nRight well look at you know ... a lot has changed since you've been here unemployment is now at the lowest we've seen in New England in Massachusetts since Nineteen sixty nine that's that's for the whole country but Massachusetts is even lower it said three point five percent right now warring wants to repeal the tax cuts of two thousand Seventeen that have given our state more money as far as new jobs\nWage increases our states collected over one point two billion dollars in unanticipated revenue because of that she called the crumbs just like a Nancy Pelosi and she if she had her way would undo that\nAnd raise your taxes I think she said fifty percent would be the baseline and she's not sure if she had Ninety percent might be too much when she was on ah MSNBC a few weeks ago Ninety percent maybe too much but at least fifty percent and then of course she wants to make it fully government run health care which as we know has a thirty six trillion dollar\nPrice tag attached to it and of course that puts a bureaucrat between you and your doctor or if you like government run health care that you love having a you know to wait for a hip replacement Canadian Stewart dialysis like people\nAre so many Canadians come to the United states when they need heart surgery but does that give better care that they're willing to pay for here that's why\nLike government has to ration health care if they take it over and by the way there is no incentive to drive down costs ones government becomes the guaranteed pay or just like student loans you know it was a bit worn complains about the cost of college course she\nCharged three hundred and fifty thousand dollars to teach one course at Harvard or that you know the fact is when government becomes the ... of the loans or whether it's a student just salts or not doesn't matter those\nColleges get their money and so they drive the ... year after year after year when government gets involved and takes the free market out of it was competitiveness then that's when costs become completely out of control for us the average Americans\nWell I Wish you the best in this race and I hope our friends of Massachusetts in Boston and everywhere in between will pay attention to\nYou know the big lie of Elizabeth Warren and understand what a real true ambitions are here over her to become president you got to re elect her and Jeff deal is offering a better economic vision and better security for the people of Massachusetts and I wish you well an eraser\nThanks Sean if people want to get involved it's not too late deal for Senate dot com da da da da da da da\nDe la lecture and they just promised me won't
