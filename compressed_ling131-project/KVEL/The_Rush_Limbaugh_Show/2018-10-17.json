have access Trump stops in talks to them wherever he sees a pack of them gathered\nNow he may not accept every interview request which they would define as as access but they cannot say that Trump is hiding from them like Obama did an Obama wasn't hiding he just thought the media wasn't much pack rats but he didn't he didn't want it to send to their level I mean he knew they were on his side\nWe look at Florida you look at Donovan in Staten Island he was losing by ten points I endorsed him he won I can give you a long list of names look at Georgia governor\nMany many races and I will say that we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact because I'm having they wouldn't say\nThat in the old days if you got the support of a president or if you got the

Trump tells a piece he won't accept blame of GOP loses house\nNow the eight people tell you well that's actually what he was saying no it isn't essentially you are miss quoting Donald Trump is not looking at himself as a negative at all he's not looking forward and seeing the need for excuses any pay\nHe thinks he's helping people he thinks he is helping secure victory but it's not even in his mind that they're going to lose and somebody's gonna blame him\nThis is why Trump never\nMisses an opportunity to talk to the media gets why he tweets\nOver and over and over again so now we got a

doing an awful lot of media\nUh anybody complain you drink too much media deal like it like it I like getting the point across I've heard you say many times that the economy isn't covered properly and it's not that the economy's not covered properly by the so called mainstream media and it isn't a we went up almost six hundred\nPoints yesterday and they didn't even have it on the major news you couldn't find it anywhere in the economy is doing probably better than it's ever done in history and they don't even talk about it and that's because they have their opinion and they'd like to keep their opinion going the way they have it they do not treat us fairly and therefore we do the news they all want me on the news so I can talk about myself\nAnd what about the your tweets and so for these people say we don't want any more tweets anybody ever tried to stop tweeting\nThe economy is doing probably better than it's ever done in history and they don't even talk about it and that's because they have their opinion and they'd like to keep their opinion going the way they have it they do not treat us fairly and therefore if I Do the news they owe me on the news so I can talk a little myself\nWhat about your tweets and so for these people say we don't want any more tweets anybody ever tried to tell you stopped waiting oh\nAnd I don't think I'd be talking to you if I did that that's a way of getting out the message look we're fake news everyone's sake and I'm not saying you and some of the people on Fox and I know of\nBut some of them but there's so much ... information being put at that's my only form of communicating really other than having a press conference every hour I don't go to wait and I caught social media would definitely getting the word I we have the greatest economy in the history of our country and it's not being reported\n\nAnd you'll hear people in the media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms\nWouldn't blow it releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of this is going to happen to one degree or another to second thing\nThis tells me is that Mueller himself is waiting to see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end\nThis because his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically his boss at the department of justice and to Congress and there is deciding whether or not that it is made public so if the Democrats do when the house\nThey're going to insist that Muller not conclude the investigate particularly if he hasn't found any commotion of Democrats when the house they're going to tell them what we got time man we can all the time in the world he did get\nWe don't need to report right now we already won the house and we didn't mean your reports so you\nKeep digging hint hint you keep dig until you find that proof ... meaning\nSince we're on the show you're not going to need any proof all you need to do is highly speculate that have happened we'll take care of the rest that's going to be the Democratic message if they win the house\nIf the Republicans when the house\nWhile there's a whole new ballgame in terms of what mother will do and how he will do it and whether evil and that wrap it up issue as report or not but there is no reason\nOther than political\nReasons there's no reason for smaller to say or for anybody to leak\nThat he's ready to deliver key findings\nNo reason to do that other than to have been used as\nA change agent in the upcoming midterms\nSpecifically Muller is close the rendering judgment on to the most explosive aspects of his inquiry into whether there were clear incidence of commotion between Russia and from\n[laughter] believe me that one of the lead long ago there isn't any of that and the second thing is whether the president's talking the actions that comes to the obstruction of justice\n\nAnd Bloomberg goes on to say some things that make it look like they're pretending that there's even more being investigated besides collusion an obstruction but there is and\nThen they say there's the question of timing is critical mothers work won't be concluded a head of the mid term elections when Democrats hope to take control the house\nAnd and Trump's one party hold on Washington but this time line raises questions about the future of the pro it sells ... single he may replace Jeff Sessions after the election a move that could bring in a new boss for smaller Rosenstein my also resign or be fired by Trump after the election but you notice here\nMueller's work won't be concluded I haven't I've ever six mid term elections when Democrats hope to take control that not every news stories written from the perspective of if you had done the Democrats\n\nOther words what was his work won't be concluded ahead of the November six mid term elections when Republicans could maintain control about no one ever think of writing that\nThis is out there to create the\nIllusion that Mueller has been gardens and it's only a matter of time before the world is officially told at Trump loaded that's what they hope to create with this and the media will be helping and it will all the impact votes\nAnd again if there was done to be this gigantic blue wave that was not in doubt why would any of this will be necessary let me take a break

much Raj I'm just an old white man that here in Huntsville, Alabama who shut up\nThat you won't ... well yeah and so you're you're demonstrating your your arrogant white privilege here\n[noise] [noise] yes I Am a [laughter]\nReally a a ... with me through the uh the article from\nI Believe it was ... that ah ah that they're going to release the mall or a report or sometimes after the election we're ready to that yeah\nUnderstand that we don't believe that we're not going to believe anything Mohler says anyway now that's an interesting point too I mean a lot of the ... or ... implicate or the or\nAn Obama administration and Hillary Clinton and the DNC or in a a this address the gay shouldn't including with Russia which they evidently did then you know we're not going to believe anything that report says the [noise]\nUh I I I just don't understand it the drop by media just doesn't get it they're not gonna feel was people that voted for Donald Trump away from Donald Trump\nSaid I Want to understand it's like a you know the magnificent seven uh both guys really you know when it came up there and they didn't check into who they ... what kind of Christians were or or uh you know if they are\nNot lived or a good life they wanted somebody did offend them and fight against all the things that we see a which have destroyed the country of the last uh eight to ah ah sixteen years\nWell I don't think that the media is right now focused on separating Trump from his voters I think they they know that's too late I don't think that's what their objective here in the midterms is\nUm I think they're very frustrated they haven't been able to and if they could be it would the icing on the cake but I think their primary objective now is to flood the zone with anti Trump voters\nDemocrats made up of every disparate coalition group you can find they are trying to assemble this gigantic Democrat Party that is a combination coalition of minority here minority that just constant Adam altogether and get a big majority party and that's that's where they're trying to generate the turnout\nUm\nBecause they know they're not going to distance from from uh from his voters so the the focus I think is on ... up a first time participation um and that's why this this is Suzie as the\nThing is so important and the inspiration stuff in the anger is so that's why I think that they have strategic may become the party of anger I think they are using this anger and they were exploiting it to generate turnout\nBased on what they think is the majority of Americans that hate ...\nI I think they do move past the idea that there's a bunch of Trump voters that regret it and can be inspired to show up and vote Democrat as I say if they could make that happen to be icing on the cake\nI think you can see the frustration in them every day you can see the frustration in perusing the news as I Do\nMore and more stories that are starving to raise red flags about the blue wave\nAnd their summit rushed them falling for doing this on purpose or sucking you when they're making you think they're giving up they're making you think they're trying to despair either trying to make you think you got it in a bag no they're not gonna ever pull\nThat off not here not with me\nBut I don't think that's the case either I I don't think that they are I Would have that much discipline to be able to have media wide threw out the entire left wing media universe\nA disciplined approach to run fake stories about the blue wave not happening I think it's a legit\nI've never I've never believed there was going to be a blue wave\nI never have\nI'm willing to put that out there and that if if I ended up being wrong Soviet\nI'm not afraid of being\nWrong it doesn't happen enough times for me to be worried about it but it's this I have never thought because common sense does not suggest that like I said yesterday where is the evidence that Democrats\nHaven't been able to put together a winning coalitions and flooded the elections in when outside of areas they dominate like New York Los Angeles San Francisco Chicago they had been losing elections they had been losing seats left and right starting in two thousand ten that hasn't reversed\nThey didn't win with the cabinet thing they haven't won with anything trying to get rid of Trump they haven't been able to stop Trump on even they're stupid travel uh order the layers using the judge is Trump is succeeding implementing his agenda there's some things he hasn't been able to do you have like the total repeal of Obamacare\nBut they had not been able to give you you would think if all of these things were true of people hate Trump regret their votes a wish it had never happened regret that Trump is President Trump wouldn't be getting anywhere near done what he's getting done there'd be universal opposition to it if the Democrats are right about all\nThis but they're not write about it but I I\nThe evidence on the ground isn't there that there is a blue wave waiting to happen there is evidence all over the place the Democrats are Ross didn't fit to be tied over the fact that they're losing\nAnd then you couple that with their their mentality but says winning is their birthright power is their birthright their entitlements but\nElections hadn't been going their way you know world stopped to think if all of this that they're saying is true Hillary what a one in the first Trump wanted never only one in the first place you have all this talk of a blue wave right now is true\n\nThey thought they had it in the bag in two thousand sixteen and they were revved an energized too that were there wasn't any talk of Democrats not turning out back then anyway I'm a little long segments going to be short\nAll of us know about it in the paper tomorrow Raj Shah ... be meant workers Rush Limbaugh on news talk have [noise] you know\nWhen you put a safe in your home what
