forth and make it fair and the if it is it's gotten to the point now where fairness here so far out the window\nIt is actually true that the wealthiest one thousand to forty nine\nTax payers individuals' pay more in actual tax money revenue\nForget percentages they pay more in taxes\nThan the bottom Seventy percent of taxpayers I ... I misspoke when I said Seventy percent of the population because of course not everybody in the population pays income taxes but of those who do the the top\nOne thousand forty nine taxpayers pay more money\nThan the bottom Seventy percent of taxpayers combined the top\nThree percent of us taxpayers\nPaid\nPractically Ninety percent of all taxes in two thousand sixteen individual income taxes or the federal government's single biggest revenue source in fiscal year\nTwo thousand eight team which ended September thirtieth the individual income tax is expected to bring in one point seven trillion dollars\nThat is about half\nOf all federal federal revenues and that's according to the congressional budget office\nNow if past statistics can offer any guidance in two thousand sixteen\nOne point for four trillion dollars in income taxes were paid by one hundred and forty\nNine million taxpayers\nReporting a total of ten point two trillion dollars in adjusted gross income\nAnd Trump does not back down from it and even as I say for writing magazine was stunned that Trump got away with dominating even with these questions a couple of more before the break up next she says do you think that climate change is a hoax\nI think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um I don't want to give trillions in trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs\nI don't want to be put in a disadvantage I Wish you can go to Greenland\nWatch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean raising the sea level and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know\nExactly and you don't know that it doesn't happen all the time anyway you don't know when it started you don't want to and then you don't know how natural it might be\nAnd watch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the ocean raising the sea level and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know\nExactly and you don't know that it doesn't happen all the time anyway you don't know when it started you know no one in and did you don't know how natural it might be\nBut did you hear her say that the chunks of ice forming into the ocean or raising sea levels I remember one time on this program way way back in the nineties discussing that in fact there are two things\nThe first I pointed out because I read it and the Heritage Foundation a action to report that this was during the spotted owl earth first\nA natural forest station\nControversy and it was all part of a global warming craze in the early nineties and I pointed out\nThat there were more acreage there was a more acreage of treat their more trees in America then in Nineteen Ninety ... at our founding\nThe left we're fatty they said I was insane that couldn't possibly be true that we had come along and we and chopped down trees and we haven't replaced them to make things out of the trees and they thought I was just insane I\nPointed out you people misunderstand something yeah we cut down a lot of trees but you know what we plan for trees this is the wood industry they need what right how do you get what you have to grow trees\nIt's not a finite resource and for every three to cut down for new ones are planted it's part of the policy warehouse there is one of the big companies that was doing this they wouldn't they wouldn't listen to it that didn't compute they couldn't begin to fathom that\nThey couldn't understand anybody seriously claim more trees more forest more forested acreage in Nineteen Ninety two than it was in the Seventeen hundreds\nDidn't make sense to them because they don't understand capitalism or economics everything than zero sum game if a company came along and dropped out a bunch of three years to build a bunch of houses or whatever and and that's that was trees that were gone forever why they don't want your cutting down the redwoods that ever come back you know\nI'm the same token I remember saying it's still true today there was another report just last week that there are more trees forested\nAcres in America today than there were even fifty years ago the second one was when when I um when I pointed out\nThat are falling ice\nFrom a glacier or light green them is going to raise the sea level rise and it's like ice in a glass melting I said it's not going to raise the sea levels I said those ice cubes\nBeing jumped into the ocean and not going to raise your crazy it's crazy it's ... you know what you're talking about of course it's going to raise you\nKnow it doesn't get a glass eyes and for some water filled up Philip Glass an ice put as much as you can fill up with water actually going to melt you tell me what the glass overflow\n... well not\nThe ... is the volume a bunch of ice chunks\nFalling off a glacier are in no way capable of raising sea levels it's too massive it's too big but it's all about that but you know what your throat where you're not a scientist you can't see this\n\nTrump is right to say we don't know if it's natural or not but we sure as hell and not the ones causing it if somebody gave you the order okay you need to make ten percent of Greenland melting and have the ice follow the what would you do to make that happen to think about what\nWould you would rush is always at work and the he ivy never closes Fifteen hours a week here

your Thursday or friday show last week you were you were speaking about that movie so I decided to go check it out\nThat would be friday I was yes yes\nYes so I got a moment after work I raced over to the theater I I I watched it over there but um [noise] I wanted to I I I just want to portray how ... and it was is they were very very powerful movie and to illustrate that I just want to share the experience of what happened after the movie\nI'm normally when you go to a movie theater you watch a movie and then the the credit start rolling in the music playing and you see people they they start getting up and filing out of the theater and they're talking to each other and stuff\nBut this did not happen at the end of the movie guys now\nAfter that after the movie was over the the credits began to roll and the music played and and after after a while all all the credits finished and the music stopped and everybody was still seated\nOkay I Need to ask you this because there's one thing about this I I'm I made a calculation when I was talking about those on friday to not mentioned something about this movie because I I did not want to frighten people or deter them from going to see it\nOh we've got what but what what I'm not asking you to identify that but what if anything surprise you that you didn't know or just just surprised you period even if you think you didn't know what about the movie what did you learn you didn't\nSomething about this movie because I did not want to frighten people or deter them from going to see it oh\nWe've got what but but what I'm not asking you know identify that but what if anything surprise you that you didn't know or just just surprised you period even if you think you didn't know what about the movie what did you learn you didn't know\n[noise] well I I didn't know about who Mr guys now was on my ... I was not familiar with the case or anything like that um but that wasn't that wasn't really the the the powerful peace about it but I guess the\nThe\nWhat what made it what made everybody if they were all feeling like me and all sitting down and not moving after the movie was over ... was it was it was about an abortion doctor yes but this this was a movie about a murder trial\nAnd but during the murder trial the um there there were two there were there were two things that were portrayed in one was just the ... of what happens in those clinics but even more than that\nWas was that the why what was the barbarian eight of what happened in the clinic\nOh the bar verity of what happens in an abortion clinic when\nNo no in God's nails in God's nails clinic what happened what was the\nOh that uh that he was he was allowing babies to be born and then after they were born Danny would kill\nExactly that is the vast majority this is why he's called the biggest serial killer in American history God's now killed most of the babies after they were born alive and he did it by sniffing they're spinal cords scissors now I didn't save is on friday\nI didn't say this on friday about gods now about what he did because I didn't want to frighten people away\nIt's not\nAs you I had to struggle to get this out of you so it's not something that jumps out at you when you watch the way he's right it is about primarily a trial I made the point of saying that Nick Searcy who's the director\nLets the story tell itself there aren't any exaggerating computer generated graphics there there's not a lot of\nA special effect a real or computer generated in order to shock because of the story tells itself the numbers\nOf children born alive killed by this man is stunning and shock it then you realize that the mainstream media never even covered the trial much less money or not and they've always done their best to suppress it\nIt was nearly impossible to get this movie made precisely because of what yet revealed\nHollywood doesn't want this movie made the actors in this movie were risking their future career as my taking roles people like Nick Searcy who um a is a ... and across the board actor he can take the lead they can take a supporting role he can take or\nWhatever you want he chose to direct this movie and all of these people in one way or another we're risking something major by tackling ... and doing it they couldn't find funding people that run the Gulf funding pages would not allow\nAny kind of public funding for the production costs a Facebook Twitter I don't know specifically which one did they wouldn't allow any\nWas Facebook would not allow any kind of a promotion reference or fundraising for this at all is actually kind of a lot of was the amazing miraculous buddy if it was it was a lot of hard work at a lot of time\nTo get this movie made but\nAnd it was a real challenge for him I how how difficult is it\nTo focus on the fact that this ... did his murderous work outside the home he did his share of of uh of abortions in the world but the numbers of born alive that this man murdered\nIt's just something you know everybody thinks late term abortion is bad and by the way this kind of abortion and it's called an abortion if you if it's\nGot a term I'm having a mental block and with the term of this is but in Illinois and so forth when when the procedure came up a bill was sponsored to stop this I think it was a rock Obama who refused to support\nIt the left will not support any limits whatsoever on whatever is called an abortion and the the the the the the thing that left just tried to do\nIn countering this movie is to say well well if you want more God's know then you go hunting overturn roe versus Wade they tried to say God's now was doing\nWhat he was doing because women had no other choice they couldn't go anywhere to get\nThat's a flat out why by the way guys know clinic if you will none of the none of the year was sterilize people\nWere getting sick and infected with it just it was a big stars in Philadelphia but\nI didn't focus on that on purpose because I didn't want the ... because you don't\nSee it that's my point they don't graphically try to make their point they focus on the murder trial but good going\nOut there John I'm sure he was he was getting sweating of nervous out there what does
