anything but a white now\nHistorically life wasn't better for you than it is and the current moment is sounding alley that that's the same template and even if the president was saying this was just supposed to be a lunch that's an outright lie I most of the White House myself several days ago\nAnd I said I don't like that you know unpredictable contests and they said just last summer we this was absolutely a press I went\nDown the way you would think actually a meeting between the president Kanye West your browser by the way Kanye West said or blacks really like you get caught up in the idea of racism over the idea of industry his comment to a white police brutality is to release the love\nOr any of that there should be in Chicago easy id Asian centers that's\nGoing to have the fat which is a the namesake of his ... said that ... that sentiment is what ... the balls to go for it and make so much money generally the gate as I'm just stunned across the board you\nKnow we're gonna have a because I thought they were going to have a conversation which we would follow up on 'em in part on criminal justice reform sentencing and prisons which is by the way a bipartisan really important idea a there was that was mostly nonsense\nThat was mostly nonsense because that man a white man was conservative\n\nThat was an assault on our White House immediately after county way us in the oval office wow\nThat was bonkers if you thought you were going to get a thoughtful way by playing political analysis you're not when we knew that you guys are missing\nMe see ... because that was an

mark of in Chauvin burgers and filming in Iowa\nHave then how's it going doing well how are you\nDoing good [laughter] I just wanted to say that I'm as a as a black woman a young black woman I Am so incredibly proud of Kanye West\nHe's speaking for the people like myself who are the the super silent majority right I mean there's like\n... eight percent of us or something crazy and and I think that there's more out there and I think that we're winning we're actually winning that's why the left is going but there are that's why the\nThe mainstream media is going bonkers as they called him because they know that if we get just a few percentage points more of the black vote it's over for him it doesn't matter what they can say whatever they want to say they will keep pushing that\nThat racist talking point that the Republicans are racist but people like myself are waking up and I'll tell you something that I'm thirty three years old I was born and raised a lifelong Democrat I was a liberal I was an idiot okay I ate up all of that crap\nThat they fed me my whole life which was that you know I couldn't get ahead that I Would never be treated equally I never felt more ... than when

of that crap\nThey fed me my whole life which was that you know I couldn't get ahead that I Would never be treated equally I never felt more love then when I went to south haven Mississippi and I went to a Trump rally and I wore that make America great again hats and I totally\nYour uncle's home now you you need to go to a mental hospital you need to go to a mental hospital right away\nRight well I'll tell you what you know what a mental hospital is better than the Democrat plantation and you know what they look how quickly they turn on you when you don't agree with what they say and the sad thing about it is is that the car sellers what's really sad as he uses a slate\nHe's the person that they put up there to lie to all of us for their vote\nOh I Know that I think I think he's a leader in the Democratic party because he's able to marginalize until white people that they can't you can't disagree with the Democratic party or you are going to be an Uncle Tom and if you're not going to be accepted in your community is you're not going to be accepted in your church not going to accept and your neighborhoods\nBut then on top and the more and more black people on getting\nOut there and I'm saying things I'm Talking to people and people are starting to wake up it little by little and you kinda have to probe them and ask them questions and things like that but people are starting to say Trump not that bad he's not the racist that people keep lying and saying that he is\nYou you oughta you ought to look at you you ought to look at it that this just my scrolling down my Twitter feed right now of people that are listening to the show tonight who were telling me that they actually believe that Kanye West should be in a mental hospital ... mental health shaming someone\nThe day

they're they're bought and paid and they're on their their brainwashing people twenty four hours a day and in fact the matter is look at the black community oh you have to do it open your eyes and see I live in Memphis, Tennessee\nRun by Democrats and it's from that\nAnd you know go to every single Democrat city black people have\nGot to wake up they've don't wake up and say well if you ... and for us to continue to vote\nFor one party and makes no sense on planet earth when that party has done nothing for your school system is done nothing for the prison system it's done nothing for bothers the lack of fathers and the homeless welfare state and and people are going to eventually wake up and they'll look around and say that the party has never done anything for me\nAnd what I did that I'll

think on your point\nSee far we've come to think about this for a moment George Bush doesn't like black people if we take a look at prosperity and the unemployment rate rub your father hated black people would that go with Donald Trump Donald Trump loves black people\nI mean even county that man is though\nYou know who else Donald Trump was\nDonald Trump gloves women you know George Bush like\nWomen we take a look at unemployment rate that go to the economy and he liked woman rocket momma oh sure I I I think I I don't think broader bomber like one\nBut Donald Trump Donald Trump loves women\nI'm Still talking about the economy and unemployment rate ... mud or in for Marco then let's talk about the things real quick uh this is kind of important in the context of these conversations while the media wants to make it all about how much the profanity Kanye West what is done you pointed out\nWas blowing it out\nThat uh hey you know from an economic standpoint what's most important important that people are lifted up that they have opportunity oh okay so where have we have the most opportunity\nFor black adults will shoot that's Donald Trump here or all of the demographics\nThat are experiencing record low unemployment rates this year\nYes black adult women Hispanics\nBorn born adults and even Native Americans\nIn fact if we weren't going to find a girl that Donald Trump doesn't like the Donald Trump doesn't well apparently Donald Trump doesn't like why people\nAnd in Hispanics born born adults and even Native Americans\nIn fact if we weren't going to find a grow that Donald Trump doesn't like the Donald Trump doesn't well apparently Donald Trump doesn't like why people\nGeorge Bush doesn't like black people but Donald Trump he doesn't like why people think about the only place that record ... right now\nHuh oh that happened now\nBeing that you are probably more ... than the average person out there you know how the game has always been played Democrat politics or what their identity politics they're meant to divide they're meant to cause friction division they're meant also importantly to do what he people down\nWhat we've seen every time people get an opportunity\nWell that is an opportunity to open their mind remember talking about just a few minutes ago sliding scale morality but also finding people who are open minded now historically we've seen well over Ninety percent\nOf black adults vote for Democrats\nNow when it with any group of people we ever agree Ninety percent of the time\nWell why is it that for decades now we've had black adults that were breaking Ninety percent plus it's time for Democrats no open mindedness no division of thought\nBuying into the identity politics but nothing ever changed\nAnd we see that we're still the country where a man\nFrom the poor neighborhood in the country can go on to become the most renowned neurosurgeon in the world and by the way be part of the Trump Administration and a Republican and now we see that one of the top entertainers in the world self made near billionaire\nCan also like Donald Trump and be a Republican and that is the problem because that is where the Democrats get exposed as soon as there's an opportunity for diversity of thought and that comes through opportunity\nAnd the one thing if we take a look at George W. Bush\nAt the administration at the politics of use as\nUsual at that time we didn't see the inner cities being lifted up what Donald Trump run on what any campaign on the inner city we're going to let them up\nLow minority unemployment rate it's real it's happening George Bush might not have like white people but Donald Trump like people telling us less Donald Trump rye mud ever the great one mark a little bit [noise]\nHave you ever thought about the word education will it means to lead for the the word fourth raises another question which way is fourth\nHow do you know you're going in the right direction easy answer is it just depends on which way you want to go well my friend Dr Larry on President of Hillsdale College says young people almost always say that\nAnd that they've been taught to say that but you and I both know that's the wrong answer let me tell you about a place that leads fourth Hillsdale College\nThe economy was good in the early part of the two thousands why didn't we have a record low black unemployment the\nBronco bomb I mean come on now while I of course open change when it was a bunch of bull crap what I mean he he cares about black people right I mean come on look at them well yeah he he\nCares about having their boat which means you need to keep all my government assistance keeping the economy that's mediocre keeping the economy that will not allow people tablet Ford mobility whom you've gone right where you need all okay so now we have Donald Trump we have record low minority unemployment rates across the board\nAnd what do you say you see somebody like John Yang who obviously is not an ideologue God he was not a Republican\nAt least not traditionally somebody who thinks that George Bush doesn't like black people but somebody who loves Donald Trump you see what goes on there and you see why the media and the leftist are so scared of this man because he did what couldn't be done\nHe made a difference in acting policy they gave people a chance and that means that you create open minds that means that when you hear that wow Donald Trump's approval rating among black adults is in double digits all the sudden\nThat could be enough that could be enough let's go to Nancy\nThe difference in acting policy they gave people a chance and that means that you create open minds that means that when you hear that wow Donald Trump's approval rating among black adults is in double digits all the sudden\nThat could be an ... that could be enough\nLet's go to Nancy in Indiana Nancy go\nHi this is Nancy from evidence DNA and I am so happy to talk to you but you're talking about a moral sliding moral compass Andrea Democrat\nYeah so you you got this scale morality we're all somewhere on that scale between one and two\nRight but you gotta have morals to be on it [laughter]\nOkay I uh I guess I see where you're coming from a appreciate the man see [laughter] All right let's go to Don and New Jersey Don go\nUp in a fight when Tropicana and Daniel ... on ... what was the captain says corruption pure you're trying to tell the last few minutes a timeline them out says I can hold you encountered slicks month whatever way to hold you for three hundred years on our trucks on strike and your jury after you're sort of a recording to\nAsk for ten grand\nAnd then they'll fight or a picture of a hand over a drink caption priest's I met her translation is in the back of a woman or exploited it's not a choice children are forced to pay\nAttention to ever written word trigger off the codes were uh all the other lines\nAre hyper aggressive hardcore gangster they dictate what you're saying I mean is what do you come and knock on doors everything okay or or confine says although orchard together with very little chance it won't be able to interact with each other I Need protection ... desire for of his\nInfluence how they get\nSo when I bring these tapes to the prosecutor I recorded him say okay we're going to require down the street that we're going to pull you over I recorded back it's like oh it's captured or you can hear them call me you're not allowed to bring those tapes down quick track\nAnd you have to tell me where you've been with South Carolina to New Jersey and when you get the court said others of Chicago backdrop says after fleet or Brazil or when you order a psych exam\nAnd they helped me in the county six months and like I said I'm sitting here it's like this one says Chicago so I have a few that wants to hospital contract with guys trying to push them into my brain that's the contract\nSo is this is an interesting that you know it's kind of like a ... if the euro west of the Rockies\nDial a but I I Will and will take a look done uh and and I\nYou wish you well and and the sun is still morality I think you're dealing with some very amoral individuals I Would say that if we are talking on the scale of one to tend the folks that you are dealing with probably starting out around the U.S the way and and so I don't like your chances of ever getting very far with those folks but uh hey uh you know if we're now\nWe're going to try to find those folks who are at least at least you know five six is on our overall sliding scale morality it's by the way if you missed it at the onto the show it's got to my theme that I'm hanging things into today\nI like to say there are two sides to stories one side effects and you have the premise of the premise of anything is falls anything built upon it will fail to but they're also was a sliding scale of morality and similar on it\nWe exist and where we're at our best maybe we're good people when we're at our worst maybe we're not quite as good but the differences are we've somebody who will end up hurting others what we see in today's world we got a lot of folks that are willing to hurt others and we have a whole political party right now that is willing to do that as well\nAnd a lot of that happen through misinformation so let's talk about the employment situation again for a second record low unemployment for minorities\nBlack unemployment rate at all time lives\nIn somewhere along the way you have Donald Trump that brings out the best and many of these minority communities you have somebody who actually sat down with Kim ... which many of us were skeptical about at the onset and something constructive came out of it\nNow you have gone yeah west who goes into the oval office and\nSomething constructive might come out of it\nBut more to the point the more open minds we have in this country the better the employment picture\nFor minorities the more opportunity not only politically that comes with it\nBut the better the opportunity for the entire country open minds\nEqual better opportunities and a better chance for a more moral nation because if we had here to pull politics and the people that start out on that sliding scale of morality from a really negative place\nWhere are we going to be taken for the people who wanted to believe for example Christine Ford and Chuck Schumer who said he believes her Dianne Feinstein who believes her people believe them\nSo you had people that started down that sliding scale morality and an amoral place and have taken their politics and those folks left with them\nThat's not good Donald Trump taking hold minority communities including black adults women Hispanics\nEven Native Americans to new heights economically that they had never seen before dance the jade and change it and that's the difference and that's the irony of Donald Trump\nWho in his own personal life maybe not the most moral man fine and the grand scheme of sliding scale morality\nWhat politician has kept more promises inside of two years then that man that always told me that the there are two kinds of people you got people who will tell you something and you can't believe it and you got people who will tell you something and you can take it to the bank\nWhen Donald Trump says something he can pretty much take it to the bank I'm Brian mud in for the gray one month over him\nMuch\nFor years I've been sleeping on my Casper mattress\nI take it over
