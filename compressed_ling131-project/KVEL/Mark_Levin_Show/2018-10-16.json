Massachusetts Senate race what happened what happened in Massachusetts once upon a time not all that long ago there were some simple it's a primary to Elizabeth Warren in at this point I here's a question\nJeff deal the Republican and does what he says but really about average somewhere in the neighborhood about twenty five points\nThis tiny chance that be backfires enough to move the needle even reasonably\nJeff I ended up calling today and Elizabeth Warren to drop out on the back of her being Pocahontas in her entire test backfiring on her quite spectacularly but you take a look and I mean not to project anything on to the good folks with questionable voting habits in Massachusetts right now\nBut I take a look at at New Jersey we gotta Sen Menendez he he still leading in the ... what happened what does it take you actually have to be inside of a jail cell before\nYou'll not be voted for your demographic Massachusetts or er Jersey or what happened to be come on now they got to be some senseless in there somewhere so anyway ah Geoff Diehl everybody chips and gay because for many including potentially with some folks and Massachusetts might be the first time you've even heard the guy's name but he's trying to give 'em credit\nBy the way I Am by muddy inform article that gets me at Brian my radio and talking about the fund that the president has had on back of Elizabeth Warren's botched rollout a protest proving\nThat those high cheekbones she talked about really had something to do it at president out today that Pocahontas the bad version\nSometimes referred to as Elizabeth Warren\nIt's getting slant she took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be one and one thousand and twenty four\nAnd India is what he's referring to there far less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her DNA tested useless even they don't water quality\nAnd he continued you went down there he had a lot of fun just worried that now that her claims of being in the end of the Indian heritage have turned out to be a scam an ally\nElizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetuating this brought against the American public\nHarvard called her a person of color amazing God would not have taken her otherwise and again this is the important point here we're talking about the Elizabeth Warren deal is not just oh it's another politician alight it's not bad

as a Caucasian\nShe made sure that she was always referred to and had it would have changed that she was Native American or a person of color [laughter] name is Lee seriously\nBut in the end the president wants to he said thank you to the Cherokee Nation for revealing that Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to as Pocahontas\nYou can just see him in and hear him saying that to gang is a complete and total fraud and again you don't have to listen to me you don't have to listen to the president United States all you have to do take it straight to try that she claims to be part of a toss\nUp for her to rally back from that one way the the president in terms of choice holy cow you had all kinds of moments today including moments in with a story Daniel\nNow to be ready for it to us I guess for space\nThat that happened today but uh we we have a bunch of other stuff obviously it's been going on in the news including the Saudi Arabians situation will be discussing that a little bit later in the show we have the oh by the way Honduran caravan parts whenever this as three point O.\nBad is on its way here and this was a really cool thing president when you know\nUnited States has strongly and for the president upon doors that at the large care of and uh people heading to the U. S. is not stopped and brought back to endorse no more money or aid will be given to Honduras affected immediately well thank you this is the one thing I've never understood about foreign aid\nWhy is it that we give foreign aid to countries this girl is over and over and over again and again why north we give them a billion and a half bucks per year\nAre we giving a building that\nBut not a hundred and government for so they take it and then send their people out to try to cross the border\nUnreal but anyway president paying attention and if he does stop the aid of step one to recovery and when you're being victimized I Am Brian mud and for the great one Margot there [noise]\nAre you worried your identity can be held hostage you should be because ransomware does exactly that this is Tom Kelly studio a biology care making every American safer from the effect divide it up as a tall order but that's my goal so here's it to the best thing you can do to help protect yourself around some where\nIs the backup your computer often if you have questions about identity theft and even if you're struggling with fraud today my I Do care can help\nGet Fifteen Percent off at my id care dot com plants mark my id care dot com Ross mark\nSo I wouldn't know but I'm guessing there's not enough dope in the world to have that math makes sense so anyway let's go to Joshua in D.C the great W.

twenty fours a bit of Native American and were conservative she's like one hundred fifty six\nNative American I mean I'm probably one thousand twenty four so it's\nLike every race that there is I like the the thing that really frustrates me as a as a young young thinking person is white cat or these politicians make their careers based on their own merit on their own talent on their own wisdom or their connection with the people and how to solve issues and stuff it it's pretty annoying\nGod Bless you that this is the first time you've gone through a name\nAmen brother [laughter] this is one of my my all time favorite calls quite honestly or is it Twenty one years of doing radio this is the moment that makes my heart saying you're twenty two year in science and you're in Washington DC and you're making political sense\nHow does that happen in and do you have any friends\nI there are plenty of friends or where there's a small revolution ah but ah I'm I have to get a lot of credit and my parents you know a lot of money\nAnd not just to frustrate you need more or the word pedigree is actually a like a technical term that we use in genetics and it's because the people don't really see the difference between our animal than people in\nSame thing so there were you pedigree for people and animals\nBut uh uh I have to get a lot of credit and my parents you know a lot of knee and not just to frustrate you need more ah the word pedigree\nIs actually a like a technical term that we use in genetics or because people don't really see the difference between our number than people that I think so there were you pedigree for people and animals\nReminds me of a ... dog you and me baby and nothing but anyway uh that amazing Josh I mean really\nA longer view and spread your wisdom to as many people as possible lord knows we could use it they're a great call critical All right let's go to a Peter and Illinois All right Peter I uh uh it's a tough act to follow so you've got to up your game that was a pretty impressive call there\nWhen you were talking about the brain that voters in Massachusetts you have to remember that the the same people who after Teddy Kennedy left a woman the ground and the bottom of Chappaquiddick reelected him six times back to the United States Senate [laughter]\nYou raise a very important and interesting point in fact the only thing that he did get caught disqualified problem was a well ultimately his presidential bid at that point and you're right if you could also going to get away with Chappaquiddick and you still get reelected in Massachusetts\nAh you know what I ... that is uh that that is an excellent point which by the way that that whole thing and they and it's fascinating by the way every now and then uh because of the last name people will think that\nUh because I'm In broadcasting I Am directly related to the person who helped break that story one Roger Mudd back then and I'm not I'm not a is somewhere in the very ah outer lying to a bar or a genetic suburbs had a great you might say there would be a some overlap but actually\nI Am a more aligned with them for me a ... there is one infamous member of the the family that I Am directly related to him that would be Dr Samuel but\nWho may be familiar was one of the uh co conspirators in the assassination of Lincoln he was a doctor actually fix the flag and ended up having a whole kind of interesting deal where he went to the door to goes and\n... that's the story for a different day but anyway that is my relation not Roger Mudd who broke Chappaquiddick which by the way it's kind of interesting people thought after that\nOh Roger must be the best Republican guys now\n... both signed up to this day he's still a Democrat it's just that he was doing his job imagine that I think he actually had some people in the news business that did their job\nAnd it got like you know yeah yeah the Kennedy was running against a quarter their\nCaptain peanut good old friendships that was my nickname for him or in in Georgia by the way from suburban Atlanta so a nickname was always kept in being in fact one of my favorite parodies from many years ago was I remember the ... and ... enjoy commercials\nYou know sometimes you feel like an egg I kind of had some ... he's like that you know sometimes you feel like and that sometimes you are one you know in the plenty of Jimmy Carter is that you could throw in there so anyway it's just a as an aside but yeah so that cleared the path for Jimmy Carter\nTo want to win the nomination again for the Democrats and get his butt whipped by one Ronald Reagan so ... was happily ever after for the country now so heavily at ever after for Massachusetts or for the United States Senate\nAh because to your point he continued to win time after time after time\nAll right so a couple of things here\nWhen we are taking like three weeks away from election day\nThere's a lot to keep in perspective and one of the things that I Will frequently pointed out you um have hurt me anywhere along the way you you've probably heard me say things like there are two sides to stories there one side to facts than to be pretty a\nParticular about the fact you know you don't get it's kinda like you know ... we're really not having a conversation about you being a Native American Elizabeth Warren because while you're not\nRight so you you can't you would that would embrace of false premise which then takes me to the premise that the premise of anything is false than anything built upon it is as well\nLast friday I introduce the sliding scale of morality which means that people always wonder how is it you don't have somebody who under best day seems like a pretty good person and then several underway wow they really are awful and they're stabbing you in the back in their line\nAnd and that's because you have some people that have the moral compass that is stronger than others you know let's say that on our best day where an eight out of a one through ten ten being perfect which none of us are plus urinate even at a bad day\nYou're probably not going to be worse than the five therefore when you're ... not going to go out of your way to hurt somebody else for your own personal benefit well then you bring it to somebody like ah\nOh I don't know Elizabeth Warren clearly clearly under sliding scale brownie one of us both warn\nPretty a moral person because she is willing to hurt somebody that's just that she's wanting to commit fraud it's that she is willing to hurt somebody for personal gain and once again not a victimless crime because somewhere\nMany times over all throughout her academic career throughout her professional career leading up to the time that she was the United states senator she took the thought of it actually Native American\nSo somebody did get hurt it's pretty moral on the sliding scale of morality that is the willingness to hurt somebody\nFor your own personal benefit ah so you put it all together two sides of stories one side effects the premise and the Saudis go morality we ought to only get is that yes Elizabeth Warren sometimes referred to was Pocahontas\nIs a bad person who is pretty amoral and again\nTwo sides to stories on side effects if you want to be the person who defends taking this a lot of the actual Native American\nAnd you can justify that not bringing on we'll have that conversation [laughter] and we can also talk to the Cherokee Nation as well because they have a few things to say about it will give the conversation non Brian mud in for the great one month over him\nNo\nI've had my share of mechanics calling me saying well they found something wrong that needs replacing when I've taken my car in front of oil change
