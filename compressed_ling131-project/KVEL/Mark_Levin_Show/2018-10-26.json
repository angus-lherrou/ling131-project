I think I think that whole performance was really beneficial for me I mean you know when you're running for governor mark obviously you know voters are going to look to see you know do they agree or gender or not and so I'm somebody who's running on keeping Florida low tax state he wants to massive pack\n\n... he's running saying that we should abolish ice and so there are different obviously Cheech policy differences but in the governor's race of instead of like a senator house race it's more than just about your position about leadership and who could actually do the job and I think his antics\nJust showed that he's not somebody that would be a good governor even apart from his radical left wing ideology so I think his whole performance backfired I think a lot of people that and then looked at me uh and they obviously now get a sense of my biography my service of the country um and I just take a day\nThat the easy decision that I'm just a better leader than go on\nOne of the things that's a very very troubling to me knowing you know for several years you lead the fight in the house of representatives to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital\nWhen nobody thought it would go anywhere you lead the fight in the house of representatives pressing for moving the American embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem you succeeded along with the president along with are are wonderful and bashed her Freeman\nAnd so forth and then for him and his party to suggest that you supported by neo Nazis when in fact are the biggest voice for the state of Israel in the United States House of representatives my jaw hit the floor\nWhile I I think it was so ridiculous that I think voters just\nWhack that off I mean give me a break and this was from a guy who actually opposes having our embassy in Jerusalem he opposes recognizing Jerusalem\nIsrael's capital and he's been endorsed by this radical left wing group dream defenders and he actually signed a pledge to the group\nSaying he would support this radical manifesto they are I'm In this group dream defenders wanted there remains a things is boycotting Israel vps\nThey say Israel had genocidal apartheid state so that's the group he stands with he will not just of Elvis group that that is who he is\nAnd I'm actually just today there was a group of we're thirty eight sheriff's\nIn Florida right give them a letter asking him to get the ... dream defenders because uh the pledge that Gillum signed a set that police and prisons have no place in justice they want to abolish\nUh basically traditional law enforcement get funded and then spend the money on welfare programs with very radical stuff it's dripping with hatred for men and women\nAre in law enforcement and it's just totally unacceptable and go I'm he will not budge or maybe you're sticking by that and and that's just unacceptable cross or yeah for him to say that I I think\nIt was um I think it was a total for hours and that's the thing voters are sicker\nPeople on the left or just lashing out like that I had strokes and and I think it really backfired big car [noise]\nYou know when you sign a petition you know you're putting your signature to it so there's no confusion any signs of petition in favor of boycotting Israel he signs of petition in favor of moving police officers outta prisons and\nMore than that as you pointed out but I don't think the moderator quite comprehended what you were saying\nYou're talking about he says abolish ice and move it under the Justice Department I don't know how that changes anything moving ice from one a building to another building as somebody who served as chief of staff to the attorney general his problem is he rejects law enforcement and your point was this\nOnce a criminal alien served time in a state prison in Florida\nThe doors open and they're either turned over to the feds who deport them or they come into your neighborhood and he supports that person going into your neighborhood and not being deported isn't that basically his position\nI asked them on Sunday night's debate of CNN will you honor\nA dictator request they're called ... when the federal government wants to take a criminal illegals coming on a program\nWhere you want to detain requests from Donald Trump's ice agency he would not say he would do that and so if you get to say oh I don't want criminals on the street with a ... quite a lot to cooperate with like this idea of of all he wants to do is move it under the Justice Department mark you know about him trying to backtrack office position\nYou know where he was running ads in the primary thing abolish I because they want open borders that's what the far left one\nAnd he was playing to the bay so the idea that all he wants to do with like a administrative tweak or he's lying when he says that he wants to abolish the agency because he doesn't want immigration enforcement\nBats dropped off as they should you know when he was running ads in the primary thing abolish I because they want to open borders ... or ... one\nAnd he was playing to the bay so the idea that all he wants to do with like a minister tweak or he's lying when he says that he wants to abolish the agent eight because he doesn't want immigration enforcement\nNow when we come back after the bottom of the hour run to scientists by the way what is your website Ron\nRon deep in the dot com\nOr we're going to put it up on my social sites ladies and gentlemen runs being big time outspent this guy's Soros behind him he's got ... behind them all the left wing billionaires and left wing groups they're targeting Florida they know if they take Florida it's going to be very difficult to win the presidency in the future and they're getting behind a true\nBernie Sanders George Soros people for the American way which is so he works for radical when we come back I Want to ask Ron descent and there's an FBI investigation that's been taking place in Tallahassee where this guy was mayor and Mr Guillen connection to it and there is a connection to it we'll be right back [noise]\n\nI mean I enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel whoever the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the Iraqi didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief\nSo he engaged them after my got the Irish to designate Nathaniel ... case has seat in the status currently not collectible that's a big win because it basically says\nNo use pursuing our client there's nothing to be gained here after my kept finding on Nathaniel may happen till the IRS agreed to a deal\nDid not put in that letter that Andrew is not a target he just said Andrew is not a subject so that to me is is a is an interesting er mission or because the bottom line is why\nWould they be investigating corruption in city hall if it had nothing to do with the mayor you wouldn't have had those FBI agents around him on these trips like they round\nAnd round as soon as he immediately tried to racialized this issue that the reason you were bringing it up and for that matter I guess a local media is bringing up is because of his race\nNow last time I checked it has nothing to do with somebody's race when there's an undercover agent giving somebody I'm of value to try and see if they'll take it any took it has nothing to do with race and I notice he tried to do this over and over and over again in this campaign let me ask you a question your running mate who is your running mate\nOr her name is Jeanette noon yeah she's a state representative from Miami\nShe's a Cuban American\nCuban American in and when we get elected she'll be the highest ranking a female Hispanic I'm a history of Florida government\nMhm I noticed the media doesn't talk much about that\nNow of course not but I'll tell you with Andrew lashing out like this I mean\nWhen you start talking about corruption people understand about black or white it's about right versus wrong and if you're using this office to feather your own death like answered did\nFor the massive problem it's interesting mark there wasn't just about the illegal stuff that he died when he was on the Tallahassee city commission or he did vote to raise property taxes on people but he also voted to increase his own retirement benefits by tens of thousands of dollars basically doubling 'cause hey\nAll right so he wanted the people that were happy to pay more and he wanted somebody to go directly into his pocket so he's always been a self dealing politician or whether ... whether it's legal votes like that which are corrupt anyways or illegal activity like accepting\nThe Hamilton ticket and turning around and giving these guys the deal they want it\nAnd he worked for this group people for American way is that correct\nYeah and here's the thing about that that's a very ultra liberal groups so if you look at people for the American way filing they say they pay Andrew Gillum Mrs ... mayor a hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year to work forty hours a week\nWell the mayor of Tallahassee is a fulltime job so how how was he working forty hours a week\nFor people for the American way so one of two things are true either he is actually doing that in which case the galactic that people have power happy which may explain why they had the highest number of murders and the history of the city last year and have one of the most or are they have the highest crime rate in Canada\nOr he ain't working forty hours a week and that's all just a fraud and he basically accepting money without performing services so what are the other uh is problematic no matter which way you\nKnow I'm a little confused when I met the nation is in the Floridians are too you can be mayor and have a side job with a group like people for the American way founded by Norman Lear at a Hollywood entering a hundred and forty thousand dollars on the side\nWell yeah I think that would be the question\nIn services so what are the other uh is problematic no matter which way you\nKnow I'm a little confused when I met the nation is in the Floridians are too you can be mayor and have a side job with a group like people for the American way founded by Norman Lear at a Hollywood entering a hundred and forty thousand dollars on the side\nWell yeah I think that the question is their people for the American way so that was in exchange for him working forty\nHours a week I think he probably wasn't doing forty hours a week I think they were just trying to funnel money to him but if he was working forty hours a week for them to make people tell athlete feel you know they have the it's out of control crime problem is raising the taxes he's doing all these gangs\nAnd yet he's working for the left wing group so it's a problem either way but it's interesting even though they documents are out there\nUm journalists do not pursue that at all I mean if I if I Walk on the wrong side of the sidewalk you know they try to do a different story got me so it's definitely a double standard I mean it's an obvious question that would really that should be investigated by the crap\nI Want to hit to other things before you go and that is health care and taxes\nHe uh has talked about Medicare for all this is the big left wing push Medicare for all and it's been pointed out Medicare for all means everyone on Medicare loses Medicare\nEveryone when they don't employer private employer health care plan loses their private employer health care plan every union member who's union is negotiated a health care plan they will lose their health care plan\nEverybody will lose the health care that they have now\nWith some theory some obstruction some concoction they'll create or Washington DC will have the scientists that system whether you like it or not whenever you have today disappears and what does this response to this and he would eliminate all existing health care plans for everybody that's on them including Medicare\nOne little correction market it eliminates I think for about three hundred million people the two things that Bernie has built keeps\nOr the VA in the Indian Health service so no I guess that means that all that Elizabeth Warren has a one one thousand percent her health care if they do this but bottom line is right so his response is when I called them out on that was basically to act like\nHe didn't know what I was talking about he was running commercials saying single payer health Medicare for all two months ago but he realizes that that is toxic and Florida because we have senior citizens who have their arrangement they've been paying in the Medicare Medicare Advantage program\nWe have obviously millions of people who earn their health benefits through their employer um through their employment\nAnd he would take all the way you have no choice\nYou get dumped just as you said dumped on a single payer which we know will cause tax increases it will bankrupt ah\nIt'll hemorrhage money and so they'll have to ration and so yeah you may have\nThe right to have all this great stuff but you're not going to find a doctor\nThat got to be able to perform that there'll be waiting wind and we know the drill and all that so that is not popular once people know what it is and so basically he just tried to run away from it as much as he can um even on the primary he would gang that that's the way that you're when we're in Florida so we're going to keep reminding voters\nLet's talk about let me talk about that let's hit taxes now I mean one one of the reasons a lot of people come to Florida from these blue states as you don't have an income tax\nAnd that's also one of the reasons you have such a dynamic economy such a diverse economy in Florida and I'm a home in Florida so I've seen I've seen the difference between the no tax income tax state and I have a home and I my primary residence in Virginia and an income tax thing\nI cannot believe with all the proposals he's making it says I've never supported a state income tax\nThat's what these guys do I ... in Connecticut years ago and so forth so I'm not an favorite and then they push and push the spending in the debt and then either they push for an income tax or some court orders and income taxes supports an income tax and intrusive Disney\nSo there was a study Donna nonpartisan study that analyzes all his spending proposals and the conclusion that this study was here in order to make it work he would either need to do one or two things have a state wide sales tax\nOf thirty eight percent or impose a state income tax which could reach as high as thirty five percent so those are the only two realistic routes or he would be able to pay for because you know he wants to pay for single payer health care he wants to pay for free college he wants to do all this other stuff\nAnd that's what it would cost so you go down that road a Florida is done that but now I'm ... I mean they were totally critical our economy and cripple our state and we obviously can't let that happen um at all\n[noise] Fifteen dollar minimum wage Seattle tried it it's been a complete failure\nAll the cities at trying or what they wind up doing is the the the people who are earning minimum wage or low wages they're the ones who are punished because what happens is people get fired small restaurants can't afford it even chains can't afford it\nAnd so the price of food goes up less people go into these outlets and go into these places and people lose jobs they loose temps\nI mean this doesn't help people actually mandating a Fifteen dollar minimum wage when it has this consequence doesn't\nSo mark I started off blue collar kid I had to work forty hours a week before I got the college I worked all these jobs for six bucks an hour\nThrough college I wouldn't have been able to get through without that and if you don't want us policies were in place I Would not have made Fifteen an hour I Would have made zero\nBecause I Would not have had the opportunity for any of those jobs and so what he will do is he will put hundreds of thousands of people out of work he will cause businesses to shut down businesses to leave the state um but here's the thing markets Seattle thing you mentioned a lot of the people who\nWho who kept their jobs and they'd get a pay increase to five Fifteen they still ended up with less take home pay because their hours got reduce by the business so it's really been counterproductive and all the evidence points that way but yet he ... he doesn't care and this is what he's running on\nIt's particularly a harmful to young people are trying to get their first job particularly harmful in minority communities people trying to get their first job\nSame with his open borders policies particularly harms or know skilled or low skilled the unskilled or low skilled individuals but uh he claims to represent these people but his policies crush these people run dissent is once again what is your site America\nWe have all of in search let's give all the support we can to run to scientists in Florida let's increases ground game there and the grass roots there where people go if they want to help you\nRon deep Santas dot com R.

very trusting the a fire in community and in society is supposed to be able to bring most situations you\nKnow this is sick and this man is sick from a a philosophical ideological perspective eased a radical\n\nYou sick from a philosophical and political perspective he knows this not to be true\nYou have\nCriminals in society including in poor neighborhoods who cannot be reason with rapists\nMurders wouldn't be right this will be murders robbers wouldn't be robbers and so forth and so on\nAt the time that a law enforcement official has to go to a weapon toward gone to a baton to a taser then they have already gone too far\nBy their very presence\nRapists\nMurderers would be rapists would be murders robbers wouldn't be robbers and so forth and so on\nAt the time that a law enforcement official has to go to a weapon toward gone to a baton to a taser than they have already gone too far\nBy their very presence by the\nVery trust that they inspiring humidity and that society they're supposed to be able to bring most situations to heal\nHere's it's incredible\nAnd Debbie Wasserman Schultz has no problem with this she thinks he's great because at a news conference today in support of Andrew Gillum here's what she had to say cut twelve go\nI just want to share with you [noise]\nHow heartbroken I was I had my incredible fast [noise]\nWho are taking care of the people I represent every single day have to\nThat kind of dangerous and deal with that kind of her [noise] while serving like insects and so we're going to make sure it's one of the reasons that we have to like the Andrew Gillum\nGot [noise]\nA story that we can stand up for the values of the community\nAnd the values of the community is to trash the cops even in the face of this\nThat's a press conference today\nAnd they want Debbie Wasserman Schultz to know that she's a victim that her staff\nHerseth victims\nBut so it was Donald Trump junior a victim and so is Eric Trump a victim and so it was Donald Trump ...\nAnd so as Lara Trump of act and so it was Marco Rubio victim and so what Susan Collins of victim and so it was General Mattis a victim\nAnd I just don't remember all the outpouring of anguish by the media I just don't remember it\nDay in and day out\nNow this isn't about moral relativism ever anything of this or this is about absolute bold face blue light ten hypocrisy\n\nAnd Steve ... was actually shot and almost murdered as others were shot\n\nLuckily this cook either didn't know what he was doing or didn't intend for these bombs to go either way\nHe's a terrorist\nAnd the New York times ... says things are registered Republican I'm trying to figure out how that can be\nI'm not saying he's not I just want to know more\nBecause once you're a felon and Florida you're not automatically return to the voting list you're not allowed to vote unless you go specifically to the floor like clemency board did he do that did he get approval\nI mean this guy in two thousand two in two thousand two he made a bomb threat [noise] he made a bomb threat in two thousand two\n\nHe's not a clean slate the way he was\nRight the perpetrator before he was caught was portrayed\nThe insinuation from Schumer and Pelosi the insinuation from CNN and MSNBC was there was a direct line between Trump and his rhetoric and whoever was doing this\n\nThat was the insinuation that have pushed him over the edge and that this is what causes it sort of know it doesn't as multiple felonies in his past\nThe guy threatened\nTo use a bomb and two thousand two\n\nThat's pretty yeah long before Donald Trump even flirted with the idea of running for president United States\nHe was arrested in two thousand two according to the Associated Press on charges of threatening to throw place project the discharge any destructive device\n\nAnd as pointed out in the Washington Examiner you made the bomb threat\nBecause he was angry at a Florida utility worker St people do not make these threats\nAnd commit these other felonies and I suppose would be governor Andrew Gillum Matt ... who's there Andrew Gillum\nWhat say well the police should pull out guns are tasers Billy clubs or anything of this or no no no they should figure out how to make\nThe guy he'll need more you know community relations my community relations\nAnd tell you what\nI'd like to know a hell of a lot more about the situation I really would not from a conspiracy perspective or anything else I just want to know more of the facts\n\nAnd I'm sure now that the New York slams the Washington composting constipated news network MSL us the and all the rest of them are working feverishly to figure out how he became a registered Republican or retain that than I think the New York times is obligated since it was the first reported\nThe tell us how was it because Florida is not allowed to clear up it's a voter rolls because of all the left wing are suing is it because um [noise]\nPeople on the uh Florida clemency board give us registration out what exactly are we going to rethink this idea that that one should be able to vote [noise]\nI'll be right back when you\nTake one atom of nitrogen and bond with one atom of oxygen boom you're just created nitric\nOxide a miracle molecule your own body makes that fuels your cardiovascular health heaping vibrant but as we all age our

the first time where supporters of the other candidates have been directly account of attacked\nAnd attacked regularly for a long term and you know and that's a thought things that people when they when they pick a five and then they're attacked by that\nAnd that that's my point is you know they fought back and forth that it's the it's the rhetoric between what Donald Trump that and and what the media and the Democrats say it it's true it's directed to I don't ever remember Donald Trump I'm doing something to the supporters of the Democrats the way that the Democrats\nI think I think you're giving this not way too much credit CERN two thousand two he threatened to bomb a or a public utility because he was angry with a worker\nSo I'd be very very careful about playing into the left hands that this is uh some guy who who's angry about what the left is doing and so forth and so we're all angry about what the left is doing but we don't send real are fake bombs to a bunch of people\nNo I don't support that at all the more the case of you know you're you're asking why do we push the button why go there anyway why ever fact order that doesn't have the right way to do things the way that works at a\nWhile the media likes to do this they attack or all the time because you see Mr Zucker overt CNN and uh the clown that runs MSL us they\nThey've decided that they are political operations and that they want to um [noise] uh they want they want to play to a base the radical left coup democratic base and that's what they've decided to do\nOr they're not really news operations they know damn well that Don Lemon as a joke they know damn well the Jake Tapper more and more has become a joke like what they run at night Steven Kobe or the ... of a\n... with the goofy years may I guess I

the math on this and it's pretty incredible you and I and everybody else pay into Social Security trust fund about oh what is it six point eight percent seven point two percent annually I don't know if they\nHave that we Institute for near citizenship in this country for a period of three years you've paid double that rate\nAnd then you work your way to ship your rate come down to a normal rate for math on an\nAlly like let let's ... you see there's a moral issue here I don't think people should be able to pay their way out of the illegal behavior\nAnd and watch\nAll also sees because many of them are and very little in terms of wages and many of them get paid under the table or because the employer doesn't want to be revealed as a crook\nWhat I'm saying is I don't think this would work because it's already lawless and so you're saying okay let's tax it well if that's already lawless and they're not paying any taxes to begin with the employer and so forth then how ... how do you push them into that system\nOr something even for legal immigration coming to this country we\nGotta have something going instead of\nWhy we need is to limit the number of people coming into the country legally and illegally that's it\nIs not Nineteen Eighteen twenty Eighteen at the new ball game\nI don't know what that means I mean if the new economy we can't way of bite the tank\nAnd the Nineteen twenties during college his presidency we had a during that period before and slightly after we had like a twenty year respite on immigration you aware of that\nI Wish it was to some extent or a matter of us being able to just slow things down assimilate people within our system to take a look at how it's shaking out in terms of our school systems terms of law enforcement terms a local health care in terms of jobs and so forth but what's happening\nIs the left is flooding the field more and more and more we've never had a fifty year period of immigration like we have right now never in American history we actually have a political party that cheering illegality\nCheering so I I I don't but I appreciate your call people come up with tax schemes and everything else it's beyond tax games it's beyond well let's have them pay three times and no no that's enforced the law\nThat's enforce the law and many people who come here people don't want to hear that many people come here don't work\nThere was a whole underground economy [noise] with uh with fake Social Security cards\nWith people getting Medicaid or aren't supposed to get Medicaid there's a whole massive undercount
