position would you be more personally and what your position is on issues facing\nOur community ... let's begin with with you I lean a tell us a little bit about your background\nOr your family your professional um your profession in your personal interest where do you live\n... my name is Dr Eileen Gallagher and the ... Christian I has\nBeen practicing for Twenty years and have\nA variety of experiences in medicine of course I see patients and love that part of my job at all with and someone at low that who's interested in it at the site of medicine and so I have been someone who has worked help open new clinics trained staff\nAnd work with electronic medical records that's an additional area of expertise and I ended up in Utah after living in many places throughout our\nGreat country it lived and eight different states because my family in the military family and that we came here like so many others because we chose your child loving it a quality of life\nAffordable living on family set our culture so my husband and I had been married for Twenty years we have five children here they finish carpenter\nAnd so we ended up in Park City because that's really really good interesting stuff fighting carpentry work can be found in abundance [laughter] so we're here to save their life where he works\nAnd the business side of the medicine and so I have been someone who has worked help open new clinics trained staff and work with electronic medical records that's an additional area of expertise and I as ended up in Utah after living in many places throughout our\nGreat country it lived and eight different states because my family as a military family and that we came here like so many others because we chose your child loving it a quality of life\nAffordable living on family center culture so my husband and I had been married for Twenty years we have five children either they finish carpenter\nAnd so we ended up in Park City because that's where the really good interesting [laughter] that's fucking carpentry work can be found in abundance [laughter] and so we are here to new things are life where he works full time and I work a little bit and when that new opportunity\nPresented itself I um ended up running for office now that wasn't casual I've been working on campaigns and ... uh involved in politics since I was a teenager\nI think that that is a great idea as long as certain some people call them strings um other it's called a reasonable business decisions are incorporated namely uh we need to make sure that the plans that are competing and being offered a quality plans\nAnd the AC a made those requirements for a plans to be offering you can't discriminate or refuse to Monday through my pre existing condition like pregnancy you can't you are allowed to cover your children up until they are sort of their schooling up until the age of twenty sit the then and those\nNational standards were set if we were to have an interstate competition I think that it would be reasonable to expect first of all for good practice and second a lot of preventing massive confusion get access to all the different policies that why compete\nA state by state you meet the basic minimum requirements\n[noise] um next question for for you Dr Gallagher um although there are seven Senate districts\nThat are identified as rural or four of those the majority of the electorate in in their constituents in their in their district are from metropolitan areas rural Utah's interests are truly represented the roof represented only my three Senate districts\nThat would be Senate district twenty six a which has been led by Senator Ben Sasse all I'm In is senator Oakland in a district twenty four which includes uh Richfield\nAnd senator Hanks industry twenty seven which is San Juan part of why such and one third of Utah Valley um\nThere is a big responsibility to represent rural Utah as the Senate leader in district twenty six you will assume or a leadership role how would you lead rural Utah's interest in the Senate and um [noise] we'll leave it at that question\nOkay well I Would embrace that role is something that\nProfessionally has always been interested mine I have lived all over the country usually in areas that are rural within nearby metropolitan area in some very aware but nationally as well as here in Utah how that can create really different economies as well as\nAccess to services\nAs well as in need to diversify economies et cetera [noise] ah I think that you're right our legislature needs some balance and it doesn't have it right now one way to do that would be for us to have fewer big business and and fewer\nLand developers for example we only have for farmers we have\nFive doctor it than all the legislature and having voices from people like myself and some more farmer that they could run if they can find that I Am and from other people who are not necessarily representing the corporate interests would be very useful for our legislature\nAnd as a result she rural citizens here in district twenty six and across the state\nOkay commissioner of winter to\nAh you understand the importance of of this district representing rural Utah's needs its bleeds it leads to state and if it weren't for this for twenty six in the leadership there we wouldn't be representative right what does your position on on how would you represent rules real Utah's interest in the Senate\nYou have to be a strong voice you need to know what you're talking about\n... and uh you know one thing that's impressed me is I'm over the years that I've attended the last eleven sessions and been involved in that and they hold a rural caucus senator ... has been the leader there has spoke or the agenda is that they follow\nOur to highlight rural issues and and some of the challenges we face\nAnd with few rural senators you've got to have a strong voice there and educate all of the other twenty six senators of the issues that you face ... and I'd been willing to do that\nI've been in meetings with the governor and when you know as they ask for opinions and and you listen to them and then I go you really don't want my opinion yes we do\nAnd then you tell them and then sometimes they have to sit back and go well you're pretty bold you know but you know if you want to know what we're thinking or what's happening then let us speak otherwise you're still assume that you know what's best for us because one thing or one size does not fit the whole state and so [noise]\nThe agenda is that they follow our to highlight rural issues and and some of the challenges we face\nAnd with few rural senators you've got to have a strong voice there and educate all of the other twenty six senators of the issues that you face and ... and I'd been willing to do that\nI've been in meetings with the governor and when you

bold you know but you know if you want to know what we're thinking or what's happening then let us speak otherwise just don't assume that you know what's best for us because one thing or one size does not fit the whole state and so\nRural issues and there's\nThere's twenty six counties out there is there a rural but yet we only have three senators that represent truly represent as there are they are going to have a sliver of the oil in them and to say that the rural they have a sliver but the you know they cater to to the population more than they do the needs of\nRural no follow up with a with Dr Gallagher on this question but I have one more question for you um do you feel that commissioner do film of rural Utah's interests are are are fairly represented in the Senate\nI made us later I think that they have done an exceptional job in voicing that and er at times it I think sometimes uh they've come short but in the Senate I think that Senator Rand hassle has done an exceptional job letting his voice heard\nAlong with the other a couple that to a ... well ...\nYou know he he's considered rural too but he has a lot of Washington County in beaver an iron counties and so they're starting to change and then to diversify into urban more than rural\nWashing their hands to becoming Reuben is yes it is I'm a dumped her ... same same question if you do film of rural Utah has interests are are fairly represented in the Senate\nI think that the\nVoice of rural Utah is being promoted very much like governor Herbert\nAs well as by the emerging groups like league of cities and towns and the emphasis that county they're having now I'm bringing their lobbyists and their voices straight to the legislature\nI think the reason that leader city in towns and that counties are starting to send people individually it that the legislature has it been listening as much as they they have to some of governor Herbert ah plans he has major plans for\nRural job creation which will I assume would be in at a major emphasis is whoever ends up representing districts when he said his energy policies are also very much focused on meeting the needs of rural Utah and their economies and I think there has been an interesting sort of a\nDisconnect that has happened I think that there's been so much focus on what is good for Salt Lake [laughter] scared for a very metropolitan areas that that push from below with our counties and our mayors and the ... the governor maybe isn't translating\nSometimes and so I think that the legislature as a whole to do a better job now I'll tell you I have never heard anything the kind words about [laughter] this prevents hassle from our county commissioners out on this side from our various merit et cetera I think he's done a really great job of representing\nAll the different areas to stretch to the legislature\nI'm sure he would appreciate that um the state of getting on tourism here on the subject of tourism this the state a tourism um resources have been spent to to promote the mighty five\nUh in in the ski industry is handling and in rural Utah specifically here in the you would've basin has been has been left in the way that they've been left wanting a what would you to do to um to support tourism in rural Utah specifically you're in the you want to be\nWell specifically in the EU and the base and the obvious choices are to make sure that we promote tourism at framing gorge at the Green River at dinosaur monument\nI have hike and fish in camps in most of our state and all of our national and other parks in the west and it always perplexed me that state parks has so much advertising and so much revenue um that\nDon't take into account the fact that our other more rural areas first of all the rights to get to our beautiful places in district twenty six and also are not getting promoted internationally\nAs well as nationally and still the first thing to do with either do exactly that the eastern side of district twenty six is just is gorgeous and five and should be promoted both nationally and internationally\nCommissioner winters and uh do you think that this uh this that the legislature has been allocating the tourism money uh equitably and what would you do to support tourism in rural Utah specifically right here at home\nUh the argument will prevail that these resources would be used to continue to support metropolitan grow how how would you fight for rural Utah's interest on this issue and do you believe rural Utah's roads need additional funding\nAs a county commissioner yes we we always have a shortfall for money to to do roads or the five senses appreciated your brought us a little but it does not get it there [noise] um\nWe have twelve hundred miles of road that we maintain inducing county that's paved roads we have a hundred miles how does that compare to uh to heavier to say why such county was such county uh\nI Would think that there are some are far less\nYeah then they're probably talking maybe four hundred miles total lane miles to maintain and to double in in some some when you start talking about the roads the way that the formula is is\nA road miles whether it's paved roads you get one price than you get a gravel road you got dirt roads and uh they break it down and and pay your accordingly and so you have to maintain those records\nAnd um to just run a blade over in in the summer time A R B roads sometimes are just grab all that and so we operate five graders five days a week trying to keep up with that\nWhen you have a storm come in it's all one done and you start all over we've had flash flooding this summer sticking out a lot of the road we've had closed them and so we we can always use more money it would be nice if they were always paved\nOr you get into the metropolitan places county roads are outside of the the ...\nAnd so ah the cities get she wrote money there's B and C road money than comes out of gasoline tax and so when we get the real money we have to look at the two thousand miles so we have to maintain where's priorities what do we need to do each year we try to do a little more paving in that but\nI'm One that yeah we need to find out how we can make the gasoline tax stretch but we haven't had when they raise the tax they hadn't raised taxes or the gasoline tax for Nineteen years it got way out of balance and you know how expensive car tires are\nThe gasoline went up to we just never did put it in proportion\nAs soon as they tried to fix it so that it was based upon the rack price and it'd be floating they have a base rate and then they kept it and I think that given time that it will make a difference but we're not there yet [noise] a\nDoctor jumper Gallagher due due to the to the rural road money allocated from the from the from the legislature Higgins is an equitable and how would you fight for rural Utah since this on this issue\nSo I don't think it's acceptable and I think that our upcoming prop one provides a good model for how to start to fix\nThat an equity um I don't know that it would fix the entire problem but it's good models so the idea of providing a ... percent sales tax increase\nFunding for the first several years after the sales tax increase giving that many of the counties to address their infrastructure needs as they're the ones he knows best what they need ... rate a source of revenue for the next few years and then I think provides a really good model for\nStates coming up states coming up with clever ways to generate a tax revenue that doesn't burn and the whole population and then rather than putting it to the general fund and having to make legislation just singing it directly to the county\nRight so Dr donor a government Herbert endorses an initiative to increase gasoline tax by ten cents per gallon to fund education in Utah I Know education is is a subject that you're passionate about do you do think that this isn't appropriate use for gasoline parents\n[noise]\nNot ideal but something needs to be done and I think that it's a great start fixing\nSome of the problems that we're seeing in every classroom in Utah because an inadequate funding [noise] Joe I appreciate that there is so many attempts to try and increase the funding to our school\nNobody wants to increase property taxes understand that nobody wants to increase income taxes and yet the funds that are going to go straight to the education they need to be increased and so this increase in gasoline tax will be a great start with a three hundred and Seventy million that it is expected to\nUh generate half of which will go straight to a district school districts themselves to decide what they need to spend money on [noise] we have a unique situation here in Utah than how we find\nSchools and that we also have to sit lend money in the background as well as the state money and yet it clearly we have been under funding our schools we have overcrowded classrooms the teachers who can't teach the way they would like to\nThe fact that our classrooms and there's teachers in our students perform way above what you think they would do with fifty fifty fifty percent funding in the nation that testimony chew are amazing teachers and parents and how they're preparing our kids that were coming up on a new\nA generation where kids need to be able to participate in this high tech energy economy and all the other economies that we're generating hearing your child with are amazing gross\nAnd to do that we have to educate them all\nGiven there was in years past that we had the receipts coming from the forest service and the ... for for grazing for mineral producing and that\nAnd that pay this back and we could almost keep even with that is so high will I Will prove promote that a hundred percent that we need to develop our public lands\nBut we do it in a responsible way and they are doing it\nDr Gallagher do support the oil and gas and oil and natural gas exploration and our public lands it's what level\nWell it depends on whether you're talking about federal versus state lands first of all you can choose developing in Japan's\nUh specifically responsible they're being for individually federal federal and state because you ... your your state senator\nAnd proposed to be um federal and state uh do support willing forgot such charisma public

Wisconsin Josh your next up on the market within show I'm Larry O'Connor\nIowa area or I'm good I I'm concerned though because if the Democrats do get the majority in the house this is going to be a rough two years\nAnd I have an idea I'm Talking to your string color and I said that a good idea that they should do is they could show Detroit when it's ran by businessmen like Donald Trump say in Henry Ford and the strength that Detroit once had and then once Democrat liberal take over\nAnd how it just falls into corruption in squalor and just show them side by side and then even better for my own state I think they'd on how they're now\nIf you let politician and take over you get your choice if you let Republicans take over and have ideas you get Foxconn and he's beautiful jobs that were getting shocked and I yeah I Wish they were told that more and more and more and they don't\nYeah and and you know Josh I'm Glad you brought this up because I I Love Wisconsin and I think that a year Governor Scott Walker has done some great jobs in his incredible turn around what he's been able to achieve in that state and of course they all said that people would be fired and people would be starving in the streets and no one would get an education and it's been phenomenal\nYeah and we saw in the Scots number and Madison there were all yes and that took on our capital and we start right short and look at what we've been able to accomplish that strikes is second half of the term of Donald Trump if it if we fight the good fight and vote on November sixth that'll happen\nThank you Josh thank you for the call appreciate it thanks for coming into the Merck within show ya I vividly remember those mobs\nDetroit if you let Republicans take over and have ideas you get Foxconn and he beautiful jobs that were getting shocked that I yeah I Wish they were told that more and more and more and they don't\nYeah and and you know Josh I'm Glad you brought this up because I I Love Wisconsin and I think that a year Governor Scott Walker has done some great jobs than it is incredible turn around what he's been able to achieve in that state and of course they all said that people

that'll happen\nThank you Josh thank you for the call appreciate it thanks for coming into the market within show ya I vividly remember those mobs taking over the capital occupying the capital of Madison during the early years of the Scott Walker or the governorship of ... that was back when I was working with Andrew Breitbart and Andrew Andrew got on a plane\nThe next day he sent us all a text message I'm going to Madison\nIn the winter in Southern California guy the Andrew why are you going in Madison look at what's going on there look at the mobs look at the riots look at\nThe ... ... look\nAt Scott Walker needs us Republicans need us conservatives who are trying to bring sane rational governance to the state of Wisconsin need us and he sure did go there by the way right next door to you there are Josh over in Michigan this is a remarkable thing\nYou know everywhere you go right now on cable news broadcast news all over the Internet who do you hear about running for Senate this young upstart appealing good looking guy who's who's a defy the odds and has a real\nChance to win all you're hearing about is this guy Beto O'Rourke bitter rug doesn't have a chance to win and Texas bigger and bigger work is not going to win\nThe Senate seat in Texas\nAnd it's all made for TV we've seen this game before every two years every election they tell us about the new rising star in Texas was finally going to take paint Texas blue you know when Hillary Clinton\nWas a deciding not to do any sort of polling or appearances in Wisconsin Pennsylvania well not Pennsylvania she did appearance in Wisconsin or Michigan\nOr that she was actually at that time contemplating spending more money in Texas because she was so sure she was going to win Texas and Georgia and Arizona and she ... she wanted to to this was going to be a transformative election with Hillary Clinton and the remaking of the map\nWe hear this all the time but it's not true and meanwhile in\nMichigan there's this guy John James the last poll there showed him in single digits now this guy a running against Debbie Stabenow I mean he is he's a former military uh did combat in Iraq\nUh this guy is African American this guy is conservative this guy is right on all the issues are they here I Want to play a little bit of of him because because this tells you exactly how the media so corrupt\nBecause all they care about with federal Rourke it has to do with two things it has to do with forcing this fake narrative\nThat the Democrats are really into the Texas is moving blue Texas is going to be a democratic state Texas is not the same Texas because the Democratic demographic changes because uh because of all of the radical conservative policies that have hurt that state which they haven't I mean\nPeople are flocking to Texas people are flocking to Texas because of the economy there is one of the only states the persevere through the eight dismal years of rock Obama because they had Republicans in charge of that state there's no way that people have Texas would reverse that trend but also because they hate Ted Cruz\nThe media hates Ted Cruz because he's so good so smart and so conservative so they're they're they're puffing this beta will work guy up and meanwhile listen I got a little bit of a John James this a really impressive guy in Michigan\nReal leadership is what's needed in Washington in order to ensure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity American exceptionalism is not entitled American exceptionalism to turn\nThere was a time in American we stood out what was right and without any sort of political motivation of reservation we waste wars on he will not on each other we was services for self we they're greatly policemen wisely we love deeply in a man's world was von this is what I'm president knew when he talks about making\nAmerica great are you kidding making about seeing I mean do you hear this guy doing the African American young handsome odd articulate as as a perfect on the issues perfect on his love for this country full support of the president\nI mean I come on if he if he were running against Ted Cruz do you think we'd hear more about John James\nIf he were a Democrat do you think we'd be hearing a little bit more ... why is everyone obsessed with ... or ... when he was basically running\nJustice far behind Ted Cruz and the latest polls then John James is running behind Debbie Stabenow and you know the answer\nTo that question you know very well the answer to that question how about Jim down in her non do Florida I'm Larry O'Connor you're listening to the mark within show what does a gym\nI just want to start or what the Democrats are the Republicans should be talking about yeah\nIs what the Democrats are not talking about about gun control the economy jobs unemployment people for one case the media is driving the narrative and they're doing that in the pocket of the Democrats\nYet Jim you're right all the Republicans need to know what they should be talking about in the next day or two and a half weeks you're absolutely right all the things that the Democrats are avoiding and that includes the fight over judge Kavanaugh now justice Kevin notice how no one talks about that anymore it's completely disappeared why do you think that is Jim\nOh geez I I Wonder if the media is driving it there are saying okay well that's not important anymore that might make the the conservatives rushed to the rules and\nYou know\nDisregard they're what they're what they're trying to do\nThank you Jim
