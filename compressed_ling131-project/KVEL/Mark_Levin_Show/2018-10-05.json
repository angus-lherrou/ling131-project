dearest\nFriends one of the smartest floors I Know\nOne of the nicest people I Know as David Limbaugh\nAnd he writes great books and he's got one out right now called Jesus reason now this isn't exactly my area of expertise but it's become his area of expertise he's written a lot about politics and so forth but he now has written extensively about Christianity David Limbaugh how are you my friend\nMark how are you a thank you so much for having me on\nWell it's a great pleasure in the book is as I say Jesus risen first of all let me ask you this you are\nAnd I had to overcome some hospitals up ... overcome some doubts\nAnd when I finally became a believer I I thought OK I'm holding in my hand the word of God with the Bible and I was so in all of that so ... that I wanted to inhale it and gobble it up and read as much as I could learn as much as I could about the Bible in theology and I I wished at that time\nThat there were some short cut that there are some a guide some parameters that would help me get a hold of a handle on the Bible more quickly than I did it takes a lot of work if you do it on your own takes a lot of work anyway and and it's worthwhile work but as I\nStudy that I I I wanted to share what I learned because I was so excited about it so I tried to write a book on it and this was before I had any platform you hadn't written any columns and written any books and it didn't really go anywhere it was premature but then I started writing a column and\n... and probably ten or Fifteen Years later I'd written all those columns two columns a week every week and I got five books under my belt and I thought well I now have a platform I've got a little more confidence uh and I might just a try this again so I wrote my first Christian themed book\nAnd again ... explain my faith journey and why I Believe in Christianity and\nThen for men I've just gone on to write other books in the last one was a book about the gospel or where I go through the gospels and explain what the text is in a kind of paraphrase it in chronological order and then I also interspersed commentary from some of the greatest Christian bankers\nAnd some of my own inside and I wanted to continue with the New Testament after that because I ran out of space literally on that book so I started with the book of acts in this\nBook and it has a history of the early church\nAnd six of Paul's Thirteen of pistols his letters to the early church is so that's what this book is it's just a continuation of my a trek through the New Testament\nA and I've got more to go and the next book of red green my publisher agrees to do it so what what the short answer to your question is I was on fire for the Bible remain on fire\nThe Bible study that really pretty hard for a lay person or the last Twenty years on and off and I wanted to share that passion ... help people where I was who were who were doubters and wanted to learn more\nAnd give them some kind of a primer and and a deep dive if they wanted to go further I Hope this book is both deep and accessible at the same time and will help people learn about the Bible and most of all inspire them to read the Bible for themselves and learn about it\n[noise] let me ask you this question and you look around the world\nYou see Christianity under attack even in our own country it's under attack in different ways you look at the middle east and same with Judaism you would think that the only religion that ever existed in the middle east was Islam yeah it is the third religion to exist\nAnd Christians had been pushed out of most of the Arab countries obviously there are individuals who want to push the abuse of sort of Jerusalem in Israel but when you look at our own country talk about the Supreme Court in the courts generally there is a growing hostility\nTowards Christianity do you think your book will help people better understand that they don't have to be afraid of your face to face\nYou know that is such a good question I I really believe that the Judeo Christian tradition is at the bedrock of our constitutional principles and I realized there's in white and that influences and Judeo Christian principles a behind the constitution and our liberties\nAre and what our tradition stance for the Judeo Christian Church tradition stands for freedom we believe were made in God's image we leave where we have these innate rights as an alien Abul rights that come from God that comes from our religious tradition\nAnd as a result of really believing that from the core of ourselves\nThat we all men are entitled to that freedom we by definition do not want to suppress the freedom and liberty anyone else their religious or political liberty and that includes people whose views are in that like the U.S\nThere for the last in response to your question has nothing to fear for it for much atheist have nothing to fear from about Islam as long as it doesn't attack us has nothing to fear from us\nAnd yet the the the suppressor the the totalitarian the authoritarians a suppressor of free speech and liberty\nCome from the left and we do have something to fear from them and so I don't like this notion that Christians should or Jews should sit idly by and while the secular laugh destroys our liberties destroys our way of life destroys those sacred values that that underlying undergrad all of our freedoms\nAre and we can't just as some Christian some passive Christian suggests we can't just pray and expect God to do it all of course we pray and we put it under his control but he put us here for a purpose we didn't just we we weren't just placed on earth but he passed it by standard we need to be active and there's nothing\nIncompatible between Christianity and political activism as long as we are acting in accordance with our principles and that's what I think we try to do and I we have to fight the last as hard as they find that we don't have to be as dirty as they are but we do have to be as relentless and his intense\nI and that's what we need to do and yes they have nothing to fear from us we have a lot to be concerned about in terms of what they would do to us if they had the power\nThe book is Jesus is risen it's by David Limbaugh or you can get at an Amazon dot com or you can go to my site secure they're already ... Facebook Marta ... Twitter we have a link to it is really a fascinating and um\nI went into the er the audience little interesting discussion you and I had when I said I Want you to come on and discuss your book and David is so respectful of other face and other beliefs and other people he said well\nAre you really short because you know I'm I'm Talking about Jesus and you know and you're Jewish and so forth\nAnd I said I get it it's okay I Want you to come on my show I Want you to talk about this I'll tell you why David\nAnd we're going to come back in thirty seconds I see some more vibrant some more rigorous he's alarmed the Christians say sit better society is I feel the same way about my own religion Judaism\nAnd so let's discuss that a little bit when we come back we'll be right back [noise]\n\n... we spend most of our time indoors so am I doing in the outdoors when you're inside kill with over ... hundred scientists to choose from plus cost him options we have a solution to make your indoor air cleaner pressure and well there are sensors they're manufactured right here in America\nI'm Free within twenty four hours and you can sign up for a subscription so you never have to think about air filters former ...\nSign up for the scripts and they never have to think about air filters former again\nYes and and that's been documented in and\nA lot of people want to do rock that because it has any interest of the secularists to ah say to rewrite history to revise history and say that the framers were not religious men that they were secularists and that\nUh they they say that as a result of that we should get back to our secular values and when they they want a radically transform fundamentally transform our nation or back to secularism and those kind of values that but because they distort what really it really was\nBut we know for a fact what they want to transform us back\nTo is something that's anathema to our founding principles and we watched the totalitarian tendencies of the last uh as Obama tried to bring on and he wanted to fundamentally transform the nation into nothing like it appeared\nAt the time nothing like it was founded and you've written eloquently about this and you know that his fundamental transformation was not a restoration of where we started about a radical transformation away from it and the completion of the destruction\nOf our founding principles in my view\nNow I Can't ...

past three months I Believe and so he's become a new hero in this entire process rock solid Lindsey Graham something else that I don't think many of us necessarily thought would be the case\nCouple of things I Am very much based on information or the arguments the information I provide you my opinions all based on information and one of the things I've been tracking from the word go the day after Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the United States Supreme court\nGallup has always tracked on Supreme Court nominees and you may be a boon whatever about Gallup but regardless of what you think of their polling it's instructive because if they do it every single day ongoing you can use a baseline to get a temperature ... temperature jak of public opinion on any given issue in this case\nOur views of Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat was interesting and the very first polling done\nOn Brett Kavanaugh after his nomination by President Trump we had four percent more Americans say that he should be confirmed the not the case of that the baseline that's where we started now after we had the first hearing\nAnd we had twenty senators on the Senate Judiciary committee and Spartacus\nDo what they did coming out of that\nFour percent more Americans thought that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed and not in other words despite the fact that a couple of months went by despite the fact that they uh you know what sport gets on them it didn't change public opinion at all not at all\nIs interesting because as consistent as that was we did see with Christine forwards allegations\nA bit of a shift as a Thursday morning not yesterday but a week ago the morning of the hearing we did see public sentiment wanting the Gallup shift into negative territory on Brett Kavanaugh\nWe saw public sentiment shift to three percent more people believing that he should not be confirmed then should be getting prior to the testimony alright that's after everything that the media and the politicians did the Brett Kavanaugh\nWhere are we today that's kind of interesting by a forty six forty five margin Americans believe that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed\nNow they're too soon to be learned in this entire process on this information to first as public opinion despite all the emotions oh the emotions the all the nonsense sport it gets to Christine for two gang raping whatever\nPublic opinion only shifted by seven percent seven percent top to bottom that's it in terms of the opinion about that\nNow what's instructive inside of that seven percent we bounce back\nTo pretty much where this country is one of the things I find fascinating is when we actually do have representatives in this country that represent us and in this particular case the United States Senate is doing pretty much what the American people want to have happen here\nBy a slim margin red Kavanaugh\nEnded up receiving the necessary votes to advance the final votes moral and we'll end up becoming the next Supreme Court justice on a narrow vote just as the American people wanted it so that part I think is so I could graphically interesting\nThe next facet of this conversation is where to focus your energy\nBecause how many people are really persuadable politically one of the most common questions I ever receive has to do with persuading people politically how do you do it\nWell the easiest way to tell you how not to do it who is it that you are most likely to engage politically\nProbably allows people in your life that oppose you\nWrite how does that work out for you and let me ask you\nFor the angry leftist but you argue politics with you ever get anywhere you just get angry do you think they're one of the folks\nJust poured that seven percent that was ever persuadable in the first place\nNow I Know we wish that we could change their minds especially if they're in their lives and our universe\nBut people have to be open minded first coming up next to talk about that in how to be persuasive and who can be persuaded and how not to bend your head against the wall and just become really unhappy I Am Brian mud and for the great one more glove and\nListen to what David ask from Illinois has to say about his experience using the ex chair here's what he writes the extra has made such an unbelievable difference in how I sit at my desk\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity instead\nAndy and so it made sense to them yeah you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change Obama probably made sense because hey that was what our teachers told us in here we are and things are working they had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy\nWe finally have it right now is one of the most important windows of time\nWe have two really good opportunities to reach people\nEspecially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me right they're getting the wage growth the bonuses it's all happening and it's important to tell them how we got here\nAnd then it's also important in the cabinet situation to articulate what's on the line here hey if somebody that you didn't even know came out and accused you of say sexual assault may not be awful right yeah it'd be pretty bad\nRight I mean that's what happened here and and go through information only rather than just the emotions of yeah you know Kavanaugh anyway just a little food for thought let's go to Archie in Ventura, California Archie go\nRight and it's good to hear about your ah your history and and your experience or that tells me why work with a choice you to do is to\nSpeak well of you and I wanted to say that uh I live in a very carefully to the Susan yeah a colon senator Collins is a [noise] a dissertation about what happened and even though I'm a Democrat and I'm In California I was a quite\nImpressed by it she laid it out very precisely he was a very methodical started out a little weak but it went on from there and build the was diligent showed her diligence all of the time she had been getting a\nComing to her a conclusion interview he did and all all the meetings he went to until I found it very at applying and informative and uh her stock went up ... percent with me\nI couldn't agree more I was frankly shocked at just how detailed top to bottom on every single consideration that's part of this process\nI I mean she was on ...\nAnd point by point by point from the nomination process pointing out how many organizations were going to oppose\nRegardless of who the nominee was that one of the organizations hadn't even filled in the name and they put out that they were opposing the nominee mentioned that even senators got out ahead to one of them even got out ahead of the name being announced when they were saying that they were opposed\nAll the way through\nPoint by point by point\nWind Christine Ford was not credible in terms of allegations even though she did mention that she believed that ultimately she was likely a sexual assault victims no evidence whatsoever\nThat it was Brett Kavanaugh and her eyes she could have been the top attorney in the country the way that she laid out the details as she found them it was about Fifteen minutes fifty fifty five minutes her speech and I would say that it is a must view if you missed it uh it is definitely worth catching the entire thing it was captivating\nAnd again I have never heard a senator deliver a better speech not ever\nI didn't agree with absolutely everything she said but it was principles it was details it was well thought out and almost everything there was inarguable and I just absolutely remarkable Susan Collins who goes to ... go to Jim\nJim in Charlotte welcome to the show\nHey Brian thanks so that's what it at a pretty much echo what the last caller so to go about my respect and admiration for senator callers I mean this increased by what are ... are are sort of for about ... percent of that I knew her vote was going to be a year after I was thinking of driving down the road that\nYou know the only other thing bigger than what Susan causes food or today was when the twentieth main author Josh what Chamberlain protected the ... your your army Gettysburg little round top costs preserving the you you're so am I really admire her and I'm Glad she did what you did\nWell that's a pretty big moment in history and I I agree that this is one for the history books as well by the way a how are the folks in North Carolina do and you guys are making the back\n[noise] oh yeah there are other skaters are kind of a ramp butter in big bucks or a sort of the cold weather gets in on her I think er I think they should be like diminishing a little bit\nHow the folks over in Wilmington [noise] ah well I'm over in Charlotte but uh\nI was in the marine corps are facing over ... over ... pretty good they're recovering pretty good for Jacksonville you or your real vulgar areas there all the waters receded into cover various so I talked to a friend over there ... or ... ... slowly but surely recognizable\nYeah appreciate your service thank you for listening and sharing your thoughts as well and may God Bless you know the folks there I Lived in Wilmington for a very short time than when I saw what was going on and heard that it was an island or pre unimaginable so glad that ah folks during the get it back together after the hurricane and in North Carolina\nAll right let's go to\nJake Jake ... in California Welcome to the show\nOr a a yeah I was a I Would agree with your point about work it up ... and Ford and as far as their allegations that concern but I had a little different take on a not so much to go after her but to ah go after anybody in the future\nThat might think that they can put people up to putting out false allegations and not have to pay a price\nCorrect I think that's the single most important thing and the reason why I'm not willing to just give a pass even though Kavanaugh is going to clear this thing\nBecause he's always going to have this thing that he's going to have to deal with there's a certain percentage of the population that's not insignificant but it's going to believe the allegation regardless and it's not okay to perjure yourself these are principal\nAnd again you know if we're going to deal with the rule of law for going to deal with the premise that should be addressed and we know because of politics we're not going to see the Senate Judiciary committee pursue her for perjury and conduct the investigation that would be necessary to travel down that path\nBut it doesn't mean that it should go unchecked what she did was absolutely wrong because again when you say you I'm One hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted me and you have none of your or none of your witness a\nWould know the witnesses period that corroborate any of that information I mean that's a problem that's not acceptable in this country or appreciate you are you listening in and checking in coming up we'll continue the conversation and also share some of\nMy final thoughts on break cabin on the situation as we get ready for the vote
