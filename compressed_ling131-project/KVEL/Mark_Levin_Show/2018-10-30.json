versus one Kim arc we've talked about this I've written about it\nAnd that declared the fourteenth amendment adopted the common law definition of birthright citizenship [noise] um but the decision conferred birthright citizenship when a child of legal residents of the United states\nNow the majority is broad enough to include children born\nIllegally in the United states as well as legal immigrants but that's not what the court decided it wasn't even presented to the court and so of course you have individuals\nWho are trying to read it into it the court has never decide that illegal

place the help you need could be one phone call the weigh eight hundred three nine o nine five\nThat someone who is in Nineteen fifty to the constitution was not interpret it as giving citizenship to the children of illegal aliens\nExactly it's like saying proved to me that the fourteenth amendment didn't mean to\nMandate gay marriage will I mean no one would have thought that and and and that's the thing here what are the best I could see from my research is that for most of our history we didn't have\nToo many illegal aliens in the early part of the twentieth century it was in the sixties and seventies and eighties it started to grow and there was never an active decision what happened was because most people um\nAre born here who who are born here are obviously legitimate citizens and we believe in birthright citizenship for illegal immigrants\nHospitals never asked any questions and H H death on the Social Security administration never clamp down on it on the back end how do I know this is true because everyone agrees that children of diplomats are excluded right I mean that's the whole point\nThat they are not subject to American law they everybody agrees\nChildren of diplomats tourists who just come to the United states I mean real tourists not not the the shame that we see taking place in some of these places but\nJust because you're a tourist in the United states you have to give birth doesn't mean that you then she'd or a burst birthright citizenship to the United states if you're saying from Canada\nExactly exactly I mean that's that's the point so you know there is evidence that there are plenty of children of diplomats that are also being handed\nA citizenship papers and pets administrations has been extremely lax and in that case everyone agrees they're not entitled to it so again this is a passive act Trump is actually restoring\nThe real law on this dates back to the U.S this as grants attorney general or just a couple of years after the fourteenth amendment passed he said very clearly\nThat this means people subject to complete jurisdiction not aliens with parents born abroad um there were two other cases before then it said the same thing this justice pray overturned that inexplicably and this is just the stuff that nobody is willing to talk about\n... you know let's make something very very clear about this they say it's a dubious legality for the president had to do this with an executive order let's walk through this together\nFrom the Nineteen sixties and seventies the bureaucracy starts concerning citizenship when the children of illegal aliens not based on the statute not based on the constitution\nIt takes hold corrupt the federal bureaucracy who's in charge of the federal bureaucracy dinner or what's\nThe president\nThe president you know so if president says you know what I\nI I'm going to stop that some of the river then including the leader of the Republicans in the house they say you can't change the constitution by executive order you know that's what Obama was doing we don't do that kind of stop\nYour point earlier he's not changing the constitution by executive order he's not re interpreting the constitution by executive order he's getting the executive branch under control and saying this is what the fourteenth amendment means\nThis is what I wrote my book stolen sovereignty literally we have stolen sovereignty\nThe executive branch made this decision imagine if the people would have voted or Congress would have conducted a vote we're going to give citizenship to hundreds of thousands of people every year who break into our country against our consent no one would have ever voted for that\nThat was a bureaucratic creation and again let's zoom back to asylum to many other changes Trump is making he's merely merely restoring\nThe constitution and the statutes he's overturning the other administrative a lawless\nAnd the people every year who break into our country against their consent no one would have ever voted for that that was a bureaucratic creation and again let's zoom back to asylum to many other changes Trump is making he's nearing ... merely restoring\nThe constitution and the statutes he's overturning the other administrative\nA lawless acts of previous administrations you know very well marketing and you do this as well as conservative review we are not in lockstep with everything that any party does we'll call the president now if we disagree with something but everything he has done an immigration is actually\nThe base statute its path administrations have done this a verdict that he's changing\nSo I mean is the head of the executive branch he doesn't need a statute or to reverse what the executive branch did without a statute does he\nKnow no unless Congress the only thing that could act as Congress with their naturalization power could explicitly say thou shalt give a citizenship to all legal they they could do that\nBut until they won't ... isn't the problem though that the courts might aren't the courts out of control even these so called constitutional is on the court\nOn you know to stay on popular opinion here I mean this was my concern about Gorsuch and I think we've seen that in a very similar sovereignty case into my of the assassins um I I don't know if we have five votes I I doubt Roberts will be with\nUs but I don't think I I don't I don't think a cabinet with me with us\nI I think yeah I mean I I Know Tom is would be based on his past writings and his understanding of sovereignty\nBut but here's the broader question issuing citizenship birth certificates that is an executive power\nWho's to say that the judiciary has the final say this is not something you know IBM versus Microsoft case or controversy this is the most foundational national question and the notion that we're going to see that to the courts\nBut the problem is the courts sees it for themselves look what look what they did to the president when he was simply trying to have a six month\nRespite so we could vet people coming here from six majority Muslim countries that are\nSpreading terrorism in those countries where there's civil war in those countries it didn't even include a majority of Muslim countries where the vast majority of Muslim population and look what happened in these federal district court some circuit courts you you have to hold your breath\nOh in the end by the way since Trump won and Trump via lie in the Supreme Court\nSubsequent lower courts have come back and basically repeal that Supreme Court decision they're just totally disregarding it and putting injunction on very similar policy this is what happened\nAnd I I don't know the answer for this one as a society as a body politic both the executive branch and member of the Congress of both parties say let's see what the courts say well I mean if the courts are not a concurrent power side by side but standing over then we have North Korea and there's no elections\nSo this is the problem yeah I I don't think this will do well in the courts but again they would stay the same thing if Congress or to do it just last week a district judge said that a statute of Congress\nMaking it illegal for local communities to thwart federal immigration law is unconstitutional not the president statute so I don't know what you do with that\nMhm [noise]\nWell here we are but one of the things I'm very pleased about is it sounds like the president is taking the son now I hear some of the race Bayer is on cable TV well actually the cable TV filled with race matters and I heard one of them say recently that today\nThe president brought this up the ... division president even bring it up he was asked about it by by a reporter who was interviewing him who got word that they are quietly looking at this and the counsel's office or maybe the department of justice even said I don't know how you got that information and they turn it into a race issue of course they're going to write\nMark you know it's tragic about the race issue\nAnd and this is really ironic and really said the fourteenth amendment was crafted to ensure that the declaration of independence were actually the vision would actually be actual alive men the bare bones minimum writes life liberty and property would be given to black American citizens that should've been citizens for many years they were here for centuries\nAnd instead that is being back there dies to subvert the actual meeting and disenfranchise\nAll American citizens black and white and everything else at the hand of of of illegal immigrants it it makes no sense as a\nRub minute let me just say that I have to go so let's let's be abundantly clear about that amendment was for black Americans that amendment that amendment was for former slaves that's\nIt done and it was to make sure that they were treated as equals citizens the whole point of the civil or the post civil war amendments was to protect\nFormer slaves and nothing to do with illegal aliens same sex marriage this one not one of their nothing whatsoever so the left pores that suggested the end of the fourteenth amendment which wants to do Daniel horror let's keep up the good work we much appreciate and my friend thanks so much gutless\nAnd God Bless you to listen to this the IRS hired a small army of private collectors of your heart just skip the beat chances are you oh the IRS because hearing the most powerful collection and she just got more powerful is pretty scary\nYo the IRS do

ways optimum has resolved over half a billion and tax that for clients half a billion\nCar optimal tax relief at eight hundred for nine nine sixty three hundred eight hundred for nine nine sixty three
