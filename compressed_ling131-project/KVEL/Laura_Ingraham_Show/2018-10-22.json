you\nWas spot on but very kind of very short so let me just mentioned this again you are no stranger\nTo radio let's go through some of these things you've been on thousands of radio programs you've been in the public eye doing this stuff for a lot a lot a lot of years and I used to love watching you on TV and we'll go there and just admitted man oh man give me some background how'd you get started in radio and all this stuff\nWell I appreciate mark and I appreciate being home with you today because ah these are important times for us as gun owners are dangerous times for our country they're dangerous time for those of us who care about freedom care about being able to take care of our families a lot\nI think it is absolutely essential\nThe job you're doing a certainly this was really really an ... program and sort of I Want some we're going to promote your program at every available opportunity um I you know I'm from the country\nOr they're in northwest Louisiana grew up a shooting guns are riding horses are riding motorcycles you know what I'm saying I have a couple of hot rods along the way and actually\nI began an entertainment career ups\nAnd music and we've we've continued do that and and and thank you for mentioning we did have talked to in record by two thousand Thirteen and I've had several things but back in the early Nineteen nineties Nineteen Ninety nine to not want a we decided\nTo uh put guns on TV because there weren't any\nAnd we I and some other people that that were enthusiastic about projects that way but you know we need to show people how to shoot guns how to how to properly handled goes how to do the place of the gun in our society our culture\nAnd that was the original shooting show and it shows used it sets\nAnd we we were up on satellite we were free to cable companies everywhere wound up helping to build a\nCouple of TV networks loan way of radio network or two as well\nAnd and it's just been a real privilege you know a couple of days ago I was at a veterans of a gathering them jail\nA down into solved and met some people used to watch the shows you know so ... we're so thankful for over the years the people that are really hung in there with us because we need more media\nProgram media on TV ... comment\nWell you brought your show was really the precursor to it when we talk let's talk about a mutual friend of ours somebody that you haven't talked to in a while but it's a very very close friend of mine we spoke about off air over the last few days and that's for example Mr Rob Pincus you remember watching Rob show\nOn uh from ... out there in Colorado a number of years ago su I\nKnow you gave birth to this stuff into that genre of television a long time ago and I want people to understand who we are talking to hear because it was you who who who are a lot of people look at as the the godfather of that genre of television on outdoor channel and everything else correct\n... well it ... it was due due humility I'm a ... problem but yeah uh and\nAnd yeah you can only bought you got you got to be careful if you take all the credit you might get all the blame you know what I'm\nSaying you know what I I think I played with that because when you look at the\nProgramming that you put out in the quality of programming that followed you I'd be more than happy to say that I take credit for that if it were me and also to take some of that blame because you were very instrumental\nIn creating that type of television programming it it of course it splintered off and we now have a number of other different TV shows from that but now now things are changing we're going to get well we've got about another three minutes in in this segment maybe two and a half so let's say that you're moving you did I mean how many how many radio shows you know thousands thousands\nAnd thousands of radio show where you are done trust your radio digital radio that's true of a new music goes motor sports we've have good old time at that you know you and I discussed it is so important what we're doing and and we will talk about this for combat surely have something\nReally exciting that you're going to be part of and uh\nBut you know what I'm saying you know what I Believe with that because when you look at the\nProgramming that you put out in the quality of programming that followed you I'd be more than happy to say that I take credit for that if it were me and also to take some of that blame because you were very instrumental in creating that type of television programming it of course it as splintered off\nAnd we now have a number of other different TV shows from that but now now things are changing we're going to get well we've got about another three minutes in in this segment maybe two and a half so let's say that you're moving you did I mean how many how many radio shows you know thousands thousands\nAnd thousands of radio show where you are done trust your radio visual radio that's true of a new music goes motor sports we've had a good old time at that you know you and I discussed it is sold or what we're doing and we will talk\nAbout this for combat should have\nSomething really exciting that you're going to be ... and ... ... it it's going to just add to the mix and you know you talked about the other us photo shows came after us because it's so critical that we have pro gun images because a lot of people are saying hey\nYou know we're surrounded waiting fight 'em anyway we go we got 'em right where we will McCain right this time of the\nYou know that's that's the truth that's very true statement we're surrounded we've got it right where we wanted we know right where\nThey are ... you know and that's and that's pretty much how I think a lot of people feel\nAbout where we are right now at least if you watch the mainstream lane string lying propaganda media\nYou know they're they're they hate us they've surrounded us and all that stuff but we're fighting our way out of this no doubt about it we are going to win because I Know you feel like I Do Janet Reno always prevail it might be one hell of a battle or a number of battles and it always is a number of battle but nonetheless uh\nYou know I I think freedom always prevail All right so some of the things I Want to cover with you when we come back we've got a lot of ground to cover\nFortunately my next two segments are are fairly good size\nSegment so we'll be able to spend some time there\nBut you know a real I Want to I Want to cover some of your your shows with you what we're talking about doing down the road want to talk about what tombstones doing down the road very important\nComing out of to do with the freedom day's coming up in June again I guess that'll be the case but before I go there are you in busy today are you into stone\nOh actually I'm looking over in the ... come down on the border\nSo that when we were well but we're actually based out of style and it is like\nYou said more of the most unique places in the world so a historically significant in the development of the Old West it in fact are the the Old West image around the world to soldiers actually bigger than life and it's all did a lot of uh you know\nA much to talk about there and and so a really it was just such a pleasure to meet you to see you and Allen there oh this past week\nYou know say it ain't so I say I am satellite\nRadio moment word because that meant that denotes a word that I Can't say unless I'm On satellite radio which is a very bad word you know found like radio moment where the media believe me I'm I'm believe me I've been on them and\nI'm a student of their hypocrisy in lives for well over a decade now we called out at every twist and turn we get\nBut yeah I think it's great to see you there and to be able to be bringing some of what you're going to be bringing from that area that as you mentioned is so rich in history and its captivated me for a number of years\nYou know you mentioned the movie's really fun stuff you know the original the tombstone movie in Nineteen Ninety three I Believe in Ninety four with Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell a little bit more careful than the others that you know Val Kilmer played a version of doc holiday and then you go over to the wire DARPA Dennis Quaid\nPlayed a little bit more I I think the wider movie it was a little bit more historically accurate because it covered some earlier aspects of his life and how they got their versus just show up there but really colorful history in that area that comes alive when you get there and as you know\nYou came to the area and when we were the right before we were ready to go to the airwaves on Monday This bomb\nAnd uh I don't know if the mayor was there when you got there or not but\nBoy that segment with him was just off the hook who I could have kept them for ten hours and talked about oh definitely hit on you know\nHe's fun to do the fun guy he's going to tell a friend of mine a dusty and gold and for that matter and and you're exactly right and you know what I was so proud this past year and now I'm looking forward to getting out here for the next freedom days but a dusting\nPaul than the others that you know Val Kilmer played a a version of doc holiday and then you go over to the wire DARPA Dennis Quaid played a little bit more I I think the wider movie it was a little bit more historically accurate because it covered some earlier aspects of his life and how they adopt their versus just show up there but really colorful history in that area that comes alive\nWhen you get there and as you know\nYou came to the area and when we were the right before we were ready to go to the airwaves on Monday This bomb\nAnd uh I

forward to get out here for the next freedom days but a dusty stood up for\nFor Arizona and ... tombstone stood up for the second amendment or in a mark\nUp but look where for climbing the second amendment say yes or\nNo no he he absolutely did when he read that and we read the proclamation on the show\nAnd I believe you're going to hear your I think we're going to hear Gordon read it in the third our as I as a replay that amazing find our from\nTucson but you know that made global news that was it did make news in Tucson that made news all over the world when when ah when Dusten stood up for the second amendment and Tuesday because tombstone people come there you got this little town of about two thousand people out in the middle of Arizona\nIn what most people say how they even find this place and people from all over the world make the pilgrimage there because of its rich history\nPeople go and show up and that's very very cool now let's talk about the freedom day's coming up in
