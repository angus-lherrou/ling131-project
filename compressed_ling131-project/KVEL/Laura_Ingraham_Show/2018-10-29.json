to that poll that's very very important right now go ahead and repeat what you were saying about that latest poll\nOn poll came out showing that an all time low America's wonder band so called salt rifles\nAnd that's after of course we've had a year of unbelievable attacks on assault rifles so the snake ever since the shooting in Florida and in the school or despite all that all the millions and billions of dollars that anti can groups have spent\nA in demonizing those particular firearms along with a you know all the media that that is the free media that ... that's been attacking them\nOf for the poll to come out with a like a giant jumped in our favor shows the American people are starting to get it\nThere is a U.S news and World Report\nOut on the twenty six article us gun control groups outspending pro gun forces on election let me give some numbers to you and I know you know these\nNumbers Alan but I really wanted to comment on this a lot of people will hear this and be very very concerned us gun control advocates outspent by more than forty percent gun rights groups on next month's congressional elections\nReversing the on our a longstanding dominance in spending on gun politics boosted largely by the personal fortune of billionaire Michael Bloomberg who this was referring to of course\n... who was benefiting entirely Democrats according to this these gun control groups including differs in every town for gun safety of spent twenty point two million on the elections well over the fourteen point once spent on pro gun by pro gun group led by the n._r._a. that's according\nFriday this past friday I went to the federal elections commission now Peter ... executive director of Giffords' says there's definitely a shift it was just a few years ago when people considered get this gun safety\nTo be one of politics is third rail now the opposite is true of course gun safety is mass\nFor gun control these people are so dishonest intellectually they can't even tell the truth about what they do less people find out and decide hey I don't want that asked that Paul Mr got leave just told us about reveals Allen\nShould we be concerned about these numbers\nYeah we'd definitely needs to be concerned about these numbers are numbers mean number of dollars that the uh opponents of gun rights are spending because it's going to impact ballot measures candidates for public office\nAnd you know overall it it has impact public opinion as well and we now have more anti commercials running on TV or in a in ads or then you'd have program was running for the first time in history over time that there is taken advertising told\nA so the bottom line is is that you know we need to worry about that and it's really hard I have not figured out the way for us to compete with it because they're getting money from several billionaires a year where they write a hundred thousand dollars for a thousand dollars a million dollar checks\nAnd I just don't have anybody like that and neither does the n._r._a. really and this isn't a problem when you figure out and figure out soon\nYou're right and I have and I will say it again publicly I volunteer to be the billionaire that helps I'm working on that I'll let you know how I may go take a listen this statement from the n._r._a. spokesperson Jennifer Baker concerns me a little bit\nWhile the gun lobby control is funded by a blank check from uh New York city anti gun billionaire the n._r._a. relies on millions of small donations from working men and women his money is no match for our grass roots organization\nAnd the the lead up to that wasn't NRA spokeswoman said Bloomberg's money would not overturned public support for the second amendment of the U.S constitution which protects the right to keep and bear arms ... I'm I'm not so sure about that statement\nBecause when you have people you just said coming up behind me\nYounger generation seen nothing but anti gun crap all day long it begins in the media knows that's why they do it why Bloomberg showing it it begins to drive that narrative that guns are bad doesn't it\nYeah and I don't really agree with that statement at all that's why we're seeing here like in Washington state on the sixteenth thirty nine and I get an issue on the ballot here are grassroots you know you know working with the in Iran and the speed of light keep and bear arms has pretty cold for a while we we've pulled up and all of us can even with polling data\nOn his anti get an issue if only to find this week three billionaires one day Michael Bloomberg dumped in six hundred thousand dollars for last minute media by ... do you help quote unquote for them to them over the top and I don't have these without dollars but in the media bias compete with it\nSo all we do have the grass roots and we can't tell you have more grassroots side does those advertising dollars or so the sixty second TV and radio spots have an impact as particularly on need it the more uninformed voter or the casual voter out there and that's the ... that's our concern so this does have an impact I Can't agree with you on that\nI Wish we had the money to compete and I feel a whole lot safer for winning I I'm hoping I graduated is can be strong enough to win on that particular ballot measure but if we don't win is approved his into putting his dollars at both the election\nWhat concerns me about that I agree with you on that statement I'm not real I wasn't it that statement concern me somewhat as I mentioned but here's really why because I didn't I don't want us to create complacency I think statement like that can create some apathy on our side with what we've got the grassroots look what the interests that they're not really worried about it my five boxes enough\nOr well I've I've just I'll just renew my membership next year and not worry about ... that's what concerns me about that and I know the honorary wants to keep that happy face on we all do but there comes a time when you got to say look guys\nOkay these people are out spend enough now three to one and we need to get off our dust we've got to get active yes we have grass roots but we need assistance here let's go now to sixteen thirty nine you covered enough of it but I just want to ask you one question as we're coming up to this ballot initiative\nThat six hundred thousand I'm just going to say this from what I just heard you say\nYou felt better last week than you did this week is that first statement [noise]\nOh yeah I had the money to compete with that certainly thousand dollars I I I feel as good as they get last week I don't feel it with that last minute money coming in from three big donors Bloomberg being one of those and you know one of the problems we have is we want to put a good spin on everything but sometimes you can't believe your own rhetoric a and sometimes that it it's better to let people know who they are the fat off\nYou know I always say that are done rightfully one election away from extinction and it's really true\nThat it absolutely is true and it's true every single election cycle it every single election cycle All right let me move to another topic with your quick we've had just a couple of minutes\nS a F joins California group suing riverside county sheriff overseas you W policies this is not the first rodeo with the second
