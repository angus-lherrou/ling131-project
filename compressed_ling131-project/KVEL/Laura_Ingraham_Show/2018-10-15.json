it works like a chap I'm able to bring you some amazing people that I Would not normally be able to sit down and talk with\nWhich is why we're doing here we are in the valley of Shon it's a little bit rainy but that's okay it's going to be really nice tomorrow and I'm sitting here talking to mark down my stroke skipped up makeup Jesus\nMe kind of live to tape right experimented with this at the gun rights policy conference a few weeks ago and it works like a champ I'm able to bring you some amazing people that I Would not normally be able to sit down and talk with which is why we're doing here we are in the valley of Shon it's a little bit rainy but that's okay it's going to be really nice tomorrow and I'm sitting here talking to\nMark ... get that make up Jesus a little bit closer okay you speak up a little bit louder if you what\nMy name is mark ... combat Vietnam veteran okay more than that I'm a\nConservative American patriot but more than that I Believe in God and I'm not ashamed or afraid to say it loud and clear and\nNor shows you know or should you and all of this ties together mark yes that was why I'm now in keeping your second segment because you are truly living walking breathing American patriot a hero in and I think everybody's eyes so I don't consider myself a hero or do we do those guys never came home but we do and we consider all of you heroes\nAnd I I Know how to access you know that's what makes you so humble and I hear that from a lot of people that I've talked to a lot of veterans combat veterans will say the same thing that's what's so awesome about you guys and girls just what it was what makes you guys a cut above the rest in in my eyes in my estimation\nThat very humble this after what you've gone through is in fact what makes you a hero if that makes any sense from my perspective\nThere's other people that sacrifice for this country and the blue silver and gold star families just write the blue than will boost our families their loved ones are in the war the silver star families their loved ones are wounded and they're working to try and get them back into the mainstream of life and the gold star families their loved ones have been killed\nAnd last Sunday in September as gold star mothers day the best kept secret in America made it absolutely and I tell the kids you know I asked them idiots could you just say thank you to these families on their day\nAnd they you know\nGiven more than they give the ground hogs you know and they don't even at this stage though we're at a point now where\nHistory I've uh I've a Thirteen year old son he's fourteen now just turned fourteen September thirtieth my daughter will be sixteen of November second\nAnd these kids I I'm finding that I'm having to teach them things that I learned in school that they're not being taught from my perspective it's entirely different\nIn today's schools but there were dying for I don't even know your kid's only I'm telling you right now they're worth dying for their that import so let's ask them\nThat there is a\nSymptom Eric has three or four percent of the world's population\nSo they had a Ninety seven percent chance of being born someplace else and they were God put them in this nation and it comes with a non ... and it comes with the responsibility\nThe whole freedom up to stand up for God and country and they don't they need to be taught that it's not they don't get everything for nothing\nWhy is why we're sitting here what segue this is just as a short segment unfortunately but why is what we're talking about now what makes where we are today such a vital part of where we're why are you a member of Arizona citizens defensively and why are you wearing a gun on your hip and fighting for our right to keep and bear arms right now with disabled\nBecause the more people that carry the bad guys are more wary of\nTrying to do anything they're not going to invade a house in Arizona because everybody carries most people have guns you go to New Jersey most people don't and so the bad guys now they're good they can they going to cost a woman\nBecause the chance of her having a gun or zero\nCompared to how many how many women carrying Arizona forget about it so just the fact that you carry isn't it isn't it isn't about that you're going to use the fact that it's there\nThen it was made for either the freedom and the right this is a state whose history I Love I'll be broadcasting from tombstone Arizona live on the Daily Show Monday and Tuesday following this program tomorrow when the day after\nAnd I love it I get out there once a year this is just the history of the state to state was built on the gun it was built on fundamental individual ism as Americans move West is was this was a rugged place even today right I mean this is\nAmerica here and wild wild west you know and he'd be\nBloomberg knows that he spending tons of money he's got us he's got a big giant sticker right on Arizona and he doesn't understand of course he doesn't but what we understand the idea that we understand that he wants to take that right from us and easy CDLs at the tip of the spear in fighting for that if he thinks\nThat if he could take all the guns away and nobody went to war there wouldn't\nBe in a while he or she wants to he wants to keep his own guns oh sure he regards have guns isn't it ironic that he stands there and talk to you you're shaking your head laughing and I've never met you before jak you understand the joke that Christie here yeah it's a job now so if he spent that\nTime and energy and even helping kids instead of screaming that he's going to take our guns away work on helping young people working in helping young people\nImagine the good he could do with tens and hundreds of millions of dollars that he's spending and trying to take away American writer kid\nA healthy breakfast every morning and that kid got up and could go to school and learn\nThe constitution and the bill of rights and how great America's freedom is and how many people are living in good right good condition he could do far more good\nWhat do you think you know at least he's on a path that he wants to take our guns away that of his mind I Can't stand the guy I make no bones about that every year I think I I find the irony in Michael Bloomberg to be absolutely hilarious if it weren't so dangerous because of the money that he's capable of spending I use this analogy\nThis is a guy who wants to take away sugar sodas wants to keep eating bad foods right you're shaking your head also is to actually control you know he's running as a Democrat he was a marriage is a Republican now he's an independent she says the guy that has no conviction\nBut don't you find it ironic he stands up on the podium at the New York hotdog eating contest every year while he wants to take away oh you know things that causes obesity while he's introducing when he was mayor anyway well he's introducing folks are going to ... shutdowns sixty five hotdogs in ten minutes\nYou know the whole irony of this thing gets me and and so with what difficulty it's this guy who go it's a typical rich guy who thinks because he made so much money he's so much smarter than everybody else all he did was smarter he was smart enough to make more money that will was little he gave up the guns that surround him when he was not\nNever he won't give up anything this security I bet you is it is out this far greater than most people\nHe's got an army is how they can afford it but he thinks because these that smart Martin and everybody we've got about a fallacy of the ... the left we've got about a dollar theater Democrat we've got about a minute Saudi are actually two armed American radio listeners and tell them why it's so important that they stand up and be heard and fight for these rights\nCarry a weapon and when you can carry it in an open area carrying an open area so that everybody can see that um does guns around and that's the bad guys can see you it's not about the good guys seeing you it's about the bad guys seeing how many guns are out there and they got to rethink how they're going to be\nUm frying they're evil and that's the deal the guns in the way and it's supposed to be because good people need to carry them more and more good people\nOn my job it was a real pleasure meeting you I wasn't planning on going I'm Glad I had the opportunity God works in mysterious ways there's a reason you were across the table or yeah when we were going to the segments I had planned on going directly to Mr got leaving opening this program but guess what we're\nAnd that's the deal that guns in the way and it's supposed to be because good people need to carry them more and more good people\nMarked on maestro it was a real pleasure meeting you\nI was applied on and I'm Glad I had the opportunity God works in mysterious ways there's a reason you were across the table oh yeah when we were going to the segment so I had planned on going directly to Mr got leave an opening this program but guess what where I couldn't I Can't think of a better way to have started it where we bring somebody in here who are you know I can say\nYou got a real you've got skin in this game brother\nOh boy do I do right yeah I saw some actress that I'm dealing with in a war doesn't go away\nYou said that it's been ... years and years and you feel you're just left Vietnam\nThe tunes don't city Marshall has to be on the show was where he was trying to make that work\nI've been through a couple marshals down there I Know a couple of deputies very well so when we get there we're going to check with deputy rattler sci fi rattlesnake can get into town marshal how 'bout that I bet you pull it off [laughter] I'm certainly going to try so that's going to be a tremendous amount of ... okay so here we find ourselves a VCD out\nThis is an important meeting a for well for reasons let's start with the fact that you gave them the grass roots organization of the year why\nWell if you look at the room here and you see what they are pulling off and the number of of you know supporters and members they've got at attending turning out in working for gun rights in Arizona you can see why they deserved it aren't very many grassroots groups in the country that can ... full of people if they've got sitting behind us\nUh their their grassroots were there you know I'm\nYou know they're the elbow grease and they put a put down in penalties of metal these guys really deserve the award that their their their track record last year was phenomenal and of course they got their work cut out for them this year with the election cycle coming up in this bad we're in Arizona ... maybe the key battleground states okay what controls the Senate\nBut let's talk about the it is it's it's control it gets battleground it's ground zero in a couple of different areas number one that control the Senate why\nWell obviously this is the Republican held seat right now ah and if they ... it it's a it's intense battle polls show he'll eat a cat it within the margin of error is the polling data this is one of the two seats the Republicans ... could possibly lose\nA and of course they lose both of them they lose control the Senate and gun rights and we're in big trouble in the Senate if that happens in all the nominees for the courts you know go down the tubes are this is ... this is critical so we're really in in the ... probably the key battleground state I'm into Arizona Nevada the two big ones\nTouching each other on the map and this is we're in part of the country that the Republicans cannot afford to lose if they want to keep control the Senate\nYou block it there's a lot I could go into here because Arizona when we think of Arizona we think of deep red conservative state we think of gun owning gun loving I'm just goes hand in hand\nWe also know battleground from another angle and that is Michael Bloomberg wants to take this state down this organization that we're sitting out here and all of which I'm proud life member of\nHas been working diligently behind the scenes for the last couple of years to put up a preemptive strike if you will across the bow to stop this ballot initiative and they've been pretty successful here legislatively would if we you know I'm going to ask you to are you telling me that they could turn blue\nYet could I mean uh\nTo be honest about the Republicans have been at each other's throats in disarray internal struggles battles\nSee McCain flake and other members of the party or I mean they pretty much ... in in a lot of cases have shot themselves in the foot or it's it's a really tough state right now for Republicans is that the demographics are changing as well\nWhen you look at the demographic changes and you look at the public and in fighting a it's a very easy to kick off the seat up it'd be it'd be a horrible lost the gun owners nationwide it\nWould be a terrible loss because you're do you would then start to see Arizona senators voting in favor of gun control or not supporting pro pro rights movement you know in the Senate should they come up and say for example if a concealed carry reciprocity which is now showing that there's still tables in the Senate\nWell it goes it goes beyond that you have the you know you're a Republican Senate candidate here supports gun rights Democrat would ban assault rifles ... she I mean there's a a Bloomberg proposal that she wouldn't vote for\nAnd Bloomberg is spending a ton of money on the say yes so this this organization in here which won the award as the grass roots organization of the year how many times now\nI don't know or they may wanna twice or this they they definitely want it this year right now I think that one at once in the past year\nI I in fact I Know they have I just don't remember recall when let's put it this way they've got their work cut out for them they've obviously got a very dedicated crew people here this is not my first rodeo here I've spoke here with this organization throwing three separate occasions\nAnd the room gifts for ...
