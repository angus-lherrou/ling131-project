just caught Ebola outbreak map dot com and that's really great resource for everybody that courage to go on there especially I was going to be voting for Trump because I see this problem in our country with the migrants\nWith diseases and things that are doing to our country and it's just going our country is it's been so long the wrong way and does its nationals on everybody even look at Kennedy JFK used to say it was a Democrat and he said that a\nBook and do what you said that you should get Kennedy is that we need to do\nWith what about the study care what America should care\nAbout and that's not it will ask not what you do to your country can do for you ask instead what you can do for your country was the most famous one\nYeah yeah that's that's what I'm thinking I Wish you all Americans care about our country and our borders and it's not that we can take a lot of Democrats like it's just being an American and as Americans we should care care about our borders and our country\nAnd what that was great why that is a great point because you're right President Kennedy who is a very different kinds of Democrats and the modern day progressive Democrats but that is very very true I Wonder what they would say about that that is an expression of national nationalism unlike any other isn't it\nAsk not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country\nWhat can you do for this nation we not for the world not for the United nations not for you know foreigners what can you do for this country that's your job that's your responsibility because it is about us burst nation first\nThat through nationals I mean there's not a dog whistle it's not some sort of a coded language it is simply a statement of I pledge and that's why I said this before I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America anybody who's ever recited that pledge using\nThis is where my allegiance lies I don't pledge allegiance to the flag of the United nations don't pledge allegiance to the flag of Canada or to Mexico where to France or Germany or to\nUh to um uh Switzerland or to\nUh to the Dominican Republic or to a Guatemala or anywhere else I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United states of America and that means I'm a nationalist there is no coat in it there's no racism and that there is no bigotry and now we need to stop this nonsense right now stopped letting the Democrats defined language to us\nDiane is calling us next from a Greenville South Carolina Thank you for joining us now and go right ahead\nHey how are you

how it's done in your state and vote now go on your lunch break there's hardly anybody there go on a Saturday I Know that in my state of Ohio My wife and I voted early or at the board of elections on

cast those votes right now do not wait for November six\nAnd by the way more Republicans are taking that advice early returns not returns in terms of results but in terms of turnout show that in a lot
