that is our religious rights under attack day in and day out\nAnd thank you so much for all of you who have made a tax deductible donation to the alliance defending freedom our friends and ATF you know about them we told you about how they helped Colorado Baker jak Phillip or try to keep them for being further harassed fire chief Calvin Cochran in Atlanta losing his job\nBut those cases and others like flower shop owner Baron Hill starts when things are just the tip of the iceberg ATF on guard all over America as new challenges pop up all the time and that's why ATF is so vital listed the ATF senior counsel Jim Campbell\nYeah we represent a promotional print or in the state of Kentucky uh he was asked to print messages that conflict with his religious beliefs and he declined specifically he declined a request to promote a a gay pride festival and he was sued for that and he had a local human rights commission that ruled against him\nAnd so now that cases all the way up

about to become an ex jak Philips Kelvin Cochran Baron Hill starts when Blaine Adams says it can happen to him in Kentucky it can happen to you\nSo those of us who cherish freedom that we see these ongoing attacks we just thank God every day for a wind spending freedom so what they do is they go and fight for these folks in a legal bills are expensive ... not the ... these people from bake shops to flower shops to print shops\nThat two hundred thousand dollars lying around in a fund to defend themselves or if they're religious liberty comes under attack\nSo that's why you would I Need to get

planted in our mind\nA it is necessary it is necessary to identify another type of profound in the bearing of false witness this is not\nJust politics talk shows that are but and you know political life especially in an election season are very much about um\nAbout politics about a green\nDisagreeing about various things so every day whether it's Larry or me here in the real effect or dot com pain free studios we sit here and talk about what the left believes what the right believes and that's fine and it's good and it's proper and then at elections are about who will lead us as we take a look at these are the various sides\nOf these issues but no one no one should do what I Am about to play for you know one should do to this level no one should take advantage wild wild ... started\nWhile the bodies were still on the floor that sent a guy that started I ... you could see it on social media it was there it was an opportunistic it was eggs or criminal behavior and um and it was\nTypical typical of today's left it starts with California Congressman Adam Schiff on CNN's State of the union\nNo one sets the tone for the president of United States and the tone that he says one of division off in one of hatred and this is now becoming a struggle about good versus evil and the president of the United states is evil\nHoward Dean really\nThis man was flames hatred were fan by a president who kept talking about this caravan of refugees has that favorite Harris\nI'm this is a um [noise] this is a triangulation a lot of people are making this this is sort of doubling down on not just intellectual dishonesty but but just disgusting levels of scapegoating that the\nPittsburgh synagogue shooter\nWas somehow spurred to action by the president warnings about the Caribbean\nThe thousands of people who are headed our way\nIn order to intentionally violate our borders that a president who is vigilant about that you somehow set the stage for this kind of a reaction I mean\nHow low\nWill these folks go and and and I think the answer is in\nIs the author who say training I Wonder why they are they're very very first thing that\nYou somehow set the stage for this kind of a reaction I mean how low will these folks go and and and I think the answer is in\nWhy is he out there who say train you country why there are very very first\nThing that the president didn't condemn the attacks in Pittsburgh and in the pipe bombs the very first thing the media did was blamed the president and make him responsible for these ridiculous\nYou can't start putting the responsibility of individual on anybody but the individual who carries out the crime he delivered on the promises he made and if anything I think that I ended up by the way that every single thing that comes out of the media Ninety percent of what comes out of the media is now negative about this president\nAmen amen and that's where our level of discourse has been dragged down\nAs you hear word afterward and page after page in speech after speech about how our our ability to get along just kind of been thrown into the toilet\nAbout how our level of discourse instability is all kinds of dashed against Iraq's an observation that you certainly can make is that because Trump won or because of a Trump tweet or because of some sharp elbows the\nSalty thing that he might have said it some rally are you kidding me is everybody that stupid reason our discourse has been dragged into the muck\nIs the reaction of people who hate him the reaction of people who cannot handle that he won the media have been biased for as long as many of us have been alive\nAnd this this is nothing new\nBut the level of hatred that's how you know the change is real by the way\nThe level of vitriol the level of venom when you have an entire dominant media culture walking around saying the president is racist the president is a hater how how in the world that how do you think Thanksgiving is going to do you how do you think your Facebook exchanges are going to go\nAnd I believe we're going to do it I Believe we're going to do it\nBecause some Republican voters are standing up for long held staunch conservatism others just wanted to deliver a rebuke to the sad and pathetic tactics of the left\nEither way I don't care vote Republican and thank you very much Mark Davis in for Larry
