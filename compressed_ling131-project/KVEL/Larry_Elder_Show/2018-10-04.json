downsides equipped to thicken it's fall back to focus on constructed proactive sense that I think they can do the unintended consequences because the problem is you select one particular population within a website\nAnd then he said that population they may not appreciate it but it was his editor what do you know selected\nThat can be a reaction which is quite negative things that people have pointed into position and the question is always did they get that because the quiet or on their merit and that's a bit of a sudden for anybody to deal with\nAll these here since I've been working with the fact that that come to the states and other than when it's very it's I think something needs to be done this I went in and force I'm within the last ... through the pipeline but we think that needs to be done in the ... the meeting that she was opposed to having it\nLike ... coming from Europe I think we're in a strange situation at the moment Web Russell deciding that that seems like a

and the oil companies are able to see that situation\nAnytime soon and so I really do that how they can say that we're talking about legislation rather than that said not to eat than these two or more gender bounds on board critical we do get gender balance over time but they're on the second is like that in company might take a little longer to get\nThat and set in areas where there are less than they do so as he qualified to take on that role in sudden factor but I didn't mean to say that we should stop that was encouraged people to get over that but I don't think legislation is the way to go at this point I think it probably\nSend the signal and or the that we actually get precious other down the organization the only place because we can't make a difference at this point and there's not that I taught and then culturally that should actually how all the way down the organization of course they need to grow the base of a strong\nCapable women who were actually able to what the way through organization quickly and efficiently and effectively but\nIn all honesty we do need a press out from the board down\nSo that we have bought them up on the top down approach I think that could be the most helpful way we can actually get that but we could look at different tools that people that we don't know ... years or something like that leads to this and that sort of a more cool so we find talented women no matter whether they might be\nAnd the question of quotas I must say that um it's a controversial\nOne because I've been out there trying to make progress especially in the natural services industry for ten years and sadly you know we haven't made all that much progress a little bit now more most recently\nBut that having been said I think that um if you force the issue by quotas you end up with unintended consequences undermining the industry a little bit and and the gender representation and so as a result I I Can't say that I'm On board with quotas but what I Do\nThink we need which is sort of what we're seeing here the pay is a notch because if there isn't some type of the pressure\nWith a perception that their consequences on the back and you know I think the excuses\nBut that having been said I think that um if you force the issue by quote as you end up with unintended consequences undermining the industry a little bit and and the gender

the pressure\nWith a perception that they're forensic places on the back and yeah I think the excuses for inaction running\nSo it's really incumbent upon all too I think with that little bit of pressure\nKeeping a spotlight on the issue is the type of thing that hopefully in that light light people feel that the needs a new and then once you actually start to get a more balanced representation shift a little bit you get to a tipping point and that becomes organic and it's not fulfilling so I Hope that that\nYou know what's going to happen in the near term without necessarily
