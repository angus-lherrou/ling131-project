being covered we're going to move very quickly and I want to read a comment first let me start with this kind of as I open up the previous hour in case you missed it I'll start with this I did a national radio program in Great Britain today it's it's not an I Do a lot of those on the BBC and and the international interviews after something like this happens they kind of\nReach out to me on that have been very friendly to them over the number of years so you know and I certainly don't mind doing a lot of talking to the British people most of them feel exactly the way you do\nIt's just they're elite mountainous at the top\nThat doesn't they just simply don't understand Americans freedoms and you're not going to convince them otherwise but it's fun to go round and round with especially when you know you're going to get ambushed\nParticularly because you've been on with this particular host before in the past but ah the article after my appearance on the show is titled or made I guess precedent on the LDC leading a leading Britain's conversation\nKevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter now it's even today in light of the Pittsburgh synagogue shooting Kevin McGuire smoke with mark Walters passionate supporter of gun rights and host of armed American radio to get his view and gun laws in the marketing adamant the stricter background checks\nWouldn't help the situation\nAs quoting me a background check look it up the background it doesn't look forward mark pointed out that he could name thirty mass shooters in America who had our past background checks quoting the again if a madman wants to get a hold of a God he can in America it's unfortunate but it's true it's a very complex issue mark and mark went on to claim\nThat a ban on assault weapons is not realistic and even claimed that he bought his first day our during the Clinton assault weapons ban which is true\nIt's easy to knee jerk reaction and say my God we have to band is in reality that's not going to work\nBecause they can't be bad they are already here millions upon millions of Americans are not going to turn in their firearms who have done nothing wrong and that's the vast majority of Americans I said as an American got only we hate to see those were the ones that want this to stop you claim\nHowever at this point Kevin seemed to lose his patient referring to gun supporters who have recently spoken out in defense of gun laws in the U. S. Kevin responded that the fifth of Americans with schools are intimidating the fault if they do not\nKevin ended the discussion by telling mark all I don't want your thoughts and prayers anymore they you know up on\nThey didn't say that it it didn't hung up on the edge of the interview and apparently unbeknownst to me went off behind my back which is proof positive that you've won the argument because these guys can't stay in the kitchen they like to go to the sandbox they they can't play with the big boys\nDo you have two minutes for a great tip concerning defensive firearms or the concealed carry lifestyle check out into the fray a weekly video blog hosted by Kevin ... editor of concealed carry magazine into the fray covers every aspect of self defense from legal and ethical issues\nTo the latest gear and tactics accurate direct and easy to share with all your friends you can find every episode of into the fray got into the fray video dot com that into the fray video dot com\nBoom bugs is the ultimate quicken acceptable handguns safe ideal for securing a firearm were not caring person our cutting edge technology and innovative safety features provide peace of mind will store and you're going to the next game this ...\nOr anywhere you might need to access with a simple way below fingers pressed him accustomed Pico the wave of an hour of ID card above the gun bucks or ... seconds\nThe unsafe ideal for securing a firearm we're not hearing on your Bruce of our cutting edge technology and innovative safety features provide peace of mind will store here in gun on a nice day in this ...\nOr anywhere you might need less access with a simple swipe linger pressed him a ... or the wave of an hour of ID card above the gun bucks opens in seconds our modern design a sleek lines not only make it a great addition to any space but it's the perfect reason\nTo bring your everyday carry guns out from ... in the closet basements safe\nAsking yourself my conceal carry weapon feeling the gun bucks the answer is yes the gun bucks fits most full size hand guns with room to swear for extra magazines or bleed and other items you Gary for protection\nThe gumbo mix was designed to be you're going to guns and he was absolutely the best alternative are fast unreliable and gun storage visitors for gun bucks none come more information than to buy today\n[noise]\n\nUm [noise]\nMy my Gallagher you're listening to harmed American radios monster broadcast now by mark ... by the end of the line\nLast day Wednesday ten thirty one has to like get the range with a brand new gun you'd better hurry up USCC a wants that to happen for you they want to get your free gun this is your absolute last chance to win or giving away a different got every single day but it all ends Wednesday so you're almost out of time you got to hurry on this one just tax harm\nTo the number eight seven to two two and get entered right now and it's not just one gun you could get up to twenty four chances to win that gun each day could be twenty four cameras locks eggs could be whatever could be a are Fifteen who scary I Know\nBut they're all gone Wednesday oh you have to do is tax armed A.

R. G. Love to read your emails All right let's go back to a W. R. Hawkins a W. R. Hawkins\nI I gotta go back to Chris Murphy for just a second okay\nBecause here's what Trump said and you pointed in there you pointed out in your piece if they had protection inside the result would have been far better this is a dispute there will always exist I suspect\nBut if they had protection inside the synagogue maybe it could have been a very different situation okay what's what's wrong with that what did Chris Murphy take exception to win that statement come again keeping in mind listener that he is a man that is protected by guns everywhere he goes in DC what's up\nWith what he said is he goes Trump's position is you know uh to counter dangerous people with on people that are opposites she used to just be sure dangerous people never get done well that's state sale\nBecause that's a fairy tale he goes on to say Trump's position works in the movies opposition works in real life that's all I\nSee maybe we'll get in real life wasn't it\nIt in real life it wouldn't work Sunday right because this guy has numerous background check chips past one is you know just ... permit a and so you know we get a guy who's been ... been vetted and it's\nTo your point that you were actually making when you started your show a background check looks backwards if there is no criminal history than a person who plans to most evil date in the world can walk into a gun stores smile I'm by no problem\nBecause there's no criminal history to be found in the background check and uh so Murphy doesn't understand his background checks don't work in real life they work in the movies gun free zones don't work in real life they work in the movies having a large congregation of elderly\nCongregants who are defenseless setting together on a Saturday morning that doesn't work in real life that works in the movies you got to have someone there with a gun and you can take out a bad guy to come to you Chris Murphy is a lunatic\nChris move Chris Murphy is also a liar he knows better he's also a hypocrite because he is protected by gone to the capital he understands that he knows that he's just intellectually dishonest as the rest of the socialist party is in today's day and age who speaks particularly on this topic\nFor they know not what they say now interestingly and I don't I'm not trying to catch off guard has has nothing to do with what you wrote a over the past week or today by any stretch but I heard the nine one one calls coming in or I or I heard the police chatter\nRadio chatter when one of the officers were it was responding saying there's automatic weapons fire\nAnd that went out over ... you know to the rest of the officers ten thirty eight automatic weapons fire or was there automatic weapons fire there am I missing something\nNow unless you're telling me that uh yeah they are Fifteen and then what I understand they are Fifteen a couple of blocks that even at three o'clock so I'm not sure but\nYeah you're dealing with semi automatic found out about\nThis happens all the time ... and ... and with that also probably wasn't on purpose but with the gun control the Louis you know Hillary Clinton when she was good you'll remember able to\nCall it used to say that one of the reasons you need a vote her will stop people from coming to school with automatic weapons you know right by my mind out of my mind I don't want to make your relatives that had\nNever happened so you know let's see they want to use just just like Murphy talking about semi automatic rifles they want to use the phrase ... to ... ... scared of the few people who they can scare with their language\nAnd uh you know again I Am not trying to say that police officer did that but uh that's just where we are society you know people use the wrong terminology\nYeah and I guess we're all guilty of it from time to time you know I had the interview with the dopey McGuire over there and I can't come home and do the guy you know he's entitled to his opinion and we have fought on the radio we go back and forth and we don't like each other and that's what makes it fun so\nBut you know I I catch myself to you\nKnow it's impossible not going to sit here and try to correct the guy on the phrase out your the terminology when I've got four minutes on a radio interview because then it turns into a Piers Morgan type deal\nAnd it just disintegration I Want people to hear what we're trying to say and but you know I Know somebody out there right now is screaming at me AWOL if it's not an assault rifle make sure you call it that we do we attempt to do that all the time sometimes there are even bigger points that we have to get out without turning the argument away which is what sometimes that would do\nAll right you know what let's move on from Chris Murphy he's just to sell it in the lunatic\nAnd he's a hypocrite and he's also very he's a very dishonest man is what he is\nBut we already talked about you have another piece law enforcement synagogue attacker legally owned his guns I think this is important for one reason\nBecause doesn't that go that headline alone says it all I W are that's what goes to the heart of why we have a right to defend ourselves because we understand that evil exist evil chooses the time and place to become evil\nNot us but and we have a right to defend ourselves from\nI think this is important for one reason because doesn't that go that headline alone says it all I W are that's what goes to the heart of why we have a right to defend ourselves because we understand that evil exist evil shoes is the time and place you become evil\nNot us but we have a right to defend ourselves from it because we are powerless to even identify it aren't we\n[noise] true true you know there's there's something I'm trying to call her the whole is I think what I write\nI I Know what I Do I write news but I also want in my heart to educate people\nThat are and there's a quarter I'm coming to terms where I can somehow get people to think about the fact that there is no substitute for freedom I'm not trying to be posted on a it's very simple control a lot of apple substitute for freedom and if you think it is that he didn't pay attention Saturday or you didn't pay attention to Parkland\nOr you didn't pay attention to Santa Fe high school a cake twenty eight the where you didn't pay attention at the church in Texas November fifth one Seventy and I keep going but a gun control is not\nA valid substitute for freedom because gun control priest poses that if we limit everybody's freedom\nAnd certain crimes will go way it does not work that way what happens is when you limit my ability to exercise my God given right you put me in an unnatural position\nThere had been a member of that congregation on Saturday I would've come under fire and the senseless and somehow we have to realize that lesson that we can't ... every time we embrace gun control where we need to or not we're saying this for a substitute for freedom folks there is no\nGood substitute for freedom there is not one that works and that's why our framework went out of their way to hitch a second look\nWell said I'm not even going to stop that is the excavation without a perfect place to take a break you know I I got to say this on another note that when it comes to\n... studio Capitol Hill one American news network I posit Senator Bill Nelson on gun control calls for universal background checks on\nGun sales Bill Nelson is in\nIt now you take that right to the bank why can I make that statement because the individual in Pittsburgh as we have pointed out to you for the last half hour now heading into forty minutes\nPast his background checks so ask yourself this question Florida\nWhat the hell is Bill Nelson talking about\nAnd if you get a chance to ask him yourself and ask him what to ask him to tell you what gun control will work he cat he'll do what Kevin McGuire did in Great Britain he will pack up his toys and leave the sand box because he can't play with the adult\nA W are sorry I had to go off on that when I saw that and I paused it on my monitor let me get that off my mother so I don't go into an remark\nAbout All right we also now this doesn't surprise me either California Democrats will use and New York Democrats will use anything they\nCan a W. R. Hawkins won't they to push more gun control in their States isn't that true\nRight that's true how many California Democrats running for office right now are using the Pittsburgh shooting push more gun control and it's I mean California listening to the show here's what you got to think about these people are running for office they're not in office\nIs ill campaign like this for gun control what do you think they're going to do once they're you know you don't need this you're the California is already in the time it's already over the edge on gun control it's ridiculous\nAnd if if there's somebody who thinks one more gun laws gonna matter I mean they're a they're not bright or be there an audio law which means they're immune to factor like just having the gender and I think by and large that's ... that's the case with gun control over\nWhat you know you you asked if you actually you pointed out in a statement\nAnd I ask a question and that is in your piece about Democrat Bill Nelson on this very topic I felt that was interesting when I saw that headline and I saw him on the television I just decided to snap on it for a moment\nBut here's what you point out in your opening statement your your piece is titled Democrat Bill Nelson wants to implement gun controls already in place California as a W are disappointed that you can't do any more\n... you just can't you just simply cats\nNelson wants to implement gun control already in place that's the key and here's what I W are says to open up to open up the ...\nBill Nelson Democrat of course in Florida wants to implement gun controls that are all ready in place and are almost always the means by which mass public attackers get their gun\nSo it wants to implement gun control already in place that's the key and here's what I W are says to open up to open up the ...\nBill Nelson Democrat of course in ... in Florida wants to implement gun controls that are all ready in place and are almost always the means by which mass public attackers get their guns what do you mean by that\nNow I mean if you go back to go back ... Columbine a or a if\nYou will stay in the twenty first century just stay in the twenty first century\nI Can't think of a high profile public attack or the attacker acquires guns in some way other than background checks\nLiterally the the two exceptions the two exceptions or the ah mall\nShe mall shooting in Washington state and Newtown and they're exceptions because of those cases the individual Stoller guns\nAnd murder so I wanted to take a take a hold of them to I Want to make that very clear but up out of that [noise] people\nWho people who shoot up places they go pass background check to get there and so these these these checks the worst is the only thing they accomplish is what the Democrats really\nAnd that is they make the process bond ago just a little more bird some and it does cause some law abiding citizens just not to bother because they don't want to go see if that's what the Democrats really want they want to slow down to\nBuying a firearms they don't want them in anyone's hands when they say they're just to get criminals owning them they're not telling the truth they don't want anyone to have a gun\nYou better than you better believe that you better believe that they also point a lot of anger at hunters\nAnd hunters who face death threats for shooting animals legally on a hunch will go there to cover it all back right after that when they do if you are on the right ...\n...\n...

their their noses at us when they're defeated\nCourtrooms in Chicago is than to choice for that for many many many years of course ... wasn't going to take it\nAnd as a result won both of our cases it was great to have her here\nAnd also of course a W. R. Hawkins and the second hour where we went through and had a lot of fun with him to going through all of his writings at Breitbart of course I opened up the provost programs or excuse me both previous hours with my surprise call I got this morning from\nBritish radio and Kevin McGuire show over on LDC obese I guess it's just an obesity let me just double check and make sure I'm getting the right one or it is a yeah L. L. Y. L. D. C.\nAnd Kevin of course a very popular journalist and longtime radio guy and journalists and pundits over in Great Britain and he says anti against the day is long I've gone around around with it before\nThey called me out of the blue or Fifteen minutes later I found myself on the air with him earlier this morning and as expected the I knew he was going to try to pot me from the left and that's exactly what he did he can't stand my responses leak you can't argue and of course he did what most liberals who lose arguments do he got\nMad and hung up on me and then attacked me\nAfter I was off the air with him apparently and I know that from reading the column that made\nA some news over there today there's a column Kevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporters do read it Kevin McGuire clashes with American gun rights supporter down at the bottom you'll you'll enjoy the column\nAnd there's also a link to about a minute and twenty four seconds of my segment with him I played it in the first hour and then at the bottom is a comment about how ah the host was incredibly rude and ignorant and that after I thoroughly\nDestroyed him in his argument slam down the phone and went into a tirade behind my back and\nOf course the comments are also mentioned that I was in the American way of course was polite courteous and gracious throughout it you know it's interesting because I've done a lot of British media over the years a lot some of it some other attack ambush style stuff from others they genuinely the the they're fascinated\nMaking their phone I don't worry about anything that evening on right now by phone and said it may have an email we have a TV Tonight tonight ever need to protect my comment among them from Canton\nTasers still defending the leading

be one of the root causes I got tired of a black\nThough when I got tired of waking up with headaches all hours of the night\nSo I tried them I just wanted to work and here's where the Michael Dell

a little bit of spring water as I get over this cold I Apologize in advance for scratchy throat you might hear me cough if I Do I Can't help but I'm not going to keep me back and hit the mute button I Do apologize\nFor that so just bear with me I appreciate that very much want to play something here John lots of talking with Dr John Lott\nCrime research dot org and very quickly we give you some of his books that you're what you're going to want to read the war on guns arm of yourself against gun control but I think I've told John on the program before I one of the best books he's ever written as far as I'm concerned I've got it marked up like a like a kids' school book\nI Love it a more guns less crime course third edition of biased against guns and on and on you can find all of their crime research dot org let me go back over to John's Twitter page and want to play this for you today Dr John ... thoughts on the mass public shooting at the Pittsburgh synagogue entertain you hear what John smokes on this for a minute thirty second cyclists\nAnother mass public shooting our hearts go out to those who lost loved ones in France today for extending garbage hair\nThank God we have a president who understands what can be done to stop these attacks fifties killers purposely seek out those places were victims aren't allowed to defend themselves big gun free zones service maintenance for these attacks\nThat virtually all of these mass public shootings keep on taking place in areas where victims aren't allowed to defend themselves\nWhen he signed up in front of schools churches and synagogues there weren't killers the victims might defend themselves we need to have them have permanent concealed handgun so that the\nKillers don't know who it is it might be able to go and stop the synagogue today said that they could not afford year round security that it was just too expensive\nThey that they could only have it at high holiday\nWell oh I Want people to carry permit concealed handgun it's one way an inexpensive way to go and solve that problem\nPeople need to understand the dangers of these gun free zones that these gun free zones make it attractive for people to be the killers to attack and it makes it easier for them to go and kill people\nJohn is straight up common sense to me and I've known you a long time and I can hear the frustration in your voice when you were taping that am I right were you you sounded frustrated and you sounded kinda angry am I right\nI mean I Want to try to do something to stop these attacks and I don't know how anybody can look at how these killings keep on time after time picky targets were victims aren't able to defend themselves\nYou know just a couple of days ago last week there was a mass public shooting or what could have been a mass public shooting at a Kroger grocery store\nYou can talk and everybody from meet the press to Jake Tapper on CNN\nThat up today a but what they failed to know in any of those discussions is that it ended because a concealed carry permit holders stop the attacker they're\nIt's so you know these guys are they have they use the quotes on the shows about you know don't shoot me I'm a white guy white guys don't shoot white guys but they don't put that don't shoot me part there\nThey they don't put obviously the killer who is out there killing Black Sea was stopped by a white concealed carry permit holder\nOr when he saw the permit holders was pointing his gun Adam and ordering them to stop he uh he made those comments but his first comments were you know don't shoot me\nAnd and you know I I just view it is amazing by us that these guys could bring up this case\nToday multiple times and no one wouldn't mention that it ended because there was a permanent holder yeah\nAt the same time they're attacking Trump on these shows\nFor somehow believing that letting somebody have a primary concealed handgun it's a synagogue I could've save lives\nAnd you know I assume they realize that they brought it up and contacts there would be hard for them to go and criticized Trump at the same time during the show\nAnd just given what other example I was just reading the New York times uh from today a earlier and are they talked about Trump's discussion about gun control laws as an assertion okay they use the word asserts\nFor them to go and criticized Trump at the same time during the show\nBut I just give it or the other example just for him in New York Times uh from today a earlier and are they talked about Trump's discussion about gun control laws as an assertion\nOkay they use the word search they don't do that for the Democrats were talking about the need for more gun control laws on the same article\nAnd you know these guys have such blinders with regard to this you know as you say it's common sense to me but I was chief columnist for the United states sentencing commission\nI must have read through a thousand trial transcript and I have to tell you no one can read through all those criminal cases and not come away with the view that these criminals\nFly to pick easy targets\nYou know they may be kooky or dumb or whatever but they're not so stupid that they don't try to pick easier targets in the same thing is true with these mass public shooters they may be\nCrazy in some sense but they're not stupid they want to try to kill us like people are\nSo they want to go to a a a venue where they know victims aren't going to be able to defend themselves because they know the longer it takes\nFor somebody at the scene to a ride with a gun then more people they're going to be able to kill\nSo yeah I guess I Am frustrated but I'm\nFrustrated because on one side they seem to think that they have all the moral authority that they're they call for laws that either had no beneficial effect or actually cause harm you know these gun free zones are wanting to say all of that and yet\nWhen a when these attacks occur they want to posture as all people who are willing to do something well my responses yeah you're willing to do something but let's do something that actually works let's do something\nThat actually matters it wouldn't make people safer you know\nThere's so much meat in what you just said I could take the rest of the hour whether it was quickly I'll go to a point out the media when you were talking about the media\nThey won't because it doesn't fit their narrative that's why they leave out that portion of course you know this was talking to you what you heard John Say about the Kroger shooting we're going to be talking about that on our director radios daily defense tomorrow in fact\nAnd probably on Tuesday as well but as John Locke pointed out on his Twitter page and you can follow him that John are locked junior on Twitter by the way to get all this information real time as he puts out it's a great great Twitter page\nBut he points out stuff and I was doing the same thing at ABC and the just eliminating the fact\nThat he white concealed carry permit hold her into the pack and he goes on to tell you when it's weak in what Colum Lynch doing it that he wrote about how the headline could be totally different\nHow it could be white concealed carry permit holders saves wax from should I mean it's just that the media narrative your listener is what drives us we talked about this together for so many years and they're just very dangerous the way the game that they are playing in the way the media handles this for a lot of different reasons when we come back\nI Want to ask John's opinion about what the Pittsburgh mayor sat and I do want to go back to the homicide rates where we stand will cover that I promise we'll get there\nBecause we see lots of different numbers people stand them out all the time oh the u._s. ranks number one you guys have the worst mass shooting right in the world the homicide rate in America's if more people die by gun violence in American anywhere else in the world you lead the world and it's disgusting you just need to repeal the second amendment and get over that was for months gets\nBut that's not true and I've seen everywhere from us ranks anywhere from first to Ninety second when it comes to this where do the numbers actually fall\nRight well I mean I have a very long discussion about the some of my book the war on guns are basically give a rough idea about this stuff\nLook um when you look at the data for all countries around the world or the United states in terms of homicides ranks below the average and it ranks below what we'd say is the media which is kind of the halfway point half the countries are above and below\nIt we like rank even low or if we knew the truth to it or some of the worst countries don't report a homicide rate data and even some many of the ones that do report it why you know it's not just Chicago and Philadelphia which is ...\nFor four and half the countries are above and below\nIt we like rank even low or if we knew the truth data some of the worst countries don't report a homicide rate data\nAnd even some many of the ones that do report it why you know it's not just Chicago and Philadelphia which had histories of of tampering with a murder data you know there are many countries around the world Venezuela others that we could name\nA which have you know taking it to even much greater extremes\nAnd I'm a and the other thing is uh most people think that homicides and murders of the same\nOr not a most countries don't affect almost no other countries outside the United states\nA couple of the places report murder writes a\nBig difference between murder or homicide is that homicides include justifiable homicides United States has relatively more justifiable homicides than most countries\nBut it seems to me you shouldn't be including though there's a big difference between somebody killing a victim and let's say a civilian who is trying to stop this up for being raped or a police officer who is trying to stop the cry\nFrom occurring uh uses their gun to go and kill a criminal those are two different cases and I'm not sure I really want to like the two together but\nPutting that aside most of the comparisons that people make around the world involved firearm homicide sort of feel that firearm homicides will way higher or much were well above the media were pretty close to the average um but\nThere's a reason for that and that is not is that in that it ... about half the countries in the world don't report firearm homicide data they just report total homicide did\nSo the reason why we look so bad when it comes to firearm homicides and just you remove all the top countries from the range there is one reason why gun control advocates like to always put the discussion in terms of firearm\nHomicide rate across country and a\nUm [noise] so uh you know it\nYou know there are other issues I can go into but ah you\nKnow ... well that's a good what's a good place to stop because the clock is ticking down on us on this break here we've got one more segment but I it's interesting to me too because I Want to ask you about something else when we come back and then we always hear the term\nOut of developed nations ... of all the developed nations in the world and I get to thinking well what about is Brazil developed nation is Mexico developed mission wire\nThat seems almost races to me what about all those that don't their lives matter why don't those statistics count a country as a country as a country and those numbers are numbers are number so I Want to ask you about that when we come back to and then I just kind of want to give some predictions from you if we can\nIn the last remaining segment last few minutes that we have back with John Locke right after this don't go away\n\n\nThe magic you're walking through a parking lot that dust your with your children as you approach your car you see a large manned closing in something seems wrong something is wrong you can only move in front of your kids in turn towards the attacker\nYour mind flashes back to everything you've learned the man is now thirty feet away you don't make a movie yet but you can feel the weight of your nine millimeter on your hip\nYou hear yourself constantly issue the command stay back and then it happens the attacker understands what only criminals can comprehend he has picked the wrong target he quickly turns around\nWhat's wrong says your child as you get in the car nothing nothing's wrong I mean everything's
