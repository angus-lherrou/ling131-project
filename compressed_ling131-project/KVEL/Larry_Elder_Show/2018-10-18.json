{"month": "10", "state": "UT", "station": "KVEL", "content": "Sides if president they're digging also I think it was done I think is done through the day he uh he has done enough to watch but he was on the bench for that whole defensive series yeah big enough just watching them I say I pray for as under center ice formation\n\nAnd he's going to roll out and throw he's got a man and it's behind them and nearly picked off after the election and it's like the plate\n\n[laughter] funny one is down I think that's right Chris obviously these down on that play for the you stuck in the second to give up and ... get up and one of the sale hills defenders I hit him you know just look down and I'm like it's going to help them up and washed away\nOh my goodness I don't think there was any malice amount though for still for twenty eight I don't think the clock even ran for that play twenty eight six\nThe score second attend as it is not got past the defender was all over the player though I formation under center you got to tell a gardener as a tight end on the right\nAnd he's going to head off Jane hearts trying to get around the right side just no blocking you does get back to a lot of scrimmage that's all dirt and sand\n[noise]\n\n... starting ten ball in the right hash four minutes marked in Raleigh a third down there's only been about ... not even thirty seconds really gone on the drive so far\n\nRight formation right has shifted the press under center and he's just throw he's got a man and its other gardeners\nBoy it's tied to dump it took a complete it just seems like there's no connection between quarterbacks and tied in fact that's only a seven year old from really quick and it just was\nNowhere near ...\nReturned that little tight and dumb and it's nowhere near him that's twice dig into San jose for as there's just no connection between quarterbacks tied in\n\nSalem hills so it looks like it's a minimal rush on this point yeah just a few ... is the fallout it hangs up there forever and a fair catch called and probably get picked up ... that that\nThat should be a penalty the advances or write a Salem hills does pick up the formal\nBut because of the ... kind of catch called\nThey blow the play dead as soon as it's picked up by a Salem hills film hills person so that's to fumble is our number one one time he lost it and the other time just now he was lucky enough to have one of his other players right there is not used for all over that first attempt failed hills three thirty three second quarter\n\nAlright waiting on this uh waiting on the rest to say it's okay to go hang on the SAT looks like they're going for the jugular right here motion left or right from the slot man so there's more to the right quick quick throw that a lot man\n\nAll right waiting on this uh waiting on the rest to say it's okay to go\nTake empty sat looks like they're going for the jugular right here in motion left to right from the slot man so there's more to the right quick ... wrote that slot man and he's breaking through is on the sidelines only a couple of years Scott\nThere is a flag down the field so he gets to the Eighteen yard line but they are going to bring it back they started the drive at the forty nine yard line right there maybe I didn't mention that but it was that the forty nine yard line first in China and the gets the Eighteen but they're bringing it back\nA\nLot of penalties on sale and hills\n[noise] so\nThey're bringing it back is it a spot foul or is it a if it's a ... it's actually going to be like a first and eights because it was twelve yards down field and yeah they are doing a spot style so\nIt might even just be a first intended it almost looks like he started a through line of scrimmage brought me that the first time marker and now it's going to be back at blind a scrimmage so I think it's just a replay of first attend really\n\nAnd we have a time out on the field first a first time out for us so let's take a one minute break three twenty four second quarter clock twenty eight six down hills already it's\nMoving nutritional manufacturing company and then you would do is to me that he won't be in a company in his round is one of the lines ruined gas and you went to high school were and the Utah Jazz\nAnd get re Giuliani sponsoring mostly to strengthen the community by buying locally and

and my mind\nAnd then getting onto the main men meaning gun right there on one lane annual entertain named Raymond little savings in Myrtle all ages Brian Gorman\n... with the first in twelve so I guess it was two yards behind the first time mark or with a holding penalty quarterback just sitting there gaps are trying to throw you just trying to air it out and he hits the guy at the ten five touchdown\nYeah they're just trying to they're just going for the juggler but it looks like there's another penalty so bring it back\nSo it's not a touchdown until we see the uh I mean that quarterback she was dancing in there you know in the park and just waiting to throw the ball used by as well as play a big umbrella trends right now they're just going for the score\n... cornerback should just be back it up I Know they'll throw the underneath a couple of times but yeah Alex lodges like not a hold on me what what are you love the reaction when they're just kind of like not me and it's I think it's in the backfield too so this is not just going to be second\nOr first in twenty two I think it's gonna be first in like twenty something bigger than that let's see\n[noise]\nDid they say it's a personal south maybe I totally missed and in fact I was taught saucer you know it has to do something with him you know used to play with these guys and kind of acting like a little trader [laughter] come into sailing hills and now the talk is that he's going to go back to you want it for basketball season doesn't make a an alpha sense but\nYou know you could tell their self that you know there's there's more to this game and it might even be the odd foster factor but\nIt is first in thirty one guy that was a Fifteen year penalty\n\nQuarterback scrambling he's holding on to the ball he's running out and you have to catch up to them and it's going to be a second and I don't know twelve or something\nThis was a pretty good run of about Nineteen yard I I don't think it was a quarterback I think it was actually one of the running back out of the actual number eight or one of the guys who you know high fiving for knocking out big enough I think they could oaks is going to actually try to come back he's he's jogging on the sideline they might have cleared him of concussion but uh\nI'll keep an eye on that for you fight so it is a second and twelve as they got Nineteen yard on that play and there at the forty nine now that the ah where they are at the forty nine yard line yeah two yards behind the original line of scrimmage was which was the other forty nine motion from the plot meant less to write\nQuarterback screen past due that man swing past I should say at a nice hit by Jane or not the guy down\n[laughter] you're celebrating a past celebrating a nice it right there and it's going to be thirty twelve boy they read that because they they ran that played just six plays ago where the man goes in motion and then they swing tests and then the guy that Jane hard hit right there and made him drop the ball\nSo completely ... is the same guy ran that Ninety eight yard touchdown off the kickoff so\nJaded for next loving that moment and you know maybe the our foster factor here is you know given the use a little bit of adrenalin because this by no means is the worst game that you have to play this you're selling hills just\nI mean besides are obvious strengthen size they're they're not faster a whole lot\nThey uh they're not playing as well as the scores from their other games might indicate quarterback keeper the Siamese alone he might make it all the way Jane works does catch up to him about twenty five yard line momentum takes them down to the twenty two so it's gonna be first and then\nFor the Salem hills a sky hogs the way the game's going you almost wonder if a\nA foster she's a stay out here you can tell he's just trying to rub it in and you can tell the youth are taking exception to\nIt\nSo first in ten from the Internet and I'm saying that because I'm right in front of the play right now I can hear some of the things that are being said\nAt the end of players and the celebrations and what not a shock at first attempt for sale and hills and they're going for the end oh no quarterback get around it looked like he was laid back like he's going to run and he has taken ... is still not being caught touchdown boy he just ran from the left has all the way to the right\nAnd our gas it boy you know for for as much as they're not really like playing the used to be better than the other team it seemed like number six in fact dance in front of the eight so I like dude do you have no chance of the playoffs what are you doing there is a flag on the play though so hold on a sec\nYour oh get out or catch what's your\nStarting ten from the fifteenth so you can score like starting to move back to physicians behind the end zone\n\nSo now it's down but if they don't get it here I Wonder what they'll do they get off the shock and if you sat three high on the short side that you are not use lots of them got three now in the light side to on the short sighted which is the right side they can also chalk it up here we go\nHe's rolling last just thrown into a place for down seven seconds\nWorked out of ten term second All right so let's see what you're still\nYou're going to kick it off I think they can also going to the end zone that they're going to go for the ends on fourth and ten cents\nOn the fifteenth like they can't get a first down they can't call a timeout but they got to do a quick 'cause sometimes for a place like seven seconds so\nWe're like read of the one of the last one in the backfield with their you know where it's worked out of time from the Sistine throne you talk retro sovereignty and they know\nIs that\nThey're knocking dig it out when I stop targeting tried people's personal Robin the passer four seconds left burned down yeah you watch ... D sad for sale mills high five each other after knocking the quarterback out earlier and now they're just trying to hurt people just trying to hurt\nSome class guys that's\nAll I Know they are and that's why I'm Talking really Laos everybody hears they're being around or being impartial argue play other teams that can certainly find enough and then actually clean\n\nLast player the quarter they can also drowsy talk clock Don\n... why would they complain about to hop is over itself thirty five to six stories yeah the second quarter I start anything special like I'm coming or anything so

it was a shortcut anyway they're going to start their\nDrive from about thirty thirty eight yard line so first at ten forty Salem hills sky hot around thirty eight yard line\nDid what they do here see what the U.

and ... yeah they do watch it hard to talk about is the guy there first ... minutes to tackle\nAnd they are finally gang tackling um about I don't know ... yards down field so that we passed from the motion guy gives them a second and to just short of that deal\nAbout the thirty forty six yard like the second or two from the forty six forty eight for first [noise] the blocking\nIt looked like it changed a little bit on that swing past hit hard man that one on one of those other three years left to right now motion\nOr right the left again this week pat type a plus but the quarterbacks just throw it caught it forty to fumble and they're going to call it a complete that got caught in complete so good you are you can't be all the ball\nJane Harman excellent hit on one of those places other three years left to right now motion a right to left again swing past type a plug but the quarterbacks just marketing to throw up caught anti forty two but formal and they're going to call it a complete they're going to call it incomplete\nSo good these are you came down with the ball the fences around them a number twenty five for selling hills down to twenty yard line but he does drop the ball so it's a complete [noise]\n\nOne thing I mentioned earlier in the game and the the quarterback those are those the ones either way over throws that are under throws it when he when he was in a hurry and ah so the more I got to be ready to adjust on thirty five six the score it as a bird and two and a pistol which means they're probably just gonna run the supplemental\nThan they are the it's a\nWide open hall opened number twenty four seven hills out of balance a forty hour long it'll be first in ten [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo inside you territory forty hard line first and then um yeah they're actually moving it up to thirty nine which you know not not a horrible spar they're under ... for a quarter to receive the side one of the formation down the quarterback\nAnd it's growing less ice thrown in an arrow out\nA quarterback next to tackle that chasing ... about five yards down the field is going to be second and five\nMaybe second employers that may may have been a six year

into the into the first time we've seen that from Sam hills today they usually kept it pretty short so do you set the twenty first in ten\nAnd the clock is rolling nine minute mark\n[noise]\n\nFired as they present their quarterback had the final drives after getting hurt and the second quarter now is a a presence documentaries wrong last he's got man you've got a man who's going to run it himself he's going out of bounds of the twenties no yard has got a man kind of going on a banana route where you go in the back out\nBut I don't I think it was just running for his life right there second a pen ... minute mark for this play\n[noise] [noise]\nRight I say a prayer second down looks like they gave him at least the football and that's why they give him a little yard edge\nUnder

the other side of the field and then they swap around and go to the other direction first in ten years from the film ... shocking idea ... looking left\nHe's got Amanda swing touchy and horse he's going to be outside bricks want to tackle he's on the side like he's got some of the artist jobs inside the twenty first intent you\n... well that's a nice little swing past Renee a running back position is that perhaps hitting them as a a pressure came in and I dare jade hearts goes around the outside with a ball\nAnd uh it's a first down for the usa down to the sixteen yard line first than ten\n\nRick sander sin a junior round Spencer junior as their presence junior Gavin show up at junior you've seen a lot of play from these guys this year Jane works at junior you get some ... some beef on the line and the experience of these guys have gotten this year you could turn this program around with the experience from those skilled players\nI say a prayer as in shock yeah in\n\nFact the rallies rolling right what does he have he's got a man oh Jesus Christ is going to go the other direction and he barely mystery and hearts but there was it a center on them complete\nSecond attempt\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] thirty nine to fix ten and a half minutes fourth quarter\n[noise] actually [noise]\nYou gotta love the idea of having those juniors comeback of seniors although skilled players you you find a way to get enough sense of line in there that that's a little bit bigger than the one we have\nThe press and rolling\nOutlast he's gonna throw he's looking he's running instead and he's taken out of bounds at about [noise]\nI don't know is Thirteen so there'll be a three hour gained thirty seven thirty seven\nDidn't have anyone to throw two\nAnd a third down this is where they were approximately about the end of the first half when they went for now I'm not left play um wouldn't have gotten the first town and the clock expired\nRight suffered an eight nine and a half minutes as if perhaps shock and he's got three to the right one of the left the right side it's white side he's got one of the backfield with them is\nLooking right he's got a man in the end zone any overthrows\nI mean I don't think had a gardener was even really expecting that that ball was within there are there perhaps just throw a pretty hard but it was high too and there was a defender of the area so I'm not saying that southern governors solved by any means\nThat was a lot of traffic right there and I say a prayer has it's almost like he looked like he was going to go through to the outside and then he says wisdom right up the middle so again it's going forward on Fort down for us today from the fourteen this was almost identical to the end of the first half situation even for being on the same side of the field\nSo three receivers to the white side that's the right side one to the left one of the backfield with ... as a shotgun\n\nAnd he has to gene marks oh he's in a mess he can't get out of that sport down your turn it over boy he just ran ran up to meddle into a mess\nRight through a mess so not fall down a little drop play and now it's kinda hard ball\n\nBasketball season just around the corner probably about just over a month away I Know the initial plans for ... to cover all the home games pre season\nOr maybe if we do play union I don't know if they're on the schedule and all that if we're playing at union will probably cover that one any other local a local ... games preseason wise will cover it network will cover\nEvery region game as long as there's not a mix up like there have been in the past Allen peacock going to take the reins on that this year I'll be helping them out as much as they can but a lot of work to travel around all these goals sweetness or a little screen passing the less receiver a\nHe gets about ... to make the taco seven minutes going to be about second and seven so from the from the ah Seventeen yard line\nThe ball is now the Twenty one [laughter] that second and sex and All right as I said sexy stadium announcer said seven but\nEither way to the side for sale and hills now they're going to move on over to the right side of three to the right to white side\nAnd one of the last one of the pistol formation with a new quarterback for sale in the hills\nAnd they used in the backfield and they get that tail packs right after that hand off occurred\nAnd I'll tell you what for as much success as you see the first often times it's gotta be frustrating to see the U.S get in there and be able to stop that against the second off since ... dollars good from the is that that's what you imagine the do if if they could compete against the first\nThat's like that but the second off that the line letting the defensive defense through right there in ...\nIn there and be able to stop that against the second off since ... dollars Fifteen cents on the is that that's what you imagine the it's a do if if they could compete against the first off that's like that but\nThe second all sorts of line letting the defensive defense through right there and and then let me get processed under thirty five making a taco for years and that is Jose goose meant rolling their eyes quarterback bad throw in complete and now it's fourth down for an eight\nSo a a run where they lost garbage on second down an incomplete on third down and now sailing hills for the first time today is going to have to put this is going to return it for the uk's\n\nCarter Smith that looks like it's going to go back to that used to return this and also going back for the December twenty four Logan ...\n\nCarter Smith a sophomore in ... sophomore divert comes back up not Jane horse goes back\n\nRight first part of the day for seven hills and they put a guy in motion and that's really weird snap is good and hard and the kicking up high and Carter Smith than everybody to back off and it nearly hits them hills defender\nAnd uh it's going to be down\nAt the forty to forty three yard line first intent just rolls to the forty three\nCarter Smith almost went over there and touch the ball to like it was one of those things where he's just got a run off the field as long as nobody else got it so they use for five minutes on the clock rolling half of all sorts of ten it's the fourth quarter forty nine to ...\nFilm hills has had to work pretty hard for the forty nine comparative to you know say tipping August the norm and some of those other games that we've been in\nIt didn't come easy for them first especially the first quarter when we nearly tied the game is seven\nAnd they barely squeaked away with a fourteen to seven or ... the other one was a Twenty one pretty close eye ... eye formation under center or forty and he gets them to move and so it's going to be first in five\nFirst then fired his heart count works three times today so far\n[noise]\nFor Twenty one fourth quarter\nAnd the wind is blowing it's not cold unless you feel the wind oh man\nCold breeze [noise] you know [noise] [noise]\nRight I formation president ... first in five forty eight\n[noise]\nTheir president center that large out again and now he's falls is out but he still have an answer to jade hearts anyway Jeb harsh around the side bike it a couple of yards out of it but man I tell for as bubbles to snap picked it up and none of my hand off you just hitched it over there to jade horse didn't work still got positive yards\nAnd from what was second in five it's now second in the ... set to yard gain on Africa and hearts on around the outside\n[noise]\nThree twenty eight remaining fourth quarter [noise]\n\n\nIs that President or center that was a tight end on the right but there's two receivers on the left the short side of the field ice formation otherwise and a gift horse is going to have that whole writes I owe it spreads out man if he wasn't ... just spread to the sideline I think you really would have gotten it\nHe may have ah he did get a couple of yards and it's going to be force in wind and these are going to go for it but it really is it ... without formation would have spread it to the sideline as long as you've got more species anybody else\nHe would've made that and even maybe turn the corner that's where if you have a speech during the formation like that you can really do some damage fourth

New Jersey Joseph you're on the Larry on the show thank you so much for calling I appreciate it\nYeah how are you Larry I'm doing well I Would have a nice thirty minutes but it's worth it you know [laughter] okay um I\nI Want to play but the Jewish point I'm Jewish myself the point is to be very clear that you have to differentiate between reform conservative Jews that are not proud of being Jewish and trying to either that any between Orthodox Jews that all love Don shop is a big difference when you said Jews\nYou don't really mean Jews you means you don't want to be Jewish but they're real Jews the orthodox wants all full support Don solve all the rabbi support them and they're given synagogue is just no there's some synagogues on the weekends they have a special blessing for President Trump is you're just know that's how much the Orthodox Jews\n... Jews\nI Know many people don't realize it but there's a big difference between conservative reform to that don't like Israel and don't like really being Jewish between Orthodox Jew love Israel and of course the old on shop any personal commonsense knows that Obama is the biggest uh is all eight or enjoy it and say you got to be a fool not to believe that\nAnd what Don shop there is no president ever ever did and Israel which is why does everybody to bridges and Israel named after Donald Trump even a train station but you know that\nI I Do know that but but just at the point is Seventy five percent of American Jews don't like him I I absolutely get your point about the uh twenty five percent that do I know a lot of them to do I'm just talking about collectively Seventy five percent can't stand them I don't plan on voting for for him again ... when he runs again and twenty twenty\nThat's because you know trying to tell you what do you think Jews don't you don't really want to be with us from trying to tell you they're going to vote for people that would not want to support Israel has some trying to say that's not surprising that actually makes sense to fit everything right\nThose are my here's my question is if they do does not support Donald Trump do you believe that person or that Jewish person is a shame to being Jewish that's my question to you\nYes with no doubt yes with no doubt ... know that really\nI mean you got to be a fool I mean if you really Jewish it's solid Jewish I mean you've got to be dumb enough to vote for I don't know I I look look you're preaching to the choir\nYes I mean you got to be a fool I mean if you really Jewish Jewish I mean you got to be I'm not\nI don't know I I look look you're preaching to the choir about about the Jewish vote the black vote the Hispanic vote the all these people the overwhelming vote for the Democratic party I think the wrong to do so but I think it's another leap to say are you are so self loathing Jew if you if you don't support the Republican Party and that seemed to be to be what what you're saying Joe so that's what I'm asking you\nYes yes good summer that's common sense right now you brought up to the world with common sense falls\nRight so so all the Jews who voted for Obama for example in your opinion are self loathing Jew I'm asking\nOh disgusting you crazy all the time no\nQuestions ... ... there seem to be no question that yes or no better\nOff now now you're aware Joseph that that's the same slam its use against black people like me I'm I'm call self loathing because I'm a Republican\n[laughter]\nOkay so the two people that work out right now after what's going on either you're dumb which is unfortunately the truth we all know that all your personal evil I mean the people to know what's going on is full support Hillary and all these people are just pure evil which is why I think Trump is so important that he stays in office because he represents the truth\nIt sort of Jewish Christian Muslim if you fight for the truth you have to go for chalk otherwise\nI don't know what okay so Joseph how do you feel about people that call people like Kanye West Larry Elder Candice Owens self loathing black people\nOkay so the black people that make fun of black people or to result there's there's many many most I mean I I have a lot of black friends just\nOn some supporters but the one that went to college or pro Democrats want to keep the power to themselves and make sure the brothers they pretty dumb\nBut the ... of you didn't answer my question I think you can if my question because you know where it leads the very same thing you said about Jews being self loathing because they vote Democrat or said by or said about black people like myself who vote Republican\nMaybe there's another alternative explanation we disagree regulate nice living one as a ... nights have been one Seventy four three I M Larry Elder do not leave town\n\nWow coffee organizer the organizer of migrant caravan from others was detained in Guatemala on Tuesday is the U.S government threatened to withdraw aid from both countries\nForgotten Man is find out how much money we give Honduras Guatemala every single year on this line up with a kind of impact was holding this aid would have on their economy so a look at it for me what you cripple eight nine seven one that's a G.
