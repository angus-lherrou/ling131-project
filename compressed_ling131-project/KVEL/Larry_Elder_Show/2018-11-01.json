always told me that you needed a constitutional a member\n'cause he wanted but you don't get a number one number one you don't need that number to nothing to humans lessons well you can definitely do it with an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nNow how ridiculous that were the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits too ridiculous it's ridiculous\nAnd it has to end them have you talked about that with council you have to

only one I guess good\nAlthough those benefits to kill us it's ridiculous and it has to end have you talked about that with counsel yeah I have to wearing the percentage in the process it will happen with an executive order that's what you're talking about it but I was thinking about I didn't think anybody but I knew that but me I thought it was the only one China ...\nProfessor issue in can he do this with an executive order\nWill either leave because let's let's see if Iraq or for principles the president cannot amend the constitution and executive order Congress and amend the constitution by an act of Congress and the Supreme Court isn't supposed to be able to amend the constitution by issuing a judgment or ruling in a cave\nBut that's not what the president is talking about here the constitution doesn't require birthright citizenship\nIf there's anybody born here and subject to the jurisdiction are citizens all he's trying to do with clarify what that phrase subject to the jurisdiction me and it doesn't mean anybody who happens to be subject to our laws because they're physically present here it meant something much more complete an ad or when the lead into the country being part of the body politic\nAnd that's what the debate of the fourteenth amendment make clear that's what the early Supreme Court decisions on this make clear and the Supreme Court has never held otherwise\nAre we now so so that would mean that the children of citizens\nOr the children of lawful permanent residents are automatically citizens by virtue of the fourteenth amendment but the children of temporary visitor whether it's a tourist visa or students either ... or or or or certainly the children are people who are not lawfully present in the United states at all or not automatic
