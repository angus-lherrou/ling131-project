it's just too darn long and I thank you so much for being here it's a pleasure to be sitting face to face with you always a pleasure to be with you mark your long history you have a long story around\nI'm second generation of gun rights activist advocate uh\nAnd uh my father was Neal knocks he was a gun writer and then was one of the moving forces behind the Cincinnati revolt in Nineteen Seventy seven and about the national Rifle Association listeners just for your information right that that turn the national Rifle Association into a lobbying juggernaut\nUm then he uh founded the firearms coalition which I now run 'em and eventually dad was elected on to the board of directors of the n._r._a. and became the vice president\nOf and was in line to be the president the following year but he worried some people and so they recruited\n... he scares some people he didn't worry I'm your dad scared some people that are not\nRight they they went out and they recruited Charlton Heston specifically to run against dad so that they could bumping out of the chairs and keep him from becoming the president of the n._r._a. that's pretty hardcore company when that's how important your father was that they actually did that with asked him to quit the soil yeah we had more time for it I honestly\nBut now uh I uh I dad died in two thousand and five I'm I was helping him for the last two years of his life keeping the organization running and\nAnd helping with the day to day writing I have a regular articles on ah ah ... dot com and in firearms news magazine\nAnd ah the website and all of that firearms coalition dot org\nUse it firearms coalition dot org correct that's right firearms coalition dot org we've had some issues we actually had somebody who claims to be a terrorist group hacked our website a few years ago and we never quite recovered from that my IT guy is a guy named Chris knocks\nAny relation yeah okay just checking my my brother and uh he uh he's cheap but he's not really great so [laughter] but anyway we've we've revamp the website and it's looking really good but for the last year\nI've been really focused on election politics rather than gun politics and [noise] I've I've kind of let the firearms coalition\nA sort of slide a little bit um and I apologize to any of our readers and and followers\nFor that but the election this year is so important and I am working full time to get good pro writes a candidate's elected to office this year\nRight let let me stop you were saying you because you've moved into election politics let's let's go there briefly absolutely I have spoken so far to some great heavy hitters today Alan Gottlieb Alan Cohen and others are\nIn the election is dominating of course we're now you're talking about midterms national you're also talking about state you're talking about Arizona subjects Phil me on because this is a vital places as ground zero right\nNow well I moved the coalition back to Arizona I'm about\nSix years ago and when I did I started getting much more involved in local Arizona politics\nAnd uh I actually have teamed up with a local a campaign consultant who work strictly with conservative candidates and um it turns out that concerning the candidates are also pro writes candidates and so I have no\nUh problems are working with these campaigns and and supporting these guys in primarily in local politics we had a couple of congressional candidates unfortunately our candidates didn't get through the primary\nUm so now I'm focused on making sure that the Arizona house is as pro rights as it\nCan possibly do right and and how close are we in your estimation to that happening because I Want to segue ... depending on your answer I'm gonna do it anyway but I Want to segue over to the federal election as well so where are we where are we here locally\nNow here in Arizona we're in very good shape um we've got a few districts that that lean Democrat and we're making some inroads into those districts\nBut uh as far as our state legislature they understand that gun voters are very important to them and we are are in good shape to get those people elected and ah I'm feeling good about the way our local elections are going here in Arizona\nAlthough I I lost a city council race by eleven votes are in in the primary election one of my candidates so it can be really heartbreaking\nTo no question or no let's use the state and how you feel comfortable about the state\nI'm pretty comfortable about the state yeah we've got a good solid Republican majority I Believe that the governor is going to win again I I\nThe owner although I I lost a city council race by eleven votes are in in the primary election one of my candidates so it can be really heartbreaking into no question or I don't know what I use the state and how you feel comfortable about the state uh pretty comfortable about the state yeah we've got a good solid Republican majority I Believe that the governor\nIs going to win again I I'm not a big fan of governor do see but he's ... better than the alternative\nYou know you would that nobody was a big fan of a lot of people weren't big fans of Donald Trump but he was way way better than the alternative absolute I'm a big fan of Donald Trump\nLoved it and called the election the night of the election on on my radio program I should go to bed tonight knowing Trump plus three hundred electoral votes will see in the morning\nThree hundred to ... I still have people and I'm proud of the asking me to pick their lottery numbers for say All right let's go now let me segue to the to the federal election I've I talk with my previous gas over the last hour\nAn hour and a half year in the Arizona as in a strange place there when you're talking about the U.S Senate Arizona is actually look I mean it's a one point race right now today as we sit here at the at the easy CDL meeting in meeting someone who would've ever thought that\nIn bright red gun toting gun loving history of the gun states Arizona\nHere since ... who is the Democrat running for the Senate\nUm has painted herself as a moderate Democrat and she's done a pretty good job of it uh although a lot of her history is now finally coming out and people are realizing that she was a a a Democrat socialist green extreme\nRadical leftist before she started moderating in order to be able to be elected to office\nShe's like Mike Bloomberg becoming a Republican he didn't become a Republican because he believed in Republican values he became a Republican because they already had a Democrat candidate right and he wanted to spend enough money to get elected in All right ... ... what what can you stay here with me for one more second jury there are\nRugged outdoors\nFree plug in individual as a state built on the gun I think of the west I think a custard butt kicked [laughter] okay by a bunch of bunch of guys that could shoot better with Winchester model Ninety four is okay the foot the fact of the matter is for eighty floors wherever they were but the fact of the matter is I don't want\nWhy do we have to worry about that out here we shouldn't even be having this conversation here in the great state of Arizona Jeff this concerns me and there's a couple\nOf reasons why we have this problem and one of them one of the biggest is that the Republican Party here in Arizona is rather torn it's dysfunctional we've got\nCrazy right wing radicals we've got right wing not so crazies and then we've got moderate me she ... she John McCain Republican and we're always fighting with each other\nBecause we're used to fighting with each other within the party and the party can't get its act together and um that means that we can't unify behind a good candidate and and stick with it\nThat there's a big wing of the Republican Party in Arizona that thinks that the base isn't enough and they they they want to run for the middle in order to win and they hold up John McCain Jon Kyl Jeff Flake as examples of seed that's what\nThe Arizona people want what I'm hearing from you right now I'm picturing in my mind radio to me is the editor of the mind and I've I've just trained in doing that when I'm listening to you I'm visualizing a puzzle\nOkay and I'm seeing three or four\nPieces in the state of Arizona in Arizona put together in three or four pieces based on what I'm hearing from you that it has it seems like Arizona is now searching for a new identity\nBased on that base that you're you're talking about several different bases here right a John McCain voter would never vote for a mix Sally\nImage Sally voter would never vote for a cinema I I'm seeing three or four different McCain voter would vote for him it cello they would have to\nBut but a a um uh\nBut they're not allowed in water Doderer McGrath a Goldwater voter back in the day would never vote for either of them McCain has said this is the here's what I'm\nI'm very concerned about what I'm seeing in the ... and I'm going to be honest it upsets me it really does because this is this is the Arizona to me it's a free statements\nThe water or drama graph a Goldwater voter back in the day would never vote for either of them\nMcCain while this was the here's what I'm Talking about [noise]\nI'm very concerned about what I'm seeing in the stadium and I'm going to be honest it upsets me it really does because this is\nThis just an Arizona to me it's a free state in the country it is to me it's why I live here okay and I don't like what I'm seeing here and we had our core when talking about bringing in California is bringing in California\nValues that there is demographic change happening here which is what's happening in Montana is well it's happening in Montana's was also happening in will start to see it in Idaho what's been happening in Colorado for a long time\nAnd what amazes me as you get these goofy left his moves that leave what they don't like to go somewhere they like and bring their goofy leftist ... Washington state has crush Washington state to the point that as the tip of the spear there what happens on sixteen thirty nine excuse me\nIs going to determine what happens in this state and Florida next is too big ground zero say Florida is in trouble to\nForeigners in big trouble yeah All right you've got a governor that has signed who signed a pro gun Governor Scott what's for many years

view are rockets but\nI got to tell you this because you need to know this Alan Gottlieb is the single most influential and powerful man alive today in the gun rights movement\nThat's a bold statement to make it's also very very true if you listen to him yesterday whenever you hear Alvin talk you have to dig a little deep and pick up on some of what he says because sometimes it just goes right past

M. E. D. U. eight seven to two two they are ... to eight seven to two I Won the cold beer at the stadium never did get it\nBut nonetheless it was cool because I wanted on attacks by taxing something very similar at a Braves game by the way how 'bout that game last night I let yesterday there was a lot going on when I got off the air yesterday yesterday was a fun Sunday I was up rather late\nBecause I had to finish watching the Braves in ethics fashion I had to watch the game that my wife and my daughter were at\nYesterday while I was on the air\nAs they won in while it was quite it was quite an exciting ballgame National League division series game three they want it in what was that we scared to death as a Braves fan and a season ticket holder\nFreddie Freeman's home run popped up made it sixty five and they held on it was a lot of fun to watch then of course after that the walking dead was back on\nSo I had to watch that fell asleep a couple of times watching that got up nonetheless wound up seeing it great to see the walking dead back on there was a lot going on yesterday Dover was being run NASCAR races Dover was being run yesterday during the day football couldn't care less I don't know who played don't give a crap about him don't care\nBut there was like you got baseball this is just a fun time of year if you enjoy watching baseball so and yes the Braves are playing right\nNow ... how come I'm not\nThere that's a great question freedom never takes a break free to them ever take a break or does it could it be technology you just\nNever know [laughter] All right so let me welcome you back let's have some fun with Colin Powell let's kick this guy apart shall we and have some fun doing it again what does this have to do with your guns what does it irrelevant Colin Powell\nHave to do with your it has everything to do with your gun\nHe is making himself we're trying to make himself relevant again by by no I Know by appearing on CNN with freed the car you that's\nRelevant well yeah it is for some reason he's out there CNN reached out to him or his publicist\nIs making the rounds in I get a lot of that stuff I haven't seen anything from those publishers Colin Powell is available like to talk about so and so I haven't seen anything I'll keep my eyes but I get a lot of that stuff\nBut I Want to go back and talk about some of these things has everything to do with your gun because how does it like your guns how abandoned the Republican Party and supported Obama if you recall yeah that's what Republicans do you know would support Obama\nNamed me would you what does that make you if you support Obama does that make you a Republican\nHell no it doesn't make you a Republican makes you think about a Republican\nThese are the kind of people Republicans tablet Schmidt guy that Trump is clearing out and making irrelevant these are bygone era guys and girls that Josh cannot accept that they are bygone era guys and girls now\nAnd they are seeking to reestablish themselves\nAnd imagine if the Republican Party has a guy like Colin Powell at the helm someday a guy who says it's OK to register your stuff\nAnd you don't need certain things but he claims to support the right to bear arms and supporters say he's the porches right to bear arms and to protect himself and he supports your right to have a what\nA guy who says it's OK to register your stuff and you don't need certain things but he claims that support the right to bear arms and supporters say he's the portions right to bear arms and to protect himself\nAnd he supports your right to have a weapon that he chooses okay for you this has everything to do with guns and I want you to view what we're going to talk about and pick apart from him right now through that lens\nHe said that he doesn't know that Trump can be the moral leader for the world because right now that is not the way he's acting\nLet me tell Cohen ... he's not supposed to be the moral leader for the world Trump is acting to fix all of the things that everybody before him that tried to be the moral leader of the world screwed up\nThat's what Trump is fixing today\nAmerica First because Powell and his cronies his un global lovers who screwed everything off and shipped millions of jobs over this is what Trump is fixing\nThat's why he's acting the way he's acting to use house terms\nRecently it became me the president as opposed to we the people that's not true we the people are the American people not we the people of the global world of earth\nWe the people Powell means us America\n\nAnd Palestine and you see things that should not be happening how can a president of the United states get up and said that the media is the enemy of American because the media the enemy of Americans call and you don't like to hear that I've been the you know I Wonder if that that for me\nYeah right bowled ball question huh I've been calling the ... the ... the the greatest threat to Americans for years on armed American radio and it's great to see Trump rip them apart because they are of the rats\nHe's metaphorically speaking how not an enemy on a battlefield for the battlefield of ideas metaphorically speaking you understand that\nBecause they are the enemy of half of this country probably more than half\nBecause of their left wing propaganda their gun grabbing gun Haiti for example for the purposes of this show I can immediately point to that as an example\nFor their propagandize and weaponize ing\n\nWhatever topic it is that they choose to use against us\nWhether it's Christianity whether it's done right I could go on and on but again for the purpose of this problem is is armed American radio would it be difficult for me to point out to you\nHow much the press you want me to go I don't have enough time in a year to go over the anti gun stores haven't covered with you for years\n\nBy not being beaten down anymore by the very people who pummeled you\nIn previous administrations into the ground for decades and walked on us and cost us billions\nBy the way what does this have to do with gun everything you know the United nations attempting to beat Americans guns into the ground of which I'm sure wow would sit and have a conversation with those people Donald Trump would tell them to go ... salt Sharry\nHow would look at that as an insult because he didn't sit and talk to them because he's looking out for you\n\nAnd he says he insulted all of his fellow candidates up on the stage during the debates yeah politics is rough and tumble\nAnd every single one of 'em deserves it and none of them could effectively fight back Donald Trump buried them by the way Mr ... who's the president\nExactly\nAnd it says I don't think that's what should be coming out of the president of the United states\nReally\nSo he doesn't think providing black Americans the lowest unemployment in the history of the country or providing women the lowest unemployment among many other things for these groups\nExactly\nAnd it says I don't think that's what should be coming out of the president of the United states\nReally\nSo he doesn't think providing black Americans the lowest unemployment in the history of the country or providing women the lowest unemployment among many other things for these groups of people if you want to separate them into groups\nThe lowest unemployment for women in history that's a problem for me doesn't think that's what should be coming out of a president of the United states\n\nHe wants the president of the United states to play nice nice with people coming across our borders illegally harming American citizens bringing drugs galore across the border\nAnd crime with them\nThat's OK called power wants to sit down and talk to those people and play nice he would probably sit down with Dianne Feinstein and play nice with her during the Kavanaugh hearings as well\n\nAnd Colin Powell says but I don't see anything that's changed in the last two years I just told you what's changed\nColin Powell doesn't see that he does he's ignoring it intentionally and that would be intellectually dishonest\n\nAdditive Trump's rhetoric about America being a victim is so not true well of course she would argue that she's the one that put us there\nOne of many who put us there she's one who had a hand in putting us there we have been a victim we've been sucked dry\nBut European nations and our quote unquote friends for years including our enemies\nChina comes to mind for decades they have been sucking billions of dollars out of this country that is a victim\nThe world is watching Powell said they cannot believe we're doing things like separating mothers and children who are trying to get across the border from South of our border\n\nThey are separating criminals just as they do if someone's caught on a traffic stop they send the child the child welfare services while they put the parents in jail\n\nColin Powell was reciting the lives of the laughter you following me here the lives of the less\n\nHe didn't say that when Barack Obama was doing the exact same thing\nColin Powell is not talking to you about the fact that many of these so called parents aren't parents at all\nBut are faring kids across the country across the border in an attempt to get here illegally that they are the ones in fact exploiting children for their own game\nHouses they can't believe we're making such an effort deceased immigration coming into the country we're not it's called the thing illegal immigration Mr Powell\nFacts are stubborn things sure but they can't be made up you are not if you are not entitled to your own set of facts\nThat goes to the coast when George Laurie overnight all your change the law\nWhen seconds
