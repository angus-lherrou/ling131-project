was reading about it on the news when you saw that what what I mean tombstone Arizona when you saw that America's Second Amendment she will will come through your head\nI think from memory I may have had known about just before it happens think Gordon ... emailed me and contacted me about it ahead of time\nAnd we put at a news release about it as well for the second amendment foundation or complimenting comes down on becoming the first Second Amendment city so to speak and then urging other cities adopt resolution like this to and which many other cities around the country did a tombstone was the leader\nTombstone leading as America's Second Amendment city the first one I'm going to talk with you in really good detail about that because there's history behind that and how it all came about and what you're doing with moving into the future\nI Will say this now I've had the benefit of being here many times since Nineteen Ninety six this is your first time here as I told them what the heck of a job out here this place looks better than I've ever seen that look before I'll go there with you to know other cities did this\nWhat is it what does it mean that that uh ... says I'm going to be an American Second Amendment city does it make your life easier is the founder of the second amendment foundation\nWill tell you it did it came about income some did this it was coming at a time we had a lot of cities gang up on the rights of gun owners passing all kinds of ordinance is in gun control statutes in their cities and attacking Ken rights and it was really great to see a city it particularly tombstone\nCome along and and say hey there is the second amendment we observe it we support it and uh that the population the mayor side was just tremendous and it helped as the as a push back and anything against a pushback helps us fight the second Amendment rights ... gratitude\nAnd you know what I think it's cool about what you just said\nIs too soon to be a very small place but it is widely recognized when you hear the name to stone people know they know tombstone it might be what twenty six hundred residents are somewhere around the fifteenth Fifteen hundred so it got Fifteen hundred there's not a lot of residents are small town but it's got a big name\nWell a male and Fifteen hundred residents but how many tourists as a kid a year a lot more than Fifteen hundred now Eldorado days is coming up you and I will be done at that time were here right at the heart of Eldorado days but as American that it's designed to\nDeal with will not designed to but what it does is it celebrates the vet you know just the history of folk worthwhile to think about all the color of her characters that came through you saw great today that said I don't even remember his name but he was shot Frank Leslie Frank Leslie was one of the most notorious gunfire was in the Old West\nAnd I would guess you're probably more of those on no names up there probably
