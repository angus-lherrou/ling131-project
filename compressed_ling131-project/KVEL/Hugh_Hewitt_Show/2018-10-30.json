didn't stop or right there but later in the program they went back because many people jumped on it many people saw that and CNN was flooded with comments\nAnd so Jake gave her the opportunity to

which is a week out law and he I look at the numbers and I'm very very very uh optimistic about their Republicans in the Senate and I'm not resigned are losing their houses I was a month ago what say you\nHere I'm In exactly the same place as you are a I think Republicans look very very good in the Senate fight this is something that we always thought would happen if we got closer to the race that some of these races would settle out and I think we're seeing that for sure\nYou know the house is really a toss up I I I think it's one of those things where it's very very difficult to predict exactly what the margin going to be\nBut I think Republicans are going to be competitive coming into the stretch right here on the outside but that the Senate does look very good question about it\nNow one of the things that are that I Want to always report objective way my audience and the NBC and mirrors put out a whole this morning that shows Kristin cinema up five points over Martha

five and a half percent under that model and so they're under estimating the actual Republican turnout\nAnd I do not believe Arizona is going to vote for radical and you know Arizona pretty well what do you think\n[laughter] right so I think there's a few factors you're the first of all absolutely the data I've seen as well from Arizona suggest that the early vote has come in I had to pay for Republicans in other words if you compare early vote in ... in two thousand any team versus early vote in two thousand sixteen\nUh things are looking favorable in two thousand Eighteen even as opposed to twenty sixteen cycle which was a ... which was a good cycle for Republicans in Arizona the second point is is just the fact that it just in cinema\nI I mean not only is this someone who has seen
