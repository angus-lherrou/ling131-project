your thoughts on uh the caravan which continues to march north for the left attack on the president and by the way when the left the taxes the president for saying that he is a nationalist\n... is this a sign I was just talking to generally similar is this the sign in some\nWay that the left is growing increasingly I'm worried or concerned about the suppose a blue wave that has been going to be crashing onto our shores on November sects\nI kinda feel there might be something there that really do the fact that they're attacking him in such\nWay he can't even say that he supports the nation's first as opposed to the globe without them saying do you mean white nationalist ... it's just so insane I Wonder if they're not worried\nThat he's he's winning he's he's still\nReally really really really popular in a lot of cities them in a lot of states where we're concerned\nThat his rallies are rallying voters to come out there and be our candidates and the ones that we need to take back the house or in a little bit of jeopardy he's winning so rather than trying to tear down those candidates let's tear down the man who is driving the train\nThat there may be something to that the president is still popular and when I say that I mean in a relative sense yes forty\nSeven percent approval uh is is is balanced like fifty percent disapproval according to that washing or a Wall Street journal NBC poll that I just mentioned which is better than President Obama at them in terms of his first term in ... in two thousand ten\nBut he's forty seven percent considering the fact that Ninety two percent my French is there anything in America that Ninety two percent of people can agree on nothing\nBut Ninety two percent of the news stories about Donald Trump in print and broadcast form or negative\nNews somehow it just coincidental I suppose there's not an organized attempt to smear Donald Trump to destroy his presidency among all of these people in the news media right it's it's just a coincidence they all just happen to feel the same way right now is a coordinated attempt Ninety One Ninety two percent of anything happens\nYou could probably look at it with a jaded I Ninety two percent of the news coverage of Donald Trump is this your story on in broadcast or in print journalism\nContains the word Trump Ninety two percent of the time it is negative\nAnd for him to be at forty seven percent approval despite all of that hysteria against him\nYou simply as I said going into break a modern day miracles so they're trying to tear him down it's not working and I just wonder as a as a you know generally so did the journal generally so much asked me is that uh is this are concerned that they really really are nervous that they're blue wave isn't going to come crashing onto the shores\nAnd I think it is that's why they are just going after anything that can when you got Jim Acosta or don't you mean white nationalist here's Mazie Hirono last time we heard her she was busy trying to slander and smear it descend man a good man a decent man and judge Brett Kavanaugh here's what she has to say about the president of the\nKnown that he had no because of
