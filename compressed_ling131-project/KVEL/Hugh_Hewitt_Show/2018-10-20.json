a somewhat I Would have over to my house for dinner or something like that but you know I knew and we all knew he was it was hard not to like what do you see happening David\nWell for movies like for a while has indicated that Saudi Arabia would pin the blame on some scapegoat in their security services\nUh the jerky boys likely to accept that explanation or as long as Saudi Arabia acknowledged that to show he had been killed inside the confidence in Istanbul\nAnd that seems like the way things are headed at this hour of a well informed source or who knows what the courts up to a told me that Saudi Arabia and identify the person they're going to say is responsible\nHe put it Maurice late into the person that is responsible or someone in the intelligence services who knows crown prince Mohammed bin Salman personally and felt like he he this person and intelligence\nAt the authorization to carry out some kind of rendition and that went horribly wrong if you've been following Saudi Arabia or you've been following this story that has seemed terrifically plausible but it's convenient for Saudi Arabia for turkey and for the United states to find a way to move on\nThis is the Henry

know the twelve hundred and twelve century I'm not sure it works today David absent public judicial proceeding that the west can pursue what do you think\nWell what does works mean you know for as well from entering governments make do with a partial truth fairly often\nUh the quarter public opinion is a different matter I think at this point are after all that we've seen leaked by Turkish officials and all this been confirmed it's going to be hard for crown prince Mohammed\nBin Salman to repair his were his reputation\nYou know he he'd gotten pretty far in the west as a reformer and somebody was going to open up the kingdom kind of an innovator and a new kind of leader for Saudi Arabia I think he's going to have a lot of trouble now getting that kind of selfies with Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg that he's been accustomed to\nIn fact the person that has been identified to you by a good source as likely to be pointed to as the prime mover the rendition gone bad or cage NBS in ordering the rendition does that important do you do you think the royal court changes in succession\nTwo elements there first of all I think this person\nFriday and Saturday cord so that's not the kind of court we're used to wear the defend it might have an opportunity to blame the crown prince or you know in the past a crown prince who came under this kind of a cloud might have trouble with the succession\nIn speaking with her not drink I mentioned his recent book into the hands of soldiers and then he'd been in the middle east correspondent for the New York times since he's well qualified to unravel the often mysterious geopolitics of the region our conversation continues\nSaudi Arabia is changed crown prince ... had consolidated power like no figure in the kingdom in decades he holds all the key levers and so the best handicapping is there's no one in addition to challenge him a while there are many people ... who are enjoying criticizing him over this he's made many enemies along the way\nNone of them seems to have enough heft to push him out a lot of succession as long as they're dead is okay with it is dead is elderly and may not be that company right now\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo wrapped up a very brief meeting with the king ah not too long ago is expected me with NBS when he's there\nI'm expecting that he will I don't know the details of his schedule\nSo it is it possible that there is within the gear and this was just a range of ... have you been there and the second option which is you accept responsibility but not guilty\nThe other one is you say someone was trying to take me out a rogue operative was actually working to advance the exiled faction of the royals and I had improved the Ritz Carlton has that been floated anywhere you\nKnow you know it to be honest a cynical as I Am I expected that's what they would go with I expected we would hear that there's rogue operative was associated with some old regime\nBut in fact what I'm told we're going to hear is that the rogue operative as someone who actually was a friend of a crowd Brits around but Solomon who felt like he had the okay it from the crown prince to do this rendition\nAnd who was trying to make a name for himself who was trying to impress everybody with his daring do and be a quote unquote James Bond and it went horribly wrong\nWill that be enough for the United states John Bolton that I talked about this at that point he said we don't have the ... the middle east anything is possible that was last Thursday would or the second offends me six a sufficient for the United states\nWell a key question here is has turkey shared its intelligence Turkish officials have leaked to many people including me that they are in possession of audio and maybe video of from inside the conflict showing who did well in excess in Asia you know they've got they've got the goods\nIf they've shared that wish there U.S intelligence got abides who often work very closely with the Turks are then that's one thing and if they haven't if they've only briefed about it and that's another that that diminishes the degree of seriousness for the U.S diminishes the pressure on the U.S\nTo try to pursue this it depends on what the Turks have shared really\nRight now does that impact for example the war in Yemen and this is actually word comes home this is the anti Iran alliance being stresses who's a Jordan and Egypt and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates and Israel and America trying to confront the who these were sending rockets into Saudi Arabia that are made in Iran\nDoes this break that anti Iranian alliance which many of us have welcome a as being a necessary for corruption in the middle east\nUh I'm not sure they had any impact on the Iranian allies I I'm not I don't see the United Arab Emirates or Israel or Egypt showing any squeamish is whatsoever about what's been done here and so far it looks like President Trump is very willing to accept\nThis explanation he was even yesterday you know getting out of the Saudis had already suggesting\nThat this was a rogue operator before the Saudis had begun to float that explanation themselves so I think the geopolitics are likely to remain unchanged so long as a succession inside Saudi Arabia is unchanged\nAnd therefore arms sales on interrupted the American public accepts certain moves on because it as an exotic story in reads like a thriller I'm a ... has a lot of friends but it is it is very difficult to keep a story like this above the fold for very long
