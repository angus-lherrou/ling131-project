support\nIt's about identity psychology moral foundations and the dynamics of tribal resentment and the report\nHitting tribes breaks American into seven groups from left or right with names like traditional liberals moderates politically disengaged and so on\nIt won't surprise you to learn that the most active groups are on the extremes progressive activists on the last eight percent of
