Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing it was an effort in a new sort of currently as soon as I argued over at the Washington Post this week\nThe Democrats will ultimately share that credit proceeding to ruin the lives of Brett Kavanaugh and his family had likely is accuser Christine Blasey Ford Elite media outlets did their part in the facilitates the allegations in the Washington Post and the New

description of what is happening\n... denied the appointment it will be because he has been depicted as a sexual predator who deserves contempt origin impossible in prison he may no longer be able to teach law coach sports or expect to be treated respectfully\nHe could be forced to resign as current traditional position because having a coat convicted unquote rapist on the benches unseemly\nFor these reasons he now has the right perhaps not a legal rights butter right based on fundamental fairness to have the charges against him put to the test of clear and convincing evidence\nWhere some standard close to that a judge Kavanaugh been rejected an ideological or professional grounds before the sordid accusations were leveled he could go back to his life it Robert Bork did but if the Senate fails to confirm him now his life\nWill never be the same but this is no longer about who would make the best Supreme Court justice is about the most fundamental issue affair and issues of

total review on who you are you in partnership with a graduate school of public policy\nFor confirmation debacle orchestrated by the Democrats were both grass cynical to reach the very core of our country a country founded upon some judicial principles of due process stood the test of time [noise] first of all like the presumption of innocence riskier\nA drug or strategic voice in the Senate that as senator Joni urge to Iowa\nWhat have you been hearing\nWell I Am hearing of course a mixture of the calls I get to the office a lot of them are are saying get Kavanaugh firearms and then there are others that um are you know adamantly opposed we see those folks on the TV all the time um but what I Do hear when I'm Out in about ... people just can't understand\nUm why we haven't moved on with a getting him confirmed they understand that he has the right to um credentials to sit on the nation's highest court and they fully expect that we should get this done soon\nI Want to review a few things with you about the testimony\nFirst of all there was a story and political that she had a fear of flying which is why that had to be the way she never actually said better itself but that was represented the committee she did say she was not aware that the committee would come to her so that could be on her lawyers her former boyfriend has filed a letter saying she some lawyer with polygraph said never discuss sexual assault\nThere was a new real clear investigations report that the second front door contractor evidence shows that was not about claustrophobia but a second entrance for an office\nThere wasn't a single verifiable assertion or testimony and not one that could be disproven either and then there's the Rachel Mitchell Report I simply do not believe that that testimony could not Brett Kavanaugh of consideration\nNo I'd I don't believe so either and and Dr Ford I Do honestly believe that she has experienced trauma\nAt some point or otherwise so do I I I think most folks would agree with that however um even the witnesses that she called forward\nActually uh can't corroborate or simply tear down that that testimony that she gave about um some party that she had attended so\nUnfortunately for her I don't find that to be a credible message again I Do want to reiterate that I Do think she experienced trauma that I don't know and it wasn't proven that it was judge Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile we have the secondary assault on judge Kavanaugh who I Do not know by the way he's ten years younger than I Am so we did not move in the same circles but he he strikes me as a very good and decent man and his two daughters caught me telling the fourteen year old they will be dealing with this for the rest of their life and that people have not stood up\nTo ... to underscore that their father is not a gang rape is that none of this has been proven that Sheldon Whitehouse is allegation was libel was slanderous and immediately reputed referred by the committee for prosecution are you and your colleagues doing enough to stand up and and stand by judge cabin on your view\n[noise] well I think we are standing up for judge Kavanaugh of course she won't hear any of those stories covered by mainstream media um but we certainly respect him we respect his family they have been put\nThrough um the the worst possible situation ever with their father being demeaned and and discredited and and it's very unfortunate and we have those discussions on why would anybody want to step up\nBe nominated for such an important position why would anybody want to run for office if it's simply takes an accusation and unproven accusation which can put a family literally through how\nJust look around here it's all about obstruction it's about resistance at as about what can we stop and put in the president's way what can we put in Congress his way to stop them from\nDoing a better job for the United states of America I mean look at our economy and how strong we are doing right now and and know thanks to our counterparts\nAcross the aisle they have tried to slow us down stop us at every opportunity whether it's getting rid of unnecessary regulation whether it as as stopping the tax cuts and JOBS Act what ever it\nIs they try and delay delay recess\nUm and that's exactly what they're doing in the house if they take the house we can expect that for\nThe next two years the disheartening speckled with is taking place in the United States Senate some very good news came out of mid week the new trade deal was filing son with Canada several weeks following of signing with Mexico gets the United states much go kind of agreement for us MCA\nUsa Ga will replace NAFTA which dates back to the mid nineties Larry Elder turned us even more of the Heritage Foundation will pick up their interview with more\nThis huge victory for Donald Trump I mean we've got a new now though modernized now that by the way I\nAlways gotten out there was a pretty good thing I mean it unified our North American continent uh Canada Mexico and the United states and needed to be modernized there were a lot of things in and out there that were out of date or unfair and you know Trump\nHad a big victory here first you got Mexico to sign on and that is you know tighten the screws on Canada and they made some real concessions here Larry that they didn't want to they didn't want to make another sets up very nicely\nFor negotiating you know the big big deal it's going to come to hopefully with China because they they are the worst or you know abusers of betrayed laws and on the planet one quick thing Larry I we're there yet the rose garden when Donald Trump held a press conference and one of the points you made\nIs he said look I Want to use these tariffs as a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce their fears and us and I often say you may not agree with the tactic but where is it working because these countries are reducing their or\nEven a review of the congressional budget office says it NAFTA increased\nIt was passed down from one of the points you made is he said look I Want to use these tariffs as a negotiating tactic to get these other countries to reduce tariffs on us and\nI have to say you may not agree with a tactic but what is it working 'cause these countries are reducing their cherished\nEven a review of the congressional budget office says it NAFTA increased economic prosperity for all three countries\nAnd the University of Chicago survey of top economists found Ninety six percent agreed are strongly agree that on average Americans have been better off close but with NAFTA than the previous trade deal so when President Trump's keep calling it the worst trade deal ever don't you have a problem with that\nI Do it you know and I told him I disagreed with him on that I think you know I actually helped pass NAFTA back in Nineteen Ninety two or three or Ninety four when we originally passed their when Bill Clinton was president we got the Republican Congress to vote for\nTrump also had a point that it could be approved this is the best of all worlds you know in my opinion we have a new free trade agreement it's now called the U. S. M. C. A. when I got a call now from any longer\nBut it is a new a North American free trade agreement that will open up orders are between all three countries it is modernize it gives America has a better deal\nAnd uh so I look I don't see why anybody would be unhappy with this outcome\nUm my understanding is one of the things that this deal does is put pressure on other countries to pay their workers more money why is that why is that a good thing for consumers\nOkay well I think that's a fair point you know we shouldn't be imposing minimum wage on other countries right and that's one of the things I don't like about this the also very it got me on that one I've not you know we we won Mexico to have a twenty dollar minimum wage that would put a lot of Mexican workers out of out of business so that well that's one of the things I think is bad economics in this plan\nA show I mean I agree with you on that one\nSo on par though this deal lower tariffs and barriers are up for a candidate has imposed against us and lowest terriers and beer and barriers that Mexico imposed against us in general\nYeah not just by the way it was just one quick thing or not just terrorists but also there were a lot of it you know as you know we talked about this on your show before war and more what Americans produces called intellectual property we produce\nComputer software we produce Patton sent copyrights and and a technology and when it comes to some of these countries like Canada and some and it's certainly China and and and many other countries and Asian countries they just

matter that cabinet is guilty or innocent\nHe also accused Kavanaugh racial profiling where's the evidence here's my colleague Mike Gallagher\nHe literally just stood there with Dick Durbin looking sternly over his shoulder saying it doesn't matter if Kavanaugh is innocent or guilty he's just the wrong guy for the Supreme Court and he literally says it does it matter if he's innocent or guilty this guy has been one of the finest sure rich in the country all this time and now ... says\nHey we need we need somebody else temperament his temperament I Love that\nBecause you know ... and he
