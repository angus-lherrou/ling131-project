morning to you thank you so much for joining us for the Hugh Hewitt show my name is Bob brand she was sick today after his rally in\nA Pittsburgh last night but I was a tough one a railing against the president knows a battleground soccer's door event in Pittsburgh obviously with you and a lot of colleagues Michael my bed and others I'm sure it was great event but uh\nUh you have that deal in Pittsburgh while battling the uh the illness that took his voice from him yesterday so I'm very happy to be sitting in for today from the pain free really factor dot com studios of am fourteen twenty the answer\nIn Cleveland so the president\nA rally last night as a mentioned uh for Ted Cruz but also rallying for himself and for just the conservative Republican vision\nIn this country and why it is it's so important and so in a row for the Republicans do not only a hold on to but maybe expand their majority in the United States Senate but also to try to hold off\nA the Democrats whether it be a waiver a trickle just cannot let them are in it but the president says of course\nI'll take over the house we cannot deal with Speaker Pelosi we cannot deal with the Democrats the shareholders\nI'm a chair persons of various committees\nAre which will wipe out important investigations are ongoing right now which will start new investigations that will be politically motivated and more so\nYou know the president is doing everything it can I said before the break you know his energy level is absolutely unmatched I said that not to just be you know overly overly complementary of the leader of my party but\nQuite honestly President Trump and his ability at his age to continue to turn out these performances and the high level of energy to try to rally people for um you know congressional vote for Republicans is simply amazing you've never seen it before President Reagan and didn't do this\nYou know President Bush won or Bush to didn't do this you can go back further than that\nThat nobody does this but the president is just continuing\nTo make this worldwide are not worldwide but nationwide tour of a of rallies in order to support Republicans if they do not when I'm going to say something about President Trump\nThat needs to be said\nHe was mocked for this in some circles a few weeks ago when he said that if we don't when\nUm the house or maintain control of the house don't blame me and some people mocked importance off from trying to avoid responsibility you know when clearly if a reporter if voters turn against Republicans it's going to be a repeat edition of Trump\nWhat the president meant was and I think last night as another great example of is\nIt's not for my lack of effort don't blame me I Am going around and I am doing everything I can to rally support for people\nTo uh you continue to enact the vision the the agenda that was laid out in twenty sixteen when I ran for office I ran for office and said I Would do a B C D and all the way through dizzy and I am doing it\nYou know when I'm going to say something about President Trump that needs to be said\nBecause he was mocked for this in some circles a few weeks ago when he said that if we don't when\nUm the house or maintain control of the house don't blame me and some people mocked importance off from trying to avoid responsibility you know when clearly if a reporter if a voter turn against Republicans it's going to be a repudiation of Trump what the president meant was and I think last night as another great example of is it's not\nFor my lack of effort don't blame me I Am going around and I am doing\nEverything I can to rally support for people to uh you continue to enact the vision the the agenda that was laid out in twenty sixteen when I ran for office I ran for office and said I Would do a B C D and all the way through dizzy\nAnd I am doing it but some of it I cannot do because of congressional obstruction and I'm doing everything I can to support that Congress and to make sure that we remove the obstructionists and that would mean the Democrats and we have to not only like I said hold on to hopefully grow if it doesn't happen\nIf we lose that twenty three to twenty seven or thirty seats or whatever it is that is the average and this is what happens in the mid term election the opposite party of who's in the White House loses that number of seats in virtually every mid term election\nIn modern American history political history this would not be a repudiation of Trump it would be a direct\nUm you know following of of of historical tradition just in terms of voter norms if he is able to buck those trends if he is able to stop\nThat that wave from happening\nIt would be one of the most amazing accomplishments in modern political history\nIt just would he would be he would\nBe stopping something from happening which is expected of the minority party which is to gain that number of seats if you somehow heads at off not only should he be given all of the praising the world for his ability to ah to rally voters in the face of incessant negativity from the media about his own party\nTo keep control but he would be you know he would be bucking political history in the same way that he bucked it when he won the office of president in the first place it would just be an amazing thing\nBut at any rate the president last night obviously are spending a great deal of time talking about votes and voters in the United states and tying it to the caravan why and how white simply\nBecause the Democrats are trying to import more voters by way of that care of them he says we're going to stop it and he says we will have nothing that we will not used to stop ...\nWe're going to talk more about that as we continue this morning ... in

hour and at the bottom of the hour RJ home and of the fair which is the federation for American immigration reform of joined us to talk about this caravan ended up as well but I Want to get you and an eight hundred and five to zero one two three four specifically to answer this question\nTo what links do you believe the president of the United states should go in order to stop this caravan of thousands from coming to the United states using a bogus claim asylum which is all they have to do is use the right language and they've all been coached\nTo know what that languages to claim persecution\nAre based on their race race or ethnicity or their sexual orientation or whatever the case might be\nAnd then of course knowing the outrage\nThat was expressed by the left one the last caravan came through in these people are made these claims were then held in family centers detention centers if you want to call them that\nHousing centers some parents were separated from their kids kids kids can't be held in the same facilities with adults\nAnd all the nonsense that we saw by the way even if we didn't want to use those now we can't because their full these people are they going to be released with a simple wink and a nod saying come back\nSoon for your asylum hearing and then when they are released as we know eighty to Ninety percent of them do not come back for their hearings\nThey disappear into the ether they disappear into the continental United States not stopping in the border states\nThey're coming up the state's coming up so high up on the Pennsylvania the going throughout the north east they're going quite frankly all over the country and what are they doing when they get there we heard the man in the clip that I played previously they're taking jobs\nThey're taking jobs they're using resources there using educational resources health care resources and so on and so forth\nAnd then they're spending the money that they earned back repatriating those dollars to their families are waiting them over are back in Honduras or El Salvador Guatemala or Mexico or wherever it is that they're coming from that's what their goal is you're still to what lengths do you think the president should go in order\nTo stop this are we talking a full militarized border are we talking about tanks on our side are we talking about\nSoldiers in troops in guardsman locked arm in arm saying you're not coming through you're not getting to the port of entry to make your claims what should the president do\nBecause in an interview aboard air force one yesterday the president made clear there is no limit the number of troops he is willing to send to the border to stop this caravan he previously vowed to send the military as opposed to the national guard to confront this group which the un houses over Seventy two hundred members strong it started\nWith about a thousand now it's over seven thousand it's organized\nThis isn't just you know legitimate grass roots and just people all starting to walk and somebody else followed like forest Gump they're not just running alongside just random laying off the cuff this is an organized effort

using guns of their own or assaulting or committing violent acts I don't know that we can just turn around and start committing violent acts years of the reason I ask what you did on there I wondered\nIf somebody could give me an idea of what life is actually like in Honduras or I Believe it's probably every bit of what President Trump once described\nA much to the outrage of the left you know one of the Blanco countries it's third world it's impoverished we understand that but that does not give people in those impoverished third world countries no right to just circumvent us immigration law violate our sovereignty and and pour into this country unabated it cannot happen\nWe cannot be the world's dumping ground for all of the rest of the world's problems as it pertains\nTo asylum this part as important as well and I and and I want people to understand there's three basic requirements for asylum first and asylum out an applicant must establish that he or she fears persecution in their home country second they have to prove that they would be persecuted\nIf they go back on account of one of five protected grounds\nRace religion nationality political opinion or

protected grounds\nRace religion nationality political opinion or social group in other words a Honduran\nMigrant or invader coming to the border of the United states after plowing through a Guatemala and plowing through Mexico and giving to our border they wouldn't have to say if I go back to Honduras they're going to persecute me on the base of my race weight your hunger and\nOn the base of my religion what religion are you that's going to be persecuted in Honduras my nationality again you're Honduran\nMy political opinion or my ... participation in a social group in third the applicant must established that it's the government of Honduras that is persecuting for said things\nNow we just heard from one of the migrant or we have one of the migrant caravan ah members in that piece that I played last hour from Fox and you heard what he thinks of why you why do you want to come to the United states and you were when you said jobs we want to come to work\nWell that's that's not fleeing persecution which means when they go to the United states port of entry they're going to lie and say I'm being persecuted when the reality is they just want to come to the United states take jobs from Americans or from legal immigrants to the United states and then repatriate the dollars they earn for those jobs back to their country\nThat cannot happen\nThat is a violation of American sovereignty there is no two ways about it let's go to Houston Lucas look yes you're on the Hugh Hewitt show where you at the rally last night in Houston\n\nLook you can with my father in law and my family\nSo you know where that is amazing that is fantastic can you tell me something\nCan you give me an idea and I know you didn't call about this but I have to ask you can you give me an idea of how many people how many thousands of people were still outside the bad venue or and then could not get in but wanted to stay and Sheeran support the president and Senator Cruz\nNumbers wise I cannot say but I Know all of downtown were shut down because no cars could drive through because of the amount of people still outside trying to get in and just trying to celebrate freedom\nThe president's ah estimate from his team was around twenty five thousand people outside the venue but your police chief down their heart Acevedo said ah maybe three thousand people\n[laughter] [laughter] no I think it was probably more like ten to Fifteen I mean all all the roads were shut down all around but I notice\nThat I Know they they try to minimize the president's impact in fact they they do that all the time and I know or else I mean it was very very liberal a sheriff down there and uh I Know what he's fans more but at any rate what'd you call about\nSo I mean I I'm a marine and I feel that just because of government our government says one thing doesn't mean that might be or be not best for the people I bought for this country I don't fight\nTo a sit back and watch our country being invaded we've already made\nCertain understanding that they're not being there not leaving on doors because the prosecution they're leaping because they want what we have we've fought for what we have enough they're not ready to grab a gun and fight for what they want\nAnd they can sit back and kill all we can sit back and just do it needs to get done the problem today it is we don't drink a cold beer out of the death of a school of our enemy that we thought we'd all but dead bodies on a wall to let people know that you don't come in here we are a great country and we're only great because we fought for it we didn't walk into someone else's country and take it\nAnd that's what they're doing they're not coming here because they need help coming here because they want what we have we need to stand up and fight for what we had before we all lose that just because the government just because Trump or the Democrats or Republicans doesn't matter or country of one we all need to stand up together as one and fight back not sit back and just\nHope that guy that does it affect us in our little out wherever we live\nTell me this marine how do you feel when you see these people marching under a Honduran flag\nI feel like we need to take a Hogwarts just go down that road just take care of 'em real quick\nThank you for your service to our country God Bless thank you Lucas ah that that would offend me as a member of the United states armed forces had I served more than anything else\nWe fought for our flag and these people are marching toward invade our country not carrying our flag so showing they want to be one of us carrying the Honduran flag saying they just want to move their nation into our nation of prosperity that's a problem by Princeton for Hugh Hewitt here on the radio
