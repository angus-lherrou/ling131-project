and our technology is allowing us to start to think of ourselves as completely ruthless\nAnd the way that we're consuming media and the way that we're thinking about political tribalism is a function of that sort of TMZ mindset you're right there\nI'm sure you read David Brooks his column the rich white civil war last week based on the hidden tribes study and it is in fact not a problem of the

think of a none of his comments and the tenor they bring to our politics\nYeah great great flags on both quite so first of all I think that the study of refer to hit tribes is great every your listeners should go read it a David Brooks peace in the New York times early last week was one of the summaries of it\nAt one of the things that he says that so really it is when you take apart so these demographers at social scientist started to look at America and figure out where are we on politics and so often we just think of it as right versus laughed\nBut there is another dimension which is\nIntensity of thinking that politics should crowd out the rest of life on the second or third most conservative voter and the U.S Senate but I'm a huge skeptical of the idea that you can put politics at the center of your life and actually live well and love your neighbor well and what what Brooks like was two of the seven\nTribes that are identified in that study hit and Dr\nTwo of the seventh that are most politically it at that or the eight percent on the far left that pay constant attention to politics\nThat are rich and the white and the six percent on the far right the pay constant attention to politics that are rich and white and eighty six percent of America is saying go away you people are weird\nPolitics as a means to an end so that I can coach little league it
