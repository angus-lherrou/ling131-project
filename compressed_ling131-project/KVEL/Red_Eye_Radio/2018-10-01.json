twenty\nFive these on any impact this entire episode has had on women's willingness to come forward and report sexual assault Johnny Carson also do immediately after it happens\nIt's caused by the Democrats it's caused by Dianne Feinstein and Chuck Schumer not respected her request for confidentiality smell when you come forward with an accusation as serious as the U.S it has to be tested against the evidence and against proof and we would have known that\nConfidentially inside of this year committee wasting its time and I don't know what I don't know what the FBI is going to find that the committee has not already found that the committee staff has already interviewed all the witnesses that missed four sided interviewed miss forward and judge Kavanaugh for six\nHours after judge he sent him a letter that was in an interview but you're not right about that so they've either interview them or they receive letters under penalty of perjury I sent for nowadays are actual interview so

everyone who's alleged to be at the party has said\nThey've submitted statements urban interviewed under penalty of perjury I Would be shocked if any of them change her statement under penalty of perjury to the FBI but if this makes a few senators more comfortable about going forward and voting on judge Kavanaugh is\nVery highly qualified nomination in in the face of an orchestrated democratic smear campaign then was that may end up as a good I was just kind of truthful and everything he said in his testimony I found him to be truthful throughout his testimony I found them to be in terms of the ... he was and\nI found him to be appropriately indignant sure at the smear campaign and I I'm disappointed what Chris Coons set on that video leading yeah and it reminds me of the old proverb

they accused him of being a serial sex criminal for the Miami\nOne more kind of Tom Cotton on face the nation yesterday cut number twenty seven\nIf it turns out that he was not truthful about something that has nothing to do with what allegedly happened thirty six years ago truthfulness is still something you'd want in the Supreme Court nominee though is that relevant\n... what are you

investigation as to whether we might be getting a a eight or ... or at least a page\nI don't I think it will be very very well done and I think they have a limited witness list because of the terms of the agreement that were struck but did you watch the testimony\nI only got the part of it I had appointments that\nDid you did you see Dr Ford talking about how she escape from the second floor
