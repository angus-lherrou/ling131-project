spent investigating potential corruption in Tallahassee now for three years the probe appears to include lobbyists\nAnd former a campaign treasurer for you Adam Corey you've been trying to distance yourself from Korea but you've been friends with him for more than a decade and two trips he took together are part of the investigation\nHow can it can Floridians trust your judgment when someone under FBI investigation was part of your inner circle\nYeah well you know we all have friends that sometimes let us down and uh the truth is is let me be very clear about what the record is I I Am not under FBI investigation and neither neither is my city government\nAre and what we have done is we welcome that man if there is someone who has done something wrong they ought to be held fully accountable for their actions we've made every public record available on a publicly searchable website and our city a contrast how I dealt with the FBI by comparison to how Mr distinct is just with the FBI\nOr he has gone out of his way before he quit his job in Congress to protect a Donald Trump or to curb the inquiry by Mr Mahler\nOr he has got even so far as to suggest that some deep state is that worked to undermine the presidency I mean he's a conspiracy theory if you will so if you check the way we dealt with their investigation as opposed to how Mr disadvantages dealt with it I'll take our example every single day of the\nWeek the difference between a anger and me that when I get with the FBI the prosecutor I was working hand in hand with them to bring people to justice\nWhen Andrew deals with um he's dealing with an undercover agent posing as a contractor who he was on a junket with a New York city you went to a Broadway show with an undercover FBI agent you went to Costa Rica with the same lobbyists and guess what happened\nThe lobbyists that wine and dine Andrew they got two million dollar grant from the city government so to me corruption is when you're in a position of

do they expect that happened down there\nThe election is turning towards the Republican President Trump's approval up to forty seven percent unemployment down I I told you earlier that story in Minnesota's amazing unemployed in Minnesota is to point three percent excuse me two point nine percent that's not actually unemployment\nBut that's below full employment that is just people you know
