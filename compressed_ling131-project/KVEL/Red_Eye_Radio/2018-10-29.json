I. L. M. in Wilmington\nWilmington moved over to great to have you on board one of the things we like to do is keep you up to date with all of\nThe races across the United states because the United States Senate impacts everyone one of those races in West Virginia where the attorney general of that great state pat Morsi is running against Joe Manchin the Chuck Schumer supporting a Democrat and Patt Morrison joins me this morning from West Virginia morning general good to have you with us\nThey get more than you it's good to be back to the program\nIt's great to have you back give us a rundown how the race than eight days from the vote\nWell you have a lot of momentum going into the final stretch\nEarly voting just started on October twenty four and we're seeing a lot of it on our side as people come out to the old I said people across West Virginia were absolutely sickened by what they saw on full display in wash this fall\nAnd they're coming out and we're feeling that we're growing in the polls yep some polls show that I suppose showed us up but the most important thing is that we're trying to get our message out and get a vote out in the final eight days the president\nIs coming back to West Virginia on friday just another big side for us and as you know President Trump is very popular in West Virginia you warm with forty two percent of the vote\nThis is talk on coming back each time these carp we've got a big boost to the polls are I think we're right there for the stretch where are\nWe know that you were just or another ... out of the year and we just have to fight a key part vantage over the next eight day\nPatrick Morrisey it as my view that the desperation on the left the attempt to claim the president and it's all over everywhere this morning the president is I submitted the Kevin McCarthy then I submitted the Republicans are responsible for violence that there's not a bomb or a semi representative Trump people\nI think that blows up in their hands and I don't mean the bomb I mean the rhetoric because ... the idea that\nThis crazed killer would be killer is somehow representative of Trump supporters or West Virginians is to me going to drive people to the ... more see a vote check what do you think\nWell look I think that's right and whenever people are seeing the mob I think they're beginning to associate with\nMeaning that rhetoric because ... the idea that this crazed killer would be killer is somehow representative of Trump supporters or West Virginians is to me going to drive people to the ... more see a vote check what do you think\nWell look I think that's right and whenever people are seeing the mob I think they're beginning to associate with the with the crazy what happened because people literally going not\nOn the other side of the aisle and I think more and more people know if Joe mansion or to get elected again this first voters for Chuck Schumer that whole Schumer post Clinton obstruct resist impeach mob that's what it's all about it\nPeople connect the dots now and there's more and more activity occurs where people see crazy behavior on the part of the liberal leadership and the people that are trying to gain control of the house that I think that's a very motivating factor more and more\nI think folks are understanding what these are not West Virginia conservative values they don't my record on the conservative fighter except on the Obama administration repeatedly it'll warn protect coal fighting substance abuse\nAt standing up for conservative values are Second Amendment and whole lifestyle you Joe Manchin the opposite and even more importantly when he votes for sure it's a vote for the mob mentality\nNow now to finish on that point pat more and said the does the average voter connect Joe mansion with Chuck Schumer because we all know what matters most is the majority in the Senate when it comes to judges\nAnd while Joe mansion may have voted for Brett Kavanaugh his party didn't they did everything they could to destroy him and he tried to stand aside from that wreckage but do voters know that if you vote for mansion you're voting for more of the cabinet or attempt to take out so\nWell we just started a couple of commercials on that I think they are or are they that voters are smart they know that the craziness they saw that come from the Republican side of the aisle they know that it's not always Schumer and Pelosi\nHillary Clinton I mean Hillary Clinton said that they can't civil I mean\nThat's a quote from Hillary Clinton I think people can connect that and obviously Joe mansion doubled down supported Hillary Clinton even after she said she was going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies that works I think they are you there are bringing it together because they know that\nThis side represents a complete a hundred and eighty to return to go back to the Obama era\nThe Hillary Clinton era which they really hate it so I feel that the energy on our side we're seeing it all the\nSurveys it's growing and growing at a job as as a problem as voters out it's just going to be a big issue for\nIt is a long day but it will fly by good luck path\nMore if you use sprint toward the end I Believe West Virginia is one of those that can surprise on election night because West Virginia very much follow the news and you know that mention is a shovel the [noise]\nYou in the middle of a nonstop action type information like the U.S is coming right back [noise]\n[noise] a five year old brutalized law enforcement officers gunned down these are the victims of illegal immigration American lives destroyed by our broken immigration laws [noise]\nBut President Trump is fighting back and conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the fight Kevin McCarthy is real mobile and enforce the lone act fully fund President Trump's border wall expands caseload penalizing criminal illegal immigrants\nAnd insurers only American citizens have the right to vote that's the\nConservatives illusion of America deserves the leadership of President Trump needs that conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy build the wall and enforce the law so health\nPresident Trump's visit time for the wall dot com and tell Congress to pass Kevin McCarthy build the wall and enforce the law at now pay for my safety for the express\nWhat this is a huge huge\nDespite its absence of empathy math is always served as the arbiter of facts versus opinion\nBut when the math itself comes into question we're left to partisan interpretations for example a recent Angus Dayton op ed sites World Bank data showing evidence of us poverty on par with Ethiopia and Pakistan\nThe Heritage Foundation disagrees they assert debate about welfare in the United states often degenerate into a fiscal tug of war in which the left seeks to expand the conventional welfare spending while they're right six to shrink it\nLast night on the Steve ... show he was in Pittsburgh last night calling into the show televised and saying hey you can't really have a better friend than Donald Trump for the Jewish cause autism and Israel so\nThey can say that but they really can't back it up and so it's unfortunate that we're in a situation like this now we're just going to ... at each other\nNow let me talk about that I'm Talking with Anthony Scaramucci his new book Trump the blue collar president bookstores everywhere also a lower third tier on on MSNBC today again this is in\nThe people who do the car runs aren't the people who are talking so I Can't blame is on me courage hours just on their show Trump's role in stoking violence among Americans I have a Washington Post column today Anthony Scaramucci you cannot blame violence on anyone except the perpetrators of violence is a ridiculous than I don't blame Bernie Sanders\nFor the Alexandria softball shooting I don't blame Maxine Waters for people chasing I'm I'm Mitch McConnell or or secretary Nielsen out of restaurants people who commit the crimes are responsible but what do you make of that lower third Trump's role in stoking violence among American\nWell listen I I again I'm In New York camp I totally disagree with that you have to figure the individual but I have said this is the president I said as recently as yesterday we had a conversation yesterday if some of my TV appearances\nWhy not try to tone down approach because you know you're you're at forty seven forty eight percent\nOr you could get yourself it in the mid fifties used to instead of oil on so many different fronts 'em and why why\nWhy have a headwind on you you can use these people on that he's on the opinion that there's no if you have these people that they're just going to continue to come at him\nGuns blazing no matter what he does end or says and reference a yesterday me on the phone the speech on anti Semitism that he gave on Saturday and he said it is just pick up all of that in the mainstream media\nOr and so and then I went and checked that went on that and looked around and sort of the criticism was while he was reading the prompt or he didn't really mean so it's just you know he he is right in a lot of ways you knock and it gets a fair shake that I feel perhaps you may feel that he deserves a as it used\nTo be whether or not then that I played three clips of the I I played three extended clips of his Indianapolis speech denounced the anti Semitism I think it's\nProbably the first than anyone driving to work this morning as heard them because this is where I wanted to get to the ... inside and you do a let's get our Harvard law school brains on here you know that the media has monetize hating Donald Trump you know that and that's a problem that's what's going on is that\nA couple of of cable channels have monetize hating him one is monetize loving him that Anthony is bad for America it just said I agree with\nThat well I told I told you that I think that we're seeing that objective standard and the business\nModel of these companies now fragment thing to go to people that have confirmed biases that he gives a very big issue you know when I go on time uh obviously if a pro Trump supporter where the three hundred and four page book about what I saw the campaign short stint in the White House but how he was able to steal the base\nOf the Democratic party and I go on you know what I Would say are adversarial programming um and I just get lit up and destroyed on Twitter now and and people try to do the politics of personal destruction and the politics of dehumanization and you know you're mentioning my Harvard law school degree\nBut you know Seth Meyers was calling me like fat Tony in the\nWhite House you know and that is what I don't understand you're you're one of the actual guys who came into the Trump Administration and nobody knows that\nI was I was a walking pinky rang according Seth Meyers I was at a gym and laundry uh Jersey Shore cast member and so I mean it's just funny I mean you're allowed to do that to Italians are not really allowed to do that to other racial groups you know work ethic rooms\nBut that's fine I mean the point the point I think the more important point you is that if let's stop this nonsense um it's just bad for kids because the kids are going to get out of the discourse and that they're going to\nPut us in a position where there are there are no longer are involved and I think the politicians not to sound so cynical actually walk\nYou left off ...\n... ... lab Anthony before we run out on a because you advise the present you talk to him I think he needs to do more television with more adversarial people like it used to go on with Anderson Cooper and that's not my network\nI think you had to go on with Scarborough I think you had to go home with Matt I gotta go everywhere 'cause he never loses one on ones and they cannot not televised and but he stopped doing that during the campaign\nHe was ubiquitous on every channel it every moment totally interviews on radio what do you think\nWell you go back to my calms plan I wrote a seven page calms plan that literally said exactly what you just said I was about to implement that plan on the thirty first of July and I got fired at nine thirty seven in the morning but\nHad I had been able to implement that plan I Would have put a big dog out there in all of those situations and I think he would definitely be gravitating way more independents as a result of that so I a hundred percent agree with that\nThat's a scary but you go to ... good luck with Trump the blue collar presidents in bookstores everywhere you cannot Mrs Trump the blue collar president come back soon Anthony Scaramucci let me also take a moment now\nTo tell you about our friends at citizens for truth and drug pricing good sponsor of the program and I want to make sure that every one understands that the cost of your drugs or on the ballot
