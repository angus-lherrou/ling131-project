very familiar with that tore blown the country now be route used to be the jewel of the middle east there isn't any more Fred isn't\n[noise] no I'm afraid not a George ah we've watched it deteriorate for several years now and of course a Hezbollah has become a very strong in country and a operates as an Iranian proxy\nAnd uh how long Samuel has this been going on with Iran backing Hezbollah and who are the are these Lebanese people or the Iranians who are they\nWell Hezbollah the Lebanese party of God is a Shiite religious militia\nI'm a\nUnderground Iranian proxy group that was formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in Nineteen eighty two\nUm Lebanon as as you know was always split between the Sunni the Christian and the Shiite populations for domination of the country and the Shiite were always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy eight one of the Shiite spiritual leaders um was was murdered in Libya\nAnd left the vacuum in the country and and that coincided\nWith the onset of Ayatollah Khomeini and Iran and the Iranian Revolution and they ... and the Iranians saw a possible fertile ground to spread the revolution in Lebanon and they sent emissary that they send\nSome intelligent specialists and they sent revolutionary guards and\nTo Lebanon with serious blessing and they set of faith in Lebanon and they established amongst the many state within in many states that was very obvious to many\nInside the country I'm for them I interviewed a few people\nWho are journalists at the time in Lebanon\nAnd they said that the Iranian influence was everywhere um sadly the the two people of the two groups that neglected this this arrival and the amount of money at the amount of influence with the Iranians were spreading a little bit on where the Israelis and the Americans to people that have a vested interest\nIn keeping 'em the Iranians way out of Lebanon\nFor and is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as el ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative a statement uh before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than\nThan any other group I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on\nUS embassies in the hijackings and the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which uh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of some history\nUh they said never been done this was an organization that had a\nLiterally a snatched or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild\nA all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing uh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um it it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred\nUm but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because\nUh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley um\nWe we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us exactly where he was so\nUm [noise] it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are certainly a um I'll never forget and uh but I Know that there was a ... a heck of a lot of us that that certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nWhen we get in that story I Want to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty is Wilfrid heard what what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question or you can only look back on the events of ah\nNine eleven and see planes flying into the twin towers and on the plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon\nOr as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region\nOr why we need a footprint or in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy or and or or take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil and uh that's the the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nAll right we're going to talk about William Buckley you're just a moment we're with red Burton Samuel Katz the book is called the roots rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them\nOn what truly is a very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized in hopefully Fred than Sam you're with your book be rules you get more and more exposure\nTo what's happening over there in the if you can see him in a couple of minutes we have before the break give us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um the the\nHezbollah forces have been fighting from the onset alongside rainy and special forces to help keep 'em president off of um regime in power um has ... has been transformed from an underground fourth I'm In the Nineteen eighties on the period\nWe're for it and I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of 'em this fundamentalist suicide Shiite brand of terrorism and it has emerged into probably one of the stronger\nAlmost conventional armies in the middle east um is it is for the United states in Iraq it was um it was absolutely in a central player\nIn helping the Shiite militias in Iraq developed there um I eat these um strategies and tactics that killed so many American servicemen in two thousand six\nLaunched a um horrific war against Israel where I'm laid siege movie of indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities um it does involve the narco terrorism because one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm I'm traffickers\nIn the world and it is a force to be reckoned with that we cannot ignore\n'em specifically because it has its Weaver cells and operatives in this country has for many\nYears and it is an arm and extension of Iran was um a desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the ...\nThat we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has it we were so from operatives in this country has\nFor many years and it is an arm and then the extension of Iran was um a desire to be a regional player is not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important to us national interest\nAll countries are coursework construct parties we work with will Selma bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets out of there\nGiving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah but why are we getting talks with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions why don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stopped supplying them well we're going to ... why don't we do that Sam\nI think that this country has been very apprehensive\nAbout engaging Iran militarily some are hostages were seized the U.S embassy in Tehran um many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war by Iran and Hezbollah against the United states\nThe bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and to see the bombing of the marine barracks\nWhich was um thirty five years ago to this they\nHold on hold on for a second set and we'll come back to this point and we'll talk with you a threat as well about your book be rude rules next on coast to coast that you\nNever miss a detail on a show or a gift to sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free it goes to ... dot com [noise]\n\n\nThan welcome back to coast to coast red Burton with us Samuel Katz their book is called be rude rules Sam you were mentioning of course that the Hezbollah may have sleeper cells in the United states is that possibly one reason we haven't gone after Iran militarily and attack them because we're afraid that those cells could be activated\nNo I don't think so I think um we haven't gone after Iran militarily because we're not really sure what a direct military conflict with Iran might bring I think the Iranian youth of groups like Hezbollah\nTo export terrorism throughout the middle east and the rest of the world is daunting enough for 'em policy planners in this country for generations it was a directly responsible for a lack\nOf response to suicide\nTruck bombing of the embassies the Marines and the kidnapping of a CIA station chief from things that was unheard\nOf in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only station is she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of the age of ...\nFred burden tell us about William Buckley\nA bill was a a a true patriot George uh he uh [noise] grow up in a stone um Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening this is not the journalists were talking about\nNo it's not there's actually a funny Side Story to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA and our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years wrote them and uh our bill thought it was pretty funny in\nA thought about a cashing them but I'm a middle grow up in the Boston area a seminar are lucky enough to ah get the cooperation of bills a family has a\nElderly companion or that he's lived with for many many years and a sister who just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up uh [noise]\nUm and he went off after high school into the U.S army in and lifted and went to Korea as a young kid and um where he was a silver star recipient and are\nAlso a Purple Heart um and which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into when it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates gets hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties it was very murky\nOr as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that can tell us specifically what he was up to a but regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian\nOf all things when you know didn't surprise me because of uh the nature of it is\n... it was very murky or as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we could not find a anybody that can tell us specifically what he was up to a but regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things when you know\nDidn't surprise me because of ah the nature of it as a curiosity and his languages and you know ability to\nTo just I'm a study history and specially military history [noise] uh so uh in Nineteen sixty he uh he joins or the U.S army again a and goes into special forces a and I'm also a associated with the CIA and that time period\nOr he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl um who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter in recruiter\nAnd I'm logos off or\nTo Vietnam and where he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire a so this was a man George that was always running towards danger\nAnd uh he he reminds me of the NYPD or cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers and they'll\nShow no fear they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and off the bill uh was uh\nUh the only guy to raise his hand so to volunteer to go to Beirut a at the CIA or after the devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station has wiped out so uh that was to Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Beirut clandestine war was the ... where do you well know might be\nWell ah the station chief or um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the uh the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other ... intelligence liaison services know that to such as the Jordanians the French the Israel and so forth so I'm Bill is not a and a undercover physician during that time period\nSomebody read it on you know do well\nUh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um it you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meat snitches uh and so forth and so um you know bill was that kind of person and I'm In essence a leading his apartment one day\nA in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles are and Hezbollah grab them and um they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't you have security around [noise] it's a good\nQuestion or I can tell you a first hand from that time period a it was an unusual for station chiefs and not to have security uh salmon I did our last book on been godly\nOr where you had a whole Qadri a professional uh security personnel to specifically watch a CIA officers backs are in that time period are they really didn't exist you could request security\nYou could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but\nUh you can't really do your job as a as a secret agent to use that phrase with an entourage so ah the nature of the job in that in that time period was a you're a single time you were kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for one about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\nHe was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and\nUm I was part of the hostage debriefing team where\nAre we were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages and uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out to who was a wonderful man\nI spoke to him in ... at least by Germany after he had been held in captivity and and he told his bill had died\nAnd that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where\nUm we we knew that we had failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because um we had devoted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so then it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWill must have been like looking for a needle in the haystack for\nAll my goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it wasn't that time period [noise] um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then um\nWe we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but um it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a a person in a building or in a cherry barracks\nUm and we literally could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating [noise] uh I tell you one of the fascinating things at salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran a and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut\nWhile I'm which I'm not you\nCertainly a smoking gun\nOr as to who was directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam wouldn't let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time jak ambition wrote an article about ... William Buckley simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think do jak Anderson's column accurate or not\nI I think if I'm fairly safe to assume that under torture\nI'm Bill Buckley um revealed information I'm a very classified nature I'm a station chief um he was the supervisor he was the um the branch manager of the ... the U.S intelligence\nApparatus in Lebanon so he knew the names of the other age of he knew the name of their sources and he hit all that information I'm In his in his mind

formula\nThat um you know it'll that\nIsraelis and the Palestinians can be an end to go she ate a case like everyone else and they're missing what I Believe is a critical point and that is that the mathematical equation that they're working on is flawed\nThe state of Israel was um a lot of creative the Israelis DNA dictate the Jews never again be forced to um to do anything at the point of a gun I'm through fourth\nAnd the Palestinians DNA because of the establishment of the state of Israel in Nineteen forty eight warrants demands that there'll be some\nOr have created the Israeli DNA dictate the Jews never again be forced to um to do anything at the point of a gun I'm through force\nAnd the Palestinians DNA because of the establishment of the state of Israel in Nineteen forty eight warrants demands that there'll be some sort of military victory some sort of um you would Jima moments\nOver raising the flag where they can say that their ... their\nOpinion there equals if they've ... they've achieved Harry\nAnd both both sides um in in how they approach the world and how they approach their very very small neighborhood\nUm are are bent ... are doomed to fail so perhaps what might be the wiser course of action for is to change the mathematical equation and to try something different to try something where I'm different\nSorts of ... of landmarks in while still can be reached in order to get to a place of coexistence and to this day that really hasn't been attempted\nBrian in Indianapolis Brian go ahead sir hey George good morning hay bright\nHey listen a man what a what a mess over there in the middle east and and and than it used to ride all the horses are wrong are no good over there I Am not of Israel and look at all the American blood been spilled over there over the decade and it just seems like nothing has changed but my question is\nUh which William Buckley this is the forgotten the history that nobody you know really remembers\nBut if he gave up secret in I don't know if you know begin or not was your any trickle down collateral damage to the field officer of the CIA that were out in the field or from the information that he might have given up\nA man or keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off the air you got to give you that question\n[noise] sure a good question Brian uh answer your question is\nUh uh at the time or the agency the CIA um could not take any more chances meaning ah in essence they they removed all the ... personnel assigned to the station or got them out of a country a shop\nOr they had to shut down or their source network a and anticipate the entire ... chain that that had been compromised their uh they had to shut down safe houses are where are you meet with informants are in anticipation that perhaps bill or had disclosed that\nUh so uh you have that trickle down effect and there's also a damage assessment that comes into play here to\nWhere you start thinking about um you know the intelligence services exist to steal secrets and so here you have or or the CIA the CIA point man and Lebanon\nThat had access to everything or what value is that to another intelligence service so if you're the Iranian intelligence service for example\nA Kenyan horse trader swap with a let's say a the Russian KGB at the time so those are the kinds of things that you have to anticipate and you look at it from a worst case scenario\nAnd you shut down everything so\nA was a operations compromise or a operations were are certainly shut down stopped or until a complete damage assessment is done to see how bad things are and then you have to restart a your entire um human collection network which is never easy\nSam what's happening delivered on today what's the situation there\nUh well I'm a Hezbollah is perhaps the most powerful political party in the country while\nI'm Hezbollah has um stockpiled hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles that aims Israel Hezbollah fighters are getting on\nOn short on characteristic Lee I'm I'm a crucial combat experience and counter insurgency um capabilities fighting in Syria I'm In\nThe er the\nLebanese fighters in\nIn in Syria have played a significant role in in ... being able to the Assad regime being able to remain in power\nOn Hezbollah remains I'm One of the world's largest narcotics traffickers a money laundering of 'em you name it we've outpost so throughout the world including South America\nAnd um has remains a clear and present danger to the United states Israel in western interests throughout the middle east\nDrug why do they deal with the cartels are that are in a you know South America\nUm yes there is a very large Shiite population in South America in Argentina in Colombia in Venezuela I'm In a previous work that I did um um ... we learned that um the the government of president ... in Venezuela um\nHad a um a a shuttle service on the Venezuelan on airlines traveling to Damascus and I'm bringing in narcotics to Lebanon of course everybody along the way he got his ... and then from Lebanon be were dispersed\nThroughout um points throughout the um Europe in the middle east um\nMoney the money from those cells were laundered I'm In West Africa um some of the money was smuggled as a result of stolen car rings in the United states um it is a global criminal enterprise\nUnbelievable I I'm always ... so we should just legalize all drugs set up to somebody you know clinics to help people legalized drugs don't put people in jail stop people from robbing people because of the prices will plummet\nAnd it's one way you're getting these people who are making all these your drugs and distributed um what do you think\nWell a large ... a large portion of his ... budget comes from um illegal activities and I I think that's um you know when we think about that we have to remember the more important than the religious elements in more important even sometimes\nIn state sponsorship of terrorist organizations are criminal groups and they\nThey survive they thrive and they operate with um with criminal criminal gangs um resident\nAnd that's that's that's where we're going to come back and wrap things up one final calls next on coast to coast [laughter]\n[noise]\nWe do George we're going to make a special offer it's our latest sky high silver report the report is a twenty dollar value but your listeners

Seventy four hundred\n[noise]\n\nAnd we're back with her final segment with red bird than Samuel accounts their work is going to be rude rules your website linked linked up at ... dot com Freda want to get your take on the ... situation of course and uh of course the Saudi royals lied about the case or in the beginning\nA truly was killed that the consulate butchered uh I guess because of what his uh his writings were about the royal family and about Saudi Arabia or but geez my gosh what's your take on that\n[noise] my goodness George ah I I can never remember\nAnother incident like that on a diplomatic a facility in the history of time and now I'm sure the Russians have possibly ah ah\nDisposed of somebody's via similar methods that we're just not aware of just knowing how the KGB operates or in this arena but ah I just uh I cannot imagine how a this operation was put put together\nA to actually do this or\nInside a diplomatic facility uh with all the eyes and ears that are on every diplomatic facility in the world are you certainly could could have thought of a a much better operation and and so ah either it was done with the purposeful intent to resonate\nUh although it or how it appears that this just was a a a tremendous fiasco and uh I I certainly don't think we've seen the last of this now that curious part to George with this is a based on some of the research we've done here at strapped for\nA there appears to then a few other ah Saudi princes that have disappeared too so um\nSince since the since the royal prince basically took over\nA correct a and before a this incident a an ... so\nUh this just might be part and parcel to a Saudi a outreach and covert action a to a target and eliminate a dissidents or any enemies of ah of the royal family but uh uh it's certainly an unprecedented a mess\nYou because when he came in with his daughter base when his father basically said hey you're going to be in charge here uh didn't he put a lot of royals away at the Ritz Carlton a in Riyadh and basically held them as hostage\nOr yes he did and you know you get back to a you know the the CIA director uh is en route or just arrived there for meetings or\nA which is always very interesting because uh those meetings never happened\nIn a vacuum or I Would not be surprised to see a some sort of a a effort behind the scenes to to try to ah make sense of what took place in and move forward\nOr you know that's the other interesting thing and these kinds of cases George you know behind the scenes or you know the intelligence services just go about their business and um because you know the the world doesn't shut down with threats with liaison work and uh\nAnd the curious part there is you know the Saudis ah for all their dysfunction and chaos ah there's still an intelligence provider no that that gets funneled into the to the big intelligence community so uh it it certainly is a a fiasco though\nIt's like a partnership with the devil isn't it well most relationships with governments are a few times a I'm a I'm sad to say and it's\nJust the nature of the business uh you know some of rock along steadily without uh any hiccups like ah with our five eyes relationships um but you know those don't or at times work as smoothly as a\nAs most people think ah because remember a you know there are no friendly intelligence services that's the one monitor that you learn and and basic age in school is a there are no friendly intelligence\nServices and nation state is going to operate and what they feel is in the best interests of their country\nAnd you're more cars Yogi apparently was the nephew of the late Saudi arms dealer Adnan ... uh there was so big you know there's been this power group within the royal family for years what what did he right that was so devastating that they want to kill him over\nThat's the fascinating part I was talking to a couple of our ah Saudi analysts this morning here in the office and uh one of the analysts actually had a went in and watched him at a at a local speaking\nReal family for years what what did he right that was so devastating that they want to kill him over\nWell that's the fascinating part I was talking to a couple of our ah Saudi analysts this morning here in the office and uh one of the analysts actually had a went in and watched him in a in a local speaking event\nUh this is an individual that are really wasn't that high profile ah and you probably could have lifted you know a dozen others that are more vocal against\nThe I mean he's more well known now dead then he was alive\nWell exactly and you know wasn't one of these cases where are you know you look at what the Russian what putting in the KGB did going into the u._k. and and taking out scribe Paul when ...\nYou know the poisoning or you know so uh you know do do these intelligence services see these a nation state moves like this and say well heck why can't we do this too I I mean it might boiled down to being something as simple as that\nYeah it's crazy and Fifteen people and apparently they're going to war ... most of them which is interesting because of the big are they going to rat on the person should get this done for me and I think we all know words leading a or are they going to keep quiet and the hope that they get leniency and get out of prison in a year or two\nWell and you don't want to be in a Turkish president that's that's the one getting\nYou know that's true too that's true to Tom in the Bronx slit skin started Tom go ahead\nYes I like to say that if the latest a horrendous caper is Yemen I mean it gives the United states very ugly face and name\nAnd how can you uh how can it be said that they want peace between Israel and the Palestinians when they have this ... when they have these terrible stories going on for one\nFor another if I were in charge I Would say well maybe you can take ... and make it a temporary a hot when the over the was not for oil and that would go nuts silver but for the sake of humanity to stop\nThe gas and it's from a sending missiles into Israel and Israel bombing has to\nDo at least stabilize it that way and then there's another aspect to this story they ... they took I they they took Libya and they made a mess had to Libya\nAnd in the um they they should go back there and retake the area in the creative same government for the Libyans\nI well I think I tried that Tom ... sealed miserably so far for an incentive you of course wrote books on Benghazi that horrible situation there\nA coffee of course was no Boy Scout we hated the guy he was a terrorist and all of a sudden after Reagan bombed them killed is one of his wives and a little kid or you weren't straight gave up his new ... new planning and everything else what do you think of that whole situation for it\n[noise] well uh first uh\nYou know the state department or has a long history of tragedy I've I've lived through a lot uh\nAnd uh you look at ... I I'm a you know they they have done a tremendous course correction or the organization my old outfit is hired more agents\nOr they've they've now train they now train and protect with buildings on fire\nOr they've worked with empty and wide to develop protocols for that or as an agent or I was never trained at the state department or as to how to do that in a smoke filled environment so there's been a lot of lessons learned in a lot of changes made in protection\nA ... he was a mess I mean and bathroom Stevens never should have been there on September the eleventh or as the chief of mission of the president's representative to to Libya uh they pretty much can do what they want and he decided he wanted to go and he was there and he shouldn't have been and um\nThe agents got overwhelmed and you know certainly the the CIA um security support team were heroes you know they can and ah and and got everybody out of the special mission compound there but uh [noise] um it's just a a another long list of\nDisasters that have happened and and [noise] um let's let's hope that we don't see any more on the horizon how many Libyans storm our embassy\n[noise] um ... do you recall the exact
