you do at this age\nOld ... has it metastasized another word has left the uterus and gone to lymph nodes and the liver and that kind of thing I don't think so\nOkay well I'm your immune system is your best friend when you have cancer\nChemotherapy kills cancer cells no doubt about it but it also kills normal cells many people who die probably eighty percent of the people who died when they're getting chemotherapy treatment for cancer of the doctors oh gosh you know we just we got 'em too late and it's so sorry that we weren't able to to stop the cancer but invariably\nIt was the fact that the chemotherapy agents killed all the normal cells to kill the patient is not the cancer and so that's a a problematic thing a with a treated with chemotherapy but as everybody's choice where they're going to get that are now I ... the antioxidants and immune support is your best friend when you have any type of cancer any type of cancer\nAnd so there's uterine cancer testicular cancer prostate

of a single mineral and I'm\nA ... and so but they gave him chemotherapy instead of giving them the nutrients\nIn in ... is it okay to do both\nWell many people do and do they do very well we we have one\nI Would I Would I Would I Would you know because unlike conventional medicine in some cases uh but I Love natural things in all cases but I probably would do if I had my doubts and do a combination\nNothing wrong with that well we have one product I mean we have and probably probably two dozen antioxidant products that we take 'em all but um there's two of them are one of which was a dumb it big study I'm and I'm a Charlotte North Carolina I'm In the medical school\nAnd it was a ten year study a hundred and twenty million dollar study was the government study and um it's it's on our mosquito dined grape seed extract it's liquid or from our um nature's Pearl division and it's probably shouldn't treat journals\nAnd it just came out like last year at the end of the study and it was one of the most effective\nUm cancer which I say survival uh uh products and so liquid and you take two servings a day for a hundred pounds of body weight\nAnd um there's nothing like it out there and that so they they were just so excited I'm a hundred and twenty million dollar government study medical school\nIn Charlotte North Carolina publishing the free medical journals its ... liquid extract of of from the most 'cause I ain't grape seed\nAnd it's just a beautiful product and then of course we have a caller is the radical uh eight hundred and fifty university studies in Japan under the radical it or has the a few Clayton which is an extract from red green algae\nThat they credit is the reason why they have so few cancer deaths there and they have a a lower rate of cancer than any other nation because they eat so much of this red green algae as part of their sushi stuff as part of their standard diet and so we have a product called the radical and few quite as either capsules and the radical the liquid\nAnd so I take that and of course I'd take the most could ain't grape seed capsules and they take the must get angry seat liquid just for prevention\nI keep my
