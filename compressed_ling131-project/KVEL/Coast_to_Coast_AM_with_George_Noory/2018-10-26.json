you doing now\nWell George I'm definitely doing better\nOne of the things that's really helped me\nTo come to terms with how I think of the finite and the Internet\nAnd in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings have disability but I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body finite zone for\nThe anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body and so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite\nAnd so in meditative thought in thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infinite zone where each of us a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat did you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\nI have to say that I questioned it I didn't think about it much\nEver since Ralph passed away I said a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nTrying to think culturally then we'll get to them in a second but there are three strange occurrences that occurred or want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the ... driver situation what happened there\nSo about a month ago I had gotten into new from downtown St Louis getting dropped off\nAnd to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nNone of the goals really do we get to the second book three strange occurrences that occurred I Want to go through each one and have you explain to us what happened tell us about the drivers which what happened there\nSo about eight months ago I had a I got in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want\nAnd he looked at me and a very strange stare and said I'll just tell them Ralph set it\nOff and I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said no\nShe how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love it how about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\n[noise] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and say we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nGets timing in secret and then you had an currents with some strange bedroom lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and\nI turned off the lights and I was leaving in the house was empty and the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me during the lights back\nBut the light switch back down and put it back up put it back down and they went off the lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off and at that time I left the house\nAnd just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\nIt was a point where you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise]\nUm [noise] I don't I don't fault him I have a struggle to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shield it themselves from any and all liability from every American citizen\nWell they're they're protected by law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJonathan was was roles subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student\nAh frequently making jokes he was just if you ask is friends they would portray just the most honest I'm likeable young man you could you could think of\nNot as you go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stand to take some stuff uh you know they're going to the bathroom as often as they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the Oslo\nI I think I think he was vomiting profusely there was a lot of blood and he was out with his friends who were all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there\nHow did you get that's cool well\nI got the call after the medication had been given to him about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOh okay let's go to some culture for your job let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington question story Hi Patty\nHi uh I've I've got a little story and I hope it's relevant to a distinction entities that I think I've got more and then you can shake a stick at um it started with my son\nWho incidentally was taken away from me when he was born we somehow managed to to make a connection that we can look back for each other on day he was born on my birthday three minutes apart from the same time I was born in from their synchronous cities just\nRoll in um um we were both born nine fourteen I was nine fourteen fifty two he was nine fourteen

ask you like him why did they take him away from you as a child\nI was he was born on the sixteenth birthday okay okay I it was it was better for him and me happened\nThat way and I mean it was it was excruciating to let him go but we did find each other twenty six years later and that's another one in synchronous these out of twenty six years we crossed in the mail looking for each\nOther is is is

I asked him to join me again for the latest Kevin last time we talked we discuss the potential for one hundred dollar silver I got your message that's a silver market to see the you know what's going on\nGeorge we always monitoring of the U.S mint sales in the middle of the summer on eighty percent increase in silver sales and with the stories about the potential silver shortage from solar demand this news seems to be in line with projections for one hundred dollar silver\nAre we seeing other signs of the supermarket is heating up\nWell why the men were selling more silver medal exchanges are also heating up buyers took delivery of more than thirty million ounces this summer with J.

silver demand we also talked about California being the first state to require new homes they have short are there other states\nMany are in the process but the latest trend is community solar what's that [noise] that's where cities install\nSolar panels and homeowners share the power Minnesota's doing this and if it's successful the program could Sikh community solar expand nationwide even globally\nAnd as you report says without silver there would be no solar\nExactly that's why some experts are calling for one hundred dollar silver and according to the world silver survey demand is already exceeding supply it's starting to get excited\nExactly how far from earth to where you think is object is\nWe think is about five hundred times further distance than the distance from the

quarter Liberia it's about two and a half light days\nTwo and a half light games from earth is that the border between the ... rebels and the or clout\nWell that's actually really good question to which we now don't know the answer before we realize that there's a planet out there we thought we knew about the border but now that there's a planet where that border we thought was now we're less sure because we don't know what is beyond that planet and we don't quite yet know how that planet is affecting what this border is\nWhat was it that made you an astronomer realize that something ten times the mass of earth could be there in the first place\nYou have the clue that there is another planet out in the solar system really came from looking at the very most distant objects that are in orbit around the sun well beyond Pluto they travel extreme distances\nAnd all these ones that are this far away all sweep often one particular direction and there's no reason they should they should be randomly around the sky the fact\nThat they're all off in this one direction you can only be explained by the presence of a planet that's perturbation their orbits and keeping them piled up in that direction\nAnd that what the new headline in October twenty Eighteen are about is one of the smaller objects to being swept off my whatever the massive will called planet nine that you discovered in twenty sixteen\nThat's exactly right although I don't use the word discovered yet I Would say we proposed the planets and when we see it it will have been discovered\nWhat do you need to people who ask questions about rogue planet and they ... through um the ana knock ears Marion and all of that because it does come up a lot\nWhat exactly are rogue planet how can a planet be wandering in the universe between sellers systems in galaxy\nThere certainly are these wandering planets rogue planets and they come about from the same sort of reason that we think that planet nine is out there they certainly formed around a star\nJust like our planet stood and then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other and one of them got tossed out\nUsually the smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one and in our case we think that that happened to planet nine but planet nine didn't get tossed quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge\nBut if you could have gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter it could have been completely adjusted from our solar system in which case it would just be wandering through space\nAnd so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's no question about it when people ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a\nConspiracy theory that there is a giant planet that's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and things like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracy stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplains for a general world audience why something mass and like a planet cannot sneak up on earth in the inner planets with out every astronomer on knowing\nIf something like number\nI don't know what's the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally over to headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize if it were really coming it would be so bright\nThat you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go\nLook and see it coming you wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping it secret and you would have been visible to every backyard astronomer with the post group for the past decade and it would have been visible every professional astronomer for the past fifty years\nIf all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know\nAnywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nIs something ten times the mass of our earth were even out how to do out in the ... what would\nBe the obvious observation all changes perturbation in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers in an apartment in the planets that we know of planet nine has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets and you can figure out why it's ten we actually think more like seven o seven times amounts of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun and the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so Jupiter has a tremendous effect\nOn the planets in the solar system and nobody sits around and there's worry that Jupiter is certainly going to come destroy us planet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter so it's a fact it's really minimal\nOne effect that it does have is that over four billion years it is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planet but even that is just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii and November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible that talk with you in December about what you might find or you have to wait to do papers or\nJust the way the process works is we'll go there in November will collect the data it'll take us\nSeveral weeks two a month to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so if we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month or two of collecting those data and then at that point will announce existence as soon as we can confirm it\nWe will have found it will go back to the telescope and double checked that it's really there and then will announce its existence right away we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] January twenty nine teen it is possible that three\nOr two of collecting those data and then to the point will announce existence as soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back to the telescope and double checked that is really there and then will announce its existence right away so we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] so January of twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nIs possible I'm always very optimistic Constantine ... my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know what you should take my optimism with a grain of salt in and take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it'll take us another ten years I think it'll take us one year so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nSo there you have a Oregon right from the man who discovered the uh in terms of those ...\nOf those half a dozen bodies that are all kind of gather together out where the guy prevailed in a cloud in that area and I think one of the most important parts of doing this research project with these scientists is that I have no confusion\nAbout the fact that if there was something massive\nThat we're trying to move into our solar system what it's called the inner solar system from a mercury\nAssad and mercury out to wear a now Neptune and urine is our biggest Pluto is a been dumbed down to a dwarf planet out in the hyper belt\nThat there's nothing they could be out coming this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity that that's the thing about gravity and that it it would have impact on every single thing and this is\nAbsolutely I would've loved those ... have been alive to talk with the professor I Wonder if he would've been able to convince him about that new bureau\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start up my own work\nThat I had a discussion a face to face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I'll do it said that for conversations that lend it because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\nThat even if\nHe doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff well\nThe idea that there could be a massive planet but when you read what say about the ana knock it through scholar and ... the translation that we're a card and\nDon and you look at the carving but one thing that always is\nConfusing to me they're talking about a Trump planet but in the can of worms or eleven got\nTo hold on right there in London let's come back we'll look finished that up in conversations with\n[noise]\n\nFive hundred million dollars of debt national debt relief is help so many people there a persuaded by the better Business Bureau you\nDon't have

bumped it back to coast to coast George knowing what you were back with Linda molten how whose story next we'll deal with climate change winter\nYeah you know Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty eight when the world\nWere really kind of waking up seriously for the first time to global climate change and real dire consequences in the future if we didn't get on top of expanding methane and carbon dioxide\nMight get around the earth and at the United nations many countries especially worried about Ireland and we see level rise ... and ... population they came together to form the inter governmental panel on climate change\n... and carbon dioxide\nBlankets around the earth and at the United nations\nMany countries especially those worried about being Iowans in which sea level rise could flood and\nDisplaced populations they came together to form the inter governmental panel on climate change also known as the eye PCC and the objective was to provide data about earth changes on an ongoing basis\nTo help project some of these impacts on world politics and the economy by twenty Fifteen only three years ago and the Paris Agreement on climate change\nMany small island nation were so worried about disappearing under ... rising sea levels that the I'd PCC committed they're doing a twenty Eighteen report written by Ninety One scientists from forty countries\nThe question was should humans to restrict global warming to two degrees Celsius\nOr one point five degrees Celsius below pre industrial levels\nThe October twenty Eighteen IPC the answer is the stricter one point five degrees Celsius equal to to point seven degrees Fahrenheit should be the new target to achieve and hold in place by twenty thirty that's only a decade from now\nBecause if we don't if our planet continues to warm up above that limit\nOf one point five degrees Celsius scientists warn there will be a catastrophe of math die off they will accelerate and the coral reefs and if they die that kills off other marine species dependent upon the coral\nWeather will become more violent and wins flooding rains and devastating wildfires weather extremes will cause famine and fighting over land food in freshwater and sea level rise will force more and more Ireland and coasts populations to move\nBut to where\nThe twenty Eighteen I PCC report said the next ten years between now and twenty thirty are crucial and in order to keep the one point five degrees Celsius limit nations must cut greenhouse gas emissions by almost half of what they were in twenty ten\nSolar wind and other renewable energy sources must replace as much as sixty seven percent of today's electricity coal\nIt as an industry around the world it must be phased out\nThe coordinating lead author or the IPC the report says quote this kind of a head in the sand mentality that has taken ... now in Washington which seems to pretend\nThat this climate change threat does not exist but this was widely knowledge in the defense community meaning the Pentagon as recently as three years ago and twenty Fifteen ...\nHe is professor drew shin del\n... professor of earth sciences in the earth and sciences division at Duke University and he joins us now from Durham North Carolina\nCould you please give me the top five places in the United states where water is coming in and flooding is already making people move\nI Would say those or Florida Alaska and around the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and Virginia and Louisiana\nSo those would probably be the top of the United states\nAnd where it would be the five top nation in the world that are now Ireland and other places that are most impacted by the level right\nAround the world unfortunately all too many very low lying countries and that's a large part of why we have this new report those countries want to the United nations to investigate a lower woman target thinking the\nTwo degrees was probably not sufficient to protect them those are most of the islands in the south Pacific also ... from the Indian Ocean many Caribbean countries\nAnd then there are very low lawyer in countries like Bangladesh where the bulk of the population village very close to the level of Nigeria has huge population you read your level but you know so does most of the world I Know in the United states also has enormous populations right up the coast\nAnd where in Alaska\nIn Alaska you have an interesting problem where it's a combination of rising sea levels and melts the ice and the ice protected the shorelines from the waves from the ocean\nAnd without the ice the waiters can reach the shore and more easily and the waves are higher because of rising sea levels we saw a lot of coastal communities along the west coast and the very straight area many of them are already\nHaving to be evacuated and move to higher ground it's not so much the north slope of the south and west coasts\nAnd who is paying for that\nI Believe a combination of federal and state governments\nAlready moving people in Alaska from flooding to higher ground and use that happening in Louisiana Florida North Carolina as well\nThere's not been so much\nEvacuation of the coast there's been more what used to be rare flooding events you know becoming quite common so I think that there is likely to have to be evacuation in the next couple decades of at least some places\nThere's an island doesn't have to speak for example\nBetween Maryland and Virginia\nMore than half of it it was already going to have you seen the water come up through the dream skin to Charleston South Carolina and Virginia where nuisance flooding there was very rare it's become so commonplace that governments and had to put a marker so that\nMotorist can see how deep the flooding is the food chain and Florida has been some of the worst flooding of streets in the southeast part of the state\nHas become fairly routine as he level laws has continued and we've seen an acceleration because both to Greenland\nAnd Antarctica ice sheets are melting more rapidly than was expected just to a decade ago and dumped more water into the ocean unfortunately what we've been seeing over the past several decades since we started to generate these projections from computer models\nAnd then watch the models has often been to conservatives and things are happening faster than the models projects\nCan you give an example of one who's been dramatic compared to the computer model\nOne thing was the boss of the ice and the Arctic it went like two or three times faster than the models for justice\nYes the Arctic can't males to two to three times faster than the computer's project is already my twenty Eighteen you that a harbinger of the fact that you likely the warming and melting ice will keep increasing faster like what happened in New York\nWhere oh we've been observing from satellite the melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been exhilarating\nMy twenty Eighteen you that a harbinger of the fact that it's likely the warming and melting ice will keep increasing faster like what happened in the Arctic\nWhere oh we've been observing from satellite\nThat melting of the Greenland ice sheet has been accelerating so that is definitely a worry it is extremely challenging problem to figure out exactly how this massive she might become de stabilized\nBased on a treadmill thing from the top with water slipping down through cracks in the ice sheet and lubricating the dead of oh\nNo we worry because the warming has been so fast in the Arctic that the acceleration will continue\nAnd we're speaking in October of twenty Eighteen what would you project we will be seeing more dramatic weather events between twenty Eighteen and twenty thirty\nLess rainfall in the west increasing water scarcity greater probability is drought greater likelihood of highest fire conditions and receive flooding in the east as you get more extreme heavy rainfall events and the more heat waves everywhere around the country\nAnd well even the sheet extremes going up in metropolitan areas around the country so things like Chicago in the Nineteen nineties having a severe heat wave that

was a child I've had psychic dreams\nDreams of having relationships with an entity that was giving the instructions I can describe it and see to you as a very thin\nVery white pale entity I couldn't see a face all I Know it would very skinny it hadn't very long fingers\nHow many I don't know how many fingers and add it could have had five it could have had three I just remember one finger because I had the feeling that it was touching me with one finger and it just freaks me out and that to me\nI remember the environment being very luminous very white almost to where you were squinting your

in front of the praying mantis light and are you standing in front of it and it is in some sort of a crouched are sitting position\nI wanted to stay at the city position because by the this big huge

don't think there was any clothing\nAnd the caller that is just praying mantis in front of you\nVery pale almost like albino Gary pale\nAnd there are praying mantis foods that can be white\n... I don't think I've ever seen one\nDo you see anything in the I\nI don't remember the ... it's almost as if I couldn't look at them I think I was terrified to look at them but I had a feeling that this entity was in ... something to me because I wasn't afraid\nIt was almost like it was giving me instructions very strange I don't remember a voice it was almost as if it would tell a path ethic\nAnd the ... being the praying mantis essence seem to be blowing like a sure why\nIt wasn't glowing had modeled skin but it was very white you can tell that it had a lot of texture you know if it was white it had like ...

had\nThese kinds of foggy white stuff and that led to Charles hazard and other even mailers who are saying that this is not the only person last night on my YouTube channel I had a dialogue with my audience\nAbout has anybody whether they're in a duct tape and experience or meditate or had they had any insights about water\nA lot of water affecting the planet between now and twenty twenty six\nAnd that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower science which said that\nUh he had worked on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six in which there could be some\nEither a natural cycle\nOr something that is going to now it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that there's going to be like a shift or a jolt\nAnd that it would cause your nominees and tremendous amounts of flooding and I have had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them\nAbout exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle interacting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that has written about in genesis and that is how ...\nAnd a complex all of this seems to be going that every single question is leading the answers that people are raising more issues and scientists are all for coming forward and saying that they have information about this and so tonight if there's anybody listening on coast\nIf you are in the military government whistle blower category or human abducted category and you have any information about a huge water\nThat could end up affecting our planet\nWhere they now and I'm from Columbus was conversations with Linda which is coming up later

Eighteen I received the following email from a retired us air force staff sergeant named Tony guy\nHe also sent me his duty to fourteen to prove his military background like Dr included at the end of my earth files news report tonight\nHis email contained a life experience that he wrote up for me in titled quote\nThe experience that made me a believer that we are not alone and it began Hi Linda my name is Tony I Would like to tell you about something that I saw as a black child\nI Am fifty seven now but at the time of the incident I was four or five years old in Nineteen sixty five Nineteen sixty six I within my bed one night\nAnd I had woke up and could not go back to sleep\nHere now from Winston Salem North Carolina to tell any town voice what stunned him as a child and hot it tends to this very day is retired us air force staff sergeant Tony guy\nOutlived in Dayton, Ohio\nI was about four years of age\nI live with my mother and she had a best friend that she live within two bedroom apartment my mother had two children and my mother's friends had two children and we were all about the same age it's a two bedroom apartment\nAnd it's two levels you have to go up the stairs to get to the two bedrooms and bathrooms\nAnd I was in my bed sleeping along with my brothers and two other kids and I woke up in the middle of the night I have trouble going back to sleep and not just the earning in the dark\nCouldn't go back to sleep so I decided to get up out of the bed and I went to the window and I was just looking out the window and it was very quiet about engineering and cars as how I knew it was very late in life because I didn't hear your cargo by so I'm looking around and I happened to look up\nLook up in the sky you know just looking around 'cause it was really nothing to see but a grassy field in between good apartments and so I look up and I see a light up a light light in the sky a\nSuit was on an airplane\nThat same light than I was looking at it because it was the only thing in the sky I noticed something was coming down and by the time my notes it may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground the light that I was looking at came down it was or\nWhat I noticed that now that was one half of it was so white collar and the other half of it was neon green color you know like the glow sticks that you see at the concert when they had the glow

and it went all the way down to his feet\nCould you see his teeth in this your uncle craft\nNo I couldn't so how do you know it went down to his seat\nBecause I could see that where the or where he was the end and it was at the very bottom of it I could clearly see the whole here is kinda strange because like it's you know made it but I could look in the green part is the part that duties on the other shot\nExcept from twenty five to thirty feet as a four year old looking out your apartment second storey window\nYou are able to look through the surface of the white side of this year goal or

buildings that were beyond it seems to suggest that even though you're very strange to you that it had to have been solid matter or at least blocking\nSome time to have blocked out the buildings that were behind it\nYes it is the is floating down is that if you would blow up a blow and toss it in the air that's about the speech this thing was coming down and I was thinking that it was going to

animal needle Asians in September of Nineteen Seventy nine and it's twenty Eighteen strange\nStrange harvest and uh it was a a well received a documentary it was awarded a regional Emmy uh so I was dealing from a chore as\nSure as fact based journalism as I could in that film and I had to wrestle myself with the question of going out into pastures often by myself together to issue and and various things and my vulnerable\nAnd having to decide within myself that I was going to keep putting one foot in front of the other and if something took me\nA so be it and I am still here and I was a to my knowledge never abducted from any of the many many many places on both hemispheres of this planet that I have walked where I have been where Anna mutilated animals are\nNow what I'm trying to do is set or a different lens and framework here\nYes there are animal mutilation there were animal sacrifices five thousand seven thousand ten thousand years ago and many parts of the planet is well\nThose animals sacrifices may have been provoked by the same other intelligence that is today in the twentieth and twenty first centuries\nAre doing animal mutilation instead of making us line up to do an animal sacrifices\nBut what ever it is that is the truth\nBehind the UFO phenomena on our planet earth I Do not think it is singular\nI think that there are many facets I think that some facets are truly allies and if we had not had allies whether they are from another solar system in this universe or from another dimension\nI Do not think homo sapiens safety and would have survived the the last several thousand years without help from something else why the hell does it make itself front and in our face this is who they are may relate to the fact\nThat humans have been abused and misused\nBy a tremendous number I think of intelligence is using this planet and the solar system\nNow that doesn't the fed and humans being cool to each other and the wars I don't defend that I think death and killing is horrible\nBut I Do have a feeling of compassion for my fellow human\nCreature that we we have never been treated to all the truth about the true nature of evolution of our own selves on this planet let alone other intelligence is until all of us know all of the truth\nThen animal mutilation and human abductions and all of the fast foods which seemed very disturbing may not be understand and be understood in a correct relationship to the intelligence is interacting\nAnd that is why I feel so strongly that we have got to move the entire planet and break through like and San Andreas fault that's what it's going to be like and that sort of what you're asking\nThe San Andreas fault has to be the global announcement a consensus of the entire planet\nThat we're not alone in this universe\nAnd that the government of this planet half just start opening up what they have in terms of physical craft and beans and knowledge\nAbout who is manipulating and why if we have allies we no need to know who our allies are and not be afraid of them if there are hostile as they're described\nBy some people who have worked in the government is on friendly we need to know who they are why there\nAnd knowledge about its manipulating why if we know know our allies are and not be afraid of that if there are style I drive\nBy some people who have worked in the government is on friendly we need to know who they are why they're hostile and that we have allies that are helping\nAnd deal with that we're going to come back with more questions with Linda Bolton hall next on
