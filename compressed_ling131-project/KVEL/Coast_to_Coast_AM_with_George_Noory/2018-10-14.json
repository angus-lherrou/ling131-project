chamber and then I present\nHow many sink which is a ... a ... brain synchronization kind of technology plus guided meditation\nAnd we do five of these uh day typically and what what the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state and every person listening in their own isolation chamber through the headphones\nNow he's like a cubicle or a ... and ... declined or how you know it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can if you can close it off completely you can block out um it's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber\nWhy is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus factions it's like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um the flow chambers exempt in this case you are not floating you're you're in\nThis this controlled unit and all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank\nYou hands headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them in their control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right\nNo that's the idea you are isolated\nI mean they don't feel alone because you have the headphones on and you know\nThey they're listening through headphones and any exercise minor typically about a Fifteen minutes long each one\n... and and people go on these incredible journey is a friend who see this several times when when you see anything since his own county in the minority and went into a data hate\nYes the idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course are ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself\nBy Nora will be technologies been around for a long time that it helps us go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go on Sunni where would you and I knew that there is [laughter] ... do you teach people see it it kind of a formula right\nWell there is a yes there's a relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis\nUm there's different progression setter used but it's basically a meditative\nType of program that's guided\nOften guided where you would just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experiences during even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have passed life regressions\nMhm they have contact\nWith all kinds of let's just say a non physical\nBeing different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up to our inner self people experience different kinds of\nAh let's just say I opening in mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life or ... or regression type flashes are quite common and there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self\nWhat did you get into a open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional self within you\nSee what questions to ask you know and then you write them down one out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal and\nYou immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery 'cause information can be\nTransmitted many different ways\nIt's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery\nOr through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information but uh people have all kinds of profound experiences and they awakened to\nTheir their true self and they're the answers within them\nMhm yeah so the implication that\nPersonal growth in the spiritual awakening that are happening in the can really be transformational and I like it because you find your house them in a way your experience you William have died in the direction that\nI Would have my own personal experience now\nMy friend my last season going against on the show before she said that she has independents encountered tools that need help and I think that's fascinating that\nSure um we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just means ... assistance\nOr that's but that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen I that comes up in my class as well or where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say\nTo people that and there are people that have died but they are law store for instance someone that may have died um quickly and they're just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI Know that that type of thing does happen quite a bit and um at at ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen\nDifferent classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance it's called the guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um\nTo let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMhm mhm so to assist him in crossing over have you ever done this after a tragic incident and national tragic incident were masked is still you know one\nI have because I I did a I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era and myself and I've received\nOr a a\nTragic incident and national tragic incident were masked is still you know what\nI have because I I did a I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact or during that period of time um that was a that was one of those facts where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way badge and you're having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body it's called ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to wrap our minds around that\nSo there was a lot of people that we're shifting those are people that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and its functions in different names and different cultures\nBut there are ways to to we we presented in I think I'm more or let's just say I'm very grounded in a

exploration\nNot through the trauma that to an actual workshop or it sounds fine regulated ... out of body exploration is a thing and it's also\nWell done it's very well done it in something that William Bowman has led for almost Twenty years at them and really it is it's typically if it touches on something you can do on your own we wear what are the cultures has this existed in in history\nOr leadership from the very beginning of time I'm Out of body experiences are probably the quintessential I'm a way that throughout history people had profound experiences I mean look at a biblical like revelations begins with I was in the spirit\nAnd if you look back through all the biblical text or the transformational type of experiences people there are consciousness was projected or extended let's say beyond their physical limits\nAnd that is in itself a form of out of body exploration it shifted to was in two thousand years ago wasn't called that on the train it goes all the way back to ancient Hindu Buddhist jak\nUm [noise] ... every culture and religion known to man if you start to read it objectively you'll see their comments about this uh I was in the spirit or I was beyond my physical body let's put it that way and there they had this profound experience\nHow can an out of body experience ballot\nFree culture and religion known to man if you start to read it objectively you'll see there's comments about this uh I was in the spirit or I was beyond my physical body let's put it that way and there they had this profound experience\nHow can and out of money and validate life after life\nWell it gives you that infinite number one it's a shocker for many people just to be aware of the fact that oh my God I continue its a verification that you continue beyond your body\nAnd that's a that's a ... in itself a big life change or for people it's a wake any 'cause then they realize oh my God there's I continue there's other things that are that are going on beyond the single experience\nAnd it really opens people's minds to the potential what they are I think about it there's um seven and a half billion people on the planet and people don't have a clue\nWhere they're going to death they don't know where they come from before they were born and they don't know really what they are they they assume there are a human being because they were they found themselves in the human body\nMhm but in actuality a consciousness uh can take on any for\nI I Know from having out of body experiences encountering all kinds of life forms including by the way animals many people contact a love and love pets six cetera during their out of body experiences and the pets are having out of body experience\nAny new ones that have consumer already\nKnow or even the ones that are alive I write about this my first book where my my dog McGregor would would follow me out of body\nAnd I also had a cat that would do that ... I mean these this is we're just real events that are happening the fascinating\nPeople all over the world I mean we're a multi dimensional beans that's what we are and are biological body you know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time\nAnd then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration is that it's multi dimensional and that death is in a ... really I'm no no that's been said but\nOnce you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who are passed and you're doing this face to face\nThis is life changing you no longer need a psychic to act as the intermediary you you you're empowered to\nDiscover the answers for yourself and it's really to find out what kind of journey are we all on 'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know what I shared this evening I just interviewed Raymond Moody on my show and you know the ... the grandfather and clean the term a life after death\nAnd um he had\nExpressed to me after fifty years doing\nThat\nHe doesn't know for sure\nThat that yeah life after death exist because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard now and the poor people who live here in his life to live\nThe nomination he's killed doesn't as a scientist as a ... right now I Know for sure yes\nIs exactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need books study research will never give you that kind of verification\nYou can read a thousand books\nYou could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic\nAnd it's not going to give you the insight and the verification you'll get from one out of body experience\nBecause suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards\nI mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\n... and to get away from this bickering and confusion in division I mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being you know you're continuing as you're involving beyond this temporary stage of development\nIt puts everything into a whole different perspective and I'm not the first time I mean this is not the Buddhist have been saying this for a long time\nThat you know we're more than our bodies and that were involved in beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage of our revolution\nYeah and I meant to say that ran in the Clinton turn near dancing and I didn't mean like afterlife that\nThat's what I knew

I don't know when we're young somewhere between two to five years old at least forty one and the average number amount of money in a recorded\nYes they're very young and they continue up to puberty and a lot of them are amazing I have twin boys and my boys both of them would have just profound experiences now it was it was amazing to me what they would do at night\nYeah it's incredible I had one on now you say it's common even encounter other in your experiences can you go back and read the thing you had a nightmare you when you go back and you when you\nClose the and create a new ending to it and forget green technique\nOh absolutely and you do that you can a nightmare\nIs a ... is a reflection of your fear and during and it's a matter of fact that's a technique I teach um that we have the ability to confront and let's just say dissolve our fears during an out of body experience in a very elegant manner\nYou send loved to the fear during the out of body experience um in other words you don't run from it you confronted and you send loved to it and dissolve that fear\nAnd you do it fully conscious not just in a dream but imagine it works in a dream to but I imagine how much more powerful that would be if you're fully absolutely conscious and you do the same technique where you are literally dissipating dissolving\nFears are blocks that's the great block for self knowledge is fear\nRight it's\nIt's a great block that all of us confront and one way or another it's it's an invisible box that everybody creates surround themselves and that's important I find that out of body exploration gives us that ability to confront and dissipate and dissolve\nThose fears that end up uh that just said eliminating our our ability to express ourselves fully in this life\nAlthough he eighty six percent responding to a point you know here no here during out of money and they had a very peaceful thanks\nYes according to this survey\nAnything that's very high\nIt yes it was it was pretty high or remember that a lot of the people responding to me\nAlso were not to um they were open to the experience to some degree I have to acknowledge\nThat not only are they were not\nLet's say indoctrinated with this health far and damnation ... I'm a belief system\nThat of course is nothing but fear fear is a controlling mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population a and it still used today right actively unfortunate way\nTo control um ... you know societies\nOr we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be a feared and ... that is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when you have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal\nAnd it sounds a little grandiose for him you know that you know my God\nI'm more than my body I Am an immortal I'm I'm not some um week pathetic being that needs to be manipulated or told what to think I you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be and that's amazing\nDisplay them you know that you know my God I'm more than my body I Am immortal I'm I'm not from I'm\nWeak prophetic being that needs to be manipulated or told what to think I you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be and that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body it really does help you\nAnd your level of consciousness and forget about the tiny problem in life that you feel are so large because our brains make them that way but surely they are insignificant when you compare him to\nHow vast our our universe really is I'm Talking about being beyond your body yeah yeah\nAnd what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively\nOtherwise when you have your own profound experience you you you can no longer be manipulated by the external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nAnd you know it and that makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance the political drama that that you don't get sucked into that stuff that you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there was a bigger game it's foot here you the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience so that you know the answers for yourself\nAnd you're no longer upon of anyone else any belief system government religion\nYou are free of all of that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the the ... that we tend to get in with his Eric all news that we have you ever did kill it and\nYou realize it's you know there's so much support and stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of self\n... that's the core\nIssue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge of self if every one seven billion of it suddenly awoke one day and knew what we were and where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'll be no wars are being not never shaft\nNone of that would occur ... because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connected but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly I'll be connected to only the ones that would be connected to [laughter]\nDo we go beyond the ego\nYeah we we don't we're going to take

friends\nI'm curious if there's any a relative in between the out of body experiences and a memory loss\nGood question question you mean not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\n... ... a little bit of both uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experiences so\nBut not interfering with your like everyday memory of needing to recall certain things that you use all the time so to speak like words and stuff like that and driving things like that\nOh I Would say definitely not that I can speak for myself I think my memory um is excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years\nOr so I I well like I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory and on and ... and I'm issues when you\nEmory I'm is excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years\nOr so I I well like I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory and on and and um he she's when you have a brain trauma that not so much he had a bite me it doesn't just served their brain memory patterns and All right\nNo I have not seen any correlation for that I have um I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experiences or have an incredibly productive and lives in their late years like Robert Monroe did and others that are written many books\nI'm In their later years let's say\nSo if anything I think there's the opposite I think ah you open up potentially um\nCertain pathways that enhance your ability to ah remember end to function\nSometimes the have you ever experienced is Jamie an added ...\n... even in them than I can relate to Louis ... myself out so to speak you know yeah you make myself poll or whatnot with no functioning so that's\nGreat that's great thank you so much for the phone call I appreciate it yeah that's\nOne of the techniques that William talks about is discovering yourself to out of body channel and I do like the fact that it doesn't ... isn't she does with the TV I any type of drama or brain injury who went to avoid those they\nThey're not saying no no\nUh unfortunately a lot of people do associate the two ... and it's and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do a for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese are an element of near death\nBut the two were actually even though ... ... ... are part of the near death experience\nThere are also independent of them so it's important a distinction to make\n... interesting on this kid he gave in New Jersey yeah well I Lived for ... million in aid\nHey Lisa the call is Kelly from inside the studio\nAnd testing [laughter] right [laughter] you know\nAnd this is where it might get a little weird when I was he a lawyer I was growing up in a place called ... town Pennsylvania we move there when I was about to where they started giving visitations\nThere were these visitation they gave me um I first saw a ... a day a Catholic school\nWhere I fell down as gay load my hands both my days where there's a there's two girls and then I was in charge scaly inhabited exactly would tea or ice or the night before and good to have but off they gave me a chance for a body\nI was younger I didn't know what it why are you liar of\nFascinating is very cool too can be be pecan in his room\nYes they can um there are multiple um experiences and reports of\nPeople that have ah let's just say knowledge of events are not only in the past but in the future or what we were perceived as a future you know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time\nAs we know we look at time is linear but yet those of us who have out of body experience is quickly realize that for instance you can live a life in five minutes\nIt's ... it's there was no time as we perceive it then non physical reality it's a whole and all that that's why it's important to learn about the\nThe dynamics of our true home are true reality which is non physical because everything functions in a little different than it does here\nAre and that's why it's important to begin to read or least learn about how non physical reality functions\nAnd sounds ... can you ask in a long it takes you know the late ... and William can you asked in going into and out of money Syrians and media destiny question or\nHad a senior or something else that really going into the future more than he giving out your ...\nYou can you can ask anything matter of fact that's one of the things I Try to um teach people is to be open to asking if you have a question\nAsked to get the universe is willing to provide the answers your higher self or your higher mind however you perceive that\nIt wants to assist you if you're open to that assistance and there is no limit to what can be it let's just say obtained um there's literally no limit\n... but you have to ask yeah it's great\nTo see if she did she are well hard line to berry in St Louis Danny how are you\nHighly surprised to take a call I had a question you your guest\nUm years ago while we were about ... idea that we're really close to the past ... really what we were out of town and I'm ... and I just didn't let on my lap view him to be in a casket so I didn't go off and I was upset about that and I had this dream and that was back at least by the time\nAnd I was chasing the thought that through a process of law very familiar with but what I made the term I mean it was my dad he was standing there who writes there wasn't fuzzy or not it was my dad\n... and I said to him I just said\nDad and he he held his hand up and he said you need to settle down it's okay and ah I I Want to talk to him but he was actually fading out and I was I said to him I said dad don't leave pleased to leave and he was gone I Walk up\nBut after I woke up I I it's stress and everything was all gone and I guess my question is\nWhy this dream on that 'cause I was stressed out about it they enter into my imagination or or does she think that maybe that was my dad actually contacted me from the ... you know life after death aroused settled down because it actually works\nI think it was I mean that's reported by my God countless people report that kind of contact and often it's perceived as a dream like experience\nUh the universe it's a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continue on and yes the people especially in within thirty days of an individual passing there\nKind of contact and often it's perceived as a dream like experience uh the universe is a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continuum\nAnd yes the people especially in within thirty days of an individual passing\nThe the the chance of contact is incredibly high a and often will perceive it and a dream like environment because we're more open when our ego mind is or when we fall asleep or Hugo mind set aside and we can begin to experience is\nBut yeah I think that was a valid absolutely valid or contact Mm uh\nI Know I've had that with my mother on many occasions and almost everybody I Know it's had some form of contact and that kind of regard with a loved one\nIt sounds very healing\nYes it ... it is\nVery healing I I think that's a wonderful experience\nAnd I think your intention was right near San there in

long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom at the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a ghost named sue\n[laughter] I thought it was just so\nPrecious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary friend when I was a child too and I didn't think much about it [noise] will soon started telling him what to do like oh in the beginning it was really sweet like oh sue made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat and I'd\nBe like that Phillies sue [laughter]\nYou know innocent but then\nUh I I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it and my first book haunted managing springs I changed the name\nOf the people and how old is your nephew ethics at this time next and\nOne night in the middle of the night he came into our bedroom crying and he was covered in scratch marks\nAnd he was bleeding\nOkay he was bleeding and it looked like he had been bitten all over his body and I pulled off his shirt\nAnd he was bruised and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what is happening to you and he had his in his hands and I ran down to his room and he had cut the ear off of our cat and he said that still made him do it oh dear\nYou said stew I'm Sorry\nHe kept calling it stew this goes through it wasn't sue I'm Sorry let's do well it was after about two or three months my nephew had us each impediment and really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name\nThe one that died now is the one that did not liked me anymore right for and before oh it was awful he said to me stupid doesn't once you any here anymore [laughter]\n[laughter] and then how when did you do did you\nOh my gosh I was so frightened you and I just I mean\nEven to recall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell that story um it it was\nThe ... we had to I we had no choice right had no choice oh what did you do that\nOh we had no choice and then if it's if it's to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties and like I said in the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that's silly stew he stole something again you know and I might find\nAll my eyeglasses in the freezer or or they might be missing completely for a week and then I might find them outside in the driveway\nAnd it was just kind of ... in the beginning and and and fairly innocent but what I really think happened\nWas not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but um because see remember it was hunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several people wins or menus I'm just going to say\nThat what what we ended up finding out was that it was a good sign up for it all it is it's it's really strongly haunted still I'm ...\nAnd you are still living there no milk no\nAfter five years we did get out we got out and the day that we left\nThe day that we decided we had to leave every single doorbell and the house was going off with was a four story home and we had doorbell is on every level and we took the door but now that the batteries out of the doorbell\nOn the first level and then the second level went off we took those batteries out the third level went off it it felt like they were driving us crazy\nLike driving you out would happen celebrating what came of the place we wouldn't have been doing\nWell

is that they cleared\nAnd the Huffington Post who would buy something like that it\nActually you know what about how about true beauty what happened with this house is that it was actually bought by

because it it it's free [laughter] fascinating about a hundred years yeah it was\nTremendously haunted and then later after you know me being a historian and everything I Want to know why the house with still haunted [noise]\nAnd I don't get into that right now right but I did find out that there was a reason there always is anytime something tragic or horrible happens\nIt leaves a psychic in in print or bruises if you will that can be felt by some people and I'm One of those people unfortunate\nWell at least you know that about yourself some people may feel it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives and\nThis is so interesting that you should bring this up because I'm actually my children's stepmother um their mother died of cancer when they were one and three years old and so\nUm they're both very smart people on both of them there have there a doctorate degree my son interesting enough um is a doctor at Stanford right now and he was the only one in our family who never saw a ghost when we were living it on a ledge or experience something paranormal\nAnd I really believe it was because he just didn't want to [laughter]\nNo he had an analytical mind do want to become a doctor censored like he\nTotally turned it out so all these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until\nI knew I wanted to know what he does his friends oh yeah my mom's go turn [laughter] and ah\nIt it's it's it's a\nIt's it's kind of sweet being validated finally [laughter]\nOh it has to be validated yeah\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling so now you still live in managing springs right Joes little the history of that area\nWell this I Believe this is one this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone I'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right\nYeah oh well this was his home base he is to hang out here all the time because we have a lot of lightning here you know where we live in the Rockies\n... and I'm so he actually built\nLab on the top of pikes peak he was fascinated with managing springs especially because we have some very curious magnetic anomalies in our town\nI can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter of the managers springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have and my how this will shake my hand and never find true north I kid you not the the Indian American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in these sacred places the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just curious ... the hair on my back on my arms\nAnd my neck will go up ... um you can feel it um and the other thing that's curious about it is that because of these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas Tesla\nActually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the clubhouse hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just circling over managing springs like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense of ability to find their way through north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain and\nIt would be he was saying he was speculating that maybe because of the magnetic anomalies at the Brits were hunting confused\nBecause they were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and and like kind of how the pilots interesting\nIt really is a very special place that is\nFascinating we will find out more about managing your Springs Colorado when we come back with my guest definitely water I Am leads to garner listening to coast to coast am\nYou what we were just talking about ... springs and how has this incredible magnetic anomaly there where else in\nYou when we were talking about men are springs and how has this incredible magnetic anomaly there we're real in Colorado and why the civically Colorado did it just called you\nKnow I'm\nI think another reason why I'm that people were drawn to\nManatees springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had a path between them that they would not\nFight when they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nWhat have you right over their natural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that the um natives actually curse the town after that and that's why it's so haunted\nMake sense to me [laughter] yeah it is yeah there was no you live there I Do ... and you like it [laughter] you\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here and I am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened to OK a year ago it was September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge now this\nReal money it was awful he's with suicide um\nCome to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a high incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism and I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to\nUm process and they they don't know how to channel the energy of managed to that is the legend\nThat that's why there is so there are so many um artist dancers singers musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly channel this energy for the powers of good [laughter]\nIf you actually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't ... it will turn against you it will become a negative force and I know that because it happened to me when I first moved\nHere [laughter] oh and I see it happening to other people would I warned them my\nA godsend moved in with me a year ago and I said I was trying to help him out he was going through a hard time and I have this beautiful addict apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and bathroom and I said he could live there for free just needed to get a job he was only here for a week and he you know the the spirit a manatee Wilber took him and he goes I can\nSee what I can feel it I've never felt so good in my life you know [laughter] I said well you got to be careful well he burned out and about a month and [laughter] and that was really sad\nHow do you suggest people process that energy wherever they live it's a haunted house or if it's a a relative how do you channel that energy\nWell I definitely don't want to be around any negative energy anymore like I said I\nI Try to keep you know a healthy attitude about it if if I can call it bad [laughter] because you have to think about this why is it goes here why are they lingering that can't be good [laughter]\nBecause there is on his own business right\nWell yeah but I mean that's that's that's a lot of anger too if you think about it and um what do you say that\nI can you would have to have a lot of anger to be it to be petted here um if you are full of light and full of love\nAnd full of Christ consciousness whatever you want to call it I don't think you'd be tethered here after life I think that you would want to move on and toward the light um\nYou know you got a good point there do these beings one just each other here to hunter disrupt people because they have a grudge\nWell some of them I Believe our conscious and some of them I don't think that they know that they are here still but they're they're all troubled I you know I Love these stories when people go on my bed and breakfast is haunted but only by us friendly spirit I'm like\nGive me a great there are no such thing as a friendly those Casper or otherwise\n[laughter] will because then why would they why would they said that's a good point\nIt's troubling it's troubling and and when you sit around with this okay ... did it it can it can lead you\nDown a dark road okay I've seen it happened to my friends I mean I don't watch TV and I haven't for Twenty years and it's funny that I'm In this business because now all these goes hunting shows or on TV [noise]\nUm and I guess in the last year or two you hear all these stories about these people that are on these goes hunting shows and they kill each other and that [laughter] you heard about this stuff I think they get involved into a dark force you know it's nothing to play around\nWith our own goes troubled and our own lives\nThat I Believe so I think that everyone has a different opinion now I Want to tell you something this last book that I just wrote was actually written because of a ghost I was called on the telephone to write a story to help this poor person\nWho has been demonized for the last hundred years\nI helped her crossover by writing this last book\nAnd I have that that is a matter of fact\nIs that been forgotten jails and color on his\nGoals legends allure of the Rockies by ship for and it just came out and the very first story\nIs true I Swear to God\nKnows about it [laughter] pardon jokes about it\nOkay about it it actually begins in Nineteen eighty five I was a college student\nAnd I decided to go to this little mining town to um interview the owners of this old theater and I'm not going to mention the theater 'cause I Want people to buy my book [laughter] anyway they go to I go to the theater and I have\nAn amazing paranormal experience where I actually saw the former owner of the theater and she was crying and she was upset because her name had been painted well I didn't know what to do when I got back to school I'm not going to write this story they are going to think I'm not ... ...\nDid not tell this story to anyone you know I've been single since I was a little kid so some times just put it out in my mind and don't tell anyone [noise]\nOkay so now flash forward to two thousand sixteen I have written for books on got goes legends lord of the Rocky Mountains and was quite happy to rest on my litter Rory laurels\nAnd I ... out of the blue dot a telephone call from the Colorado alarm company about an intrusion signal\nOn Harrison Avenue and those historians out there might know where that is\nBut only a historian would know where that was and that being said this was a message left on my home number now I was getting ready to take a walk I heard the phone rang and I was like I'm not going to get it but something told me to get it so five minutes later I went to\nOn Harrison Avenue and those historians out there might know where that is\nBut only a historian would know where that was and that being said this was a message left on my home number now I was getting ready to take a walk I heard the phone rang and I was like I'm not going to get it but something told me to get it so five minutes later I went and checked the phone and I'm like oh my gosh this is an intrusion\nSignal at the at the this\nPlace you know in the mountains and I'm like what they call me I'm three hours a day\nAnd and furthermore I mean only I Would know where this place is because I'm a historian I mean this was really weird not even the same area code or anything\nSo I called the Colorado alarm can be right back and I said why in the devil are you calling me is your tax number I don't even have the same area code as as this place and it was a man that answered the phone and it was a woman's voice on my answering machine and the man said I don't know what you're talking about lady\nAnd I gave my phone number and he goes we didn't call your house and I said I've got it on my answering machine he goes I don't know what you're talking about you're going to have to take\nThis up with the theatre [laughter] police department and I said you know your alarm going off at the theater and they go yeah I got were on our way\n[laughter] oh really next morning I called the mayor of ... of this town I almost had been him I called the mayor I called the theater I probably everybody I cut nobody could give me an answer now did you do have that voice on yes\nI'd

reading and she we found out that I had the same birthday as the former owner of this I'm old theater and a lot more in common that was just mind\nBlowing and my friend said to me you were destined to write a story about this crying goes because she is very sad that she has been even all these all these years and no one has hurt her side of the story\n[laughter] and she wants you to correct it for her [laughter] you're kidding me and I said she goes no no I'm not kidding you so I called I called the um\nThe manager of this theater and I told her all of this I go I Know you're going to be ...

that we've actually had somebody tried to remove the curse\nAnd it was back in two thousand and what happened was in Nineteen Ninety nine we had a huge flood again and it wiped out our spa building and it was almost going to be demolished the Murphy company came in and they spend up quite a lot of money to have this\nBuilding completely Reagan got it because it had to get rid of all this especially this and that was like three million dollars right there [noise] but anyway just to make sure that their investment was not going to be flooded\nThey actually asked five members of the

elementary maybe they shouldn't do that again yeah not when it comes to yeah I mean there are\nCertain things to be said for the history tours and things that are being done in the secret land ... or hotels being built and so forth where's the the fine line there to honor in respect to the floor of that particular way\nYeah I I say thanks every day you know to the good lord to the spirits that the to the land that be and I give there is a legend about managing springs that you're not allowed to leave and nice you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you come here because you are supposed to learn a lesson you don't come here because it's a choice\nYou Martin summoned to this town and I know that\nSounds crazy but I have talked to so many people over the years and I always ask them I said so what brought you to manage to springs\nHallways\nWe even know if you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you come here because you are supposed to learn a lesson you don't come here because it's a choice\nYou Martin summoned to this town and I know that\nSounds crazy but I have talked to so many people over the years and I always ask them I said so what brought you to manage to springs\nOh always the same story it was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran out of yes uh-huh I Am stories like that and when you hear so many of them you know this isn't a coincidence\nMm interesting so let's go back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to these types of energy or maybe you have a ghost in your house or\nSomething that might be visiting you ... what do you suggest to people that maybe don't want you want to do to transition want to move on already yeah\nSee I think that when someone dies now I I Want to ... this with make sure that I don't offend anybody is religious or spiritual beliefs this is these are just my feelings\nI think when someone dies for the first three days or so that maybe their spirit linger it's that they stay here some people believe that some you know maybe you just hang around to see her funeral and then you leave if you're not have both\n[laughter] um other stay\nRight up but if there is a lingering energy in your home get rid of it or move\n[laughter] usually own that particular person I didn't\nSee I earlier in the conversation I did say that my house has haunted that I live in now and that\nI Want to say but the ... that it is it used to be the pikes peak Bible college that has a very interesting history\nAnd anyhow the other day band that it is that the valley so than this time of year I actually heard choir and music in my house I've lived here for Fifteen Years have never heard that before when I ran into the dining room and then it it ceased I Know it was inside of my house I heard it my dogs hurt it they weren't howling\nLike going on I think that's a residual it's like a birth in time you know quantum says this can explain it better than I can but I just think of it is like Brent toast you can still smell the\nBurnt so bad [laughter] it's fun yeah\nI Lived in time make more sense where it could be a coming back into this dimension temporarily in a split second yes\nAnd see that doesn't have a consciousness the choir music that I heard did not have a consciousness\nWho you mean by no means it was just like I heard it in the room like some it was a burping time does that make sense I didn't have a conscious\nIt's yeah it's just music that I heard like they came through sometimes believe it or not I can hear the trains that used to run behind my house and Senate ran in over a hundred years yeah so yeah when I hear so I don't know other people do [laughter]\nYou have anybody around that you could ask [laughter] much\nMore in tune with the higher laws of nature as I say it delicately they can they can pick up on it to have children especially that's why I Love it when when little children come on my tour is because um I turned it down a little bit so I don't scare them so much but ah the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to the\nRight to read so back to where people feel that they're afraid of ghosts are saying that they're not usually wanting to stay they want to move on or they should leave on it\nMove on I think it would be like you know when you're hungry you just know to eat\nHow do you help uh being do that no would you suggest or how would you teach someone to us this this goes to move on\nWell you can always try talking to it I Swear it works and what would you ask\nI tell it are you you need to move on you know you're not supposed to be here anymore and I notice is your house and you love it that you are not supposed to be here anymore your loved ones are waiting for you on the other side you need to go\nAnd just talk to them like the common person would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get caught here it's it's really sad if you think about these go centers that go out and our teasing them like they're like they're like in the zoo or something\nYou know he's not very nice\nLooking Ghostbusters when they could vacuum them up and put them in a two yeah when you ask this where you say to this this\nEntity that might be hanging around and causing this just move on ... ... why do people get scared\nI think that I you know what those hunting is addicting first of all it is so fascinating we both in fascinating with what's on the other side and then once you have validation I tell you what it does not stop it that it's like gambling or something it\nOpens up a whole new world as opposed to the moon and I can't\nBelieve this happened and then you do feel special because so many people want a validation that there is life after death let's be honest and when you do have it happen it blows your mind and you will never forget it and you will never let anyone talk you out of what you saw\nSee that's what happened to me when I was a child my parents told me that it was because they dropped me on the head when I was a baby\n[laughter] imagine that so I mean they all my life I was told that I was crazy and I'm not [laughter] other people have had happiest\nEnthusiastic I Would say [laughter] but now some of which do you started this wonderful convention this paranoia ... mentioned travels to various areas tell us a little bit about it\n[noise] well um we call it a mood movable fees for like I said and so when we go into different areas the very very very first thing that we do is we contact with the local historians and the local goes hunting groups and we say we want to be your advocate\nWe are here to help you and your community it do you need to get rid of and he does we're here we're not going to be like those guys so we're really like I Would call us paranormal psychologist [laughter]\nThere's such a jerk and yes\nAnd that's what we do and we're very kind and we're and we try to talk them over or do whatever we can write a book [laughter]\nThese two when you do the ... you have a group that comes with you and it's more of an active type of tour right\nMy two words it's because of the town itself is very active and this is how I Do my tour is um if you look at my website managed to lead since that time you will see that there's very little information on there after Seventeen years\nThere's a reason for that I don't have a meeting sites because before my tours I actually do a prayer and a meditation on that for the spirits which one wants to come out and talk tonight\nSo the tourists do change night by night and you never know which spirit is going to come out and play quite interesting\nYeah does that do say with specific date and time and all that you think are not as validating\nNo I didn't say that at all I'm just saying that's how I run my tours okay\nThere are always different they always change because that's how the paranormal is it's always changing it's always different\nThat there are some spirits that are pretty consistent but I called those kind of has much like fishing I mean as much as I Love to go fishing sometimes I don't catch a darn thing and that's how it goes hunting is you just never know what's gonna happen and then sometimes you'll it'll be hot and you'll catch a bunch of\nGhosts [laughter] my

for\nAh these Akron as ... and um what is that controlled holistic\nEnvironmental chamber in other words each person's in and personal isolation booth\nAnd I speak to them when we're doing a technique

both\nAnd I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber and then I present Emmys sank which is a ... a ... brain synchronization kinds of technology plus guided meditation\nAnd we do five of these uh day typically and work with the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state and every person listening in their own isolation chamber through the headphone\nNow is it like a cubicle or a ... and ... declined or how you know it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad\nOkay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um\nIt's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus factions it's like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um\nThe flow chambers exempt in this case you are not floating you're you're in this this controlled unit and all\nThe sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank\nDo you have headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them and their control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right\nNo that's the idea you are isolated\nI mean they don't feel alone because you have the headphones on and you know\nThey they're listening through headphones and exercise minor typical you about a Fifteen minutes long each one\n... and and people go on these incredible journey is a friend who she didn't have all the time when when you take anything first of all he is the minority and when you truly hate hate\nYes the idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course are ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself\nBy nor will be technologies been around for a long time that it helps as you go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go and turning where would you and I knew that [laughter] ... do you listen to it it kind of a formula right\nWell there is a yes or a relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis\nUm there's different progression setter used but it's basically a meditative type of program that guided often guided where you would just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experience during even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have passed life regressions\nMhm they have contact\nWith all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up to our inner self people experience different kinds of\nAh let's just say ... opening a mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life for ... a regression type flashes are quite common and there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore your true self went\nIn to open up to that awakened to that multi dimensional self within you\nSee what the question did you ask yourself and then you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receive gifts a journal or they bring a journal and you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever in whatever kind of information may have come to you\nOr imagery because information can be\nTransmitted many different ways\nIt's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information\nBut uh people have all kinds of profound experiences and they awakened to\nTheir their true self and they're the answer is within them\nMhm yeah so the implication that personal growth in the spiritual awakening that are happening in the can really be transformational and I like it because you find your house and then I mean either way you're\nFeeling you William how he died in in the direction I Would have my own personal experience now\nMy friend mine I think he's been against on the show before she said that she

people that just means ... assistance\nOr that's but that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen I that comes up in my class as well or where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say\nTo people that and there are people that have died but they are lost or for instance someone that may have died um quickly and they're just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nYou know that that type of thing does happen\nQuite a bit and um at at ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focus is\nOn that type of guidance it's called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um and\nTo let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMhm mhm so to assist him in

I mean these this is just real events that are happening the fascinating\nPeople all over the world I mean we're a multi dimensional beans that's what we are and are biological body you know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time\nAnd then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration is that it's multi dimensional and that death is in a ... really I'm no no that's been said but\nOnce you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who are passed and you're doing this face to face\nThis is life changing you no longer need a psychic to act as the intermediary you you you're empowered to\nDiscover the answers for yourself and it's really to find out what kind of journey are we all on 'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know what I shared that you can I just interviewed Raymond Moody on my show and you know the ... the grandfather and clean the term a life after death\nAnd um he had\nExpressed to me after fifty years doing\nThat\nHe doesn't know for sure\nThat that yeah light that's again I think just because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard now and the poor people who have experience it's a nice life\nTo nominate he's killed doesn't as a scientist as a ... right now I Know for sure yes\nIs exactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need books study research will never give you that kind of verification\nYou can read a thousand books\nYou could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic and it's not going to give you the insight and the verification you'll get from one out of body experience\nBecause suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour and that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards\nI mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\n... and to get away from this bickering and confusion and division\nI mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being you know you're continuing as you're involving beyond this temporary stage of development it puts everything into a whole different perspective\nAnd I'm not the first time I mean this is not the Buddhist have been saying this for a long time\nThat you know we're more than our bodies and that were involved in beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage of our revolution\nYeah and I meant to say that ... going to turn near death experience sorry I didn't mean life a life\nThat that's what I knew when I did my own Google Search on I just typed in near death experience in over twenty five million search on Google were not the only ones that are interested in is becoming more and more of a\nA phenomenon popular people are interested in what beyond just sort of they always have been you know sort of play so much as he or any more than\n... you can you have any family that you were there and you had this experience for you you were saying can you use this out of body experience even and we can you tell us about that\nWell in two thousand eleven I I've discovered I had a serious a stage for cancer of the lymph nodes and tonsils and I it was a shock it was ... come on very quickly out a large tumor on my neck lymph nodes\nAre yeah lymph nodes and anyway it was a serious issue and I had to get immediate\nHad to make quick decisions on this because it was a you know it spreads I'd ... broken and cap solution so I I went through traditional ah because it was so quick and so fast I did a traditional medicine\nBut um during my recovery\nI was having some really profound out of body experiences and in a sequence of events which I did not self initiate by the way these are just spontaneous out of body experiences which I was having why was recovering from cancer\n... uh I had a cease healing experiences\nAnd it's difficult to explain this but in one of them I found myself in this this white cube it was like a twelve meter sure square cube was segmented walls I write about this and adventures in the afterlife\nCall to explain this but in one of them I found myself in this this white cube it was like a twelve meter sure square cube was segmented walls I write about this and adventures in the afterlife", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Vernal", "day": "14"}
