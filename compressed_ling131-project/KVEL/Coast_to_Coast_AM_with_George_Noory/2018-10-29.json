and other worlds gets thin\nAnd maybe just maybe as a time when those other worlds dribble over into ours\nWe're gonna talk about that idea tonight with two very sharp mine's gas to been thinking about these questions and subjects on a higher plane than most of us\nYou know we talk about other dimensions parallel realities on this program all the time about beings from other worlds about inter dimensional time travelers dimensional portals\nWe all kind of take it for granted sometimes that all those ideas are real or at least we think we understand that wasn't always that way for people do how do we get to this point and what does it mean for us if there are other dimensions does it mean there are people in those other places and if so can they get here\nOr maybe they're us these are heavy\nTopics but we have a great guest to help us get our heads around them Christopher white earned a PHD and religious studies from Harvard He's written a brilliant book called other worlds spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions\nWhich takes a look at our understanding of the world around us and unseen worlds such as the future or heaven or other dimensions have a ball or

us when we die for Halloween\nWhen spirit supposedly roam around among us so I figured this might be a good fit\nDr white has written an entertaining and provocative masterpiece and I'm really looking forward to him joining us in the second half of the program coming up a bit later\nFirst though we welcome back intrepid investigator and prolific writer Nick Redfern as many of you know Nick has traveled the world digging into strange tails and dark legends and all too true conspiracies and I wanted to get him back for a pre Halloween discussion\nBig votes um you know falls into that category because we don't really know how gigantic faith is all you know did it all like a ... or walk upright like us you know that would give us the answers but we don't have enough skeletal material to like that sort of determination but ah\nYou know I think the the idea of extinction that might actually not be\nExtinct could actually uh applied to a number of these so called trip to says that cold\nAnd then you get into some real weird ones and ballet and he'll in books like that and written about commonalities with these creatures though yeah maybe ills and troll that were reported long ago are now being\nRecorded as ETs or aliens and it may be the same beings that are in different forms are seen through a different cultural prison where you come down on that\nWell yeah I mean I think um\nWhen the ballet and he'll in books like that and written about commonalities with these creatures yeah maybe ... that were reported long ago are now being recorded as ETs or aliens and it may be the same beings that are in different forms are seen through a different cultural prison were you doing that\nWell yeah I mean I'm a big I'm sort of follower of of John Cale is would particularly and I think one of the things for me at least I mean I've you know different people get difference you know responses from from reading his books\nBut from my perspective I I kind of type the view that is most important um [noise]\nRevelation if you like or conclusion was that many of these phenomena seems to be\nMulti connected if you like to connect save and buy that you know you have a lot of reports where people have seen big foot side creatures on in the same location and timeframe or say for example UFO activity I'm the most money point pleasant West Virginia or in the sixties\nUm when they were ... when they ... from the same soaring around the the skies above ... point pleasant he also had a lot of encounters with men in black and you were falling cancer so I think some of these creatures at least some of the the we're the ones like ... and the dog men and things like that\nI think I'm not even should I should fall into the category of\nCrypto zoology all\nCreatures shaking because I'm not entirely sure they are creatures or animals in the way we understand it um you know when you get reports of say a big foot vanishing in a flash of light or you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing\nIt makes me think that we daily with something that's perceived as an animal\nThat night may not be I don't think Kael was I'm\nSomeone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people just didn't they just turn their heads I just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle and Dale with the the way the site of these phenomena\nIn this book the book of monsters or several reports early in the book that sort of blend together at least in my head you got movement going man oh we're ... we're cats sheep's you are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen an awful lot of commonalities um\nOr or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really but it's I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has\nChanged into a wet well from a regular person you know that\nSort of all the the Hollywood imagery butts the fact is that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seemed to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs um\nI've got a lot I get a lot of reports like that but I've I've never gone to reports of someone you know literally\nShape shifting like in you know American have over to London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive what I've found is that\nThe the locations where these dog men type creatures said is intriguing it very often these\nAncient burial mountains I'm Native American land um some of the the the mysterious old mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing Bob and just seeing that random\nYou had one uh where ... ... that was from a military base not each it either it's more recent times remember them yes\nYeah this was um at a British a bicycle royal Airforce helped him re and are actually was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was I'm\nActually an American guy but it's working I'm overseas are EFL can break in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of ... which had\nI'm an American presence this was the height of the Cold War and he he swore that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ... and would have sort of kind of look like a big for type ... was it not for the five\nThat just the the face was very different to how you're\nDescribing nights and it was more like a lung muzzle with point today is very much like a German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of big for about a with a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um [noise] you know I didn't see any reason why\nHe should know creates a story like that'll fabricate the story like that he was um I was able to confess I mean he's a background in the military and he said he just wanted to share their story because they never forgotten about it and it was so when\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instant where people are record these huge dogs I mean right down to ... you make that that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic and the you know you can see All right maybe it's an animal scape from the new or maybe in somebody's dog got out in the living well these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the donors have been really dramatic you share a couple of those start with the the dome\n[noise] well yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mind which kind of looks like a a dog like animal but it's you know clearly is not\nWell in England or the okay we have what are known as find some black dogs now I'm Conan off of Conan Doyle who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel hand to the ... he actually based his novel on a pre existing legend\nI'm of one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k. um they typically a much logging much larger than regular dogs and they have these fiery blazing red eyes\nI mean a lot of the old legends and traditions if you would just say one of these um find some black dogs with either made that you would die or you know a close family member or friend would die\nI'm On the ... the dog mine they were often seen at the same places like um crossroads graveyards um places like that in mobile racing is I've got several\nUm reports of people saying to find some black dogs in the vicinity of stone circles in the u._k. not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but you know there are many many um smaller I'm full nations around the a K and I've got two cases\nFrom Scotland where witnesses so one of these large black dogs that and like the old cases going back centuries\nThe dog was that one second and then quite literally gone the next second you know just\nVanished into nothing um and again it's hard to determine what these things all you know\nThat clearly not normal dogs I mean all the ice the spirits of dogs that once lived um I guess the only downside with that is it that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine if I were the\nThey actually gone and ex second you know just vanished into nothing and again it's hard to determine what they say oh you know that clearly not normal dogs I mean all the spirit of\nDogs was slave I guess the only downside with that is a much bigger than regular dogs you know if I were the\nSpirit that dogs would resemble the dogs\nThey look like in real life I'm sure\nAnd then the cats are even harder to explain to the u._k. I mean there's no big cat that lived there and well now you\nWrite in fact they become known as I said I Am big cats and I guess every year we get dozens and dozens of reports papal saying large black cats robbing the cat\nThe occasional so the guy\nThat's got a you know from his menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases you know there are cases where wild animals actually sky from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the problem is\nThere are these large black cats robbing around the a K which simply\nBy explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom of English at the top of Scotland each other every\nDay for that many reports to exist you know there must be in charge colonies are these creatures roaming around that is if a flesh and blood regular animals which not every race or the phenomenon thinks that's the case you\nKnow what we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations on a moment talking with Nick red burn about is the monster book creatures beach and beans of nature of this could\nBe the rock and roll theme song for Halloween AC DC hell's bells we'll be right back\nDo for you to watch our TV show beyond belief with George Nouri simply go to beyond belief dot com\nYeah Mm\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better term to use over the woods are at high speed um you know kind of a like a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of ...\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know I kind of ... it in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of the name and spoke to the local police or the I don't really know what the police could have done about it it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have this spate of weird activity in this area which he's already notorious for sightings of things interesting enough like a dog man and a the find some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou have a story in the book about the terror you call it the terrible old man thing Nineteen Seventy seven it's surfaces an ... of all places in Sunnyvale, California\n[noise] oh yeah that that's really crazy story and I guess appropriate for um Halloween I miss a story a given to me by lightning I'm Teri and she had this thing can check in Nineteen Seventy seven with well I can only call like a man in black\nAnd not many black has that been portrayed by Will Smith and tell me late Jones in the movies\nBut the rail many black much weight of as sort of very pale skin a and don't look entirely human I sort of almost ... ... and found pile like\nAnd there are a lot of paranormal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know whereas in the movies ... sacred agents you know of a sacred agency but Terry told me the story of has Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time\nShe was having lunch with a friend and they create the manning black\nTime towards them sat down and proceeded to tell Terry I'm\nBasically the the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy and she said that just looking at him was like looking at somebody was dead and almost like the money was happy with that sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of ... old black suits and just gave off base really I'm sort of intimidating creepy five and it didn't really come across as being completely human\nAnd didn't something I mean the thing is that this guy said was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nYes that's right she got a lot of tragedy in a life and they kind of full half did that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never re forgot it all off it\nAnd didn't something I mean the thing is that this guy said it was going to happen to her I think they they have endured\nOr yes that's right so she got a lot of tragedy in a life and he kind of forecasted that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never really forgot it's all ... states and I think\nYou know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life and you know believing that's\nWhat this mindset or things said I'm going to come true you know I mean you could understand how it would create a great deal of stress for someone\nYou know the man stories at least the movie version of more men is that this creature years\nDifferent forms the different people different times but it's a harbinger of doomed to come they predate the bad things that are about to happen is that sort of how you think you you know plays out in the men's I wasn't and beyond\nWell yeah I mean there's no doubt it's um you know when you look at the ... story that it sort of saturated in witness and tragedy for people don't know it kicked off the lights sixty six important players in West Virginia\nI when people started saying this creature that some people described as like a flying humanoid a few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act to others described as a giant bud\nAnd um but whatever that I was saying people would play that I Would say something way bigger than any normal but bad or anything like that\nAnd when the scientists that hides in sixty seven you had a lot of weird a UFO activity um the surfacing of this weird\nCreepy character named injury cold it was like approach how many black and also a lot of other amyloid they unconscious and also reports of women and black\nTurning up and threatening a UFO witnesses on at the height of it of course you know you have the specter of the month mind flying around town\nNow in December sixty seven um they the towns um as it's called or as it was called the silver bridge collapsed into the Ohio River a point pleasant someone side of the Ohio River in Ohio is on the other side obviously\nAnd um the bridge collapsed into the river killing dozens of papal and various race such as um addressed the the connection or the potential connection between the presence of the law firm on\nOn the collapse of the bridge and the deaths and you have it was really sort of two overriding ferries one but my mom\nEven caused the disaster in the gaps all that it was sort of a a warning and to tell you that in a in a challenge strange way try to warn people of looming um disasters in and bought look\nAnd that's still very much debate you bought divided upon you know to this day but some is also an English equivalent of a known as the our mind which also has a sort of penetrating red eyes and large wings and a a humanoid full on\n'em to a friend of mine John Diamond says looked into this case deeply John eventually had to walk away from the research because he found that every time he started to get back into the race a chicken investigating the al ... stories\nAbout things would happen to him like car accidents and I'm ill health\nAnd it happens so many times close to just after he started doing the research that he realized\nFrom his perspective but it really was as if you know a cloud of a dark cloud would come over and every time he got into if any quite literally ... eventually said I'm done you know I'm I'm staying away from it because he felt somehow it was getting these clothes maintain\nA resurgence of interest in more men in recent times in the Chicago area a lot of reports people who've seen the same thing and I I don't have a strong feeling of it either way whether it is wishful thinking the part of people who follow this sort of stuff and we should what happened or\nWhether this credibility to those sightings what's your take on it\nWell you know you do get strange creatures waves in the field of crypto zoology\nYou know a lot they as you mentioned the the ... just said in Chicago last summer um and we get kind of spite so or waves of activity in relation to other\nCreatures I mean for example in the Nineteen seventies in much of Pennsylvania um there were certain spots and outbreaks of big activity um some of these like bumps the stories you know that they won't be any side things for years and then suddenly there's you know a two week period\nWe get a lot of things like that\nAnd um that kind of I'm I'm really feel like he's sort of paralleled throughout various other types of of creatures so again I'm inclined to think that may be\nYou know something that suggests again a connection\nBetween these creatures even though they perceived as being very difference of course but uh but that that wave of activity in um Chicago last year it was very interested now from my perspective although I didn't really investigate the ... because um there are a lot of people\nUm who are already looking into each one of them a friend of mine Alison John Lennon shaving two and a lot of good research into it but what I did I wrote a couple of articles about aids\nAnd in relation to have a number of witnesses to the mosque in Chicago at suddenly afterwards had lots almost as ice or prevented dreams of nightmares of nuclear destruction and um [noise]\nAtomic mushroom clouds and you know the end of civilization\nAnd I actually had somebody in the ... region of close to the tea papal respond to that article um who many of them living in the Chicago area who felt that um you know something might happen\nOr others I had these\nI continue um dreams and nightmares of atomic war in the United states and um\nAnd I felt somehow that he was connected with sightings of this my last month type creatures so in that sense you know that was that was kind of a disturbing situation you know to get old days\nNuclear

careful you don't want to commit these things 'cause you know it's hard it's hard to prove it one way or another right\nWell yeah it is hard to prove anything but I mean you know I've ...

the book that's coming out first of November 'em up secret alien abduction while you were something that I had read before the ...\nOr ... ... the the this is an abduction case in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female and uh I'd never heard this new explanation but it takes the government surveillance all different level still that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean they the conventional aspect if you can even call it a conventional um aspect of the story goes back to the fifties and he's a famous case uh from Brazil where these young man named Antonio village Bowers\nClaim to fame taken on board a UFO and as you said he had sex with these beautiful looking\nUm alien woman and I'm I'm for all kinds of ... he was taken on board against these will so he was\nAbducted you know it was an alien abduction case\nI'm within you follow gee you know it's either perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of Sonia ... all you know it was a really\nWeird aspect of the phenomena and now there's this little\nI'm known aspects of to the story or which place is an entirely different slant on it until now if you read carefully Antonio\nTheir spouses or report that he put together for um a Brazilian a UFO research or an adult to nine to ... um he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board\nUm came down and he started to feel weird as if he'd been drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard this craft which he described as being sort of long rectangular\nAnd um it had like something on TALK like a dish that was spinning around very fast and he was making a Beijing noise and that kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the the shy they the spinning disk on top of the ... and the ... noise\nSays like the classics out and you get with a helicopter now\nMine came forward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he's story didn't get very much a publicity is nine was Bosco metal ... and he had ties to say I in various other agencies\nAnd um he told a race against ... such a rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um\nThe the abduction was a fabrication and the\nDoor but he really did evolve alley cop to but they talk and said I'm ... I was working in the failed lights at night and they really some sort of aerosol illusion of Jenike aerosol er which incapacitated in\nTokyo on board the helicopter and the they a woman was rarely that and the power was played out um but he is in a sort of an old to state wasn't\nSure what was going on and that was that sort of an ceremony asleep dumped back on the ground\nAnd they the the ... all the story was that the\nAgencies within governments\nThat might well a vein rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine how bad I'm On the fifties while the CIA eyes and ... and things like they the plan was to try and determine to what extent\nThe human mind to build it and you know in other words if we can convince people that I can say I aliens we can convince them and anything that was ... when he came down to so metal ... claim that um\n[noise] but they they the abduction if you like was played out and they kind of just then sat back and wait to to say\nHow much of the story was taken and I went I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was a parenting books it was a case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples of these are pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal targets think that it's something beyond just some alien residents there's military or government involvement yeah I mean they see\nWhere it gets confusing if the you know if they're on January and alien abductions and then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine how the human mind can be altered and they use the UFO angle is the ... to try and you know um to see how it works on people doesn't work\nSo you know it gets really confusing when that could be rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around listening to the phones but not investigating the abductions themselves to nominate soap or are they doing both and\nNot feeling well\nUsing when the Kobe rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around listening to the phones but not investigating the abductions themselves the phenomena itself or are they doing both than just not telling us\nWell I think there's good evidence that it's actually both because it's so many abduct page that I spoke with said that they are a number of occasions I'd actually paying ... by military personnel and it wasn't like a a traumatic threatening at my face situation\nIt was more but these military personnel were actually approached should be up to page quietly\nRequesting that I didn't talk about their experiences and some of them didn't have some of them have basically they just have the military were asking questions\nUm along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why they should be done so in other words they were trying to get to the heart of what the abductions where why that were being done\nBut in other cases there is good evidence also of um\n... they have to pay a good example and somebody um it was tied to coast to coast Greg bishops I'm Greg tell me how um he had to pay the correspondents\nIn the Nineteen nineties uh with up to college or who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an object hey herself and Greg told me how you know back in the early\nNineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all of the lectures I wrote to each other back and\nForth were open and sailed back down with type and um now these can clearly beat John you know age without making it look like ... I was taught open race failed it was almost as if\nIt was doing base wants to Greg and college and I know that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of like an intimidation hey you know we're watching it\nAnd that went on you know for for quite a period\nA Greg is working tonight at our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it I mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who you know are are not as credible as Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm\nAnd I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction then I think sometimes paypal can become sort of paranoid of every little thing in their life you know\nAnd which is a dangerous road to go down um but in saying that I mean another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many papers so Shiite than with capital ...\nI'll tell you what network let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side of save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions but we got some other ground to cover before then or we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons five Nineteen Seventy one\nJoined a ... page with thousands of members pitch Greek for show updates and to the fans ... dot com slash ... him and click the lake but [noise]\n[noise]\nWell I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and I'm clearly a real one um they do seem to be tied to both capital mutilation and um the abduction phenomena and\nOne of the things such as being no taste and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these\nRivers flying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organized fashion that up right outside of government you know my actually my sort of do research for the government\nBut it's not you know what the CIA or anybody like that fly valley cup does I don't think I think it is sort of um you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work and\nIn most piping government don't know anything about it at all because you might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government\nItself you know it my pain even\nSort of fall go to private corporations which again would make it more\nDifficult to get material for the fame Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by a frame information request so in that sense I think you know the the phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ...\n... to private corporations which again would make it more\nDifficult to get material for the fate of Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by a five afraid of information request so in that sense I think\nYou know the the phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ... or abductions the Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out\nWhat's going on you know there there's so many cases of black helicopters and an ... helicopters turning up near the homes sometime precariously there the homes of alien abduction ... and and again kind of light with college or in Greg\nThey might be a degree of um intimidation but also it may be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abductees 'em\nAnd be able to to respond\nTo that high speed if in in the ah [noise] event that they that the people flying ... were actually able to catch an abduction going ahead you know in the ... so that very time\nSomebody who's the tuning in tonight for the first time I think we're all crazy alien abductions Kevin relations black helicopters and we're saying yeah this happens\nBut the files that you've obtained from US government from the u._k. government should wait on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is\nThat there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on in their agencies different agencies in government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about\nWho's responsible and why this stuff happens\nWell yeah I mean that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows a you know many many cases agencies\nHave the information to themselves unless it needs to be shed and if we'd daily with us had a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to\nA private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more difficult but I mean in terms of the files on the um on the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages\nI'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol mutilation Z I'm a wave of encounters that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the ... the north and I'm bored of the United states in in the ... to Seventy five\nAnd and just various other cases including some from the ... when there was a wave of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas so I think we're seeing a pot and and I think the violence and intimidation a sort of the\nThe mine coal and cause the you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences are literally physically real or not it it's tough to to even though there are some really well documented stuff to figure it out and it's supposed to figure out what\nSomeone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up ... in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there is still coming out about those or it'll be the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the jury because no one's going to come out in December and then there was a book that's going to be published I think after the first year\nAnd a lot of interest in the case but you wrangled was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee alien scenario\nWell yeah I mean you know was our store is always intrigued me I Know a lot of people dismiss you out rides but one of the things I've always found about ... is unlike a lot of pain flu hoax things\nThat you follow gee you know when this story runs out of feel um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on um you know they\nAre and I think that the big difference we'd lives are is he never\nEmbroidered on the ... the original story be told as it was never expanded on it he tells the same ... years ago he hardly tried to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and however many you know dollars and so forth it doesn't\nYou know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story it doesn't come across like your average ... so that's one of the things it's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nAre between the abductions and people who claimed that in some way or another they\nThe the graze the either in Gray's\nWho go to the abductions that somehow they have this day and sort of sinister and disturbing entrenched in the human soul 'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that um he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read out and ask for this\nWeek's portion of very fifty while he was working at allegedly\nAnd um he said that was the the aliens or whatever they are viewed us as containers and um and he speculates on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the graves had some sort of obsessive interesting in the human cell\nAnd one of the things I talk about in the book is I'm a number of abduct pays who were approached climbed dastardly by these military agencies are private corporations I'm\nStill ask questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you're out of fuel cell leaving your body\nUm did you have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of do child wave this story that was always telling as well\nYou know you you look at recent developments in regard to UFO topic in general\nAnd and of course we've been told in Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force and they stopped project book they're not studying it it's no threat to national security we don't hear we're not looking at it and now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but\nThat was the cover story and and now we've learned last ten months that wasn't true but there were on going studies that were more than one in fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably is ridiculous\nUm in light of the kind of ... that you bring up in this book where there's surveillance and there's the owner intelligence and there's um you know this information and things that sort\nOf do you have concerns about the recent revelation I I I Would think that people who are suspicious sooner weary of this you know they were some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a confusing angle George you know this this angle of um rail abductions fabricated abductions the surveillance\nThe government itself trying to get its had around what's going on you know you put all this together and um you know it it really is sort of a difficult area which to ...\nIt was in angle George you know this this angle of um rail abductions fabricated abductions the surveillance\nThe government itself trying to get its had to ride on what's going on you know you put all this together and um you know it it really is sort of a a difficult\nArea which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know went on the way I've written a book is to demonstrate what we know the says you know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency may be doing this why might they be fabricating\nAn abduction event but then at the same time also investigating a legitimate events\nYou know it's it's it's not ... nowhere um\nYou know being a just black and white you know it it's the the lines of really blood in trying to figure out what the overall goal is but there but there is no doubt at all that you know that there is sort of extensive um surveillance of abductees\nYeah it is right now the X. files everything is great in black and white ... we'll see one or two goals east of the Rockies uh John and Virginia John you're on the river\nThat your genetic

dimensions\nA fourth spatial dimensions that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look better on the equations cleaner they seem simpler and more elegant\nUm um and so on so and in fact just to skip forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members of the audience and part of string theory but\nSure you know I'm using so yes there's string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theories that incorporate these other dimensions 'em and they do it again in order to\nMake make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern govern the universe their string theorists in um theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics\nAnd the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seem to govern reality um and we know that both sets the equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit together\nWe have we we have we have a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and um that Governor governor subatomic world with the er the atomic world world of quantum and we know those equations work we know the correct\nOn the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum of the\nOf the very large so planets and sons and galaxies in San ... and these are Einstein's theory of general relativity we we know both of those sets of equations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorists and others are\nAssuming that there are additional spatial dimensions\nAnd they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other equations that we have it's\nBetween sort of the ... version and the one version you have things like spooky action at a distance or which a scientist and struggled to explain in theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean you know a mathematicians who who work on on these subjects I'm also have to wrestle with other mystery is right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know they're they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem of having two sets of equations that don't fit together\nThey're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange and uncanny on implications of of quantum physics\nThat um that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and and ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I tried to talk about that in the book as well write the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is\nAbout scientists who work on these ideas but then I'm a scientist who doesn't have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who\nWho have religious experiences and start to talk about them as higher dimensional or somehow related to some some concepts and says I\nDon't know maybe we could use flat land as an illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book about flat land that I guess it was a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nYeah absolutely yeah the ... the great little book I'm Still flatland it's kind of a classic science fiction or nonfiction book written a long time ago a written an Eighteen eighty four\nThirty has quite a cultural life and in fact I remember reading flatland in high school calculus so ... you know math students all over the world still read flatland as a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live in ah the kinds of spaces and kind of dimensions we live in so\nYeah it's a great little book written by an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott\nHe was British he was he was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century I'm coming to coming to age in a in an era of science and wrestling with what it meant to be religious and scientific at the same time um you know it was a time you know this Eighteen fifty nine was Darwin's origin of species and there were a number of\nUm there were a number of\nChallenges I guess you'd say to Christianity and Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing this wonderful book flat land which is a book about a lower dimensional two dimensional world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of world could exist um imbedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe but I Am it's flat world was it was a two dimensional world\nAnd if over ... which is a book about a lower dimensional to national world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of world could exist um embedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe but\nI Am it's flat world with a with a two dimensional world but the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat\nAnd it's populated by\nTwo dimensional objects object will just lengthen with some of them were flats where some of them were by circles are flat triangles and and even even lines they would all slide around on the surface of this world\nAnd of course they believe that uh they live in a two dimensional world until the climax until the climax of the of the novel when\nA three dimensional object of fear inserts itself goes down in in ... in search itself into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks\nOut on his his ... sees the appearance of this mysterious object to first talking to him and the sphere says I'm you know I'm I'm a three dimensional object and I come from another another world and the square says this can't be possible\nAnd the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're ... a two dimensional world is better than a larger world so the sphere regards to a more um extreme measure and he he reaches over and pulls a square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and\nOf course the than the square looks around and which down on his flat world that can for the first time see the whole world spread out in front of them so that's where it becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of a higher dimension but there's a there's a third dimension and he goes back to flat world of course and it's pretty enthusiastic about this I Can't can't stay quiet about it and unfortunately in in ... it's forbidden\nIt's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of hired mentioned so he's put in jail where he where he stays for a number of your ears and and the story ends with this for a flat square languishing in prison I'm\nHoping that by his readers ... from the readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be more than meets the eye because of their reality so he sort of\nLike the idea that the high priest a flat land wouldn't allow anybody to talk about the other dimension I'm In a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interesting comment on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lives right the sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild Fox\nBut at the square character did have these wild often and even at the stationary experience right where he saw that there was that there was another space or direction to reality and and I'm so happy ever wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to\nYou know think about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um that we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking that our world is the only world\nBut you know may maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about and what do you imagine um but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we will jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration or some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and uh they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment or we're talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions of the doors break on through take us into the brick\n\nDefined were George ... speaking ... stadium dot com website and scroll down to the bottom and you're just doing what are\nYou trying\nTo the\n[noise]\nWhich is you know\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality I Am an intimate an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he\nHe makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make [laughter] All right and the situation as he he embraces map Madison geometry as a kind of a and he kinda hangs onto that as the only sure thing that is way in which the math provide certainty 'em to him but I think his his\nUh stories a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nAs I say in the book he develops the whole way of\nThinking about higher spatial dimensions and he is very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nAnd then he starts to think you know well what if these what these mathematical variables in my ... and you know these higher these higher dimensions but I'm using what if they actually have a real existence\nSomehow um you know what if the math points to the real existence of these kinds of spaces and he\nHe thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he develops of way of\nWhat he thought of as sort of re educating the senses in order to catch glimpses into this into the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the senses I involves um you know it involves a set of twenty seven cubes that are labeled\nA all twenty seven are labeled and they're stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube you know that's three by three by three\nUm and he and then he he memorize the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll uh and then he'll rotate a Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions\nIt's essentially sort of an imaginative um exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive\nBeyond the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues sort of shook their heads I think ah [laughter] you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um\nAnd doing your research but instead he he was doing things like\nPutting this this ah this cue these cubes sets together and helping coach the Princeton baseball team and he actually he actually also invented a pitching guy not just one of the first um I'm an automated pitching devices on ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure Princeton [laughter] he uh\nHe didn't do what he what he should have been doing but he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that\nYou know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these [noise] you know our ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are\nSeeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nWell as you document and trace I mean the this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you got a free the mistakes and but I Would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto it do they all use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\nUm as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife or heaven and so on and so I'd hindrance ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course it's flat land both on both of their um [noise]\nYou know their writings really become important so modern artists take up these ideas or spiritual writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people are in the U.S and then in Europe take up these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the book chapter seven\nChapter eight is is cs Lewis right which I'm ... who I'm sure many of your listeners\nHave heard of cs Lewis Narnia the ... the fame\nFamous British a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer he uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he incorporates ideas about higher dimensions\nTo rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he he incorporates them in a number of sermons ... and and his writings and then of course many people are familiar with the scent fantasy writings and the the same ideas around there as well he's got\nHe's got references higher dimensions and um and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually to\nYou know he he was he was raised in the church but then he becomes an atheist\nOr like many many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war and becomes disillusioned there's a number of people in there you know precisely in there and James Bennett and\nI'm a number of people go off to World War one or World War two in the book and they have that they get into combat situations OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nThings you have an ear and out of body experience right\nYeah right exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and cause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and for some of them those war experiences and disillusioned them and turn them off from religion\nBut others are like like James Bennett\nA he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talked about in chapter six um which is a chapter really about dreams that seemed to predict the future I'm\nKind of a kind of a cool chapter I really like a chapter on so he has this out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimension how that might help explain what happened to him\nWell let's talk about dreams a little bit I explain it to me how how this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else reality another reality\nYeah yeah yeah the drinks are fascinating and um\nYour dreams or seemed to be important and just about every culture around the world um you know and in many cultures people have dream interpreters you know a special people who\nAre you tell your dream to and then they tell you what it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of ah [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation books and we have people like the swift psychotherapist Carl young who many people know about who\nIs is really important for people as they think about interpreting their dreams and so you have a people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of\nOf dreams and in my book\nUh especially in that chapter six\nPeople are also wondering about the\nThe spiritual meaning of dreams [noise] um [noise] in that book\nUh there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British aeronautical engineer also a soldier and and goes into combat and the second bowler war in South Africa right around the turn of the twentieth century he's he's in combat in Nineteen oh too and he starts\nThe the spiritual meaning of dreams [noise] um [noise] in that book uh there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British aeronautical engineer off the soldier and and goes into combat and the second bowler war in South Africa right around the turn of the twenty century he's he's in combat in Nineteen oh too\nAnd he starts to have dreams that\nI'm not surprised him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams\nAre then seem to happen in real life so he has he has predict of dreams or ... what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams he has dreams that seem to predict the future and these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin\nYou know as he's camped out uh with his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wondered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress I'm In a battle and these kinds of things but he would have dreams\nAnd then he would wake up generally what happened was that he would have dreams and then who wake up and the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event in the newspaper so one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his book he has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill\nTowards the ocean and he's obviously on an island recognizes the island as as a someplace he's already been into streams\nYou notice is that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the decisions are venting gas um that the ground is rumbling people seem to be going about their business they're speaking French\nBut he's panic and he's\nHe's he's trying to alert people he's he knows that something is going to go wrong he knows it's going to be volcanic eruption so he's running around trying to get people's attention he doesn't speak French they don't seem to speak English he ends up talking to one official after another official after another no one really believed him and he ends up waking up and kind of a sweat in a panic\nAnd then a couple of days later he opens up the newspaper and he reads about this a catastrophic volcanic eruption and the island of Martinique the French speaking island that Martin ... um and several of the details from his dream or correct um\nAnd some of them aren't some of them aren't as well and he tries to think I mean how could this be how could how could in in my dream how could I have seen an event that hasn't happened\nAnd he he keeps it to themselves for a while but eventually discharged and has back to the u._k. where he he actually is a early inventor of airplanes um and his his you can Google M. J. W done and you can go go in and check out his airplane design says his airplanes were used by the British and they were used by the Canadian military and others had it\nAs as those countries had towards World War one but he he tries to reflect on this he is puzzled by these dream he's worried about them he started writing them down and then he he\n\n\n\n[noise] it was this hour from Donald

the vision that you didn't have before right you can see through walls right you can see in places that you're not um\nSo yeah people people in Moody's book um and and many others you know there's a lot of literature now about near death experiences they people do um sometimes use the language of higher dimensions to talk about what they experienced\nI'm not to say on says in the same category but you do a address say on this into people's attempts to reach a\nHigher uh our or another world um [noise] you know what's\nGoing on with those folks are they is there any legitimacy to that or or do you not want to judgment on it\n\nYeah I don't know um you know it's funny it's funny writing a book like this because you know I've never had any of these experiences [laughter] you know I've never had a dream that seemed to predict the future um you know I've never had an out of body experience right or or some of the um some of the experiences I've talked about so\nYou know I Know deja vu a deja vu for sure yeah yeah I'm so in the book I tried to talk about a lot of experiences that other people are happy and um\nYou know and I try to put him play their voices and and how they understand what's happening um but I don't I don't know about finances you know I I wouldn't rule it out as being as being possible you know I mean I think that I mean if one thing if this book taught me one thing it would be that\nI think that the the world is is a much more complex and ah\nAnd amazing really than than we now uh you know I think there's much more to the universe than meets the guy um you know I I Do believe that a man and I think we know that from science I mean when you when you look at these are these businesses a cosmologist and read their\nRead their narratives about the universe read they're popular science publications I mean there's just there's more to the universe than meets the eye and so I really wouldn't rule out um spirits are ghosts are all those kinds of things you know I I I wouldn't be\nThese that I'm In and I think we know that from science I mean when you when you look at these are these businesses a cosmologist and read their read their narratives about the universe read they're popular science publications I mean there's just there's more to the universe than meets the eye and so I really wouldn't rule out um spirits are ghosts are all those kinds of things you know I\nI I wouldn't be so arrogant as to as to you know sit here and say oh you know you definitely there is no way that anyone can have an experience like that um\nSo I guess I Would just remain open to the open to those possibilities\nAnd you know I think when people would want to know is a is there a higher dimension that happened that would happen and if so do we go there and do we live live on beyond this\nYeah yeah right that's another you know big question that I Try to raise in the book you know the book it has all of these big questions um\nYou know and I don't answer that question in the book I think that's another question like your question about spirits and goes and found says I'm I'm certainly open to the to the possibilities there and and personally I I I Do believe that there is a nother world that we go to after this world I mean personally I Am I'm a believer you know I'm\nI Do believe in God and I do believe in spirit so I think I'm I think I Would line up more on that side of things with a kind of an openness to these different possibilities and like I say in the book I Try to put different voices in there who have different opinions and the reader kind of decide what they're saying you know I'm\nTrying to think of all there's a bunch of books on the phone to talk to you will go east of the Rockies Moses in Tallahassee

and and spiritual energies in the in the body and so on and and people do use higher dimensional language you talked about those as well\nA wildcard Charles in Texas the morning Charles good\nGood morning a and it is definitely the more you're kind of get laid off but anyway my yeah\nMy question well how I tried to narrow it down as much as a kid or you know for I guess for diamond say a ... but it just really this is a sort of an issue where you can you can't really narrow things down this way and and\nReally we're going to narrow it down 'cause in two minutes we're going to go to a break so\nWell anyway they ... I I guess I could ask this question I don't know if you've ever read that Jay deep Priestley unethical Christopher here and if you've ever read the pre sleaze or sort of a big essay\nOn um it's called man in time it was published along with uh with one of ... books as the head of the wonderful book you had the great bus\nYeah yeah oh oh oh good so you have read it well very good well I think you can say about it I'm the one of the biggest issues I been happening is is with the I guess was physicist ... particularly you seem to still be attached it gets in the anthropology of says they didn't ever really\nExamine they're that they're sort of preconceived their prejudices that come from their priest says it's his life I suppose\nUh uh toward a about time about the issue of of time and and you know sort of what it is how it arises how would it can be even a fundamental dimension of our ah reality and then I also the whole perception\nOr not just this time but uh I mean\nI I when I look at things in a quantum level we we see that everything is everything is is a sort of wave and I mean of course people don't even have waves are frequencies are but the time becomes very essential to just the existence of matter\n[laughter] you know an art project or a perception of it anyway so I mean they're just at any way they have any comments or thoughts about yeah\nThank you Charles appreciate the call\nYeah that's that's a great question and that's a that's a wonderful book come JV Priestley I talked about in chapter six quite a bit he's a fascinating character I'm a very famous British writer playwright and twentieth century and BBC broadcaster\nHe gets really I'm interested in higher dimensions um he reads a hint and who we talked about he reads Jay W done who have talked about 'em and he'd comes up and did all his own theories\nInterestingly Priestley like some of the other figures in the book has a combat experience he also sites in World War one and a young person and as um as an injured [noise]\nUm and he also has some\nHe also has some unique experiences of\nFeeling like he's out of time or feeling like he's out of the body and then he writes this great book that the caller mentioned are called man and time um and in the book he has\nAll kinds of testimonials from people who have written to him about their pre cognitive dream Caesar dreams that seem to predict future events um he actually gets on the BBC\nIn Nineteen sixty two sixty three can't remember and he he asked the the viewing audience to writing letters if they've ever had\nAn unusual time experience as they've ever slipped out of time if they've ever had a dream that protects the future and uh he got over Fifteen hundred letters um from from the from the viewing audience but like many of the letters are still\nExtent they're still at the\nUniversity of Bradford I've been there to read through all the letters and I I incorporate\nA number of them in my book especially will be a priest or white will take a break we're talking about other worlds with crisp white and a Tom Petty\nYou're in a he got over Fifteen hundred letter I'm from I'm from the audience what many let us know down at the University of Bradford I've been to redraw the letters and I I Am corporate\nA number of them in my book will be a Christopher white will take a break we're talking about other worlds with

reflective surfaces so you know there's\nThere's even iPhones crying you know I don't know if you've heard that word is crying before but that is sort of meditating on a reflective surface it could be a computer screen or television screen or reflective water or a crystal ball or\nA number of different services but I Know that that is a spiritual and and visionary practice that a number of people use in order to you know what what we say reach a higher consciousness or um\nYeah so that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nWell Marsha I just wrote down I'm going to give that a try next year this suggested that\nDollar [laughter] for like from the idea right east of the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I'm Michael\n... what happened to me is I uh I started writing the ... of a dream journal [noise] and I I wrote a dream that my mother's husband who was that was going to give them a used car [noise] and all my money [noise] so [noise]\nI didn't believe it was going to happen but it did happen and I'm now driving his car and I got the money to show it was very strange to me that I Dreamed I wrote it down with ... with the date on it and everything and it came true like months later\n[noise] yeah yeah that's right yeah there's a\nThere's a whole technique that GW done talks about in his book experiment with time that I talk about in my book about dream journal and how to do it and it sounds like you did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream you get up you write it down right away and and um keep a whole journal and and think about your dreams and\nHe believed that you know like you you believe everyone would start having these experiences where they would see these\nGlimpses um glimpses into the future and their dream so that's that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael for sharing a wildcard line Joe in Monterey, California good morning Joe\nGood to good evening George I'm I was about to ask your guest if he ever meditative but I thought that it might be better if I introduce\nAnother concept to him as a what they call super conscious mind\nI'm not I'm a remote viewing remote few and it has it's drawbacks this is um this is a mental world this is a mental travel or sold travel but it's also in a higher state of Seoul travel the call super conscious mind and you can access these high of world\nUm I Do this with my clients and uh they go into these different worlds for different reasons whether it's hailing whether it's neat a loved one of the other reasons um it's an extremely um complex\nA multi verse and there's so many different things how they're doing so much so many different things\nI was wondering if he ever a considered also a kind of um higher shelf of remote of writing is a is not like you're writing automatic because that automatic writing it's really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation\nAnd all it does all you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a trans state and just start writing but listening to your thoughts not thinking but listening to what comes to you and after a short time it will start to come out and you'll be channeling your higher shelf\nYeah yeah I liked that comment because it reminds me of um you know sometimes the way people talk about higher dimensions of it as a\nAs a dimension of consciousness right um and and you definitely have the\nTwentieth century psychologist and Carl young and many others um you know when we talk about there in three spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or dimension where would that be\nSome people say well it's going in you know it's not going out or it's going to end that consciousness sort of um occupies the the throat a new direction um and yeah through meditative practices\nI think it is possible to to access those those dimensions if you'd asked if I meditate I Do meditate you know I Do sort of mindfulness meditation and I guess\nIt's going in and you know it's not going out somewhere it's going to end that consciousness sort of um occupies this the sort of a new direction um and yeah through meditative practices\nI think it is possible to to access those those dimensions um you'd asked if I meditate I Do meditate you know I Do sort of mindfulness meditation and I definitely get into a\nRight into his own or do you feel sort of peaceful and quiet and calm I haven't had any visionary experiences while meditating it's it's much more a much more mundane unfortunately but um but I Do I Do meditate um and and do some of those practices and in my book I talk about others who have these kind of visionary\nMeditative practices um sounds like what you do\nThanks geopolitical you know you read about a musicians and writers who suddenly get inspiration from just out of the blue McCarthy has written about you know writing yesterday woke up with it in his hand yeah or or or other songwriters entire songs already written it came from somewhere else\nYeah and you talked and talked to scientists about scientific creativity and scientific convention and many scientists will have the same kind of stories some of them will talk about dreams some of them will talk about other forms of inspiration some of them will say that these ideas came from somewhere else and I don't know where they came from some of them will talk about different there's ... there's different layers of consciousness um\nSo I think there's a lot of mystery isn't there\nA Gordon in Lakeland, Florida good morning Gordon wildcard mind your own with

I don't know if you know what at least drivers your stuff I'm I'm young I'm communion or he actually has a new book I'm\nI'm On the subject as well but he he talks sort of like you do I mean he he also wonders um what's the relationship is between alien abduction and extraterrestrials\nOn the one hand versus um spirits and goes on the other so he I think Whitley it's come to come to believe that there's there's a connection on and it sounds like you've come to believe that as well that there's a\nThat the connection somehow you know maybe departed spirits um our aliens or aliens are depart spirits\nAnd do we think we explore the idea of a unified theory of weirdness on the program a crush on him looking for his actions and you'd be amazed how many scientists or\nA behind the scenes are interested in those kind of subject as well whether there's a connection yeah you look at the idea of the universe the many worlds theory and you talk about it in your book of course that wasn't that long ago that that would have been too far out for just about any of them to accept the now it's it's not all that a controversial anymore\nIsn't that crazy yeah it's really crazy I mean yeah and there's a number of ways of thinking about a a world or a universe with many worlds right I mean you mentioned the many worlds theory quantum mechanics and there's of course also the the multiverse idea right the multiverse ideas that there's\nYou know I'm a large number or an infinite number of other universes in addition to our visible universe and you know I um I Believe now that that's a\nThat's a very mainstream I'm I prefer the conventional wisdom now among cosmologist and theoretical physicist that that there is a multi versus you know which is um and that's another fantastic scientific concept that there is not proof for\nThere's really not proof for that idea but it it is it has become a kind of an appealing idea to scientists\nAnd then you mentioned the sort of many infant parallel universes of many worlds theory or the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics or another idea that we live in a complex and constantly branching", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Vernal", "day": "29"}
