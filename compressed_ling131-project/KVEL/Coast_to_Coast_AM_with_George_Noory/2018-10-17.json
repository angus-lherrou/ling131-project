Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating in a Dictaphone while he was floating in this pool\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word um I don't know if he did most of them in the pool in the\nPool but he's certainly dictated mostly description and honestly I don't know how he did it I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nWell let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nOnly show was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um [noise] you know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know\nThe body can write that way but certainly with a rare breed or he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nWell let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nAlways sure was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation\nSo he was um [noise] you know he was had the patriotic fervor of you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could and he had this um this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was\nAssigned to the five hundred eleventh parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne and he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's got 'em for life and and it affected pretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality to them and did he get that from his combat\nOh he's from as young as he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several times a day before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the twilight zone so [noise] um it was always there was always part of his makeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of twilight zone episodes particularly one called the purple testament which is actually ... lady\nUm during World War two so that was as close as he got to literally revisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and then several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in the golden age of television wasn't he\nYes he uh he certainly was it was a time when television was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up and television needed writers I it was it was it was this fast\nYou know I Would say vast wasteland it was a vast medium that was just devoid of talent at the time and rod you know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific and he wrote so much\nThat he just sent stuff outside stuff out and so finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know his shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk to Scott Carol surely rods wife\nI did not unfortunately no no the what he hit a tree with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah now with with\nRod he started before you got in the twilight zone use a writer for other kinds of shows was any\nOh sure sure there are some people\nMay not know this but rod Serling was\nWithout question the most prestigious writer in television before the twilight zone he had written you know he won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five fifty six and fifty seven a twilight zone started and fifty nine I'm so he was at the top of the of the heap or before the twilight zone came out\nAnd he just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama sensibility into the twilight zone and\nGave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times when he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and I always tried to a critique him editorialize and even controlling\nYeah yeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that certainly ran into is that he believed that it's a writer's job to do those things that the writer job to address\nThe issues of his time and every time he tried to address any issue of any social import on television the censors would get in this way the sponsors would get in this way\nAnd it was frustrating for him and\nThankfully for ... for rod he was successful enough and he had built such a name for himself that they were willing to give him his own show and he had always loved science fiction he loves fantasy science fiction or you know all that kind of thing so he\nCreated the twilight zone because he always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it and say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff by if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it will be a little less a controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show with a cool ending it had a message didn't it\nOh absolutely if it was a TV series that just had a cool twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now you know it's a it was always deeper than that certainly certainly episodes were always deeper than that um because he again believe that that was part of the artist job the art if it's going to be art\nIt has to what he would say that has to say something about something and you know it has to be entertaining he did wants to entertain but at the same time you have to say something about something\nWhat do you think some of the ... that he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career the big the biggest issue was prejudice um rot had this this innate\nAversion to prejudice and he believed it was ... I Believe that all evils\nStemmed from prejudice that that's the beginning in ... that's the root of all of them so he wanted to address that idea\nThat um we have this um this tendency to look to other people to uh for our own faults when we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the twilight zone before and after\nHe in some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about six years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine and yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released um science fiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred\nTelevision series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction as all television series and the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one who made it and at this point\nYou know you ask the average twenty five year old they're not getting any black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone if it's entered the consciousness just as a term you know people know that the twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is off kilter or something is strange something is you know not quite right\nAnd it lasted all this time because of of Ross messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so well produced so well acted a it was just a first class production from from get from point a to point the you know so so that's\nI think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and I it's a Bradbury had heard about it\nAnd I had written an article about it in a what we have what's called the after dark newsletter in a bread Bree just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about my my shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I've got and that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office\nAbout what rod didn't write all the script she oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no not listen nobody could right\n... the way you do on science safely Indians complete control my you know combined secure communications with pride at ground zero virtual credit card

got sick notches on my belt when it comes to the teams on\nWhen you were in those episodes and they were being done was rod Serling around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when they did is you know bumpers and intros and ah [noise]\nYeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because there was no regular cast on the twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know hand the producer buck out and we're\nReally seeing kilo in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled control from network hassling as much as they could\nUh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see Mr Serling when he was on the set talked about what was coming up in the next episode or so usually when an executive producer or creator comes onto it said you know but it gets a little uptight\nYeah you know or when Alan's here or whatever but uh I recall quake\nShows that have a different feel than the color shows that we'll see nowadays you\nKnow it's well I can tell you specifically when it comes to the twilight zone I think that's one of the things that the remake of the twilight zone have been missing is the fact that it's just it was black and white the twilight zone\nBirch woman has received a jail sentence after passing yourself off as one of the victims of

Donner\nA it was yeah yeah cats they pull over the entire movie of course\nHorrible horrible situation in Long Island New York is with us they just go ahead\nI make a couple of questions or one would be the first of all the ... that seems like it was very escapist well then maybe someone stay back in the sexism just speculating if you had a job and it came home and watch the twilight zone\nThat would be almost like an escape from your daily reality and I guess people might have wanted that and I'm Wondering if there are any other shows really like that\nMy second question would be about the mysterious endings which I think a lot of that could be almost a not necessarily ethic book could've unfolded into actual movies additional scenes uh where uh someone\nCould take a twilight zone episode and kinda unfolded into an actual movie you know like a planet of the apes\nYeah I I I agree with you on that and and you get to the first question you know the yeah the escapist aspect that that's why you know what I mean that's I think that is part of all science fiction and fantasy of course is that that\nA scape is tone to it um but you know it's funny that you you mentioned that because that has actually something that rod Serling are often pointed to about ... gallery on in the early seventies during the end of the Vietnam\nEra he felt that night gallery was giving people in the ... from the nightly news and seeing you know the stuff on you know stuff on the news about war and everything else that would they go into the gallery an escape\nOr through that so he never really said that about the twilight zone but I think the similar to a point can be made about the twilight zone as well and it is surprising that that that someone hasn't taken you know a twilight zone episode and expanded it into a feature\nFilm although there's been there's been plenty of films that are certainly twilight zone in ... you know influenced that could very well just as just as well be toilets on movies that are called the twilight zone\nWas it Jack London on one of the twilight zones he started for twilight zone yeah\nHe actually started one with the movie um in praise of tough that's right yeah yeah and he was terrific guy Jack Lemmon probably gave my favorite performances on the twilight zone and and three of the episodes that he was and\nHe was he a trumpet player in one of them\nExactly yes there's one called the passage for trumpet rod wrote that one and I'll tell you a quick story about that episode you know he the director um jak caught me was so good in that episode is just so good that the director actually wrote or called rod and said listen I don't want to take the camera off of this guy I just want to keep filming\n[laughter] you'll have to answer any way we can make\nThis into a two part episode he wants to expand the effort to an allergist because jak cotton was so good and rod said you know this and we just can't you don't have the budget we can't can't do more than half an hour but that's that's saying something when the director says listen I'm just gonna let this guy going I'm going to film whatever does\nClassic classic classic Jason in Portland, Oregon is with us now Jason governance or\nWell where do you smoke wherever that President they say why like those radios theater and they take some of the old episode ... ran for a radio\nAnd they also incorporate ... date things and have a current topics like a just a couple of weeks ago I heard when they had to do with a nano robots\nEating up um oil spill in the problem is that the greed and I just thought that it thank you and I think with the sterling they cool did you know about that next\nI I was not aware of the current uh uh uh current radio series no there actually was the twilight zone a series of radio dramas of the original episodes that was produced some not too long ago but no I wasn't aware of a of a current will know\nDidn't write ever writes for radio in his early days\nOh sure yeah that's that's where he really got his start was in radio his first cells were to a word to a series called Grand Central station that air and\nI think on CBS um\nCBS network and he wrote you know for radio or in college\nAnd so yeah that was that was the beginning before he broke and and actually the funny thing is he actually went back to radio and created a radio series in Nineteen fifty four so basically four years after he had broken into television he actually went back to work in Cincinnati and created this radio series called it happens to you and it was a\nSeries of Thirteen um original\nRadio scripts where did he end up living Los Angeles\nA yes or while he once he lived in most and Pacific palisades for most of his a professional career and then he always went back to uh Africa in upstate New York every summer and then he was teaching it if it gets so we kind of gradually spent more time uh and it's like the later in life\nWhen he got sick was it a prolonged illness or did you go suddenly\nUm [noise] well it was it was pretty sudden he you know he had\n... years old was any or something like that was fifty\nYeah he was fifty and get a couple of heart attacks and he went in for a bypass procedure which was fairly you know cardiac bypassed procedure which was and it was in New York at the\nTime uh and you know it's interesting you know how new it was because if you read some of the news stories at the time about the surgery they'll explains you exactly what the surgery is you know they're going to take a ... you know artery from this here and put it here it's like nowadays you wouldn't have to say any of that you know what a cardiac bypasses but that back then it was so new that that explains the surgery\nAnd he had the surgery and the doctors thought it was successful and um by the time they were selling 'em up he had another attack on the table\nAnd that was pretty much in\nSteve's with us first time caller in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Hi Steve\nHide your uh I get a little trivia but a ride a uh I live in central New York from Seventy period at Seventy five and I worked on a military

that's a it's a funny question because I think most people can tell you for certain what twilight zone episode was the first one is what I cannot tell you for certain what the first one I have a so as I could probably narrow it to a couple um the hitch hiker is one that I I think it was definitely one of the one of the first ones I ever saw\nBut for them ... right\nYeah going my way and these have been chasing a you know chasing a driver not chasing up and it's just showing up on the road constantly are on the on a road trip um that's a that's a creepy one a rod wrote that one and that was definitely one of the first ones but for whatever reason I cannot pinpoint it for sure if that's the first one I ever saw\nYou remember the plane that couldn't land in then you we do you look down and you could see the brontosaurus the dinosaurs that just kept going back into time I guess\nYeah it's called the odyssey of flight thirty three and it's about a plane that breaks the breaks the sound barrier and somehow finds itself back in prehistoric times and uh you know ... you know Raj brother Robert\nRobert certainly also a very successful writer actually wrote the president's plane is missing which was a best seller at the time and it was made into a TV movie um but he was an expert in aviation and he actually uh consult Iraq consulted with him about that particular episode and other episodes they didn't ever ever ever had anything to do with aviation\nHe went to his brother or for advice on those so he actually got a technical consultant credit on on that particular episode\nNext stop we go to Brad Bird in the angels camp California Hi Brad Bird\nEgg neglect I'm I'm pretty sure that this was a rod sterling\nA tail it involved what they call the frog die that was in a capsule um\nIt started with a guy at a bar looking kind of despondent or whatever and\nAnd uh probably crying you know trying to give up drinking and somebody came up\nAnd gave him a a match but said call this number and uh so he was curious he called it they said well come over to I think it was going to a place where they gave him\nThis capsule and they said but the the one the one caviar is\nYou cannot drink to get\nMoney not drink because he's a message\nThat will um it will\nMake you very very uncomfortable and give you a really bad stomach reacting and so ... was was a it was some little organism\nAnd it bad on alcohol it was dormant unless you drank alcohol in which case it would wake up and then if it would just you know crave the alcohol and make you really really sick 'cause it was growing\nThat's that sounds somewhat familiar it's it's definitely not a Serling I can tell you that for sure but it does sound that that part about it ... it feeding on the alcohol and growing that does sound somewhat familiar to me but it's definitely not necessarily\nThat they were so many classic shows no they all these different messages remember the one where the camera took pictures of the future yeah and you name it at the racetrack bored and you get the winning divorce and all that\nYeah yeah most unusual camera it was called and that's\nIt was one of the you know your

or just before that how 'bout that Raj serving as low as those nasty or at\n[laughter] it's unfortunate that really was addicted he tried to quit several times he just he never never could quite do it\nI used to say either ... or ... or ... ... a lot of them are ... you\nKnow you're probably right way too much he would he'd come out on the Senate smoking Whitney\nOh sure sure it's hard to find a picture of rod Serling where he doesn't have a cigarette in his hand it's just there was it was it was attached to him it was given constant\nIn those days it was the thing to do I remember dean

D. V. copies of this big area type and pass them around from city to city to city\nRight ... and this book\n... a has a picture of both Craig's [noise] um [noise] an broke type and the paper copies that they made of this this this these three children that they passed around from city to city to city\nBench surely up and not watched and a woman says those are my three children\nWow those to my husband right before Gettysburg I haven't heard from since\nI'm Sorry he died they go on and tell her the story that's spooky enough but then Craig says Wayne scoping your attic and scrounge around find some antiques this is right after he gave me this book\nGo up my addict I live in Eighteen forty house has a few books of its own right\nGo up and is Sadek and there's this little room where there was furniture assembled but when we bought the house ceilings are only about four foot tall it's a spooky little room it's almost like Anne Frank and her family lived\nAnd there were a bunch of artifacts left over in the house when I was purchased one of the things that was left over in the house was this book ... book of photographs\nOf cricket and I opened it up and there is one of the C. D. V. copies of the same three children we opened it up and immediately there's three kids staring right at us we dropped the book\nIndustry [laughter]\nI mean that's what kinda coincidence is that right now it's almost like that conjured up something pretty doggone spooky\nI guess you got to be careful with what you do\nWell you know I don't think careful I think that the positive things about antics is they bring about good spirits a lot of happiness but there are times when you got to pay a little bit careful I knew the warns pretty well and they are used to say don't play around with a weed cheap boards and stuff\nAnd I ... I Believe that\nYeah yeah I don't mess around with really chilly it takes because you know you don't want to open up stores you can't close right [laughter]\nThat's true that is absolutely would you do when when you do your rummaging and you've been to some of these older places and you find some of these things have you found objects that looked scary to you\nAll the time it's often um the the things that make them look scary is the houses that are in um [noise] I was in a house where this famous psychologist or I died the story was that he killed himself\nAnd I go through there with my buddy another buddy of mine who were doing a kind of a an appraisal of this this for a for some lawyers and and and [noise]\nUm [noise] I was in a house where this famous psychologist or a dyed in the story was that he killed himself and I go through there with my buddy\nAnother buddy of mine who were doing a kind of a an appraisal is this for a for some lawyers and and and we're taking photographs of these pieces and this guy had spray painted things on the walls that were really strange he was a LSD person\nIn the house was filled with all sorts of strange uh furniture from the mission oak period nothing had been cleaned or in years and he had like\nCaptured animals and skin them and made things out of them um that was pretty scary when you're the first one to come across these things over the years and that that tends to make all the objects in the house all the scarier\nSo I'm going through this house taking photographs of all the strange things right my buddy won't go up in the addict I Know what's wrong with you those wind or something rung up\nThere what are you talking about it 'cause I saw something up there I saw goes up there\nI said come on man we're working here right it's not time for this right we've got a lot to do he would not go up in the addict by himself grown man\nWe ended up going up in the addict together finishing our photography up there it went downstairs took some more photographs [noise] All right I developed I I\nHad the photographs developed this was just actually no it was a it these were ah this is just the beginning when photographs were a digital but\nThe photographs in the attic all had these weird circles and I'm like or like balloons every single photograph in that house had these these weird or Santa\nNone of the photographs before we went up and he had a cat that so I figured I'd spilt water on the lens and I looked at the photographs or taken after we left the addict downstairs again\nNo problem just up and that's strange addict [noise] that's what my buddies says bats what I saw\nRestrain do you find that the the older the object more possible that it could be haunted object\nYeah I think that um age has an awful lot to do with that I just because there's more chance for stories to become attached to an object you know sometimes an object dies made and you know a table that was made back in ah\nDo you

get in there about what really connected with me was how passionate Oscar was about ... logical us operations\nI did not have the opportunity to see that collection I'm very familiar with Lincoln collectibles eye on all the books on the subject and Lincoln collectibles are worth a fortune I Would say next to George Washington collectibles they are the most valuable ball\nA for instance one of the things all you people should keep your eyes open for because there's a lot of these around I'm Mary Todd Lincoln had a photograph made where they superimpose Lincoln's hands holding her after he died\nAh she actually used to perform stances in the White House trying to talk to Mr Lincoln then she's taught the White House was haunted by the way she she had Sanchez when he was president\nAnd

instance bought the are that great assembling show by Leonardo da Vinci's letters you know at the helicopter and all\nDownright hate us and\nFor that years ago while um but that that the shroud of

now and I don't find anything [noise] um the fact that it goes back to Eisenhower's period though and it's Ethiopian is a is a really good um uh\nAspect of it and um my guess is if it's painted with a lot of a good subject matter interest it probably worth some decent money\nWhen I'm On a picture of like George Patton or something like that would that be worth\nA lot of money because George Patton was such an interesting fellow George Patton was you know they made a great movie about him and uh you know he he was just he was just a guy stood out I'd love to have is a real handle this all\nWell my gosh that would be more women wouldn't that be something I\nSure would also didn't have like a he had I not not a chain but he walked with something that had like a little leather strap at the end
