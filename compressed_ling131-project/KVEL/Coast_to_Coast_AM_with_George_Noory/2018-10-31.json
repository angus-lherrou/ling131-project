BP's electronic voice phenomena where the whole chapter in a book about\nArafat perfect because it seems to me that since we've gone to the digital age from the analog age they're getting more and more of these recordings\n[noise] yes indeed and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to use\nDigital radio to scan the frequencies more quickly a fellow by the name of Frank function in the nineties figured out that if you hack a digital FM radio you can literally break it in such a way so that is that's scanned\nAnd I think that what you have is you have the ability now to use digital radio to scan the frequencies more quickly a fellow by the name of Frank ... in the nineties figured out that if you hack a digital FM radio you can\nLiterally break it in such a way so that is the scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station\nWhen the signal comes in clear it just continually sweeps and again that that's that continuous sweeping has you'll ... if you do that voices and other sounds sort of a rise out of that noise\nAnd again people will write these words down that they will capture in these very quick sparse moment says it scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with with a imagine as the spirit world\nHe came up with one of the schools springs box which is throwing the exactly that isn't it\nThat's right Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um devices that he made and he they became more and more complex he'll eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it wasn't spirits at all but that was he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nPeter as you were putting together strange frequencies did you come across anything strange yourself\nWhile I did some experiments and you are a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think what was important was that I was able to sort of get into that had space where I felt that I was doing something that had been\nBeing done for centuries I mean I'm I'm would like to make the argument that even somebody like John the who is using his scenes stones to try to communicate with the angels and and as a result created what magicians called the ... language\nThat that you set the scene stone is the same as using a radio to communicate with the spirit world that that this is something that human beings have been attempting to do with some media mystic device some material device\nWhere we take something and we purpose that we use it in a way that it wasn't originally intended and in fact the magician or the medium becomes a kind of spiritual hacker\nWhere we're really trying to interact with our technologies and our material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be doing with it and yet as we know it's really the hackers\nThat have work early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers would probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our home [laughter]\nTo be with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book was Jewish mythology in ... the goal and tell us about that\n[noise] yeah I mean I like to think that the goal of them is really the first piece of technology right where we try to build something and then be us with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of the goal them as it's called particularly the goal of Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds a goal and to help the Jewish people who feel\nUm who are being attacked or there's a poll rum and they're trying to defend themselves\nAnd eventually the goal and becomes\nIt goes you know it it it it\nIt there's chaos ensues the rabbi can no longer control it and either has to destroy it or he has to put it to sleep\nIn one of the stories that goal and gross so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder and a race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbles into ... sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories but if you look at the actual\nJewish ... missed this as a mystical writings about the call them the goal of them is in some ways a\nA means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their spiritual\nAccurate and it's it's almost like a pass to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge\nBut the goal in itself is was understood by the rabbis to be just kind of a dumb machine there is a wonderful tell my story where a rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and they show him the goal them and the\nHe says to them well what can I Do kind of speak and they say well no it can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just a\nIt's just the toy [laughter] beach is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures you right now so we can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that then we're just pretended to the throne as it were\nYou know what about the showman you well you know you need a ... ah American tradition and other types of was a cultures ... seemed to be the solution to the other side\n[noise] that's right and the Sherman would also used in utilize\nSound and light off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to induce the states of consciousness in their people and I think that what the ... and what the stage magician does in many ways this is very connected and it also\nCan access and connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging of spiritualism which spirit cabinets and the different ways in which people were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet\nBut they were using technologies to be able to create the state\nOf consciousness in the audience and so I don't think that it's necessarily well we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be and chanted we want to exist in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advance I think it's something that we have long\nBeen excited about it I mean even watching a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a ... stick your experiences in it\n... it isn't the great adventure was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build a machine I don't think he was never able to do it was you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have\nVery interesting thing here where we have people who are considered scientists and rationalize and it's not that they were the monkey and because they wanted to just be cynical skeptical because they really wanted there to be the truth this is true of Houdini\nHoudini really want to see him he really wanted to find a medium who could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his dearly departed mother but he couldn't find one all he found was Charlotte ends but his but he believed that it could be possible\nAnd I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we\nLose a sense of that mystery in our lives where\nJust for a moment pretend even if it's just a pretend moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place to sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves in\nThe northern Houdini\nAwesome and I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where\nLet's just for a moment for ten even if it's just the hand moment imagine that these things would be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves and ...\nThose are new Houdini by the way you write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the right yes that's right ... going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy but as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nThat's right if he had two days equipment do you think he might be able to do something\nMaybe but I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes founded that people were using these things but if you should have\nMoved up hurting aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption thing kids know in ... we tried to hide the fact that maybe he really wasn't as magical you thought\nWere going to be back in a moment to talk more with Peter a beep or golf his book\nStrange frequencies we got a link to his publisher Random House to make it easier for you to get the book if you're into this it's a magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest\nFor the super natural to stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour well even take your stories you're paranormal stories and just your general questions more to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology and its ability to maybe communicate with the other side\nCoast insiders the new version of that goes to goes to a a map is now available for iPhone and know Android ... listen live we're on demand anywhere anytime good acoustical stadium dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nSpiritual material destiny I mean it I think it's actually a very American Spirit right I mean\nThat some scholars a sociologist one in particular max vapor used to talk about you know Protestantism in the spirit of capitalism that something about the Protestant American Spirit is something whereby we want to\nProve our righteousness we want to prove that we are loved by God by by being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right and I think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we\nAre in charge of our own salvation where we want to be right in front of\nOur experience with the divine is is again something that's very human I think particularly American off and\nAnd so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say\nYou know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with spirit or with God or divine or\nWhatever and and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something pre existing eye opening it up and re purpose in it\nAnd so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people practice magic for millennium right\nMhm just another example of magic of a of a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between\nRight right in the middle to get right in there and say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it could be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool\nLike should we put you Peter in that category\nMyself yeah well I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that um I tend to ah believe though that\nWe have to be careful about how much we try to read that you know from it we have to put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer that maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\n[noise] yeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it I mean there is\nYou know why some people seem to be more\nAnd if we get so far and we don't get an answer them maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\nYeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it I mean there is\nYou know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are but this goes you know\nBack to the whole idea that we once used to think that a that a profit was somebody who had special information for us and now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so you know if a for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce are that we called visionary art or spiritual art are often considered outsider artists why is that why are the people who are working\nWith these themes consider to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular are you know mainstream artistic community and I think it's we live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience\nAnd what's interesting about technology is it is and this is really key here to see if I can explain this\nSomebody takes or radio\nAnd they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio when I'm when a ... or a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world but the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to east Saudi Arabia and have another effect take place\nThe science behind that that even made this radio or something that you could find a store which said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't it yes\nAnd yet we can take the things this technology and somehow divorced from the science that is underneath the scientific method and scientific understanding of the world it's\nIt's underneath it and divorced and turn it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can think about technologies in ways that if the science connected to that might actually be in opposition to\nWell if you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you could listen online and somebody came up to you and said Peter I hear voices of this guy at night\nTalking about ghosts and spirit snow these strange things he's helped or he's out there and you of course we never had a radio you've never went online like that's listen you're probably seeing what's this guy talking about he's insane\nOr what my voices out there and it's being heard by millions or if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to use the right time to receiver\n[noise] well it's fascinating that you say that because when\nSpiritual is a was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology and people called medium spiritual mediums spiritual\nTelegraph [laughter] they really\nBelieve that there was this link between this this new version and technology and how you're right it was a special a new kind of receiver and transmit her and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iran his really augmented in shape things were spirituality in technology tell me why\nWell I mean the TV itself is kind of a ... very strange and scary yeah if\nThe some of the the there is a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four called the clue television company and they actually they this is how they advertise their television this is what they said the dreams of witches have come\nTrue oh my God\nSo they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird\nBut to increase its sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right\nUm and so the the the fact that you know week that we used to call those the after effects on a TV you know in the when we were used to watch you ate chef and VHS stations with an antenna we used to call those ghosts right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically\nIs is filled to the brim right with these supernatural on a cult metaphors and I think that that's really important I think that even when we\nTalk about technology even if we're not believers and even if we're just\nUsing it we still use these this language to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those days to not that this has anything to do with our discussion tonight but a ... radios televisions were built into very heavy furniture remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely yeah\nMy dad had an old field goal radio and this thing must have been about four feet tall and you know where it was ... it was in case in this beautiful piece of wood furniture\nAnd had to go written across it uh you know it was it was a piece of art in the same we have TVs in the in the cereal suddenly started coming out with\nThe track these are meant to be central pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like poker guys comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nAre you a hundred percent convinced Peter that the other side exists\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know I live\nIn a very limited all place what I what I like more than anything and what I liked about this about technology is it I really believe that these ambiguous states are in chanting steak when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical\nThan somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and told me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regards to trying to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about um\nMaybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but we will have transcended to the other side by use of artificial intelligence upload in our consciousness to computers there's a movement of what's called trans humanism and hosts humanists\nWho believe that we will become so

making this possible some record all media whether it was a tape\n'em or in this case a CD\nIn one one of the things I think that is very intriguing about all of this is that some\nIt's so much about the that the life itself it was the fact that it was electronic media it was making as possible some record about media whether it was a tape 'em or in this case a CD\nWell in one one of the things I

stop\nYou have to be able to determine when to do these things right mhm\nBecause if you don't you could miss a great opportunity or you could get killed or something like that for that\nAbsolutely and I do you know maybe in some ways and and I don't mean to diminish anybody's experienced that maybe you know maybe sometimes we project\nThese things from within ourselves on to the media you know maybe it's not the spirit world communicating you off with the with the um radio or what the tape player maybe it's our own unconscious\nOur own spirits that are trying to communicate something to watch that we need to hear\nWhen you started writing the book strange frequencies was easy or difficult for you to get it started\n[noise] well at part of the problem for me was is that each one of

think I Hope is interesting stories about\nThe specific thing I mean the history of there's some wonderful books about the history of spare photography\nBut I wanted to specifically orient my story around Shannon's work and doing show take up you know some of the important background information but yes it ... it was difficult and I have to say and and you know I'm sure that you understand is that\nNo matter how you want to approach the subjects where the one approach them and a skeptic or as a full on believer or the way that I like to approach them more as a journalist and a historian that\nPeople are worried when you bring up or it's like for natural are caught they don't know if you're going to try to exploit them or make fun of them or if you're coming at it and I'm On my way that they feel is is not rational enough you know and so just the idea that I Want it to work with the subjects that all\nPoses problems sometimes when I'm asking to interview somebody and they're a

get to those those of us in the audience that are of like mind district is to use caution with the amount of emphasis that you put on trying to seek out\nThe guardian angel aspect and and I guess we

father and my heart would be heartbroken that I Would\nLose out on the full relations but I Would have with my kid and I guess to the extent that many of us try to seek out the angels more than we see

walking back to the coast to coast as we continue with the supernatural in a moment are very special guest professor slim king joins us\nTo talk about Harry Houdini for a moment Harry Houdini was a Hungarian born American illusion is stumped performer noted for\nHis sensational escape actually first attracted notice of vaudeville and the U.S and that is here we have ... on a tour of Europe where he challenged police force just to keep him locked up\nSunni extended his repertoire to include chains ropes slung from skyscrapers straight jackets underwater and having to escape from an old his breath and set a sealed milk can with the water in it Ninety dull for thousands watched as he tried to escape from special ... cups\nCommissioned by London's daily mirror keeping him and suspense for an hour\nAnd another ... buried alive only just able to claw himself to the surface are merging and the state of near breakdown\nNow ... suspected that these escapes were faked Houdini presented himself as a scourge of fake spiritual as he was obsessed with trying to communicate with his dead mother and went through all kinds of mediums and\nPeople to find her he was not successful he told his wife bash that when he died they will try to communicate he will try to come back Harry Houdini died on October thirty first Halloween Nineteen twenty six in Detroit Michigan\nThe Boston all the bacteria comes out Randy body\nRight and they had no anti bacterial anything back then in twenty six so he uh had took him seven days to die\nWho the substances that what happened yes yeah it was a\n... so it substance all through they had two operations and then they gave him some mysterious serum that they'd been working on but nothing seemed to work during those seven days he had time to go over\nThis afterlife experiment that he and death that worked out and they'd had it since the early Nineteen hundreds or since before Nineteen Thirteen\nThey had this it's a two way code that they'd worked out if one of them died that they would\nUh use this code contact each other and so he had a week it took him a week to pass away he was so strong and so they had a week together to fine tune this code and then about two years later\nShe gets uh the actual code from Arthur forward\nNow how does our to forget what the medium trans what happens\nIf aren't there for the trans medium he wasn't like I'm a Marjory or you know the er which look\nFrom and where would you like was was he like Whoopi Goldberg ... in a post\nDoc he just goes into he puts on a blindfold and goes asleep\nOkay like like Casey all righty goes into that trench\nRight he just goes into a trans state they have to write down everything that happens and then he read later she doesn't really always remember what goes on attendance subconscious but he consciously doesn't really remember uh all the time what happened so they transcribe these fans so he started having these senses\nAnd in one of them he contacted Houdini some other\nAbout a year before this and then he starts having these dances and he starts getting the code now Houdini messages actually in three parts it's one word than a nine words that spell another word and then she it's a two way code\nI'm Beth has five words in French that she says back to him now does that make sense to you or everybody I talked to a Ninety nine percent of them only think of a one way code\nYou have you're on the other side one word or something you're going to get it across and then they're going to know that you're there but ... was\nSharper than that Houdini said listen I'm over on the other side I Want to make sure she gets the code\nThat she's the one who gets\nRight I Want to make sure it's her so she has five words in French that she gets back that come back to him so this was an ingenious code really that because it's take it's a ten it's like Fifteen words\nWow why why would Hillary professor obsessed with either trying to come back spiritually ... let everybody knew what was going on\n[noise] well ah as you know Harry had to be first\nFirst do skiing\nRight he was a ... a sky apologist you had to be first I don't know if you know the Harry was the first guy to fly an airplane and Australia\nYes he was that\nHe had to be first in a matter of fact he did a great movie called the grim game about that so uh and he did several movies he he was a really multi talented guy um I think he would have been I think you would have had a movie um\nCareer you know mogul yeah it had he survived he invented what they call now the dailies uh in in the movie industry he invented that\nHe rushed cut this right\nYes so he was a you know awesome and all these\nDifferent ways so he was going to be number one and if he had to come back from the grave to do it he was\nGonna do he was going to do it and do you think it was successful\nI I Know with successful I Know that the code and the message that he gave was exactly the same message that they that they had agreed upon\nYou didn't know that for a fact didn't\nComfort professor Bess his wife\nThe best was in tough shape ... best was pretty depressed that ... you know her husband had died\nAnd bass was um she had developed some what I Would consider bad habits she spent money like crazy and she uh\nWhile he was alive and after a while he was alive and after\nHe died and so\nYou remember Nineteen twenty nine when the message came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her magic friends really wanted to believe that in any way and then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses not only all her friends\nAll right and so\nIf you remember Nineteen twenty nine when the message came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her magic friends really wanted to believe that in any way and then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses\nNot only all her friends she loses all her money\nShe was arrested in the stock market Oh yes oh\nShe loses the majority of her friends the majority of her money and now she's got this bad habit of spending money like it grows on trees she just\nAnd I guess very left are nice little sum huh\nYeah he liked her a part of the uh they pay a\nDamn nitty or whatever for his ah insurance the insurance the insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in Nineteen thirty six is probably a lot of money then\nRight probably that's close to a million dollars um so they\nGot about that because they said it was an accident because this guy punched mhm and so it was the insurance company that came up and said ah that can't happen you can get a pen to fight us from being punched and so they were proven wrong in court\nSo she got fifty thousand so she was rolling in do\nNow and then she they put it all in a market and she'll off at all\nNow you have heard of the curse that killed Houdini yes what is the curse\n[noise] know Houdini had a three part show the first part of a show with magic mhm the second part was skipped college ... skates\nWould do an escape that was where the water or Chinese water torture cell or the uh the milk can escape and then the last part towards the end of his career he would go after the spiritual life and he would have have this um confrontation with them ...\nSelf like confrontation right well at some point in time\nHe would say I've had enough and he would get up during a third party would go out to a farm reader or somebody or a or that he considered fake and you would go in there and all the reporters and everybody to be found on him and he'd go in and find a couch or something and they pull out like an incandescent\nDown that goes in the dark or some of the I found it I Know I got you you know and\nThen they're probably attached to a string or something like that\nRight so ... and of course the medium sort of just what a what do you do that I didn't have nothing to do with that well they honestly didn't because I I'm a magician and a magician always have what you call it out\nThe way out you work it into your magic trick if you have a magic trick you might have two or three different methods on how it works and there's something else he switched to the next one and you switch to the next one and and it worked\nSo you're assured of success and so in his magic that's built in in the state of course I'm I guarantee you got two or three keys in there you know and if all that failed and he couldn't get the T best would come out and kissing and she'd have the appropriate tea in her mouth\nAnd just split it into his mouth exactly Ohio\nHe always had an out he always had a way out well it was exactly the same thing for the spiritual\nSpirituals because he had an agent and she would go into town and she would find some hanging fruit she would find some a medium that were obviously tricking people but some she couldn't\nFind what they're doing and she couldn't catch them so she would pull out something from beneath her clothes and like stuff it into the couch\nAnd so later Houdini at a sure thing that he could come back and expose them even though they didn't know anything about it\nIt seems as though that somebody somewhere puts a curse on it\nRight so he did this with Marjorie or he Marjorie was the uh the which from Boston\nUm hold on for ... seconds a professor we're we're in a break but we'll

R. E. F. that James Randi educational foundation had a million dollar one here\nWhich they never had to give out\nRight they never had to give it out but they I don't think they actually let anybody who could actually win participant\n[laughter] um well they're all like you for that one\nYeah ah well they can they can deflect me all they want I don't think they played fair and they finally shut it down and they're just giving them money whoever they want a that is interesting that they were taking in about one point five million dollars a year talking about a million dollar\nContest so they were coming out way ahead so anyway the ah\nThe Scientific American have the same kind of thing going on so they're always going to Marjory fan says so they set this up with six of these and Houdini goes up but he doesn't send 'em\n... that's the agents that easily sent the head what he does he builds a box kind of looks like a sauna he built this box and he has um\nJames Collins build it for him and he builds all of a Houdini props and it's it's designed so that only mean his head in our hands can stick out\nOkay so she can't get at anything so who d'nese gotta make sure that she can't\nProduce any trickery so they ah do once they aren't in everything goes according to plan and ah they have what they call a ballot box it's a little a bell inside of a box\nAnd if they push on the only I had the the bell rang and they always put the box outside of the reach of me now ah and in this particular instance they put it between Houdini slack\nSo there's no way anyone could get out well in the first say on the bell rings so the second fancy brings in the box and he puts her in the box is going to stop\nIt [noise] and they put ... and the second ... the bell rings so now he's\nSo now he's got a picture and liberal we talked about before about there's always an out you have to he has to fix marching Marjorie because these are actually already written a book about her how he's\nYou know exposed her yeah so he's got this book he's going to put out three have to expose her so she comes in\nUh everybody gets around the ... and of course Marjorie has a spirit guide\nAnd his name is Walter when it's Marjorie brother so Walter she goes into a trance and Walter comes out and just starts cussing and swearing and cursing at Houdini and he says why do you put this foul thing in here why are you doing this why did you do this I'm cursing you\n'cause this is ... and this was his spirit saying this right\nThis is the spirit saying it through Marjorie and the spirit watcher put a death occurs because inside the box is a rule or one of those ... rulers pulls up into three pieces\nYup is one of those kind and it's in side the box the only people that had access to the box was Houdini while and a James Collins\nHow soon ... was the curse a professor and then Houdini ended up dying\nWell like ... a crush them and some people say that he said you'll die in a year now that's a you know people debate about that but he died in two years he was totally that this big strong man died in two years after being cursed by Walter\nScare him\nWell actually Houdini\nUsed it in his advertising you can see their Houdini ads all over the place where Houdini advertise that he's under the curse of the spiritual\nAnd could die at any moment\nYeah and it really helped him you know kind of in a way but then you get this concept of the self fulfilling prophecy right they have proper five that he's gonna die so later when Houdini gets\nHe's under the curse of the spiritual\nAnd die at any moment\nYeah and it's really helped him you know kind of in a way but then you get this concept of the self fulfilling prophecy right that they have prophesied that he's gonna die so later when Houdini gets\nSick maybe this is in the back of his mind and so he doesn't go to the doctor 'cause he doesn't\nHe doesn't want to prove them right he doesn't want to show that he's getting sick or that something is happening and that kind of my viewpoint of maybe what happened why he didn't go when he first started getting sick\nAnd Arthur for what happened to me\n[noise] Arthur Ford Arthur forward toward the world after he gave this or did he live Houdini\nHe outlive all ah she lived until Seventy one oh wow okay poured lived a fantastic life um so after a Houdini a tries to frame up Marjory\nI'm he puts out this book he actually fails but he says he doesn't and he's got these photos of Marjory legs under the table\nAnd then he had some drawings made for her leg is reaching around his leg so he makes some drawings and puts them in the book where the photo is not anything like that drawing\nOh trickery by Houdini\nYes so Houdini once again is doing this and um there was a guy named Walter ... Gibson and he is probably one of if not the number one\nA expert on Houdini he worked with Houdini he worked with Don injure and then he worked with ... and he makes a statement that there's a a a bombshell in in the interview crafting\nAnd he gives this quote by Gibson says when we're all magicians realize that Houdini was often just honest as the mediums he purported to expose\nWow that's pretty heavy\nThat is heavy coming from the number one guy so he knew that they were putting 'em yeah James Collins in there and that uh the roads Mac and bird was going ahead and and they were setting them up so he would have a great show the three parts show\nCan you imagine what Houdini would have done for sure if they had television in those days\nA boy you would have been you know he was\nHighly uh brings up another a subject you know a ... on San says and you wonder why people don't put a fence on TV really well I was involved in a a\n\n\n\n[noise] maybe since I worked for town

supported him either scape from one of their jail cells or a there was one tiny escape from a like big fish they built the big fish 'cause there was a fish company that was sponsoring him in their

raises the elephant from underground you\nKnow you did not okay I'm going to assume that the elephant was always there\nYes okay\nWe'll do a little more homework yeah there you go no one who\nUp with the tricks I mean was this Houdini does that make him a genius for being able to come up with this or did he have somebody on staff like you who would say here's the trick\nWell it was always there yes okay we'll do a little more homework yeah there you go now but who comes up with the tricks I mean was this Houdini does that make him a genius for\nBeing able to come up with this or did he have somebody on staff like you who would say here's this trick and let's do this and we can make this how did they do this same was called puck toppled feel too I assume ... people on staff like you are right\nExactly exactly I'm James Collins when the guy that Houdini the built all of them for them but Houdini would say I want to do this and then he would put it in the ball in their court and then they would have to come up with how you would\nDo so I assume in the HIPAA Jerome they walks Nelson out everybody sees this thing lumbering in ... and then they shrouded in or close to or something and then the trick began I it's absolutely amazing wasn't the queen there at the time\n[noise] uh well he probably the same between that's there [laughter] you know Europe but I don't think she was at their okay I I don't know for sure next not I don't\nThink she was there I think he performed for them in Europe\n... let's go to the first time caller Ralph in Indianapolis I'm Ralph go ahead\nYes I'm here already taken away readings\nA New Yorker for a while and it was the last five years of his life got a letter from him just before he died of seeing bishop pike on a ledge when he was trying to go over to comb Ron in Israel and that's where they found them\nQuestion for you or what what year did Arthur forward bring back the code to Mrs Houdini this was in Nineteen twenty nine\nOkay with a three part code or the cope with the middle section in the first word was rows and rows and then he had a code for the nine or words that spelled out believe\nAnd then she had Dr words in French which means I pulled the curtain back like this and that's what she told him so he was a shirt that his code I'd gotten through\nNow didn't he she later denied that later on after she loses her friends she loses all her money a man a called Edward Said comes into her life and says he's er manager but they live together\nAnd she fell in love again yeah so\nHe didn't like that that's why you wanted to come back\nRight she meet women the same kind of way when there's a lot of things going on here but he's like Twenty years younger than her ... promise to her that\nShe can make a movie and she'll make a million dollars okay go ahead\n[noise] uh what year than they cheat deny that the the code was correct well the first time she'd never denies the code was correct uh she says she was told\nThat she never denies that the code was correct but she first about a year and a half after um she they're given the Houdini messages she having lunch with some ladies in Miami and she's she said she was hesitant about a\nHoudini coming back because why didn't he favor from the depression\nSo she was she thought that Houdini would somehow favor from this math depression that what's happening or that somehow he was going to come back and now breakfast with her every morning or something I don't know what she was thinking but she wasn't happy about\nThe fact that uh our before it was on tour somewhere so she had no way to contact him and so she was you know\nShowing this pleasure for that than Edward St comes in later promises or a million dollars and then they go on and about eight years later they make a movie called a a religious racket hears\nYeah he made a ... a a couple of movies at least to me\nWell Houdini made four or five movies\nYeah but they also I Hope they do they do well\nOr they did fine but he was he was the star of of every movie\nWas he like an actor or were they more like documentaries\nThat they he was an actor and he always had like a really really good looking coast are\nHis real name Eric Weiss yes he was he was a pretty good looking guy too\nI kind of a sudden I'm often guy he was only\nA and everything kind of a smooth smooth talker could really give a\n... compliments really well but he wasn't the greatest actor but he used it to promote his escape so we had a bunch of his tapes and have all the movies\nReal name Eric white some\nMhm yes and knocks Eric turned into Harry and then who game he got from who Don and he added and I called in Houdini and er so to this day they call them Harry Houdini but I don't think he ever\nA switch his name and he was born in Europe and he wasn't born here and he was\nHe was born in Hungary\nYeah he was born in Hungary Budapest and he wasn't even actually a U.S citizen if you\nThink wasn't there

missed the fire uh he kind of drop the magician thing\nOkay and so people are starting to go that way it's part of the mystery our you know\nWhen people go see a magician do they want the trick to fail or succeed what do you think\nWell I think they all want it to succeed I think you'd be a strange individual if you'd like to see the guy fall on his face\nNot some people who want to see that\nYeah maybe maybe uh I don't ah\nI see I Want I Want to see the the trick professor and then trying to figure out what happened how we did it\nRight that's me when I when I first went to Disney
