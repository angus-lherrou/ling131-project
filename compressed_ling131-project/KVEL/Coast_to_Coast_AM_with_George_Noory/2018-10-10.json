I Would lose money in a bad scene that you would write a book about consciousness showing the heck did you do this\nI Would have lost money too [laughter] so it was about\nTwo years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally material is that's what I Would call it now in hindsight but I I randomly stumbled across pod cast that started talking about these ideas\nI was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had and at the end of it her name is Laura Powers she mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers\nAnd I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula and I listen to different episodes and people there were many different people who've talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities the ability for consciousness to survive bottle that things I had no familiarity with\nAn overtime just hearing enough different people describing similar perspective unreality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real and this was a very\nJarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless\nAnd here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness maybe the brain's more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that process is consciousness and the identity that we have is not tied to the body so that totally freaked me out and a change in my world view completely led me down the path of\nIntense research because I needed to rethink all of reality spent about a year of\nBasically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in financing consulting and as I was doing that I told friends overtime at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive\nAnd these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity\nWith the topics\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight so after hearing enough of this\nFeedback and also seeing that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened so it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend\nAnd I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco and decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days and ended up\nWriting more than half of the book is now out and then finished over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript and ultimately a\nCold email bill Gladstone who's now my agent and my publisher multiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents Eckhart totally\nMuch deeper Neal Donald Walsh um and so that's where we are\nSuper now what did you mean by an end to upside down thinking\n\nI consider upside down thinking to be the material\nIs perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness through a brain so the brain creates consciousness what I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing yawn space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness\nConsciousness comes first\nRight with all the brain\nDoes consciousness exist at all\nAnd the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests would science back us up\nSo my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently of a functioning body so one example is chapter nine or I talked about near death experiences\nAnd if you'd asked me a few years ago what's in your experience I Would have said well isn't that just a hallucination that happens when someone is about to die it's like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die I started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple a first\nOf people feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described in near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched\nHypochondria is not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all and even more than that we find in in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest its noted they ... out of body experience\nSo the person it out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens is that it suggests some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark Goldberg dot com is linked up for you and coast to coast am dot com the name of his book we're talking about an end to

is with us right now is we talk about is working in the upside down thinking mark ... ... what did your peers say and your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise them\nIt's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before ... the pre cognition tell them because you know psycho couldn't he says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nYeah absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I\nHad no idea there was actual science and controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about ... what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt who was a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating telepathy and uh she ... she came out with some astounding things but what did you find\nIt yeah I thought that these are very important phenomenon it's it's mind my communication and just taking a quick step back the reason that I then each of these phenomenon is that I read them that\nThe material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain that perspective not account for things like the left or the and the other things will talk about and I read it in that if any of these phenomena are real\nThe material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture I was work so well apathy to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns held experiments and the basic design is as follows and I should\nSay that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter and when you combine the result\nThe statistics are very compelling mhm doctor dean rating who just wrote a book called real magic he has a section in his book called ... stigma\nSix sigma refers to statistical odds against chance when you've got to stick stick my result the odds of it that the effect is just happening by chance is more than a billion to one and in telepathy we have six sigma results\nThat they can't solve experiment the study has one person in a room will call in Bob and very very relaxing state listening to relaxing music there's another person let's call hurricane who's in another room\nJane is given a picture by the experiment there's an experimenter state game I Know that sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally sent a picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room the gate and mentally sending this image to Bob\nBob it then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what your game is looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all at Bob would get correctly one out of four times twenty five percent\nRight now I'm going to be the ... the law of probability\nThing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room the gate is mentally sending this image to Bob Bob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture game was looking at we would predict if there were no effect at all at Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent\nRight now ... the law of probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent\nSo from a statistical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect is twenty five versus thirty two this is massive statistically it's suggested something is getting through\nAnd it actually conforms to our common sense our everyday experience because if we were one hundred percent ...\nThen we would know each other's thought all the time sure instead it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they tax you where they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase ... percent mark is at the center or the receiver\n[noise] this is something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a has had been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better meditate or ... seemed to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI'm always wonder though if somebody is really tuned into certain things if they can pick up all kinds of different events without really having the sender heavy much to do with it\nI I I think that the receiver might have a better effect in changing the also\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... or communications with the deceased\nThrough medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that's not localized to the body those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular standard or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver person in the room in simply not showed them any of them for pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she sent to them what do you think what happened\n... well I think we'd have a distribution first of all we had just an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic than we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw what the US government\nUh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be a different more difficult studies to examine because the effect is so small\nWell let's talk about the U.S government studies and the things that they've conducted we know that they've been very interested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me I'm the program is sometimes referred to as Stargate\nProgram and you're used psychic spies for national security purposes many of marine I've been on this show by the way\nUp during the Cold War and and the people who were involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many remote viewers who are involved to say this was a real so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real I'm\nIn my book I I have some documents from the CIA which have been declassified recently\nAnd the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was one but remote viewing is the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being they're physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that's far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes\nIt sounds completely paranormal consciousness is localized to the brain but if consciousness is non local then it's at least conceivable\nDocuments um say explicitly and I I'm looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon\nThis is from a declassified documents that has been released recently so\nI mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that in my business world that I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me\nAt least made me question things um even further than that there's a page on a science panel and there are some very credible people including someone from Cal Tech the next page in the document says science panel's report principle findings either direct quotes\nImplications are revolutionary evidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we looked at these uh tell a path to good studies\nAnd I've always wondered\nIf the government really never stopped doing it with continued now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies\nThat just that same question and they say no it's stopped because they would have kept us on they would have used us I'm not sure what the government has found other people and they've continued these kinds of blindness studies\nWell certainly there were some successes reported in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used\nTo find a down just Russian bomber in an African jungle that they couldn't find so there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful so\nYou'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that a organizations would be trying it\nPre cognition mark the very valuable tool for people in their life because of the ability\nTo sense things make decisions based on those gun feelings\nAnd to react to them no a lot of people don't react they don't do it in something happens when they go oh I should have done that and I I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\nSo there are some studies which show a very subtle pre cognition known as pre sentiments where the bodies sensing something very subtly\nAnd we need to stick to ... to show it before something happens and there are other examples where it's much more explicit where a person has a dream known as a pre pocket and dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly as they dreamed it\nThat much less subtle but if we go to the pre sentiment studies this is where I think it becomes very compelling again if we look at the meta analysis of all the statistics\n\n\n[noise]\nIt was this hour for Tylenol

spiritual level what you're saying as well\nI Would think more than ... maybe one in the city would easily\nYeah thank you for your question on the\nUm I tend to agree with you George and there's an analogy I Love also from Dr Bernardo Castro which summarizes the way I think about things which is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water\nWhere water represents consciousness and each of us is like a world pool within that stream so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we are fundamentally still made out of water\nSo what happens when the physical body dies that's like a whirlpool dissipating and the water doesn't leave the stream it just transitions into a different state and so the water to me of consciousness and consciousness is having this variety of experiences whether localized in a whirlpool or otherwise industry\nDo you think that's consciousness\nIs a normal process of living or its supernatural\n\nThe way I view consciousness is that it's like max clump he said I regard consciousness as fundamental I regard matter as to rebut if\nFrom consciousness meaning that consciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things points to that but I Do everything that we experience as being a basically a modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow is this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter] so I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective that I subscribe to a leads to a very bleak outlook on life what's your brain's off it's over\nI mean I understood the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching um now I think that that consciousness does not die on the body dies because it's the consciousness isn't dependent on the body\nSo I see much more uh ... meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish this had been talked me a long time ago but going back to the near death experiences what people often report is known as a life review where the ex marine their whole\nLife in a flash and again this is when their brain is either offer highly impaired and they're judging themselves for how they acted during their life\nBut this is the kicker that really I think about this every day is that some people report experiencing the life review through the eyes of those they affected so let's say Bob harm to Jane in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experienced the pain through James eyes\nAnd he comes back to his life forever changed carrying much more about uh how we treat people rather than material good so it's when we talked about meeting in life the life review as a potential lens if we take that as a literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life that we were given this gift to be able to do these incredible things to consciousness free cognition to love to see\n... and things like that well yeah I I think that these are natural abilities that we tend to have in\nThe telepathy study I mentioned earlier where people are thirty two percent rather than twenty five percent there's a subtle ability even people in people who aren't trained\nI think there are abilities that are just simply not harness in modern society because these ideas are considered a novelist and totally paranormal and this is one of the reasons I wanted to write the book itself so compelled to do it is that\nAn understanding human potential and these abilities that we have could revolutionize I think the world but also our science in our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into what we do\nFirst time caller John in Flint, Michigan welcome to the show John go ahead\nYou doing sir great I'm an ex military\nAnd I will tell you I don't believe in ghost UFOs and everything else but I Will say that again retired military I was assigned to a multinational units two thousand six in Iraq\nWere by the way willing to preserving first night\nWe did that I was assigned to an empty every intelligence unit and we basically we're looking for a bomb maker\nUm we were able to use what I understand the remote viewing from a section of the three intelligent shop where there was a coal location for a boss and some building rail to find that three UAB\nThe person I Believe who was the remote viewers it was brought in a was ball and I believe he wasn't no by no which is I Know it sounds odd but uh you spoke broken English I Believe he was ...\nAnd I believe it was an albino\nWhich is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was Israeli descent from what I can get ... who I dealt with over there mhm my question is that again I don't believe in any of this other stuff but I Do believe in a remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or non American ... uh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality is more than ... ...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there are ... there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\nI Would say that it just it with what I've seen so far but I think more research it deserved on this topic is it being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there are certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be what\nThe ability to perceive something with the mind alone\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has our eyes outside of the body\nCorrect going back to the world for an allergy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though there are localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept water that outside\nI Want to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us Yes sir I'm ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs because you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately what me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I a a lot of things that I dealt with I including those sightings and everything else I've been able to do something else\nOkay so you're you're basically a skeptic who will believe if you find the proof [noise]\n\nForthcoming study will include cats and dogs to commence shortly we'd like to thank veteran Michael lap and ... him for his amazing assistance\nIn putting this altogether we are also looking forward to the study with

to coast our final segment with Margo ... market can we conclude that consciousness\nIs a part of the universe always was in that it survives outside of the physical brain the physical body but it's there it's out there in the ether I mean can we categorically all agree on that\nTo me the evidence point in that direction more strongly than any other direction when you put together a phenomenon that we just got like a psychic phenomena like weapons the cycle can eat as pre cognition near death experiences children would have like memories\nYou put all these together combined with her and um and I wanted to get that you're playing the fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the bird ...\nGeorge may God Bless you and your bus thank you\nTogether combined with certain phenomena of quantum physics it's to get that consciousness is playing this fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the bird from\nGeorge ah may God Bless you and your show continue\nBussing you're thinking this wonderful really wonderful and my question is all you can get other got tons of scholars a reincarnation as a result of consciousness living outside the body in each of us\nAnd the so they carry a consciousness moves on to affect another human being good or evil how this free will play a part in or effect consciousness and I'll take my reply on rent\nThose free will have anything to do with it mark\nThis is a very tricky question I think the question of free will get it ultimately boils down to who is the agent that we're speaking of that has the free well\nUm are we talking about the ... body having free will are we talking about the the consciousness itself and if we think of consciousness as being like the stream of water\nThan all there is is consciousness so at the level of the fundamental consciousness it would appear that there is a infinite free well but at the level of\nPerhaps at an individual that is\nConsidering itself to be separated from that consciousness or at least appearing that way then perhaps the free well did not exist at the same level that that makes sense\nYeah it does ... on a very difficult subject\nIt's very difficult and I think there are some of the concept that we're talking about night I think are beyond what what are linear human mind can't conceptualize sort of like insanity we all know infinity exists but what can we really understand what it means I think there are certain concepts that our brains just limit us from understanding falling\nYou'd think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and da da da da da da da and the end do you use it\nI I think there were probably people throughout history um\nWho really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how Jesus might have interplay with consciousness but from the bits and pieces I I've heard it's possible that he was one of these individuals who really understood how things work and it seems when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem\nTotally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nWe have against his name's Joe ... a gallon burger and he's a he's a professor and he is conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck he has concluded beyond a shadow of the doubt\nThat the ability of the mind and attitude will determine whether you win or lose in his studies in Las Vegas where he's tested and in and he said it's uncanny soon somebody goes in the Las Vegas\nOffbeat positive ah there's a high likelihood they're going to win but if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results are on candy\nI think that's all tied together white consciousness it's all part of the same don't you\nI'm not familiar with those exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just stay out of consciousness is the basis of reality where everything is just a stream of consciousness than the reality we're in is almost malleable\nAnd sometimes it's very subtle where you have a random number generator that's behaving slightly non randomly in other cases we have reports like he talked about a metal being that using the mind\nSo who's to say that outcomes which is just a a part of the physical reality could also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a similar James\n... Ah yes real quickly before a make a statement I like the uh respect of this to disagree with a that a a the as a bill about the\nEffects of a drug this starts in the fall and the mind or you know it's an indicator that consciousness is a product of the mind mhm I'm\nA you know as you the person speak him into a tape recorder as an example um you know if that example would be a consciousness and uh the play back of this tape recorded a you know if the typing wrinkles clinical though something will end up playing it just started a\nVoice or you know distortions that would be an example of the drugs mine\nYou know it's not the consciousness but that's the effect of the apparatus there's I'm\nBringing about a distortion of what consciousness put in it so it's not coming out in his shoe clarity that's you know or the wholesome of consciousness that went into it uh but anyway uh uh I think the prime example of a\nA spirit living outside of the body is that the self when you have a Gulf hunting so you have a\nExample of an active consciousness of this ... this thing outside of the body that um you know a little ever paid have knowledge of events that you know maybe it shouldn't ah otherwise a telescope nieces and everything else I think that's the prime example of consciousness uh outside of the body right there\nWhat do you think of them are\nWell there are studies using a on mediums people who can communicate with the deceased is\nRelated to what James was just describing and they're actually controlled studies that have been done at the wind British Research Center and these studies are use five levels of blinding where the media and the person who allegedly can communicate with the deceased is speaking on the phone to the researcher and all that person knows\nIs the first name of the dead person and they're able to\nBring in non champ information and there have been to peer reviewed journal studies on this they just think that the mediums are able to obtain information we need more research on it but that's an example of\nSomeone who appears to be deceased and a living person getting information about someone who is deceased\nWhere do you think in some mediums do you think are some of them are very effective\nAt erasing an important point I think there is a tendency um I think in the mainstream to say that there are frauds out there that are claimed to be mediums and maybe there are some fraud I think there are some people that\nHave real abilities and the wind ...

I don't believe that you know there is necessarily a hell no\nInterest you know ... why do you keep investing\n\nI don't I I investigate because I don't feel I can stop sometimes you know I over the years um I've\nYou know you're like addicted to it\nMm no not addicted to it but to me when I'm\nYou know investigating a lotta times I'll use energy and expend energy when I'm doing that um and if I don't I feel like sometimes if I'm not doing what I'm supposed to be doing\nMy life kind of it's like wreaking havoc right um it's like a buildup of energy and if I'm working I Do a lot of technical work I Do a lot of work on computers um and occasionally when I Would go through those fans of time and not actually use that energy I Would tend to when I fly a lot of my electronics\nOr for a jumble

have a you know\nFew mediums that work with us um we have people that work specialize on the electronics they work with the ... meters a you know we have those that use the quarter is and I think it's just a good team of people that have worked together for so long and just have a routine down\nHave you ever been on an investigation Maureen where you were ... we really get out of this thing you know no\nNobody knows more than once really [laughter]\nYeah there's there's been a couple um there's there's been a few and when those moments happen there even though they're rare there's still a nerve and\nYou know I mean one would say well I'm not afraid of anything that's you know he'll say but to me you know you have to just keep aware\nAnd uh I don't intend to feel the effects of an investigation let's say over a period of time as you know joyous it's taking energy for me it's feeling you know I'm literally like I have a pain in my chest or I'm feeling all this\nUh you know after effect let's say um I still have to work a day job so it could interfere and that's one thing I always have to kinda be aware of\nWhat would you see is the most fascinating to shoot them on to do\nOh jeez fascinating um to me we investigated the caught Smith White House um one time and there was a the last White House keepers wife Connie small I Believe what's her name\nAnd to me it was fascinating because this was the sweetest woman that had come through I felt for energy and it was nice for a change you know so I wasn't\nI wasn't a in fear for feeling um painter having any ill effects and it just was a pleasant feeling and what was even nicer it was after we were done and I was investigating how she came through she was so excited she I channeled turf felt like she just was so excited to be alive again so she could talk to the people around her but to me what\nReally it was fascinating was you know we investigate and a lot of times it's you know ...\nCentury afraid that you're dealing with so you don't necessarily see the person face to face that you can overcome you know communicated with 'em and so we had done a talk after this investigation\nUm and once we did that time you know here's this woman ... small her picture as life size in front of me and I just I didn't expect it but I literally just broke down because it was again the first time I got to really see a woman I just felt a connection to her that I didn't want\nTo explain [laughter] that's kinda that's got to be emotional sometimes when you see things like that and I bet when you were in the ... you know you look at a Greek snow did you actually think you know here's a person who died and\nYou know remains or right here in New Hampshire grossly operations attached to them that's got to be emotional for people did you ever have you ever just broken down\nA you know I've broken down on while I Try not to break down but when I'm done readings for people um you know and I've actually\nKnow you you talk about the loved ones you talk about I mean these are real people you're talking about you know their pains and is ours and it doesn't help them really to break down but you can't help it sometimes\nCan do\nA you know I've broken down on while I Try not to break down but when I'm done reading for people um you know and I've actually\nYou know you you talk about the loved ones you talk about I mean there's a real people you're talking about you know they're paying and that's ours and it doesn't help them really to break down but you can't help it sometimes because if you're a compassionate and you have a hard it's hard not to\nOh I see it as much as you probably try to try to stay focused you know you get involved in these things\nYou do definitely down you can put yourself in their place and and realize that you know our own you know mortality right so it's ... ... you come face to face with dealing with death on many occasions\n... it it can be hot breaking\nWhat would you say is the strangest case you've come across strangers ...\nStrangers case okay well when Ron would take me out to investigate many times and just about all the time he would never tell me where we were going on because it's to keep me honest right\nSo I'm not Googling minor nation eager for 'em\nSo one day he gave me a call and say hey marine you know I have this case it's ten in the morning you know can you come with me it's really only take an hour\nYou know ha ha ha so yeah exactly I'm sure are on\nYou know he's very creative right so I said oh okay you know I guess I can go for a couple of hours so we go to his home it's just you know little ranch style house and we we get there and if that's meant to guys they're one of their just what really rough and tumble is you know and this one guy you know like run I think his name was moose and the\nBig big guy covered in tattoos and we just tried it you know just\nOverwhelming right to sit there and so was

telling all these things they kept saying I think it's a little girl and I'm\nLike okay well let's see what we can pick up so after a few minutes I'm thinking oh dear God this is not a little girl I could feel that you know a spirit of a man very angry I'm very trying to get his message through and I thought wow you know this isn't meant no it's not and he was getting adamant that\nYou know it wasn't and I talked to\nUse them brings us out of the house and now I'm thinking jeez what do we get ourselves into right I'm elites run up at the top of the driveway with the guy knows any rags me

morning looking forward to this so tell me about this near death experience\nYeah everybody wants to hear about that I think that's the funniest thing because ah I I had cut my ah fingers off on a table saw and\nWatch yeah well you know anyways\nUh I went to the hospital and they looked at it and they really couldn't do anything at that time so that they cannot wrap them up and nice and and kept me in the emergency room until they could bring a specialist on six and a half hours later they put them all back together and ah you know that was fine but during the night um\nMy doctor came up to see me and she realized something was wrong even though I I I thought I felt fine and she called me and for a CAT scan actually had to bring the the woman in hospitals nobody at that time\nAnd they realized they had a blue Murray embolism\nAnd from then on things began to happen in a while Louis is all going on I had\nWhat I Believe was a near death experience and it's not like the the usual when Jay here and and that's it was I was just basically in a different place it was extremely bright white I guess it's the best way to describe it in and uh they were uh\nPeople their figures anyways I couldn't really see any features or anything but they also white and ah [noise]\nThe weird thing about it is also there was what I thought was it sounds really ... music it had that\nSame type thing and\nUh also it it felt a\nAnd there's a line in the Madonna song like a proud that I always quote and that is it felt like home was very comfortable it was very warm and then the whole
