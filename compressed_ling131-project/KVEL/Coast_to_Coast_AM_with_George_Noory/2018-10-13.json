also an expert on hunting and homes and businesses psychic ability good goals such a spirit guide as well and we're tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks jurors for having me back on your show the fifth time and a big hello everybody around are beautiful planets\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring a ghost since spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that individual and the media have a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about all things supernatural\nA good and evil are also in tradition um it's harvest time and uh in the tradition of that that\nThere's a veil of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing is\nThat I deal with half and all the time and um but the media pay more attention to it this time of year\nAnd that's fine anytime we talk about it and get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever do you think demonic spirits and we'll get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirits him something to do with that\nDefinitely ah we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nAnd this is a huge target for demonic spirits and also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people\nThat have power\nAnd and changed the world for good or for ill\nAnd uh I think that there's never been a\nTime in our history where demons have a greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get your take Jeffrey ... is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that the counterpart of angels\nThere that powerful they are not regular people who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they're very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical\nSpirit it could be said that there was a counter part of angels there that powerful they are not regular people who have died just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they are very involved and may have not\nEver lived in the physical realm or not have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect physical reality and also the minds\nOf individuals' a very easily\nAnd uh we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people\nIt's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that are under the attack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits and ah\nDemonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical round\nFrom the non physical route and actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit in a negative spirit also demonic spirits are are much better\nEquipped to ah influence people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can't see them and tell a path to fully trans for information\nInto our system or emotional systems make us angry at each other\nOther people at our cells get us to do things we would not normally do and we can see them we don't know that there are there\nSee that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many demonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as ego I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist\nYup and it's also true of spirits it's also true that\nA demonic spirits ah can change you know once\nThey were you know positive spirits and their ego God's for them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack\nAre so many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits and all spirits\nDo not have forced boxes they communicate George ... ethically and we all communicate ... ethically it's kind of like a river that\nTravels underneath our consciousness and they communicate on that level and they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in\nAnd it's also very common and uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people are not all of violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits\nBut they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sort negative spirits people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative thing is when they were alive and continue to do negative things demonic spirits are very powerful and it's an exorcist when I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's you they can they can come and get you\n... and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect it when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes and get a feeling is negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking for it or that the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work\nForty seven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked or successfully a few times for short duration and it's very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form at a moment's notice\nDid you see them I can you see I was\nBorn with the ability to see spirits I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school and grade school I thought I saw spirits in the classroom some were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them with their school\nWork in the summer are looking at me like how can you see me what are you doing I don't like this and these are the ones I had to watch out for and they actually come and start walking towards me in the classroom and I was very uncomfortable\nAren't stay with us Jeffrey we're going to get a break and we're gonna come back and talk more about the demonic spirits where do they come from what

we'll take calls next to our as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a\nNatural human\nHumans they want nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so are they attack\nChildren in their cribs ... attack people at work\nThey attack everybody we all have targets on her back and we need to realize that uh we can see them but they can see us degenerate negative emotional energy if they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand\nWhat they're trying to do they don't want us to know that there were there they want us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that in Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but the reality is\nIs that they are around the spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them\nAnd they communicated with us tell a path to be the end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy a business and you destroy a person's ability to make money destroy their family\nDestroy their lives\nAnd also ... to change or the way we think about each other right now they have us at each other's throats right wherever they want us\nTo do ...\nAnd we have to stop it and there's there are ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story everybody I've talked to has some kind of story of uh being in a home apartment condo a party a bar in a pub any ... any place\nWhere they've seen or felt something strange they're picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can\nInfluence this by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying are feeling\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not normally do that\nAnd so when we're angry that's when they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them or they don't\nKnow that they're there they may not leaving them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death from something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not most spirits are good summer not\nAnd so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue to hang around our world and\nGet us to do things he would not normally do demonic spirits are\nJust experts at it they have weapons they have devices that they make a lot of non physical energy is just like spirits do spirits change their forms like our our parents die at an old age or something they can immediately change and\nAnd he just to do things we would not normally do demonic spirits are\nJust experts added they have weapons they have devices that they make off of nonsensical energy is just like spirits do spirits change their forms like our our parents die as an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating\nAnd thinking about generating a form of what they want it to look like and also generating close because most people do not see\nMaking spirits so all these things are generated on a non physical level emotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well so demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred and rage\nWe think it's our own but it's not always completely our own\nOr the under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular spirit in charge of all negative spirits I ... the the minor spirits are kind of like criminals they really don't even get along with each other they don't trust each other\nThey most often work alone but that's not always rural or they do work in groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this\nUh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time\nWorking on individuals and families getting them to fight or getting people to fight with each other or getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify what would normally be a small amount of anger into complete\nRage and very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them is an incredible and we just don't see it\nComing on I Know that when I've been attacked personally uh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light all come out on an attack I pull out my nonsensical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on but everybody's not so fortunate that they can see them and know that they're coming\nAnd so there are around us and we don't know it around us that work and at home also negative spirit you know and negative spirits can work for them essentially and and sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not\nAre also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die\nAll the time and lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so essentially the entire human race right now is under attack\nBy negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier may not have ever lived in the physical realm\nOr for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred enraged and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura\nAnd to get us to react to they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially kill a child in the cradle he had no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought\nIt was horrible they have they just hate humans and so they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves and then our world\nRight now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize\nThat we need to protect ourselves from this we need to stop being so angry with each other because we're being used\n\n\nIn this hour on the American running ... miles\nOf the Trump disappearing crowded

questions I have some issues I didn't catch the beginning of the program and I'm not sure where you're from but I Am up in Minnesota and\nI have had a problem I created when I was back in the marine corps a prior to the war um after I went through that what happened often ... followed me as it said it would and I've lost\nTwo families or Twenty years worth of families I I'm a dedicated\nMan and I met the bottom of the barrel at the moment and I've tried cleansing my house was stage and everything else um I mean I've I've I've done everything I've talked to some of the the best people George has had on his show I mean\nAnd I'm I'm not getting anywhere you have any recommendations that I might not have heard of yet\nOh definitely give me a a call or email me certainly sage loosen up emotional energy it loses up negative emotional energy soldiers Franken sense coal there's many substances that worked very very well loosening up\nEnergy is kind of like spring something on the wall to get something off of it\nDoes in the long run of the home\nSee that's the problem is is that stage will release it\nYou know out into the atmosphere but it will not moving from your home will not removed from your living environment it has to be actually pushed down\nInto the earth and away from the property in order for it to be removed because essentially what I think that's going on here to Jay Z you've been releasing it by doing these you know really positive things stage\nSense all of these things you know I recommend them certainly but we're releasing them into the atmosphere there's still have to be released from and pushed out from the home in order for them to be out of your life and I think what's going on is that it's just accumulated a to the point where it's all around you\nAnd you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home and this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things\nYou know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work\nIn to some extent but emotional energy in negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kind of like you know\nOut of your home and this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things you know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work\nAnd to some extent but emotional energy in negative spirits and all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kind of like you know taking the grooming pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a dust pan\nYet the you know a broom and get it in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening\nAll right thanks for them now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy Jeffrey\nPeople generate both positive and a ... a negative emotional energy is from the very first day that were born shortage\nAnd these things can become trapped in our bodies energy feels also known as the or ah but the orders not just a bunch of pretty light it is who we are it's part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems\nHave an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is our spirit or maybe three or four feet\nOutside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped over a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue\nSo emotional energy this negative that we generate can be trapped in our bodies energy fields and we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's home I'm watching a television uh you know\nA pub just every place there is a motion of energy and our bodies energy fields have we don't protect ourselves and most people don't that it actually permeates into our energy field and mixes with our own emotional energy\nPositive and negative and causes habit and this is one of the biggest problems that people will call me have it's not always just demonic spirits the idea is is that we are filled\nFull of emotional energy not a positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we only let go of what we want to let go\nAnd so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy and negative emotional energy is something that uh people want to release\nThey feel a hundred percent better when it's natural let's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show Jerry go ahead\nYeah George or I guess what I'm a student at the original language of the scripture and I'm actually writing a book called that we really know Scott is\nAnd I know he's a Bible in Nineteen eighty six week I've dealt with a lot of the party a scene and I was going to ask\nYou Jeffrey are you a Christian\nI don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in God\nI also think that ah the argument over creationist a series and a true scientific physical theories as ridiculous they both work hand in hand first prince will is creation spirits don't just sit around them clouds and do and do nothing\nHigher spirits angels God you know they create almost like a bad or of a cake\nOn a non physical level the design of the universe and then comes the physical so that non physical\nProceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen as the universe created absolutely but also the big bang theory why not so it's essentially like I said like baking a cake you know that spirit guide angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating and designing these things perpetually right now as we speak not just the beginning of time but right now and that filters up it's connected with the physical all things physical so each person has to levels\nOf physical body which is very finite sixty eighty years or Fifteen Years or whatever and our spirit which is completely a turtle enter personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that or not you have but I mean that is\nBeing fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with I'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially so I Believe in all of this is science to me you know and I think that you know God has a personality\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits out there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked Christians all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think when you're doing is marvelous you know I I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation and needless argument between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to a jury you know the question going during\nA yeah what I was gonna say is you're talking about religion religion teaches at ... and the guy go to church give your money do this don't do that that's not room got\nThe problem is is that we have many ministers out there that teach\nUh this type of stuff and basically they make money off the guy the problem is with this with this whole scenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know this\nYou got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion it's it is it's the relationship between you and God now why is that\nWell to be an arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus is title is Jesus\nIs Lord Jesus Christ lord needs dia de Jesus means humanity in crisis means anointed one\nOkay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on this earth insect\nIn fact Peter said that I'm a ... that God is no respect or a person so we're all in the same boat it no matter how much knowledge we know we're all in the same boat with God\nBecause we have is the nature because we're we're born in stand because of Adam's then because we carry out and then ah our entire life we we are and and even Paul said there's that that none of us are the glory of God we were all in the same boat\nThose demons seem to be every where we're going to come back a dig holes in a moment on the coast to coast am\n... the new version of the ... he a map is no

California is with us hey Thomas\nCharge thank you for taking my call sir and Jeffrey\nGreat work that you're doing Jeffrey my question is about war and the battle field and war sounds how tell us\nMilitary personnel men and women\nIn a battle situation protect themselves from the Monica fault I'm not talking about just battling insurgents physically but there must be a lot of demonic energies in a war time\nBattlefield situation and you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI Do I was in the air force myself many years ago um and especially there are message throughout rules on the other side of emotional energy\nThat we all generate and and as a in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear and there's killing going on and so it certainly is a a place where negative fares are attracted to demonic spirits negative spirits as well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up and strengthen our energy field there are methods\nThere are rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves\nTo protect us from the facts\nThat negative energy that is generated by other people\nFear around us were just natural and the battle situation\nUh emotional energy that just you know so intense on the battlefield there are multiple layers that can be applied that actually work so that negative energy actually bounces off of us\nThis is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know uh you know just about me the idea is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves in the military you just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple\nAnd it can take the stuff I designed over the years with the help of my spirit guide can be brought up in five or ten seconds you need it fast\nKnow the old style was doing things tend to minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening I read all that stuff when I go to the service ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we didn't we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us we need to be able to bring up our protection systems and mediate Lee in order to deflect negative emotional energy or this being generated by the enemy\nPeople around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere and feed off of their killing and and also off\nAble to bring up our protection systems immediately in order to deflect negative emotional energy or this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also uh off the fear\nAnd you know I think that it's very important that we all learn that this kind of thing and it's a science it's not a religion would I what I'm involved\nIn is not religion I Would not even to say is really metaphysical is non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say\nScientists to not call me up and argue with me they are right ideals non physical science which is essentially is the non physical part of our body are emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body\nThat is susceptible to attack\nAnd also negative emotional energy by negative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad and scary situations\nHave you seen demons attacks businesses and why did they do that\nThey do it in order to destroy a person's life hack the fabric of the family in the best way to do it is to pull out the resources money George to get it out if they destroyed a business\nAnd they have a two fold thing going on and they have people that are fired that have to look for a job\nIt can cause arguments at home it can cause people to lose their place\nOr where they live all sorts of problems that can cause them to feel bad and actually react\nSometimes violet Lee\nAnd also it has an effect upon the actual business environment we're now you have the field business I think of most restaurants they fail within a year\nSo restaurant after restaurant comes in or business after business comes in and you have problems of field dismisses and that has an accumulation of emotional energy as well\nPlus you have all the people working or who don't necessarily get along as kind of like our our second family we're a family at home and we have our family at work and everybody doesn't get along\nAnd so essentially we have a lot of emotional energy people at work were sitting at their desks and maybe thinking I really hated here when they're doing that they're generating emotional energy\nAnd it can it can be positive or negative emotional energy but sometimes it's negative accumulates in the environment this also attracts some negative spirits and demonic spirits because if they can get somebody fired by you know doing or saying something\nUh you know inappropriate or\nA you know simply not doing their job or she'll be destroying the business itself by making of a the business atmosphere very uncomfortable emotionally everybody's got a story about walking into a living environment a pub\nOr a business or restaurant and saying you know what this place doesn't feel right what's they're picking up on George is emotional energy\nWhether it be good or bad that's emotional energy they're picking up on\nEverybody has the story of that this place doesn't feel right is emotional energy and the needs to be cleared out so they attack businesses because\nThey can actually make a business failed you might have two hundred or two thousand people out of work and now they're really unhappy they go home and there are arguments with their significant others with their kids\nAnd a and then it just snowballs\nNext up let's go to the Monique in sun ... son ... California Hi Monique go ahead\nI get worried I'm way that twenty eight million that guy to hack\nDid they say that all you got you on oh I Can't stand out here in town\nAnd I had a couple of questions that first one is regarding um mental illness schizophrenia now obviously there is a scientific reason behind it however\nWell they say that people with fish in there and Ari soon spirit turning around and I find it very interesting that sound and the fact you're in part a lot about seeing God he's yes and then and now they're\nSide will talk about demonic spirit here that nice first question the second question is I've been seeing number on the clock and addresses a triple number for a while to Oregon had\nUm multiple gas talk about these annual numbers and your again said how do you know that it's not coming from I didn't mind that it works in most here say on now like it's a big thing that I like now I'm ... now and then if you think that it is possible that\nI'm negative here it can come through you know by um ... and then it makes you question\nWell Monique are\nVery powerful negative spirits can affect people on a physical level that's very sad but it's also very true\nThey can actually hurt people physically it does happen I myself had been attacked you know I I deal with this stuff every day but you know I'd been attacked or you know when I'm not looking

be here a few more years and um\nBut as time was it was time for him to go sadly and I'm going to miss miss in the early\n... there somewhere you know that he's here with us now yep absolutely tell me about the watchers\nThe watchers incredible story very much very controversial of course there's a wide range of of viewpoints on the watchers ranging from the third demons they're evil they're controlling us people want to know\nA while what why are they here and and and what are they doing a why are they interfering with humanity and people actually blame the watchers first humanities ills and\nThat's one very definite point of view but then the other point of view is that they were here they came from the heavenly route from the rump called sigh\nOdd according to the Bible the location of God's throne they're dispatched to earth in order to bring a new teaching to humanity a teaching about how humans can transform into angels and make the journey from the earthly around to the heavenly realm of sigh on it it seems that that what's happened\nIn the intervening centuries and by the way it was the watchers were briefly mentioned in the Old Testament and the book of genesis and that it's the scenes about a hundred and fifty years before Jesus all of a sudden there's this rise of astounding what's known as apocalyptic material developed\nBy the ... the idea scenes apocalyptic simply means that a human man is in contact with an otherworldly being a supernatural being angelic being maybe even an extraterrestrial some people's view who delivers knowledge about\nAnother supernatural world and this then became an explosion of of knowledge about the watchers and the ability of humans to cross over what the church considers a forbidden boundary between flash\nAnd light between spirit and flash\nNow these scenes did they not right to did see squirrels as well\nThat's exactly right the scenes there's no question that that after the destruction of the temple of Solomon and eighty Seventy when the scenes were attacked the Roman army came into\nInto Jerusalem into gala lady a scene bundled up their sacred tax which there were many hit them in caves and they were last until Nineteen forty seven when they were were rediscovered and this is when modern consciousness really begins to [noise] to understand the full story of the watchers\nThe watchers are the angelic ... realm are they from\nTwo schools of thought there's some that believe that they're simply and only human beings ancient pagan royalty existed maybe going back to the time even before the flood and the that they were able to survive the flooding that continued with new bloodlines after the time of the flood\nThe second point is that they are and this comes from the Bible as well as the dead sea scrolls that they are celestial beings light\nBeing ephemeral beings who had the ability to phase into physical manifestation they could take flesh and blood bodies and face back and forth by the way between flesh and blood and their their light being status and then infiltrated human affairs\nThat sounds to me William\nThey are and this is where it gets kind of disturbing because as you think it began to research the watchers it's you're presented with a crossroads you're either going to take the tack that they are purely evil and their demonic as many people do\nAnd if you take that path it's going to lead you down to the path where you're following their offspring who are called them to feel them as these giant being with the Longate ... in this whole axis of research\nAs you think it began to research the watchers it's you're presented with a crossroads you're either going to take the tack that they are purely evil and their demonic as many people do\nAnd if you take that path it's going to lead you down to the path where you're following their offspring who recalled than to feel them as these giant beings with the ... and and this whole axis of research which is very interesting but if you're following that path\nChances are you are not probing deeply behind the tax and into the tax left by the scenes in your realizing that at the seams themselves were utilizing\nAncient tax in teaching that they are developed and synthesize from ancient Babylon Egypt Iran Iraq the teachings of the address that were centered on how do we contact\nThe watchers one and two how do we transform ourselves into angels and in fact this is what the Dead Sea scrolls are all about is this is seen this group of the scenes Jewish mistakes a hundred and fifty years\nBefore the time of Jesus who were utilizing these teachings to congregate with the angels the holy ones the angels of the lord the watchers and work transforming their bodies into\nLight in other words into angels\n... which of course in the book of genesis to me either fallen angel I'm not sure what do you think\nI don't think so because when you look at the at a mile or G. of ... the meaning of the word ... it's far\nFar from established fact the term fallen angel is ... means that they're evil beings or that they are being who were\nAre somehow demonic they their fallen because they came out of the higher vibration or if you will have an ally realms and took human bodies that is their great sin\nThey crossed what the church establishment views as a forbidden boundary you're not allowed to cross over from flesh into spirit with out\nGod's permission and this is the whole crux of the question did the watchers when they\nDescended from the heavenly realms and took on physicality ...\n\nAgainst the will of God and that that's going to determine your whole viewpoint about the watchers and what happened was that early church fathers based on some of the work of the scenes and others simply decided that they were\nDemonic being that they were a\nPowers that were beyond human control and certain humans began teaching that we need to avoid the watchers at all cost do not seek to transform yourself into an angel without God's permission because in order to actually what the church terms is a sand or experienced the rapture you have to be invited by\nGod and that's the great crossing a line that the watchers transcended are crossed over and came to teach humans and how to do how to turn into angels\nWilliam in your book to watch is you do talk about a luminous cloud were gods rude on them to me it sounds like the heels we'll it sounds kind of you and foolish doesn't it\nAbsolutely I mean in in the New Testament the Greek word for clouds isn't to feel which is the world where we get the word and the feeling from and so these are cloud riders and when you as I did in my book and in the watchers book I collected various examples of Judeo Judeo Christian art that shows the watchers including a Jesus\nRiding upon cloud vehicles luminous clouds are literally levitating on these clouds\nAnd what we learn is that this cloud is actually a symbol\nFor their ascension buddy their light oddity it's it's not a hardware UFO like a a flying Toyota it's actually an organic light vehicle that is produced by the human body and it enables them to travel entered dimensional a and throughout the cosmos\nArgue with William Henry whose latest work the watchers and of course we're going to get into many things that he is an investigative miss all it just goes after these gone a visited us spiritual or\nSpiritual first who had the ability to phase into physicality and their\nBodies are described actually as fluid they can virtually instantly according to the stories transform from their acquiesce adaptable kind of a fluid shape into physicality they can even turn invisible\nAnd this is what we we discover and in some of the ... tax as well as in the dead sea scrolls where there were they're describing looking at these luminous beings who are radiating rainbow light\nWho their bodies are described as full of eyes they're covered with others and they have certain team type faces and when you add all this description together it precisely matches what the Tibetans describe as the\nRainbow body of light in the Tibetan great perfection tradition they believe that humans can morph into a light body that they describe that what they tell us that are the the\nOur body the frequency of our body can be accelerated until it dissolves into five color rainbow light leaving behind only hair toe in fingernails that have no nerves to be transmitted the watchers could do this and I believe that the the Tibetan great perfection tradition originates with the watchers\nAnd so these watchers could could step down their frequency in a way to enter into the earth plain tuna or tone down their frequency manifest in physical form and then face back into their non physical light being for well\n\n\n\n[noise]\nIt was just hours for town hall dot com casts a sauce officers supporters Ohio to vote Republican and the number six in the term

a complicated hierarchical system that\nWorks its way down or up depending on how you look at it to a root zone where the where the core information is for much everything else close fourth fifth twenty ten that has been protected\nBy a a a cryptic graphic system with a key that's been the same twenty cats so they decided finally time to change that he was there a danger we could have gone down today well it\nIs in fact the the change over had been delayed for for I think about a year because there were concerns that the the thing about the security\nSystem has not been widely deployed to end users it's mostly the guy you have and and big corporations and things like that it's gradually spreading more so there were concerns that not everybody especially not all of the all the ISPs with fairly have made the right preparations for this there could be disruptive\nBut it was very carefully planned out in practice what happens is they they did the roll over\nA yesterday yesterday afternoon I guess yeah there were I guess if you're a little glitch as here and there but they were ready for that\nThey uh they fix them and as everybody can tell the Internet is still having

a big hello to everybody around are beautiful planet\nSuper you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring up ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that\nIndividuals in the media have a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about all things supernatural a good and evil\nOr also and tradition um it's harvest time and ah in the ... tradition of that that\nThere is a veil of of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but these things is\nThat I deal with happen all the time and um but the media pay more attention to it this time of year and that's fine any time we talk about it\nAnd get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever using demonic spirit you will get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where you're strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of main green about certain things do you think demonic spirit ... something to do with that\nDefinitely ah we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nAnd this is a huge target for demonic spirits and also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people\nThat have power\nAnd can change the world for good or for ill\nAnd uh I think that there's never been a time in our history\nWhere demons have a greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think just to ... to take Jeffrey ... is a demonic spirit in your opinion\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that there was a counterpart of angels\nThere that powerful they are not regular people who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they're very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm\nOr not to have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect\nPhysical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily\nAnd uh we're not looking out for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people\nIt's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that are under the attack of ah demonic spirits negative spirits and ah\nDemonic spirits are\nAre able to reach in to the physical round\nFrom the non physical route and actually produce physical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit and a negative spirit also demonic spirits are are much better\nEquipped to uh influenced people on a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can see them and tell a path ethically trends for information\nInto our system or emotional systems make us angry at each other\nOther people at ourselves get us to do things we would not normally do and we can't see them we don't know that there are there\nSee that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many\nDemonic spirits are ones were good and there is such a thing as you go I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirits it's also true that demonic spirits ah can change you know once\nThey were you know positive experience in their ego God's for them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack\nAre so many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits on all spirits do not have voiced boxes they communicate George ... ethically and we all communicate ...\nKind of like a river that underneath our\nConsciousness and they communicate on that level\nAnd they whisper to us maybe at night maybe in the day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in and it's also very common and uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people are not all a violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits\nBut they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sort negative spirits people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative thing is when they were alive and continue to do negative things demonic spirits are very powerful and as an exorcist when I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's you know they can they can come and get you\n... and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect it when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative thing\nIncredibly intuitive and takes just minutes to set up their no contractors season twenty four seven monitoring is only fourteen Ninety

we'll take calls next to our as well before we get in the open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a\nNatural human humans they\nWant nothing from us so many people have come to me over the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so are they attack\nChildren in their cribs ... attack people at work\nThey attack everybody we all have targets on our back and we need to realize that uh we can see them but they can see us degenerate negative emotional energy if they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand\nWhat they're trying to do they don't want us to know that there were there they want us to think that if a Hollywood myth or something like that in Hollywood makes great movies no problem with that but the reality is is that they are around the spirits are around us all the time we just can't see them\nAnd they communicate with us tell a path at the end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family to destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy your business and you destroy a person's\nAbility to make money destroy their family destroy their lives\nAnd also ... change or the way we think\nAbout each other right now they have us at each other's throats right where they want us\nTo do ... and\nWe have to stop it and there's there are ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story everybody I've talked to has some kind of story of a home apartment condo a party a part of any ... any place\nWhere they've seen or felt something strange they're picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can\nInfluence this by essentially getting into our energy fields or emotional systems and amplifying are feeling\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not normally do that\nAnd so when we're angry that's when they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them\nOr they don't know that there are there and they may not leaving them but they are there\nWhere we do things that we would not normally do how many times that people said that I Would not normally do\nThat [noise] and so we're angry that's when they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them\nOr they do\nKnow that there are there and they may not leaving them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not most spirits are good summer not\nAnd so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue to hang around our world and\nYou just do things we would not normally do demonic spirits are\nJust experts added they have weapons they have devices that they make a lot of non physical energy is just like spirits do spirits change their forms\nLike our our parents die as an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by generating\nAnd thinking about generating a form of what they want it to look like and also generating close because most people do not see\nNaked spirit so all these things are generated on a non physical level emotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well so demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred enrage\nWe think it's our own but it's not always completely are wrong or the under the direction of the double Jeffrey I'm not sure if there's one particular spirit in\nCharge of all negative spirits I ... the minor spirits are kind of like criminals\nThey really don't even get along with each other\nThey don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always the rule uh they do work in groups I have found that to be true in all the decades I've been doing this\nUh but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time\nWorking on individuals and families are getting them to fight uh getting people to fight with each other or getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify what would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage\nAnd very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally uh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light all come out on attack I pull out my nonsensical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody is not so fortunate the vacancy them and know that they're coming\nAnd so there are around us and we don't know it around just working at home also negative spirits you know and and negative spirits can work for them essentially\nAnd and sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not are also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die\nAll the time and lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they'd attack people on a daily basis so essentially the entire human race right now is under attack\nBy negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier may not have ever lived in the physical realm\nOr for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred enraged and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura and to get us to react\nTo they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem\nThey would essentially\nKill a child in the cradle it no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought it was horrible they have they just hate humans\nAnd so they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves and their world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a lot of problems a lot of anger happening right now and we have to realize\nThat we need to protect ourselves from this we need to stop being so angry with each other", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Vernal", "day": "13"}
