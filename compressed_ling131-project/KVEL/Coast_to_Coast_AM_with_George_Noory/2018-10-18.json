macabre I mean that the Saudis look you know they're they're very serious over their driver repressive you're nervous about these Middle Eastern countries there are no human rights\nYou know we talk about you know this country waving banners human rights and you know wanting to you know I take a stand against a various countries because there's human rights abuses by\nThe countries in which there are no human rights at all like you know watching federation like China ah and certainly you know the Gulf states led by Saudi\nArabia where beheadings and had shopping and chopping off hands and fingers and\n[laughter] well yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse ah we're probably at it and I think I was about a year ago as we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab\nWhich is now sitting officially in about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still there's a lot of loans that that don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm going to walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school and I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman laws right if the school provides a you know if they if the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans\nA vote what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of or is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy rights are there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair that collects\nMany if not most of your listeners aren't aware of uh is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy rights are there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans\nA fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove specifically for student loans and most uh most blatantly for federal\nStudent loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most option of the consumer protections that I just mentioned\nWhat what if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that the students in the his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nThey get that discounted author student loans [laughter] you know that normal huh\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation or something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless\nYou are making a minimal a annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise] um [noise] that could work\nA ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there but I can tell you that what we have now today\nIs the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen a you know the founding fathers way back in the day\nOr people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants\nOr so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war\nHas the power to raise an army and many other very important powers [noise] ah so the founders you know are they required bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student\nLoan that's all they were going to take calls next hour with Alan and those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loans scam give me that definition Allen\n[noise] sure oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the\nLenders for the bar or to fail to be able to repay the loan in other words to default on the loan\nThey wanted to default nope that's\nRight if it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead lots of defining hallmark of a predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the services and the guarantee tours\nAre often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than a loan the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where your credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default\nA but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled the borrower to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they got a sixteen ... percent commission right off\nThe wild [noise] so\nYou know where they can make say three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for service you know healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation\nAnd so the financial incentives that under ... ... a federal student loans system are just completely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nSnowy spleen to process the Fulton loan in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of\nAnd by any means so a student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default what happens\nSure that's a that's a good case a good easy numbers to start with so a fifty thousand dollar student loan when the student graduates let's say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years\nUh they're unable to make payments they\nLose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment\n[noise] um the student can expect to learn to be thrown into default\nSo the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably default it's somewhere around ... let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars what with penalties and fees and capitalize interests that are slapped onto that loan very quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty twenty\nFive years in the bottle or is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment in fall for roughly ... let's say a hundred and twenty five or so a thousand\nDollars oh my God so what the\nBorrower what the lending system will do will say oh you're into falls on your loan\nBig trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you fired from your job if you work in public employment we can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nIt'll be taxed to you something like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or so ultimately they will wind pipes um\nHopefully the government hopes I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments for about a four ten months typically none of those payments go towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents than ...\nThis rehabilitation and at the end of the process they wind up signing for much a newer much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars\nWell these agents again is sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or these agents that they compel them to do this alone rehabilitation\nGet a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nSees and the ... in these agents or collection companies well yeah these\nAgents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well on these these companies own servicers they own\nServicers cheese and the ... these agents or collection companies\nWell yeah these agents are typically I'm sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's no there's depends being charged ... says agencies are and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well these\nThese companies own service or they own collection companies and they also own guarantor so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before\nA President Obama show these companies make out like they would rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than a than a loan to remain in good stead and I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there\nTo rehabilitate your own it's a horrible idea or according to Moody's these defaulted loans to rehabilitate they default again three to four\nTimes and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and if you can imagine that hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan default again\nThat happen something like eighty percent of the time that the whole process starts again\nShe stayed with us well let's talk about if there's any recourse here and we'll take calls next hour with Alan calling U.S Coast to coast Dale\nSign up no precocious zone or free email newsletter today at ... dot com [noise]\n[noise]\nHe'd five five nine for nine seven two three four\n[noise]\n\nThomas Jefferson one said there are two ways to conquer and in slavery nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is they will receive a summons\nFrom a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the sun's then they become subject to arrest so in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there\nPeople are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams and and\nAnd forced to ah to come into court that way to deal with their student loans I kid you not\nYou mean if they're not properly served by a process server the sheriff or a private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're saying that can go and get them any way and take them in the ... in in the court\nWell that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly a in just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people\nOr the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was like three thousand dollar loan and they hope this guy in literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until he agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interests in court costs in fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera um that's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know uh the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nLearning with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison a that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy writes ahead of the power to declare war or as an army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse so let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans\nThey all fifty thousand or they want to pay the fifty let's assume that's what they want to do but you're saying because of these defaults the fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that it grows even more\nCan't they just cut a deal on the fifty\n[noise] well um they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it ...\nWhat kind of settled on is that for most\nPeople it's a completely unworkable settlement you know people were having trouble paying on their loans and the ...\nIt all on the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it defaulted\nWhat kind of settled on his own for\nMost people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place\nUh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan went into fault that is free unrealistic for most people [noise] uh so you know the government has got you where do they want you on the student loans they're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org so many years ago\nYou know I had worked in government lending in other areas and and I had never seen anything like that\nOr you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this is the sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nUh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this is happening to will realize that you know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you seeing that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there was about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to a recent revoked suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired a from this public employment and for the case of default student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nDoes this cross part party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what is President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats and Republicans\nAre unfortunately the past say three presidents really has only made the problem worse\nOr under Obama Obama essentially federalized the lending programs so that we're before a bank such as was mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae cetera where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans\nAnd by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five million dollars a year\nWhich is more than any corporation on earth on the lending program now Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before he said why is the government property not student loans\nThis is nonsense you know of all places that the government shouldn't be making a profit\nYou would think student loans would be it\nA and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five you know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the lending system\nWas created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those are those days I'm so unfortunately you know those ... don't Trump's rhetoric was really good\nBut since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him a et cetera so would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy device\nWho herself had stock in struggle and collection companies [noise] ah and you know I I frankly I don't think President Trump has really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds or so I have I hold out some hope\nFor him a but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight you could do a file bankruptcy in a way to students that what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um\nSome of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they tried it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing and we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away and so um\nSo yeah Congress ah ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable what we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening far less than one percent in fact about\nThree tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy is less far less than the average for other loans so there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that\nWe've had to suffer under this big government predatory\nLending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing ... this was a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against the citizens\nWere with Alan Collins is one sided student loan justice done or linked up and goes to goes the dotcom his book is called the student loans game you're on some kind of nationwide tour these days tell me what you're doing\nOh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called HR twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply delete the one line of federal code that make student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings\nSo this really gets to the core of the problem and ah by by getting this bill passed\nA we would immediately see a dramatic\nDecrease in the price of college ah we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality of the job that the government does administering the program\nA so this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nNow in a lot of people would prefer not to have to file bankruptcy they just don't like the stigma is there anything else that we can try to do or get past legislatively to fix some of these student loan issues\nWell absolutely and I agree and nobody wants to file for bankruptcy is a terrible thing to have to do and and even more difficult thing to fight for I should say [noise] ah but it's just the threat of bankruptcy that would really help the lending system but you know there there are a lot of things that we can and should be doing you know as I mentioned earlier President Johnson", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Vernal", "day": "18"}
