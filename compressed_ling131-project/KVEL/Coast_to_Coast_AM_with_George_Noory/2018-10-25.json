believes that we all can heal ourselves with magic can protect ourselves from evil entities or fight against the dark forces allows her to\nHelp others with solutions to empower their lives and here she is on coast to coast gr is a welcome to the show\nWell how George thank you so much for having me on I Am so grateful and honored to have this opportunity to share my information\nAnd you were considered to be a good which aren't you\n[laughter] well I I Hope so [laughter]\nAs opposed to a ban which I guess but no you're you're you're an upbeat person you're you're friendly you care about people absolutely no how did this all started for you how did you get involved in witchcraft well\nYou know I started working with a ... and she's also happens to be of I I consider\nHer to be a very powerful which and\nUm she introduced me to magic and instead of doing the work for me because you know she I feel like her healing um but I I feel like whatever she does with the only just so amazing but instead of doing the work for me\nShe empowered me and taught me how to do it myself so I just you know I\nPicked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest is history I feel very very confident with with what I Do you know with the spell that I've been\nExecuting so that's how I got started it was it was more about healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like I probably don't need a healer because I'm I'm using magic as a form of healing\nHave you ever cast a spell on somebody never\nAnd I want to make that very clear that I Will never ever ever cast a spell to hurt anyone um to try to bring love my way to try to win the lottery [laughter] isn't that what\n... what what what what good are spells that if you can't win anything\nYou know I think that\nThe power of our minds because I have discovered one thing I had discovered with magic is that in\nMy mind is more powerful\nThan I realized so I think that when we start healing on so many different levels that we will be able to tap into unlimited amounts of financial abundance\nAnd spiritual abundance so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will conjure up on my knee spell and work that but right now I've just been focused on doing the\nUm healing and an crossing and reversal\nWhen you talk about magic what do you what are we talking about we're not talking about David Copperfield we're talking about something else are we\nAbsolutely and it can be used by anyone I think people you know use magic every single day with the power of their minds so when I talk about magic I'm simply\nChanting uh spell and when I work my rituals I chat between anywhere between one and two hours I don't just trying to say I really that long I really do I mean I think my neighbor's probably think I'm rehearsing forgive\nMe in a second chance just want to get an idea what you're doing\nUm [noise] well when I exercise my house is kind of fun because you have to put on like the magical persona so I'll say a negative negative beans leave this house like what would you say what is it I Know I Know it I Know it I'm just a little nervous George\nWhat are you nervous for [laughter] they're only talking millions of people write about it because\nI did them and so when I exercise my house because I Do do a house exercises them every single month to keep out the entity than any you know\nOpportunists that happened to be sure crossing by and I will say on negative beans leave this house never to return I cast you out I test you out I kept\nYou out so I Will do that while I'm throwing charge salt water\nAnd the candle and every single corner of my home and really really works and then I'll ward all the windows you know the the ceiling and the floors and everything else so um that's\nFun it's really really fun and then when I when I checked spells like when I Do and crossing rituals which I think everyone should learn how to do and and do it very often\nAnd I know real capable of learning\nAbsolutely I think that we are we have become very lazy and we are we I mean we have given our power away to not ...\nJulie Leslie seal oh to Howard group

calls in just a second with her courses so we're talking about the demonic situation and use it wasn't going well what was happening\nSo I Would point I was pinned down on my bed and then all of a sudden what it felt like hours of course all of a sudden I fell on my ear going up and down I don't know if it was a pall over\nA half foot but it was going up and down\nOn my left ear and so it was really really crazy so at that point it was either fight or flight and I obviously couldn't sleep because I Would tend down\nSo this wave of courage just\nCame over me and I just thought you know I I ... I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just thought and as soon as I I made that adjustment in my mind right I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just\nPeeled off of me and at that moment with my right arm I just swung up like when I went up and I'm not kidding George\nI felt a hairy leg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone\nBut it just like it's flew away obviously\nThat's Ricky it is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't believe me\nBut I did go back to that psychic woman that look like what happened but yeah it's so freaky and I will say it never happened again after that time so I Know that this man some and that human and sent it my way but I did not sleep without the light off for about three months after that\nIt totally terrified me who\n... who is susceptible to demonic possession and and she's ... she's like\nWell you know I'm not going to list the say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail or drunk or sign\nYeah we're going to the ... the cemetery it you know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say that um\nThere is one reason I think that\nMany other were you ever to laugh you don't have a chemical which uh which never capital you\nKnow a which is actually a wise woman so [laughter] that's the definition of a witch but yeah I think you [noise] um\nThat kind of one of the ... that's right [laughter] I Can't do it even if I\nTried 'em so one of the reasons that I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful\nTo many for them to understand I'm considering we all lived thousands of lifetimes on and I'm Glad I haven't remembered any of them um some of these lifetimes we were not the best of\nPeople and um it's very possible that this is my theory that could be wrong but I have proof for my sharman who kind of confirmed um my you know my thoughts about this and it's very possible that some of these people these victims who are experiencing what is known as karma so they can be\nYou know harassed and molested in this lifetime with the demon that they had\nWith in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in his lifetime and the demon the pay is is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I've ever heard of the demon die unless you like slate\nYou cash them out but they don't wanna guard\nExactly there's thousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at Georgia it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demon and what's going to happen when we reincarnate and the demon is going to probably harass him and molest him now that's\nOne one theory and I can say\nI'm with confirmation that it it it's probably very true because my sharman has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days\nHas a lot of cases of the people who are being molested harassed\nAnd just you know possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a shower Monica journey into their past lives and nail it and nine times out of ten these people have made packs with demons or they were maybe a big\nPowerful black which and you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is she just\nBreaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situation and you know the demons or not bothering your neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified sharman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are these dark for she want ... what what do they want when\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity do they feed off such absolutely and I'm\nSadly a lot of black magicians will cast spells against people who they feel they can steal light from [noise] and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and they hooked into us\nHowever they do it and what this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent so\nThis is why it is extremely important as\nSpells against people who they feel they can steal light from and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and the book into us however they do it and what this does it will make their incorrect magic more potent so\nThis is why it is extremely important especially right now um to to really really really really\nClear ourselves on a daily basis and do vanishing rituals prayers and and he'll our our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases of the demon intrusions\nInto people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um manipulate or thoughts\nLet's go to the phones for you know jumping in Redding, California together started aren't ya go ahead\nHi George how are you are good thank you hike at I'm losing my voice so I Hope you can
