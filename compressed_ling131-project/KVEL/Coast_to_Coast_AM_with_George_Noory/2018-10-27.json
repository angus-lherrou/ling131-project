for George Norris tonight who's getting a good weekend off I Hope and doing something fun and ... in in this period just before Halloween that is our focus for both tonight and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night\nLooking forward to a season with the which it's a in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we had a great show but about witchcraft in Salem a couple of months ago but in this case\nUh we'll be talking about it in regard to Halloween and some of the festivities it will be taking place and uh and then also the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nAbout the scariest story you could ever imagine here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true\nAnd also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James\n... have you better know as a sportswriter he writes ah he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the ... he was not in he's not in LA tonight\n... originally we had um scheduled a Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out\nHe wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to finish in after all which is great because in the tradition of like you know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff uh it's a creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night\nOn coast to coast but it won't be any better than tonight will do open lines later on we'll say some of the subjects will get to\nIn the news segment in a minute but but by the way the media of the world series I think we're competing against it right now we're still in in the late innings still tied up unless something changed uh it was a great game\nAnd I don't want to accuse Larry King of being a vampire you know I'm not saying leery of empire\nBut ... ... ... how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to opt load thoughts and dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and you indicated about my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's\nReally about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world uh I tell for example the story of Iran must are being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars devolved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and somebody's also\nGot a finger in this whole nor on that\nOf it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... in labs all over the world uh I tell for example the story of Ilan mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars who's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nGot his finger in this whole neural net of businesses are really the new one of the new hot topics out their\nImagine a ... and ... and ... imagine that's because we're already doing it with mice and in in the very near future um you know it's pretty certain that we are going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think of it as a fisherman is now so you injected into the brain cavity of a mouse\nAnd when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain and then kind of a integrates itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this neuron that has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it\nAnd the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which\nI'm we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that the lawn mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that's that's even better\nBut one of the one of the things that you know on mosquitoes foreseen is a day when with with the use the one of these ... we can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't\nNeed a keyboard or anything like that so I think that is the beginning of\nThe ... of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts are memories are in code them digitally of it's not at all farfetched anymore once you have that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon and so you talk about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nWay way out there right and so it could easily easily a whole\nYou know it's not just a ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a a a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic\nWe can talk about that tonight ... I I think that's\nThe way to go not cryogenic cryogenic is a kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think these other technology is much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know and so and I'm not going to try and see what you said she was ... I think it's fair to say this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward is when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning of the mechanism\nThat's what I'm Talking about when they see the future because what we can do now is the frontier\nBut that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically that's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because you know if we if we take our science fiction movies seriously\nThen we're often reminded what starts off as a really good idea [laughter]\nI can go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\nYou think you think yeah absolutely oh\nNo absolutely and and you're right that this book deals with we're right at the house in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes city and to some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that we we are really at the threshold of these technologies rent are are kind\nOf one foot in the presence and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it it you know if it enables us\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about high in the sky want you know the sweet bind by one day\nNow these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about hey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have a ... that we are creating these are incredible robots artificial intelligence and we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing\nIs the near future but it is it's it's enabling right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I'm reminded of the ... the ... song I'm originally I inevitably come back to an subjects like this um history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla and ... and the the the I think\nThis is where I'm sort of curious about your approaching this because this book is published by a\nA publishing company which is known for being the the east and and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the books that even as you get into there's a larger discussion of\nNot just doing things because we can but because we should do and the arts are really important in there too so\nYou know just because we're on the threshold of doing some things aren't we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision on the implications of when we decide this was remember going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I I have to give him credit it was their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you've been reporting science all your life and I've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this that\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I described all fact based in their ... it's just like you know the old dragnet series\nYou know the facts ma'am right Andrew ...\nThat's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot notes that you can imagine\nOh no it's not ... I've read through to you you're very young you sound very thorough\nThorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so\nHere you're my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um\nI see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence that really spectacular many of them are really in a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous what I think\nThoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence they really spectacular many of them are really in\nA lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous [noise]\nWhat I think we need now because we are at the threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim or great\nAnd so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where our physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started at myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be an\nExport into the wisdom and Buddhism and a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and finally um\nI met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I was interested I like it or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it so I have become a man of\nFaith faith I'm a Christian and I take my age very very seriously and so when I say\nWe need to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist phase system there are some innovations in this book that I think\nWe need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book\nIs uh is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions of what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is like the weather that was through uploading a brain putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate what's the end use for that um other than our own human vanity that we've become immortal\n[noise] yeah I agree with you in and uh I think in another concern or in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now no longer speculative it's actually happening\nIs very expensive um you know never mind trying to achieve immortality through some of the technology let let's talk about some of the technology that is being used to let's say a I'm a help treat macular degeneration I Want to just take that as an example\nThere is such a good way in California right there's a company in California that is um marketing a retinal implants are people who are have macular degeneration under I buy a going away all that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most shirts\nA lot of this technology that that are aimed at improving our how Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving their mortality it's got to be available to the super rich and so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to the dynamics of the society\nWhen you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about and science fiction often be pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the years well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real are really the way acknowledge\nA ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility of there being a human revolution you know we often talk about and science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the years well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now is for people who have been kind of disenfranchised\nUm or marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking and we're taking it as a\nBehind and and and and and we're not going to we're not gonna take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ring or I Know you talk like that do the people in Salem no use in that kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know [laughter]\nWell I figured it's a late night show so\nI'm trying to get all your gun on knowing okay this\nLate but you know nevermind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know outside that the white you said why all of us are [laughter] but um\nBut I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these what they're calling bug out houses rent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world\nOn the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again but one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I Hope some\nI quote former Google engineers in a Google executive or a ... and others\nWho say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay been hanging on ... ... ... lives in this position because yes the idea of having a bug out house right yeah\nThat's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know\nHasn't had that philosophy right you have any ... to ... and yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that belief that doesn't that's not the named Jimmy although I understand your point I I'm\nWorth thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know of what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance\nRight they're done they they they they they ... that was there a moment and the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion to that for example when you talk about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral or leads any way we could\nYou know a ... quantify society hit the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except\nInheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of whom and then if that becomes the ... the plastic perpetuated I Would say again they had their chance this ... ... it has to there has\nTo be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else who's going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from issue well time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no it it it's interesting or by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside\nWhen in fact\nWhen Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and I had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere and the ... at the after party and Jeff loom was there and a bunch of other guys and I went up\nTo ... I said Jeff you know you're always like playing a scientist or not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I said\nSure I I'm just curious I said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up for what he just not just a job and you know he has though [laughter]\nI was appointed in his answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in physics at all and now you know [laughter] but no job for him but yeah it's in ... I ... I Love you bringing that up in\nThe dinosaurs had their chance [noise] it's really an indication of how the earth\nHow the world works how the universe works\nWere designed would work is designed to work exactly yeah and\nYou know you know you're somebody's religious beliefs aside for a moment let's just talk like strictly science sure um ... what what were you learn is that\nOh these species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's a meteor or whether it's a\nA temperature change or or it's a a rampant disease that didn't that I mean you know like the woolly mammoth saber tooth cats and so forth and so on\nAnd the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder\nWhy are we doing here and then I think of what Arthur C Clark one set and it stuck with me he said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I don't even know how long\nYou know and you wonder are we like outsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just to clarify a half\nWith a staff thinking that you know we're going to improve wife the are going to improve the human condition and in fact just the opposite happens we do ourselves in I mean that's a real possibility\nAnd and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said they had their chance maybe some some creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance\nNow he blew it well and now here's an age now let me up a little differently if there was a ... humans killed off species they didn't die out naturally they were killed off\nAs opposed to say evolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow their evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by you know the fact that they you know some giant\nBird in New Zealand lead these really big exits you know human could eat off for three days and so um you know there's going to so I mean I I realize you could make a Darwinian argument for them but I think there are some\nSpecies like some like some there are some tiger whenever that if we cloned that there and brought him back and reentered introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed\nThat he couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles [noise] um but I Do think when we start looking into the future and then we started making all these plans of who's going to beat and who's going to not be\nThat's the one I think you'd get super well do you use the words in your book ominous but I think it goes down then becomes dumb right scary because who is going to be making these decisions once that technology becomes more facile\nAnd right scary because who is going to be making these decisions once that technology becomes more fashionable\n\n\n\n\n... hours from town all dot com crash your sauce and the

that moved the jar you can see the video it's it's in the carousel as we call it the you know the rotating stories of the top of the fold the website of coast to coast to the MTA come watch that before we get\nTo open lines next door I'd love to hear your explanation for it if you think there's kind of a science the one\nYou get to the next hour in the meantime let's pick up this conversation about uh about cyborg too about the idea of blending human physical animal life together um it's not just about splicing it's more than that we'll get to next on coast to coast am this is Ian punt it [noise]\n\n[noise] we got a great feeling story part of Oregon now one of\nThose botanical that is so absolutely so amazing David your guy that has overcome severe issue\nOr what a light the light bulb went on and I started to research on it say Reagan's wife yeah it's a wonderful thing that is bringing me back and it's kind of almost eight years now\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've scientists have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nOr by that they are turning their attention to doing it to human and there's at least one guy in Russia who's been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic ah you know otherwise mentally very alert\nAnd he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig and there are scientists who are over her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so we're once again you know remember I'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart transplant\nSure you remember that a a Jobbik are sure of what was his name Jobbik writer yeah something like that and um everybody\nCringed at all my way way putting that much mechanical heart in a human being and you know I was in South Africa right and you suggest in and and and and\nAnd you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing\nAlthough now you know with stem cell research and other things going on\nA we're even getting past the mechanical heart hey by the way in a you talk about things that give me some pause here's one there are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota and yeah I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but there you are\nNo you know the ... University of Minnesota's a monster recently do you have a huge research you it's a it's an hour one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just it just I don't know why this gives me an article but anyway you have three groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called come era's rude they're sheep\nHuman and pick human come era so these are creatures whose DNA has been knit together using human DNA and sheep DNA or human DNA pick DNA\nAnd they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human hearts for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and neat\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because\nHis kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom ah but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I discuss the book that if you put too much human DNA into the recipe you know so it's always a question too much human DNA\nToo little human DNA then you don't get the human organs\nRight if you put in too much DNA\nThen you can have an animal a creature that thinks like him and that has basically human brain trapped inside of a body of a sheep or a pig I mean these these are the things that are very real now\nOf our ability to tamper with DNA um so that's one of the things that give me give me a little bit later that we really wanted to and what's\nInteresting is that these guys are doing it\nAnd by the way I quote one of the researchers that says yeah that's that's a real possibility that this is not like you know made up the pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this is a possibility\nBut they're doing this research against the wishes of the anti age the national institutes of health which is the government's number one funny body for biological genetic engineering so even an I. H. this kind of very um [noise]\nYeah you know forward thinking funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just push the pause button and decide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines\nFor the guard rails for sure I'm sure these guys are not just to get a violation of the you know you can probably doing it against the advice of the moms and what do you do yeah yeah they don't mind\nThe oh my God it reminds me when I was growing up in east LA and then ... the town over\nAnd I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found on my mom's kitchen and I look back and I'm Out there in the garage at the ... of our how [laughter] making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nYou know the ... I Would filled balloons up with it and then send little insects aloft just to\nSee what happens ethic I was eight in a little mad scientist in the area and\nCreate your own space program against their will right by the way\nGuys that come area you're right the mothers I say why don't you know I write in that already go go play tiddlywinks or something safer\nDalai ... as you mentioned earlier when you mentioned that the uh the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston\nAnd LA you kidding me know so I just don't I didn't have any ...\nAny game three of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like sinking a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz you see the kind of works and so I don't know I guess I guess that means in committed a lot of errors food does it snow let it snow is happening right now still lose two men on top of the fifteenth and we're we'll keep\nAn eye on it so sorry Joe ... but the the island of Dr ... pretty scary it really is but I I I still you know done anything with the technology the people you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm you know we're theory you know what how cold is an outside I don't want to look on windows Siri is it snowing\nYou know or you know Google Books by me soon you know by me some more ten meet whatever in these commercials and everybody's focused on that type of the system I kinda get it but they were just beginning to learn the downs of having a microphone\nConnected um and on monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another it's interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things\nTo worry about it and that's nothing we're bringing about ourselves okay you're a ... if you're absolutely right I tell the\nStory of a little girl in Dallas texas who use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a\nInside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things\nTo worry about and that's your thing we're bringing about ourselves okay you're a ... if\nYou're absolutely right I tell the story of a little girl in Dallas texas\nWho use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by the way you know there's a doll house fancy fancy dollhouse and parents were totally clueless stuffed starts arriving at the house the parents freak out\nBut here's the punch line and you would think that the parents will have learned a lesson and like ditch the echo you know get rid of it uh but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around Alexa now are you\nKidding me I mean that's the take away I mean you know leaders [laughter] yeah I Know\nIt's so big brother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story\nAnd ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing in the line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but but that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made\nBy this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and just now I I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter maybe there in the Saudi constantly they have a they have Google and they had the little theory whenever and they monitor that way\nBut however it happened that kind of the debt that passive listening that is going on that we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our community\nAnd for the security of our country I've just had an op ed that going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S Congress issued a report on Thursday so a saying that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on um a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nBigger than the kind of a refrigerator your dishwasher on everything that's connected\nAll the smart devices that we're talking about the Alex's the the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on ... there are now a more than eight billion\nInternet uh of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese are ... see this as an opportunity to buckets to spy on us and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home\nYou talk about the show the thing in whether that's true or not it's entirely possible and I tell the story in the book of a woman who was murdered I don't want to give away the story but she was murdered in the police started looking into\nThe the situation and the husband was claiming one thing he said there was an intruder and how he came in\nHe killed he killed his wife in the basement and the police started looking at things and they found she was wearing a watch\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the least looked into it his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing these woman wearing a fit with one of these little smart watches that keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the ...\nAnd they found out that they they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walk and it didn't square with the story from the hospital\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is sure that that technology\nOut at the husband he ended up being charged with murder ... this this kind of a Internet of things\nThat are fine on every aspects of our ally that can tell you when you're at sleep when you're awake how many feet you are what your heart rate uh you know if you watch Netflix they they download what you're watching when or how long I mean\nThere this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited on ourselves than we are well these gadgets\nYeah and I like a lot of them I mean I I wear an apple watched by the way they used that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a ... a law and order\nThey download what you're watching when how for how long I mean there\nThat this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited on ourselves then\nWe're well these gadgets yeah and I liked him a lot of them I mean I were an apple launched by the way they used that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a law and order episode last week the exact same thing they\nTook it from the real life oh they do maybe you know they always do you know\n... ... did lead to the uh but that's where I mean I I think that\nThey like to catch a killer is one thing like the ... really good they kind of killer because of the fitness the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection system which\nAccidentally convict somebody who didn't commit the crime I mean that that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having as a humongous database of face prince\nRight uh that they've not covering the young and\nAnd and and they have like an eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate so the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent\nInaccuracy room with which raises the possibility\nThat you and I can have the FBI knocking on our doors because they think we committed a crime based on their data base but the facial recognition technology that they're using to id and could finger culprits it's wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere\nAre saying it's it's more than twenty percent\nAnd so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people are going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA Michael deal in the end of life as we know it let's get to keep who's in Virginia on coast to coast am Keith\nHello can you hear me in a perfectly\nGood ah how are you tonight on my phone turned back up\nTo go and you had a question from Michael\nYes Michael and I heard you are speaking about the ah Jarvis cart\nHave a couple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because of his very experience and service even there was a whistle blower is called and coast to coast and before but uh it'd be great to have them on to tell a story\nAbout a lot of things [noise] um one of the um the predecessors of that artificial heart was a a\nHeart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine and Dr wrestling Nelson or\nWorked on that at the University of Minnesota understand that a sharp a cart was at the University of Utah\nAnd some Thirty years earlier and he and his career as hey heart surgery at some paranormal experience is one of which was a\nWhere he did a surgery that a technique that had never been done before and he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically it's ... or whatever was\nPut right in his mind and he did the surgery or from those instructions said he was able to see in his mind and later\nI got to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so do you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like ... did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah um I heard someone else and by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to it because I knew there were ... we had our time is pressures in I open lines is where that kind of blown so let me go\nTo a Tracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracy\nMichael I got one question for you here where does it and where did you just stop when do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we that's a good question I mean are we playing God yeah and when do we played God is maybe another question but Michael\nWell I think that is the ultimate question that Tracy's asking and uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book um who was actually a a\nMajor participant in and mapping the human genome remembered the human genome\nProject sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president and he said now we have\nDiscovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book and ... and it's a very telling quote\nAnd I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but when it comes to biology we don't know blank\nNow this is a guy who was in the thick of it and this this is directly an answer to Tracy is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about\nAnd and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture a child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with a\nDynamite you know you pick your your your pick your image imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my\nBook whatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you're going to have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one stink or\nThat can really within right there but it was everything else\nBut I think that's the crux two of the playing God premise are we playing God or are we would we cure a disease\nIf the diseases natural it was as God made it natural and yours is hurricanes are we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid this phrase although I Know it's a popular place phrase\nReally that's what I'm saying I just it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really in compass all the ways in which\nYou know when we make better break pad or do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but was that really a matter of playing God I I think it's more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight for the blind with these retinal transplants I I mean\nThat can be said we're playing ... to ... what I like to do is look I when I was a baby\nSeniors I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oil fields on fire yeah totally\nI was I was the first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil fill a ...\nIt's like the blind with these retinal transplant I I mean that can be said we're playing\n... to ... what I like to do is look I\nWhen I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oil fields on fire yeah totally\nI what I was the first television correspond to actually find my way to those oil field or a a oil fields that were on fire and the way I have to get there was through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the a Saudi Arabian\nOil company he knew our way through the mind feels and so that's how I I think of trace this question is\nI see it there I see as navigating a mine field\nAnd you know so far we've been able to avoid a stepping on that one mine that's going to do with them\nBut as we progress with some of the stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous never mind that great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine but I as I say all it takes for us to do is to step on that one mind that won the hidden mine\nAnd it's just gonna blow us up\nOkay remains to be seen I think that will be the end if it if it comes that way but now I Am committed\nOkay so you're the scientist you're the you're the you got the PHD in physics let me just give you what I think is a\nBetter metaphor though for a for science in is he's we had to get you had you know let's say the the goal was the other side of that minefield\n\n\n\n\n\nThis

going back to your guest um I don't get that credit and I are something like that\nWell that's a great question the ghost in the machine\nThat can a rabbi and up tracking here that ... that's ...\nYeah that's an interesting idea I I Would think possession\nYou know generally we talk about possession of the soul so if it's if it's just a ... a machine you know complicated hammer um it would have no soul that it could occupy but then again you talked to other people who say that a inanimate objects\nYou know become the uh uh the resting place or the attach ... place for\nYou know a ... spirits from that will are unwilling to leave an area and so they become attached to a thing\nSo maybe not in Seoul is we would say like there's an instrument possession but who knows you know that's what I Love coast to coast you all are always bringing up never thought of Paula is in Omaha on coast to coast go ahead Paula\nYeah let's say I'm a\nI remember when you're on the gum and what was my drama um [noise] yeah that's\nRight so that was the right now my tonight is yeah when I began\nAnyway anyway um there are people out there that are in this world that really loud and I really really really like\nAnd I think you have any right when are now I\nCame out like two weeks I Walk around [noise] and I I ... and I mean on\nSaturday when I get here are pale\nYeah sounds day in time can you keep you know\nPeople think there is certain people that are so beautiful it's so wonderful and their own lives and it just kills us\nIn a way I think you're one\nWell you're very sweet and I agree with you and I think that morning period after art I think he was just it just\nEven though many people were anticipating that this complication was going to get worse I I think if it you know if you'll pardon the expression I think we all you know lost their breath over then we just do just cut us off guard so\nYeah and I'm Sorry and I I Know that I think I think you have you with us highway\n... and that that's just stay out quick my father is a bright cast oh cool toy\nAnd I grew up and I you know\nI grew up around radio stations trends and ... yeah [laughter] that's good I Would never did that start track that oh I Know that they\nGet fair but I it's just a kid\nThey said oh my God this\nWell it's nice to chat with you I tell me real quickly uh so what kind of see what station did your father worked for a while he\nDon't Cape deal Iran and cats and they were where oh wow I Know\nI think you so much that we should I Would like to I was like to hear that you got a list you have a great night I I've always worked I'm not that ... advance I mean I can handle the little one and probably two oh one of any class about engineering and something like that but I Love\nThis engineers would really know the stuff that's really cool they could just builds up to no nothing I'm All right\nSo that brings me to keep from Virginia is back so he had called the um when we were talking with our guest less an hour and it seemed much more appropriate to have him on here for open lines so\nI'm Glad you called back east so you you had a friend who it was you were telling the story about how it is the surgeon had essentially experience to kind of almost like a scientific revolution but it came into almost sort of divinely\nDelivered where he suddenly knew exactly what to do in this complicated surgery do I get that right\nOh that's correct because I understand it and um that individual by the way and and uh actually I'm back on and sorry for not getting a little bit quicker and smarter with everything but um somebody very topic for either Scott and and they related to some of the things I wanted to say too but\nI'm sure this gentleman Dr wrestling now and uh also had a a he relates experience that of a failure or\nTwice and surgery which his patients died and they were children and they later many years later a visit to him from the spirit world and delivered a message for\nHim to give to their parents and so anyway this individual by the way is the same rough I'm now from that in a at the age of Ninety three\nAfter having been a possible for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints having left his world renowned medical career a became credit to the church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three\nAnd a an amazing man even that they um downhill skier at\nThat age and um [noise] anyhow um what I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy and some other things in which\nThings revealed by the prophet Joseph Smith gave a little bit more and hiding from time to time I hear things our coast to coast am that they're going to be perhaps the connecting and for ... informed that link about paranormal and things from traditional Judeo Christian\nTeaching a that we find them and also in the Bible and and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph ... revealed or haven't revealed to him I should say by a Jesus Christ and many other officers that he had\nProfits and he brought about a lot of\nNew scripture hatred scripture as well as new scripture [noise]\nYep and and we're going to get about thirty more seconds here so go ahead and they\nBasically to wrap it up the turtle man is one concept that he spoke about any caught about and I wondered if you've ever\nAbout a lot of scripture H scripture as well as new scripture [noise]\nYou know and we're going to get about thirty more seconds here so go ahead I said basically\nTo wrap it up to be a turtle man is one that he spoke about any taught about and I wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by Truman Napster and there's a very good Youtube video Joseph Smith and the recovery of eternal man\nBecause a lot of those principles to them lost by you know\nThe the church from the council on some of the scriptures had been lost that that were the base the creek\nWill have to leave that for\nA LDS scholars just short out um but that's interesting and I I I have a lot of friends who were LDS so\nThat'll be conversation over an iced tea coming up splurge have little caffeine or All right so a coming up next our that are more shy next to have a more open line calls will give you all the numbers you need ... wherever you want to take is coming up next on coast to coast am dizzy and [noise]\nThat way they manage forests this\nOne at all the pairs correctly and ended up in a jar container so they're all fishing out towards or so they can get there they were just out of their own man right there\nYeah but the the looting of that but moving of the I mean it really is it's an amazing video in it for people that don't believe in it goes I think you'll enjoy it um but the scissors in depends who the ... in this little cup holder whose district moving around\nAnd it's just it's not I mean you could almost make an argument like maybe the jar was on the slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh\nBut I don't get the thing with the the pencils in the than the scissors so yeah\nBenevolent pulled their guys I'll go with that until it got any other theory to a a back it up mix show is in Wyoming on coast to coast day I'm Michelle\nOh wow Hi faith and I'm Sorry I'm a truck driver I'm not like they're all\nFirst things first first things first if I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but that'd be easier\nI Know I can talk right now for a second look at Ron I'm a first time caller longtime listener and nice to have you\nWhat I was wondering why it's like I was raised as a Catholic and then like I chose to kind of walk away from that and explore other options and other things out there because you know it just I don't know that that's the way I felt inside an when lessening hair gaffe maker I'm closer to when he first got on\nHe was talking about that you know that scientific side of him and then\nThe faith that lady\nTold her to read the Bible and now it's sort of changed his mind on it and it's a Christian so what I was wondering and I don't know how well various jar with religious stuff exactly but I'm a little bit\nLike I ... I Wonder how often when I'm driving down the road and how I can trust the authenticity of the Bible because you know I've often heard that a lot of the major story from it like the story of the ... and the story of um you know like I said\nYou're our hero type figure being one of a virgin and stuff those steroids can be found in like pre biblical text snow like ancient sure as heck from like ... and that alone in it or whatever creature the Bible so\nYou're talking about the you're talking about guilt ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels\nIn the in the guild diminish narrative should the news story [noise] um and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of\nMan God a ... that was birthed by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is just another version of that\nSo the question to me always is not this to me and this is where I think a lot of it in my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up\nBecause I'm not going I'm not trusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the Bible because of how many true it has in it\n[noise] okay there's a there's a difference to me and there are true is that we know to be a worse steering\nBy right there there you you can count you can count on these trades that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good to you you still have to be good to them because it only makes the situation worse\nYou know and so there are a lot of these stories to tell the truth the actual facts of the stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be honest with\nFeel that you know story that can be found in other places\nOr even if they are it's good to you you still have to be good to them because it only makes the situation worse you know and so there are ... and and a lot of these stories to tell the truth the actual facts of these stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be honest\nI've always felt that you know story that can be found in other places they can still trust it sound like the other information on the ...\nWell no here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories\nThere are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who win Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago or the other people started in like I'm\nEmphasizing something from their tradition saying she were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity didn't they started to really promote\nThe things that they said had pre existed that sure whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof that there isn't in the Egyptians there's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but ... in the end does it matter I mean it it do you can you do live your life better\nIt does it improve your life that's the question and I think getting hung up on ... worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science there's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be his book and it's not I don't think [noise] um and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to\nYou know re learn from them every day I'm currently thinking that this is my best answer for you I Hope it gives you something to chew over while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas and\nThere's a long time out here to thing sounds good [laughter] good will be ... be a you know if you're a bad man the gym and you get where you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad you're was the first time I got to be there with you\nUm I go to ah the Justin who's in Texas on coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy hey hey yeah and it's nice to be on my list and that river river actually called and I have you can go in and take it to the left everybody's on the the religious aspect but uh do whatever you want to get to some more scientific stuff\nYeah sure I'm not sure if a lot of people carpet you must interview or he had with Joe Rogan\nAnd I only smoked ...\nYeah they're they're I think there are a little out there but uh I think somebody is uh that logically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot pretty impactful when he says things about like a a guy in a starving addict augmentation and stuff and uh\nI really thought it was a neat metaphor they use than how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around you know we have the ability you know these massive computations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want and all that and he said that you know in the very\nNear future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free\nYou know and uh you\nKnow what would that do maybe to the educational system where we go to school where we just take philosophy classes to learn how to think properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those I think we need more of those no I think I think I think I think philosophy would be we treat that's ... ... yeah I think we treat philosophy as some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built and\nYou know it's just a fine arts credit that people just take\nHalf right because it can do it if it's not that dance you know or something we are just so excited advance\nAnd philosopher you don't have to go [laughter]\nBut you don't see your point on on ... I'm a big believer in uh in his technological ... solutions on big big unseen ability um\nUh the Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed or you know his mental state from over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera\nI I think that reveal much more of the humanness which we don't and we tend to think of most of the lung must has some big giant plot machine\nYeah someday against the whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I I own\nGeniuses are you know I ... that's a very intellectual it always has some kind of inner struggle\nRight and so I'm a I I'm an investor actually in a very small way I'm In a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after that Joe Rogan interview and uh and has recovered mostly\nIn a day or something like that would affect stock well I don't know that\nThough because I in my argument would be that Iran must we I invested in ... mosque mhm right I did in ... I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the sixty minutes interview\nVentures but as a person\nYeah I thought that guy smart he gets it um and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better in the making a lot of money and so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview I'm watching the wheels come off right I Want to\nMake it was a wheel circling and just like watching a Tesla with the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome so I I I think anytime\nThe head of the company like that become so synonymous with the product I think they have to be much more careful about how they live their lives in public that's my feeling on that but but I don't want to take away from him because I Know I agree with you use its own genius\nI think you suppose and stuff a little more on it in ... on public but I mean I think the thought process and everything are pretty consistent whether he was an even read it or not he claims that that's a that's a very\nSoon future you know blame on the Web based in June of Nineteen you know what I mean right not that good but right were mentally getting more tired logically advanced we have robots now and we have all that stuff this could be a thing in the next ten Fifteen Years you know who knows what\n\n[noise]\nNews this hour from town hall darts off off as far as the person is take has been taken into custody in Florida in connection with package\nBombs that were set the high profile critic for the rest of the Justice Department officials without five federal charges against fifty six year old Caesar say August Florida President Trump is president law enforcement for to any of this us back\nAt a White House event the president confirmed that the suspect was in custody calling it an incredible job by law enforcement you strongly condemn the spending of mail bomb\nThese terrorizing acts are despicable and have no place in our country\nThe president said we must never allow political violence to take root in America great collection Washington\nBrother the drop is working to keep the house in Republican hands with a rally for two GOP candidates facing close races in North Carolina the president told the rally the Republican Party didn't use last year's attack on a house Republican baseball practice for political gain\nSupporter Republicans man\n[noise]\n\nMass murder for political because that would have been wrong it would've been the wrong thing to do\nIf somebody would have to park rangers have recovered the bodies of two people who felt eight hundred feet from a popular overlook Yosemite National park ranger Jamie Richard stills K.

Schober where he says the age of ... first born Egypt change or the great flood\nOr Saddam ain't got more around ... innocent children killed there so I mean like\nYeah I can I possibly believing that God like that\nSo you know I guess part of that again comes down to how much are we going to invest in a particular narrative\nAs being the defining story so I accept what you're saying and I think\nDon't get my point wrong about atheists I I I I I Know you're gently chiding me on the on the offending part but let me just say when I say atheist I really mean that in the strictest sense I think a lot of people live their life like there is no God\nAnd then when they go to the to go to church somehow to hedge their bets and they look like they do that and but they never actually it doesn't actually make a change in what they do is all I mean and so\nYou know everybody puts their faith in something let me just put it that way well everybody puts their faith in something would you pay the money put your season sex you put your faith in cars that everything these things are going to make you happy\nAnd some people put their faith in having the perfect body or or that they that they're going to have the perfect career and that's how they build the structure of their life around that that's really what their God little she becomes\n[noise]\nIs it belongs on the coast to coast

Massachusetts again because we had a great show but about witchcraft in Salem a couple of months ago but in this case um we'll be talking about it\nFor both tonight and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night\nLooking forward to a season with the which it's a in our first hour we'll talk about uh about Salem, Massachusetts again because we had a great show but about witchcraft and Salem a couple of months ago but in this case\nUh we'll be talking about in regard to Halloween and some of the festivities it will be taking place and uh and then also the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nAbout the scariest story you could ever imagine here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true\nAnd also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James\n... some of you better know as a sportswriter he writes ah he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the ... he was not in he's not in LA tonight\n... originally we had scheduled a Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out he wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to finish in after all which is great because in the tradition of like\nYou know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff um it's a creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night\nOn coast to coast but it won't be any better than tonight will do open lines later on we'll say some of the subjects will get to in the news segment in a minute but but by the way speaking of the world series I think we're competing against it right now we're still in in the late innings still tied up and then something changed uh it was a great game\nAnd I don't want to accuse Larry King of being a vampire you know I'm not saying Larry the vampire\nYou know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but but you do you how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to load\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know ... and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's\nReally about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak and ... and labs all over the world uh I tell for example the story of Iran must are being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars who's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nGot a finger in this whole neural net a business is a a really the new one of the new hot topics out there\nI imagine a ... and ... and ... imagine that because we're already doing it with mice and in in the very near future um you know ... it's pretty certain that we are going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think of it as a picture minutes now so you injected into the brain cavity of a mouse\nAnd when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain and then kind of a integrates itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this neural net has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it\nAnd the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which\nI'm we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that the lawn mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that that's even better\nBut one of the one of the things that you know on mosques foreseen is a day when we eat with the use the one of these narrow and that we can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't need a\n... or anything like that so I think that is the beginning\nOf the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts\nAre memories are in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore once you have that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will or thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon and so you talk about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nWay way out there right and so easily easily a whole\nYou know it's not just a ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistically\nCan run about that tonight we will I I\nThink that's the way to go not cryogenic liberal\nOut there right and so easily easily\nA whole you know it's not just a ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistically\nCan run about that tonight we will I I think\nThat's the way to go not cryogenic crowd Gen x is a kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it will be but I think these other technology is much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know and so and I'm not going to try and\nPartially what you said to me it's been a I think it's fair to say this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward is when we use terms like thinking about doing or\nYou know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when they see the future because what we can do now is the frontier\nBut that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically that's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because\nYou know the ... if we take our science fiction movies seriously then we're often reminded that starts off as a really good idea [laughter]\nI can go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\nYou think you think yeah absolutely oh I Know absolutely\nAnd and you're right there this book deals with we're right at the house in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes it in to some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that we we are really at the threshold\nOf these technologies Rhett are are\nKind of one foot in the present and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right it you know it enables us if you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about high in the sky\nWant you know the sweet bind by one day now these are things that are now becoming realized and so we can have this kind of discussion about hey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have a ... they we are creating these incredible robots artificial intelligence so we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing\nIs the near future but it is it's ... right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I'm reminded of the the ... song um which I inevitably come back to an subjects like this um history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla and and the the the\nI think this is where I'm sort of curious about your approach in this because this book is published by a a publishing company which is known for being the the east and and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion\nOf not just doing things because we can but because we should do and the arts are really important in there to show\nYou know just because we're on the threshold doing some things aren't we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision on the implications of when we decide yep this is remember going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I I have to give them credit it was their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and I do I love science history\nBecause of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise]\nUm they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you've been reporting science all your life and I've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said yeah I'll do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this that\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I described all fact based in their ... it's just like you know the old dragnet series\nYou know the facts ma'am right Andrew\n... that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot notes if you can imagine\nOh no it's ... I read through to you you're very very thorough yeah\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just serve this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so\nHere here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um I see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence that really spectacular many of them are really in\nA lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous\nWhat I think we need now because we are at this threshold of creating for ourselves a world that can either be grim\nOr great and so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other\nIs to call upon the fruits of human spirituality out for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics math and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how did this universe that I've been studying come to be and\nI explored into wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and [laughter] and finally um\nI met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I thought like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed but it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it is so I have become a man of faith faith I'm a\nChristian and I take my ... my face very very seriously and so when I say we\nNeed to call upon the fruits of human spirituality I'm Talking about ethics morality religion ancient wisdom whatever your faith system is I I don't particularly care even if you're an atheist sets of faith system there are some innovations in this book that I think um\nWe need to reflect on and say okay just because we can do this stuff should we\nMichael dealing former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book\nIs uh is this is great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that base in discussions\nOf what we should and ought to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is like the weather that was through uploading a brain and putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes\nMe question\nWhether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for then what is the ultimate what's the end used for that um other than our own human vanity that we become immortal\nYeah I agree with you and and uh I think in another concern a in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now no longer speculative it's actually happening\nIs very expensive um you know never mind trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let let's talk about some of the technology that is being used to let's say a I'm a help treat macular degeneration I'm going to just pick that as an example\nThere is such a good way in California right as a company\nIn California that is um marketing a retinal implants are people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff cause you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most shards policy so a lot of the technology that that is aimed at improving our how Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving immortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is it going to do to the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people at least\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others that you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about and science fiction often to pick\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now\nIt's for people who have been kind of disenfranchised um are marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking it and they were taking it as a behind\nAnd and and and and we're not going to we're not gonna take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ... do you talk like that to the people in Salem no use that kind of\nI mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know and [laughter]\nYeah well I figured it the late night show so\nI'm trying to get all you're done and now I Know it's\nLate but you know never my regular yeah I got to worry about my wife you know side that the white you said watch out but uh [laughter] but\nUm but I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually a buying these what they're calling bug out houses rent they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world\nOn the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again but when he was stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I Hope some\nI quote former Google engineers and a Google executive uh and and others who say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nOkay even hang on to the ... was ... because yes the idea of having a bug out house right\nYeah that's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know hasn't had that philosophy right it was ... to ... yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that belief that doesn't that's not the same to me although I understand your point\nI'm thinking about I'm reminded of of ah you know of what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park\nWhen he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance right they're done they they ... they ... that was there a moment and the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nI I'm more reminded of of ah you know what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had their chance\nRight they're done they they they they they ... that was there a moment and the fact of bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion to that for example when you think about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral or leads any way we could\nYou know a ... quantify society hit the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except inheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of them\nAnd then if that becomes the ... the plastic perpetuated\nI Would say again they had their chance this ... ... it has to there has\nTo be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else who's going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from age do you well time machine right\nMhm yeah yeah yeah yeah no it it it's interesting or by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside when\nIn fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and I had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere and the ... at the after party and Jeff bloom was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to ... I said Jeff you know you're always like playing a scientist or not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I said sure\nI I'm just curious I said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up for what he does not just a job and you know he has though [laughter] I was at this point it and his answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in\nPhysics at all and now you're [laughter] but no job for him but yeah it ... I ... I Love you bringing that up in\nThe dinosaurs had their chance\n[noise] it's really an indication of how the earth how the world works how the universe works\nWere designed to work is designed to work exactly yeah and\nYou know you know you're somebody's religious beliefs aside for a moment let's just talk like strictly science sure um ... what what were you learn is that\nOh these species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's a meteor or whether it's a\nA temperature change or or it's a a rampant disease that didn't that I'm In you\nKnow like the woolly mammoth saber tooth cats and so forth and so on\nAnd the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book\nYou can't help but wonder why are we doing here and then I think of what Arthur C Clark one set and it stuck with me he said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I don't even know how long do\nYou know and you wonder are we like\nOutsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just being too clever by a half\nWith a staff thinking that you know we're going to improve wife the we're going to improve the human condition and in fact just the opposite happens we do ourselves then I mean that's a real possibility\nAnd and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said they had their chance maybe some some creature in the future we'll look back at us and say yeah oh yeah human beings they had their their chance\nNow he blew it lumped now and now here's an age now let me ... is a little differently if there was a ... humans killed off species they didn't die out naturally they were killed off\nAs opposed to say evolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow their evolutionary cycle that was\nTruncated right by now know the fact that they you know some giant bird in New Zealand lead these really big exit you know human could eat off for three days and so um you know they've done so I mean I I realize you can make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some species like some\nLike some bare earth some tiger whenever that if we cloned that they're in running back and reentered introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed\nThat he couldn't read absorb that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles [noise] um but I Do think when we start looking into the future and then we started making all these plans of\nWho's going to be and who's going to not be that's when I think you'd get super well do you use the words in your book ominous but I think it goes down then becomes done right scary because who is going to be making these decisions once that technology becomes more facile", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Vernal", "day": "27"}
