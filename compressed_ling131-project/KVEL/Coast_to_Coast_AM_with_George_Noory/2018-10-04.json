was traveling I I was traveling into the deep red state of Arkansas uh-huh\nDo ah the ...\nConvention and also\nOn the way a ... I met a lot of really beautiful people from Arkansas and it always strikes me as somebody who\nIs a freewheeling neither blue or red and my ah in my tribal political identity that seems to be polarizing the country as your report said worse than ever before\nUm but when I actually go out of mind blue range into the red range of Americans I meet really decent beautiful people\nWho and I listen to them and I can see so much potential if people would just stop listening to this ratings the rating the horrors of of a mainstream news and just wouldn't talk to each other\nAnd they don't talk anymore John that's no problem nobody they screen they argue but I've\nActually found the people in the red states more willing to talk than I Do the people around me who call themselves progressive [noise]\nAnd I live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington state\nAnd uh it's uh it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together a a this forecast which is the main essay at the end of ten predictions twenty eight team that you just mentioned\nAnd uh I was just reading it again after many months and I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put in is a that\nWas basically it happening is\nA a level of if you're gonna defined it in planets there's two major planets and astrology and political strategy their plate right now one is a is you're honest and just recently come into tours\nAnd then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn Saturn long story short it's a struggle you're honest finds itself in the story and find which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations whereas\nThe the earth the sign of Capricorn\nSaturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short it's it it favors the establishment more than it favors those who are resisting\nThe establishment um because you're on us into horses in its fall and it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least\nComfortable sign that it's transfer the ... through now last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into tourists it ... to ... major changes in political astrology it brought the German the third Reich into being under out of Hitler and its\nSlowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms and Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same time demographics of the of the separation between the fuel all the and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth\nIs almost exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash and so we are repeating a cycle\nAnd uh so the the issue is there you're honest if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in Iran is in the fall the revolutionary the innovator the person with the original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the current situation in the White House and and it is a it is expressing itself with great passion\nAnd unpredictability but its negative it's about destroying from getting the house back\nGetting the Senate back but for what\nIt's not really defining itself is what we know what the resistance is against right here at all every day here because I live in the very heart of it you're\nA but but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if it if you follow this pattern\nWith much more energy to it then it happened before because I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said no Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six I was on a show in Portland\nFive hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man who had a meltdown said you're absolutely crazy that can happen and of course four years later I said well no happening because\nIf you're ... anybody but Bill Clinton you're you're you're you're fundamentally a you don't have anything to replace him except your want to tear them down and then\nAnd it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before\nAt least at least and and it's being I mean it's being the people\nOf this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media news\nThat it it's really quite and this plastic um Iran is confusion and its fall and tourists you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud or something it's a muddy place a swamp the muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays\nSimilarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come and save you from yourself and you know I have been held a long long time first with art and then with a huge orange I've been\nTalking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it is really a hand now it's um it's not going to be when I look at\nWhen I look at the situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where Iran is going retrograde its back going backwards and in the sky which means that it's a time to recollect where you've been and go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving tourists around or just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day and starts backtracking into aries now what that means is that if if red voters threat American voters\nGo to uphold early especially in a lot of the areas which will be in early times\nOn hold on for a second John already at the break we'll come back and we'll talk more about this will get into some of his top ten forecast for this year\nShe how close she's coming and uh also march twenty third you live in Everett, Washington just circle that dates for two thousand Nineteen will tell you about that later to

and names and ah they're all qualified to come on you want a superb workers John ... with us\nAs we talk about process the predictions John we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen productions how many have come true alright\nWell uh there have been a number I'm the more the most shocking and then my my eighth prophecy what I did is basically short um chapters that takes a theme and then looks at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines the ten real quick\nWell yes they they were the the definition of the year being the year of acceleration\nI'd definitely things have intensified that way second prophecy was a you're honest in the last chance sec style that looked at a play between Iran is in Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground but that petered out by\nMay ... and that seemed [laughter] in a way where\nThere was also the third prophecy will Trump be impeached\nOr not in twenty eight team and it looks like that's definitely happening [noise] uh I've always said that both candidates in twenty sixteen were afflicted a astrological we both have the danger of not\nOr if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means leave office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this but that they could leave in scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January so\nAh it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before\nThat the first half the day goes to the red states and the red voters say get out early they vote early\nIndeed is really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots but there is a possibility for a surprise to happen\nIn the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house of representatives will uh see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon\nSo it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see at ... eleventh hour or close to the polls are turned around so with that um\nYou know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I Would simply say about President Trump that if he survives this um these two years he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president\nOh what's what's so hard for the polarized people in my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly watching this and\nTry and taking notes yeah taking off and it's like yeah I mean literally is a large family members and other things are are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm going out [noise]\nUm every everybody watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in the fall and for us uh\nThey're they're they're just watching the news and there's assuming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the little blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats\nThat really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few presidential cycles [noise] I Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until sixth year if he's a two term president according to my interpretation of the astrology they're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states\nI see it's very clear that they're not going to budge\nAlso the other thing that uh once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical vote I said\nA gymnast minister\nI said ten months before Trump was elected I said the the big upset could happen through their\nUm and so it's it's my sense is that there will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving\nIt's almost like it's it's the musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats at the same number of seats just switching back and forth\nAnd in that there's not enough to create any significant legislative advance so it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more\nThis functional than anything we've seen before\nAnd it's almost unbearable now\nWell it's I I hate to say to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not the end of this this this crisis that's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states and the world\nIs just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually\nThink of a way to get out of the margins it's going to have to get much worse and frankly astrology a saying that they're not going to see a a tide shift until the middle of the next decade we're\nWe're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this this prevail\nYet we're not even close it's going to get much worse in what's going to happen was kind of brings me to the issue of Kavanaugh and all this all the fighting about that [noise]\nIs it I said very clearly\nIn my back in August eleventh in my article send that Kevin I Would be picked that um I I think people were stabbed pushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not saying they should be looking at according to their needs\nIf you look at cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think there'll be weighed it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme\nHas a lot but I tell you these this time with the Iran is and Saturn the defining planet so next year and into twenty twenty these these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two\nMajor corporate establishment will to power\nThat you're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote a hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see this creeping coup d'etat of corporate uh hedging money which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's or sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent citizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened\nAnd so it's possible that after twenty twenty\nAnd the American people or more of the working people people start really starting to get riled up about situation a little beep basically in a completely corporate Lee control the United states and so\nThat's that's my call I Hope I'm wrong I Wish I was more [laughter]\nRecently were on the History Channel really you know the so called the last hope in the Catholic Church of course has been under fire for all kinds of atrocities lead it ...\nYeah it was um [noise] it was a unique experience and and it's put me in a position that that show uh I mean to you have to kind of talk about something that happened uh\nFor my own sake of credibility I I'm Sorry I even have to say it but I'm the show\nA shook\nYou're talking about the last ... not young\nYou know it the the the the show basically circled in the second hour around the idea that Cardinal Ratzinger who later became Bennett's ... the sixteenth [noise]", "show_name": "Coast
