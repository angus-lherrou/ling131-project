this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but\nUh we'll also talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of the season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago\nAbout the the Salem witch trials and how historians have been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim I mean it ... it was fascinating go back if you're a member of caused insider and listen for it\nBut coming up next our\nThis is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a a writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer\nOr in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen tonight in Los Angeles we're not competing again\nHe extended game that the Dodgers ended up playing last night uh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game uh but uh but tonight a little different\nUh Bo Sox lead the series now three to one the Dodgers will get another shot at it coming up tomorrow night to send the series back to Boston three to two but but let me just say if it hadn't been for that error I'm In the top of the thirteenth the bottom of the thirteenth yeah\nUh it it would all be over now the boss will be going home with a trophy up at the games over and for those of you that missed the first two hours of last night's show that gives you are following the game or you should to also go back and listen to it through coast insider\nOf life afterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot coms a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun\nAbout eight or a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to a defense\nInsider you'll see more about that about the the tone upon test range in Nevada um and what they have recently uncovered but\nWhat if they did well then you know they would it would become the new Roswell I'm kind of happy with the old role as well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who want you to Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nCan evil so Juanita is the director of public uh\nBut if they did well then you know they were ... would\nBecome the new Raj well I'm going to have you with the old rouse well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nGood evening so ... is the director of public affairs\nFor Roswell I'm and she promote draws well as the traveling and you know as a professional opportunity and people move to Roswell all the\nTime but this time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do if it\nIf Ross was kind of Halloween all year long in a way for some people with the discussion of aliens and invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] um most people go out to grade farm which is a local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the corn ...\nAh the greatest family ah put the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that\nWere supposedly on the UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven or they can get every single year and it's just a great opportunity for people to go out and really try to experience a you know that haunted feeling of getting lost in a\nField like a UFO a crash in Nineteen forty seven other people go out to bottom line is like state park ah which again has and history at the bottom last and and it is out ten miles from Roswell beautiful lake great place to RV camp and things like that but\nI'm more more of the stars and the telescopes and people get dressed up and\nThey feel that they become one or they may come down and uh you know it's just that that theory of there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with them especially around Halloween and during the UFO festival in July\n... so I I I'll be traveling through Roswell I'm I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through rose well on my way to uh my new position will be teaching you to Kansas State and my my older my younger son and I was always wanted to go to Ross well right so we\nWe we mapped out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of her way to dip into the Roswell before we come back up again and seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but\nHow much can people tour when they're out there if anybody were interested in in being able to go to the crash site or ... or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of depression Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the rival on international year from him and Research Center which um is a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the crash I'm definitely what check out the library for those who are really the seekers and do you believe\nA in addition to that we have a UFO tours that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first for over twenty plus\nYears and he will take you to the exact location of the\nTiming of the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year the book or families where the crash occurred allegedly\nThey will take you out to the crash site where a knack for South rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land\nAnd so those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend that people checked out and um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay so when you to use the word allegedly in there which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nOr we you know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the UFO museum uh the locals know who the tourists are because\nThe sticker and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that wind which is a great story I bring your camera take pictures stop in the ... visitor center we have to amazing aliens that we'd decorate a for each holiday especially now for Halloween [laughter]\nPuts on a big fall festival with our police officers and things like that for the community but\nOn these they're about six foot aliens and people like to take pictures with them and you'll hear the story of you know are employers the month his name is Bob and ... and\nUh you know people really come here searching for the truth and we as local we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you can research\nWell that'd be great thank you appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in roads will for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nUm so our population has doubled in size we're we're account about forty eight thousand and especially on the big anniversaries of the festival um you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per year for tourism we hear a little over two hundred and thirty thousand\nVisitors that on the UFO museum and Research Center\nHunting good really good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts a until all of bringing our next guest next but thank you want to you know if I'm if I'm driving through time we get a chance to say hello okay yes\nPleased there thank you honey the Jennings is the uh the ... the director of tourism public affairs in a rural New Mexico\nA season with the which Jay W author\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a J Jody let me just tell you very funny book your sense of humor is really enjoy all the sort of a comic inside on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this decision this is this is a very unusual place in American but it has\nAn even more extraordinary pleased in the timeline of American history that I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people to come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\n[noise] yeah All right other severe about forty thousand usually um they need on our we just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people I'm a middle course long it's been a quarter million so it's a matter of about people for the small city to have to the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea should this is one of my favorite kind of books that should deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked Halloween any shame subjects or it should have you use that as it is\nIt's an a quarter million though the massive amount of people that small city to have that its borders\nWell I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked Halloween in same subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just get a guest a couple of weeks ago\nAbout ... on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views on Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\nA ... that\nThere are other places around the world outside the Salem that had massive hanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that say the first ever which wasn't the last one that was shot and what isn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for the you know the first trial the victim was in Connecticut in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nIt is and it's it's really a problem today even in in the country there's still a winter people being for being with us but the the strange thing about that to me of course the planet that have had this problem and it's pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's still in Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that a season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween\nOn the way um I like to rub zombie story there\nIn the book to and then coming up next our on coast to coast am I'm a truly amazing saga of the most elusive serial killer in American history and you've never heard of that either that's coming up next our coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\nNetworks beautifully owner Richard astro here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system which has held this gentleman's hot perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies fiercest powers to he'll visit C.\nA. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com or call one eight\nSix six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nSo the J W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look at some of those steps that we had mentioned\nMore vaguely two thousand eleven bar do Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt linkage your England\nA long ago turned its ... which is incident in which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw in Sweden which memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy\nFive in Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain\nA whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some\nOf them and did not even all that happened in America but its Salem that sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery of the even that's one of the big question going the book and I think it's a combination of probably doesn't different factors honestly they get Salem as what city one of which of course [laughter] were you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing [laughter]\nYeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it about a dozen another reason why I kind of Seattle grabbed onto that monitor and kind of held on to it it over the course about two centuries\nBut it's kind of you know it's a moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened\nThere but ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually for you to you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home of that crazy trivial killer the famous worlds exposition\nYou don't know did he do go out of their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks [laughter] right\nAnd it's humid for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf the crazy people are treated the famous worlds expedition right you don't know what did he do go on their way to put up signs and it happened here folks\n[laughter] right now he got through and I think to a tourist place or that one is that you know the tragedy in Salem itself was both basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was a civic part of the trials right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations around Salem the actual\nThe actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver's was at the time and sailing village so Salem itself doesn't really have a kind of\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the civic proceedings um\nAnd then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victims but with trials I mean the actual which is I live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... since I was kind of become Halloween count as well so it's a term of which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today in twenty eight team\nYeah it gets it and this is important in a ... great distinction\nCan't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims of murder [laughter] they were executed and they protested their innocence until the end\nAnd there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance\nYou know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath the underneath their floorboards so to speak and part of it that's left connected to the tragedy it's more just around you know a city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and into an Eighteen\nWell go back to many central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] it really is so they\nThey don't celebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically so that they thought it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first in October thirty first um but really lead over into longer than that so if you want to experience Salem\nDon't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year do you want to visit sound Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowds it's a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of Salem itself\nIt's Mardi Gras beads\nIt is it really is um I did talk again a hundred thousand people packed to the small down kind of the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know\nFive or six blocks and you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes the freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff\nSo you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras is a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans Mardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same ... did you get it Mardi Gras in any way but there's probably some amount of alcohol in consumed during this celebration\nOh definitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know cuts\nThat many of them right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween right bruises or part of it like this is within the party\n[noise] okay so that you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean it Salem known for being hunted either Salem witch ... are there are a lot of haunted houses were were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original ceiling trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims you have monsters 'cause of the film was trials didn't just involved which is in the story involves\nDemons and empty and shaped sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass see all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history we're up three hundred and Thirty years of history so that is just you know a lot of people over the centuries\nSo yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening and say on the um the ghost tours there's spooky places there's the other five executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky pathology around the city\nNow you've been here most of these I should say you've been there right you go there so oh yeah all the time out there are two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be you'll situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but it's my fault so I I don't that career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders things a lot of the things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest that that is more in the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest as more just in the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me\nYeah what's the what's the best what's the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured well you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the one that really creepy ones is one of the Boston stream of victims\nHappened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual story or vent that then I can reverberate and have kind of thought around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape prone to jail they're so all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know the cops kind of\nEvents happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch\nTrials it's all that kind of some kind of feed into that kind of a cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm curious you was there an attempt to for him to do like most of the ... or something while he was there\n[noise] no no he was the ... the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was real police station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do and he was in towns are performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know\nEscape as a PR move for his next big event so he wasn't down there doing or if it sounds busing but who is doing is a is a scape escape routine\nLike so um you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into them\nIt's great for my favorite elements of the failure of the city and complete conflict at all times between you know tourists and historians and visitors and residents and the art museum and the witches and the winters have this really strange position where they\nThe story ends and visitors and residents and the art museum and the which is in the winter that this really strange position where they call themselves which is a ... you know do a sincere religion around it but I have to deal with the baggage of you know\n\n\n\nMaybe six hours or Tylenol dot com and a half or saw President Trump has for a live chat\nFederal buildings throughout the United states we fought a tap style in some

Thursday and that's why there are new start TVD yeah\nIt's fun to shop at the highly highly there friday November second hand the Saturday November surfer\nLining up for the holidays than than going on for over forty years and now that there's so many\nThings that you\nThe harder they started I carry it out\nThis year there are five vocation the crossroads community center strata built in Utah State university Research Center and the French government there in about November second and third a dot com\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nMm [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n[noise] I'm nervous but I got my son saw [noise] because I'm I'm a real why don't you know in the\nFall of Bob Bob Bennett\nOff [noise]\n\n[noise] [noise] I Know [noise] they\nBuy from Bob Bob\nBennett a [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nPremier networks presents coast to coast am whiskey in front of you know\nHere's the [noise] you crossed my mind today on whether or not it would be appropriate to not do\nThis show tonight on the book demand from the train discovering most to America's most elusive serial killer and there's a direct comparison to the shooting\nOr this morning up the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh but just rather maybe this is it like to talk about something else\n[noise] but then I decided the book is too good and the story isn't really directly related to that type of shooting that happened today um and I just decided instead to a a opt to give you a thought that I wanted to pass along with all sincerity\nI ... I I just want to make it clear that real life murder is not a parlor game or whenever we speak of murder it's important to remember that the lives lost whether it's one desk whether it's Jack the ripper the Boston Straggler\nWitches of Salem or the most elusive serial killer in American history about which will be talking to night\nThe lives lost represents children who will never see adulthood adults that will never see their children grow young men and women who had their human potential to offer the world taken away truly innocent people who died at the hands of evil\nIn the words of Clint Eastwood in one of my favorite movies uh unforgiving it's a hell of a thing killing them and take away all that he's got an old that he's ever going to have\n[noise] so even as the author of a true crime book myself in a book about how true crime stories or cold and why\nI treat the subject of murder personally the woman that was at the center of my true crime book a black night for the bluegrass belt was the first cousin to my grandmother and a beloved character in my mother's southern family history I wrote that book to set the story straight and defend her on her\nI had read about the first three chapters and then when I heard the both socks made it into the series I I packed the book\nIn my boxes that are heading to Kansas 'cause I'm moving to K state understand you live in Lawrence, Kansas a lot of the ... probably not even on so I'm moving to Manhattan meant to be ... will be like almost neighbors and ...\nYeah my wife up in Manhattan I Know very well and I regard\nYou totally cool so so I packed the book and then I got the call like\nDays that aren't always good to go like uh the book is it something had\nThey had an overnight me a book and I had it in my hand but unfortunately awesome and I lost a few days reading time so I haven't finished yet and I love nothing more than doing an interview on a book I finished reading especially because I can tell already you're building up to a climax than I Do not want to miss with the true story\nOf the the ah the America's most elusive serial killer demand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your your coauthor is your wife Rachel McCarthy James\nAbout quarter and my daughter read don't or my daughter the case or a she worked with me on a book [noise]\nOkay it doesn't specify that's what I did make an assumption I'm Sorry I should have a figure that out I didn't really pay that worked out well I'd probably did somewhere but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say I'm a great book obviously deserves all the accolades that ... that you are getting for it\nAnd the fact that you very likely crack this case um is very much to your credit\nSo I I Want to start\nIf I can with the uh by the way to congratulations on the ... of the red Sox win tonight and what a game last night good thing you weren't book for last night huh\n[laughter] yeah I Would add to cats a lot of time and I would have been to torture people want to have to be going well over here [noise] ah\nBut you and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last the last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\nOh I wouldn't say so they ah I wrote about the Boston Straggler along with hundreds of other crime cases in a book I wrote maybe six or seven years ago called popular crime or I Would I did um\n[noise] uh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took an interest in Boston stronger case and publish some theories about it which may be right or wrong who knows\n[laughter] well I Love that I think I may revisited that 'cause I've always been very interested in as well but the men's on the train is a story it is it just speaks to something I I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and ruled the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said it is there any story too\nOld to be told\nA news when it comes to you know retailing a story about a murder and she said absolutely not\nShe said it doesn't matter how old the story is\nShe said which which best is it's actually\nYou is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that it either been\nIncorrectly adjudicated which we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it\nBut also it's true for all the time that that there'll be there'll be somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed just isn't the case here in the demand from the train\nA series of murders are happening around the country nobody is connecting them yet but in in one at least in one case\nA ... a ... a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up\nBeing killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now with these totally innocent\nThey write their their tip while they're there for people who were extra lovely executed\nFor crimes that may have been committed by the man trying to them I Would go so far as to say I'm fairly certain or the crime was committed by the man from the train but a local person was executed not an ally of\nThe or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure they uh\nUh but there were also nine people nine black people were murdered by a Lynch mob who uh when I was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by right from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight alas that we are pretty sure that was him like I can quote all although there was a ... there's an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say that it sounds\nSo I looked in the I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... or ... Illinois I saw the town where I'm home alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the whole Malone house I'm ... and\n... the mayor\nIn around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town I'm was murdered along with his wife in their home\nIn a crime that was never solved do they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah\nAnd it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of into the sort of thing\nWhere I get it and uh and ... the the belief was always it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them um but when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of demand from the train\nThe it it is possible we haven't we assume that we did not find every crime that he committed we just we found those uh which there were enough signature\nAh ... signature ah characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that they're there for him but they they may well have committed and probably did commit other crimes\nThat are we just did not have enough information about it but that that's a new and actually I I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear my parents' scratching 'cause I'm writing down\n[laughter] when that guy murdered ... about a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't um and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody but it made me think about it and so if I had gotten something wrong or you know forgive me but it's worth it\nScratching it's because I'm writing down [laughter] when that guy or a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't um and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody\nBut it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a poke anyway so how many people do we think\nWere murdered along America's railroad tracks by single perpetrator\nDemand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason\nOr ... you know during this period\n[noise] well what Rachel I did was we\nPut the murders and Buckeye right there is a hundred percent ... that is crimes were certainly him I Seventy percent bucket or forty percent bucket and that can become bucket right and I'm ... total up the numbers of murders and each bucket multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that ah\nIt was our our criminal and the murder of the tunnel came up with as a hundred and one that actually includes the people who were murdered or were executed by the state\nA lot for crimes they committed and the the or somewhere between four nine people who were who were murdered by a Lynch mob for crimes that he either did commit or may have committed\nSome germs are the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions as murders because they were innocent um do we say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims guy\nOkay that's right All right so ... chicken stew of a typical crime as you as you see the pattern developing in the late ... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\nWell this is a long this is this could be a wrong answer I'm not a long awaited person those could be a long answer because there are a lot of things the tie them together the crimes happen near midnight\nAlmost all of the crimes happen within an hour midnight\nA family is murder most often our family including a young girl is murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they live usually in a small ... at a town too small to have a police department\nThey live near the intersection of two railroad tracks\nThe I'm a very often bodies are moved their kill with Iraq the ax is found in the in the yard of the victims are on the art of a neighbor and they actually is a band and at the scene of the crime or handlers washed her finger prime\nThe house is locked up tight all the windows or the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with black it so that you can't see it all the doors are all law the or or something\nIs jammed in the door [noise] ah the head off any move body is post mortem so the police when they broke and would find a\nA a huge blood stain in one room and then a bloody trail and the bodies and another on the um\nGreat barrier up because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to\nFind them every now and like a little bit more of the earth and what's that like thirty four of them aren't there or something\nLike that they um they ah the crime garlic hurt on Sunday night so you're the ... on the weekends up until Nineteen pan crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was blogging or one of the primary on the streets those logging\nThe doors are doors and windows ... shot I think I mentioned that they um [noise] there's all cleared year graphic pattern and the murders if want to curves just south of Portland the next to curse just north of Portland\nA so that that would be a a link between them the uh\nUh one thing that is odd is that he would he would take our lap from inside the house term they wear way down low thirties gave out a little bit of light take the chairman may offer lap and set it on the floor usually under a table\nAnd then carry the lap around with him if he committed murders and the other thing is that he would put all the blankets over the head of a ... person or a half a second before you had what are you there are a lot and they probably did that too\nMay offer lap and set it on the floor usually under a table\nOr and then carry the lamp around with him as he committed murders and the other thing is that he would uh you'll put poet blankets over the head of a sleeping person or a half a second before you have to plan ahead with an axe are you there are a lot and they probably did that to keep the blood from\nFlying back and hitting hitting him as he was\nOrdering someone the er er grew quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nYeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and go into the early twentieth century following along logging lines that actually would be consistent with weird this murder happened it's not that\nThe tone that I grew up in his logging town but it was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nUm and that was plenty of logging was going on I'm In in Wisconsin it was it was insane for that matter Michigan just you're on the other side of Chicago so very likely couldn't couldn't followed them ... another\nThing I forgot to mention there all the all in warm weather with one one possible exception and there's one crime that he that he may have ... whether it's first crime which was and just an outburst of anger and not\nAnd not a plant that probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\nUm we're talking about America's most elusive serial killer\nAnd Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for the dubious tune\nIt yeah it it probably might be but I I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder in American history or the first or something murder is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... that in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is a killing on a secret there because it is done in in secret the facts about it are never\nFully known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed and um you get a lot of different people who claimed to be\nThe worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that disgusting titled than this this person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just can't document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody\n[noise] yeah I mean it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely\nNobody would ever know about it and they ... they could have done these things using drifters or people without much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed\nBut in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims right or John Wayne gay see using run away some of the things that that helped him to elude capture for so long so\nBut the demand from the train as ... as he's called ... we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you'd be discovered about this in terms of solving the crime a little bit later on almost don't want to 'cause I don't want to ruin them too close to you know finishing I was reading all knew your easily but\nThen there's a couple of good football games to strengthen dinner so the ... but\nThis guy he nobody it it it it would be president does him for us to just assume that there was some national awareness\nOf the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks now because there was a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out which is about killers along trains during this killing spree\nWealth of Eighteen Ninety eight and nine ten eleven nothing at all the ... and that this has to do with the organization of the wire services at that time in Eighteen Ninety eight the wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little\nUh immigration of this type have little ability to spread from town to town\nBy Nineteen twelve the national wire services were were organized a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years\nIn October of Nineteen eleven and all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening so when they went to his most famous crime ... Iowa in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is him and this is the latest crime in this\nTerrible series that's been going on but for the first more than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even when logically they should have that even though you you look at the crimes and there's a case in Virginia West Virginia work to crimes are committed six weeks apart\nThe uh uh and and towns that it's a little less than ... miles from one to the other as the crow flies and you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that anywhere in the United states in all the rest of the year\nSo you would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man how little who was later executed for and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate events\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speaks to the lack of said the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also it speaks to the insurgency of\nThe jurisdiction of sharing a police departments and sheriff's departments and there was no national or investigative a body like the FBI yet so there was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country in the same time\nThat's exactly true and that introduces us also into one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime for a long time I'm [laughter] I thought I was fairly knowledgeable about it I was astonished to to realize how backward\nAnd ineffective educational system was just a hundred years ago it's beyond belief how\nPrimitive the investigative\nProcess that's war at the time of these crimes and what demand from the train did was to\nExploit the peculiar weaknesses of the of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture the uh he knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered\nThere was no no way really to\nTo connect it to him and he knew that if you committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it but if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\nAnd and syringe a medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean the the ... yeah and this was uh\nAll over it but if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\nAnd syringe a medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean there's the ... yeah and this was um and then ... I'll even through and another ... ... even in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn um is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely ... crime science\n[noise] um yeah and I ... I wrote about this little bit in in the in a true crime book and he had written about this murder that happened in my family in that they the ... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nLike telling them this is who do it's it's not science\nLook at all these crazy things they're talking about which we know none of these things are true now of course you look at juries very differently right and they have a very there now they have this CSI effect when expecting\nThe forensics to be presented to them like it is on the TV show the back then it was exactly the opposite they were they they were resistant to it\nWell and there was this until because they didn't grow up with it the uh uh\n\n\n\n\nNews hours and all that is awesome and it's just showing the synagogue dispersed in charge for the stretching the exercise of\nReligious police resulting in a federal prosecutor same Roberts ours was charge Saturday Night they twenty nine county criminal complaint\nSomebody said sixty four police officers were also wounded during Saturday's shooting at each tree of life congregation at this for ... hill neighborhood is audio from broadcast dot com we hear Pittsburgh Police dispatch indications of an officer reporting in after engaging the sense that\n[noise] [noise]\nOr the trunk or fly just federal buildings throughout the U.S at half staff the Anti Defamation league it's condemn the synagogue shooting\nEighty or chief executive Jonathan Green black calling the shootings the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the United states and saying our hearts break for the families of those killed and injured\n... says it's simply unconscionable for Jews to be targeted during worship on a Saturday morning and unstable sequence happen in the u._s. you missed inning and they\nResponded Wally on his National Weather service meteorologist martial arts some winter snow when whenever you max or forecast for the mountains in the north east Russia\nLooking at some winter wintry weather across central northern New England um say none of the big cities six days we'll see just rain but as you head up and to further north of New England you'll see some snow sleet freezing rain\nHigh winds and coastal flooding of the biggest concerns the Boston Red Sox rally from for nothing deficit to defeat the Dodgers nine six Saturday Night making three games to one lead in the world series this is channel dot com\n\nDishes Michael men here when Mike ... from health markets helping folks find the right Medicare coverage of the news reports say that the rates might be going down the cost of many Medicare plans\nAre decreasing next year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best arranged markets offers that three service with access to albums on Medicare plant plans that can eliminate you're out of pocket costs plans within the euro dollar premiums and even plant that pay you\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind with so many new options it can be confusing even get objective help define a plan and they caught flat in covering the war with lower co pay more choices like dental vision and prescription drug coverage\nAnd the freedom to see the doctors and you don't miss out on savings you deserve our house markets Medicare assistance is three\nTanks Mike this is Michael madness for health markets to\nFind out if you can get Medicare plan the ... call Leighton reached seven three five eighty eight a dream that jaded reached sibling three by the eighty eighty three even reached Seventy five eighty eight oh three\nLet's see the doctor and you don't miss out on savings you deserve our help markets Medicare assistant it's free Thanks Mike this is Michael met that for health markets\nFind out if you can get Medicare plan to pay you back coal eight hundred Seventy five eighty eight oh three that's eight hundred Seventy five eighty eight oh three eight hundred Seventy five eighty eight oh three\nPresident Trump is re imposing sanctions on Iran that were lifted out of the Obama administration\nMany sanctions against Iran were lifted when President Obama signed the twenty Fifteen Iran's nuclear accord but most sanctions including tough oil restrictions will return on November ...\nBecause of President Trump's decision to withdraw the U.S from the Iran deal the president takes credit for re imposing sanctions and is promising even tougher actions against Iraq in\n...

Iowa I'm In the new crime story which\nAs you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there's a killer on the real way tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nOn on a night of a gym nine Nineteen twelve\nOh the lights were out in Alaska\nDue to a um a dispute between the bullets cause city council and the power company so they had city lights in the street lights but they were out in ... and the town was in complete darkness as this Sunday night there was a church service\nOr a Sunday night church service organized by one of the victims of the woman who was the head of the house\nAfter the ... after the ... I didn't\nGet into this in the book but I think it's true I don't believe in divorce can murders would ... would ever have happened when they did have the light spin on and the reason that was true is that he had committed another atrocity just six days earlier about a hundred miles away\nAnd he normally would not have\nA had another outrage that quickly but because the lights the city was punched in the darkness it was a perfect opportunity for him and he couldn't pass it out anyway ... um\nUh the two little girls named Ida Lena still under went home with a more family the family of Henry More they walked home after the church service and and uh the little girls spent the night with a their friend the little girl was a member of the family\nOn the morning of June can no one is starting around in the house the um and the uh uh\nHis brother finally comes to break into the house finds a couple of bodies and runs out of the house scraping they bring the town marshal and he\nHis name was it was um Hank Horton Mr Horton courageously goes through the house\nYou have to understand he has no reason to believe anything other than that uh a craze murderer is hiding somewhere in this house here as I said dark house\nOr he's holding matches in front of them are with no gun to no form of protection holding matches in front of a in front of his of themself going from room to room finding bodies the eight\nDead bodies in the house and it my log house in a small quiet\nMidwestern town the um uh and all of them hit and they had with an axe the access found as it usually is next to the body of a little girl the man from the train\nWas a it was a pervert than he was interested in little little girls and the the little girl was usually found in a\nIn an attitude suggesting that she had been a she had been outraged after that the um uh\nIn any case the crime was not there was a a great uproar as you can imagine but the crime was not solved\nOr two years later a con man named Jay and walk her son came to Alaska and realized that he could sustain a phony investigation of the crime\nBy keeping people angry he can keep donations coming in by keeping people angry or ... and he did that by using a a very prominent local citizen Frank Jones of finance the crimes\nThere isn't any chance in the world the Frank Jones was guilty or that he had in any any connection to it but this campaign to prosecute Frank Jones a divided pulled us go\nIn a horrible and unprecedented way the city fought over whether or not Jones did or didn't do it for several years\nUh and became a became better badly divided community you know families on one side of the line wouldn't play with families on the other side of the line they wouldn't go that they wouldn't shop at their stores they wouldn't uh wouldn't have anything to do with them\nThat this battle lasted in Alaska for even though\nA Walker send was eventually run out of town in Nineteen Seventeen the uh\nUm the battle went on for a long time and\nThe hard feelings emanating from it or persisted in the city I Would I Would say ... to extent that they persist to the President's Day\n[noise] you know you mentioned the ... the pushing the whipping of sentiment and making a false accusation to profit from it and even that creates a pattern\nAll too often no crime stories unsolved mysteries are treated yeah yeah\n[noise] you know you mentioned the\nPiece about the the person whipping of sentiment and making a false accusation to profit from it\nAnd even that creates a pattern\nFor all too often how um crime stories unsolved crimes stories are treated yet yeah it's the same time it it speaks to the fact that there weren't cold case\nPolice officers working the the crime still the crimes have been at that time might have been solved by after that period of time by somebody writing a letter confessing for somebody knowing somebody that\nBut it wasn't it we have to almost literally like fall in their lab which again comes back to the the power of storytelling and how ... just by keeping like telling a story that beginning middle and end\nOf these events it doesn't matter how old the story is is that it will get people to listen again in to reconsider again and most likely to connect again\nTo that sense of outrage about what had happened\nAnd so you know a a static police report won't necessarily you know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah yeah that's right\nAnd and and they do that but also keeps kind of the idea of the murder alive it it makes it it gives you a sensation again it that is you know the core of sensationalism\nBut it does it make it shouldn't make you feel it again the fact that this crime in happened ... had they had they built a you know any kind of memorial to the family had there been\nAny had there been what had the town done to try\nTo come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this comment coming to town there afterwards\nThe I'm a ... well there was I don't know that there was that Congress kind of I don't know that anyone build a memorial to them [noise] I I'm for many years the bullets are authorities and I would say that still\nTrue today that pay the the chamber of commerce tribe pipes and ... was known for something else right right\nThe ah ... there there is a house or the crime occurred\nIs still standing of his operated as a kind of more tourism or it's the it's a shows up on paranormal t._v. shows and people have to take tours of the house\nThe I'm a ... if you drive around ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now there'll be a science thing where the doctors houses but that but ah whether what let's go now and four is not mentioned anywhere\nThe um uh that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate\nMemorial right yeah uh I don't know that you raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a proper memorial to the victims victims were mostly poor people also\nWhen people without a without one and the more family was very well why they are and the community\nUh thought well on them and the vigorous efforts to solve the crime was a kind of memorial to them uh but I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers ... or there's an effort to try to so it doesn't even have to be like a statue\nBut it is interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics peace not explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of status or not or you know\nThe um the one of his role as a matter of trades crimes with the double murder in Colorado Springs it murder two families in one night and joining how the uh uh but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell that to house right there um but it still has not forgotten or many\nPlaces many places where these crimes occurred it was so long ago that it's totally I'm absolutely forgotten but in some of it's quite feel quite well remember\nSo I Want it you know I'm I'm going to make a sacrifice you because it was really hoping to finish the book before the interview but I really want to get to the part about how you think you would have narrowed down this suspect\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these are you looked at these murders and you put them in these different looking you know the percentage that you believe were clearly done by the mentioned the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you could prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but they they shared some characteristics\nWhich should also really inform us as to\nHow many unsolved murders were going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the the murder of a an entire family and one of that is a is a rare of that it was then and it is now but uh uh there were many many unsolved murders in that era\nYou know I mean there's even as you mentioned they just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't even see shooting last for long is it wasn't a lot of funding\nBut Joe ... let's let's let's go down this path of of the process that you use to try to actually\nYou narrowed down to a name to a person I've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper for example is\nAn including going through ships registries and signing whether or not there was a particular sailor that coincided with the murders and white chapel and or other parts of the world\nThat shared similar characteristics as the the crimes in in England but it happened in Central America or happened in in ... and so they were able to trying to find you know well this sailor went from this poor to that port in each one of these ports there was a murder\nSo it just it it's a complete but if you have to use him to START I mean it's quite a needle in a haystack but it's it's at least maybe um\nYou know to to look at it broadly you're you're you don't even know yet what you don't know when you start doing a search like this so you you don't you know is it even possible that her name could even be found given the scarcity and information about\nYou know people are public registries ... during that period\nYou mentioned the Jack the ripper case I Am I read I have read probably twenty bucks saying\nJak river was this guy or jak forever was that guy or the or and I and my other book popular crime I made fun of the people who wrote those books um the ah ah because I don't\nI don't have much confidence that you can actually do that and to be Frank almost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are selling the um I'd never really expected that we would find it convincing argument\nAbout who this who was doing this so I mean we were looking gas and racial says that she did expect to find them but I didn't see 'em a lot when we walk the crimes backward\nA there is a crime in Massachusetts and Eighteen Ninety eight that Rachel says the moment she saw it she knew it was him\nThe um uh and that was because I had told her that this guy would make mistakes and in his first crime he did make numerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was the\nUh uh but the number of details that match up from the first crime to let's say Alaska is is just it's beyond anything that you would\nThat you would a suspect was a could be coincidence and I'll I'll mentioned just a few\nThings yeah at least ... to ... ... did you want me to give you the name or not it doesn't\nMatter you know we will go through the coincidence or go through the the similarities first\nWell ... the first crimes that were\nSort of publicly lake where crimes in the Portland area and two crimes and the Portland area where we're committed rather obviously by the same man and the the tech the same detectives happen to be investigating him and thought this is the same guy that crime a month ago down\nSouth part of the uh uh\nThat criminal had size six feet the um ... there's another crime in Maine in Nineteen oh two in which the criminals there were there were a pair of boots ... that were central to the trial\nOr again size six feet is a very uh the the so we we know that this is a small man\nWell it is recorded about man that we found that he did in fact have size six feet\nNot speculation he did\nWe know that we ... it was believed that he was small because I'm the or a ... and in other places when he swung the acts the ceiling wasn't very low the ceiling is only about seven feet high\nIn the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe over his head he just barely grazed the ceiling\nIf a person of normal size a person of a if a person a large man could not swinging acts over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling because of that it was believed that he had to be small\nHe was five foot for the uh uh it was\nSuspected if you look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ax you could say clearly rather it's the guy is basically left handed or basically right hand that's a pretty easy thing to see\nWas believed that the murder and Alaska was left handed the man that committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed\nWe had said that he had to be a well the first stories about him say that he was an experience trap that he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settle down into an area [noise]\nWe had said that he must work as a longer because all the crimes for about ten years occur and logging areas the first story about him first stories about him specifically say that he was an experience blogger\nThe uh uh the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the\nA preview Beth and girl a that was there and the first crime in the first cry he always kill the man of the house first and the a and ended with the murder of a young girl that's what he did in first crime\nThey he always used the one side of the X. I never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never killed anyone with a sharp ... but it was always his intention to use the blunt side of the acts in this first crime lot side of the acts and\nUh and ended with the murder of a young girl that's what he did in first crime\nThey always use the one side of the X. oh you'd never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never killed anyone with a sharp ... but it was always his intention to use the blunt side of the acts and the spurs crime lot side of the acts\nAnd as he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that they are so the crime just matches up on too many points for you to think that this isn't him\nSilly as you started to look for a five foot four left handed pedophile ... longer ax murderer or ... ... ... ... how did you begin to narrowly name out of that\nThe when he committed first crime he it was obviously ... who could when it first crime is obvious who had committed this because he was living with the family which that's a common thing or a cereal murders first crime he often kills people to home and he is directly connected and\nCan be tied so we killed the first family and Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who have done it because he fled the scene and that was so they were looking for is just that all of these other facts about the first about the criminal happened to line up with what we were looking for\nAnd the name that you believe is a ... ... the man on the train\nThe ... the name that he was using their was Paul Miller the weather that we use ... he wouldn't even a German immigrant the or whether that was his actual name or not um there's speculation he could have been using a false name even that however there's no real reason to believe he was\nWe found that I shouldn't say we found a friend of mine doing research on his own after the book was published found the uh the the ships record in which you had entered the country about an Eighteen Ninety we um are are probably a man named Paul Miller had entered the country\nI'm On a ... he was he walked with a sailors gate he you know if\nHe was like it and then walk side to side with the uh uh and the uh\nUh uh they they were so if he had been in the German army a German Navy so ah they found the ship within which became what came into the country\nDo the sailors gate reference to lack of nutrition to the bowling goodness\nNo it's a if you're on a ship it has taken a cruise sometimes I've ever read on the ship\n\n\nSince this hour from town hall or

killed starting in Eighteen Ninety eight until he was a well until he stopped um but what we have is we have a name and we have a description\nCurious to see whether that might jogging anybody else's

also gives them easy access to listen to roadside service through an award winning I didn't notice you should switch because yes switching to a guy who is a no brainer\nPoll a buddy either water coal use an ax to split the wood or break up the cold right he would he would use the coal actually the boys would actually whatever you found outside the building\nWas she know that answers actually to my previous question about dropping the act's I wasn't so much thinking in terms of stinking print evidence and I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he and purchased the acts but you're saying\nIn every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had in the house than when he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten and I think than it was very common for people to have an act no yeah wouldn't mile outside their house oh yeah ...\nThat's why I connect to the story I grew up in a small town in the Nineteen fifties and sixties and we have an accent would pile outside our house and I I chopped\nA lot of with with him you know to a burning out\nYou know my dad till ... similar story but then he and his brothers you know they would tempt them fight over who's going to be chopping wood and and when we were growing up we had an ax around the house [laughter] we we did a lot of ... jumping for some reason they did was attached to it All right so let me bring in Paxton whose in Chicago\nAnd the first time caller line for Bill James author of the men from the train very interesting Paxton\nLike a fascinating law English teacher and naturally I I lean pretty heavily on how this time of year and I I wanted to ask your guest villa feet she noticed any ... any parallels between holds a vision you wrote about and that says that\nThe murderer always\nHas a guilty conscience and really tries to get caught and some of the more famous stories like the black cat\nWell ironically the berries and acts and his wife had right that way he described and Tom ... you're not going to be caught so\nYou know you can't walk to the cat up and and for the wall and uh you know he tried to get brought him into the basement instead what how how the law was but he always cutting it given what the uh\nAnd of course the berries of action is wise head [laughter] right that's what he describes it and and when the palm he he's not going to be caught so\nYou know he ... he had walked to the cat up into the wall and the you know he tried to get brought him into the basement and said look how followed the wallet but he always cutting to give them so what\nThe ... by the way while doing research on the crime book\nI happened to find a a story in a Paris newspaper in Eighteen forty six\nA which is apparently the original story from which the task of ... among the autos is the the uh the poll also of course was it was a avid reader crime choices as I'm sure you know being a anyway the answer is no ... he absolutely was not\nTrying to get caught in ... many many many cereal murders are sort of\nPlaying games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it uh but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it but that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is that he had a very unusual\nOr aversion to being hot either he wasn't he wasn't the absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent\nAnd very well thought out you've ac of action not ever to be caught one reason he never took anything from a crime scene even the you know if there was a hundred dollars sitting on the shelf there\nYou wouldn't take it because he knew very well that if he was caught fleeing a crime scene playing a scene with or something that could be\nTied to that scene you know a lot of people were executed\nFor that the er so no he was he was very nice to have a quite unusual extent you don't have a an aversion to being caught\nSome serious restraint and the guy who didn't have any money the the discipline um beg you mentioned the scooter marine who's in Athens, Georgia until she goes for Bill James ...\nHigh in in your\nUm well I was calling because I I was kind of curious first of all I heard you guys just now talking about the acts and\nUm my my brother and I we were investigating murder happened was after the civil war in our family um and he was my great however many that grandfather was he was killed when an act\nAnd the same thing to his wife and maybe a son did that but I ended up being a brother in law that was convicted of it and um he lives right now and I feel I can hope that some field workers would be blamed for it but anyway and so we were investigating that and then\nMy brother was murdered a year ago\nAnd then his son is in jail or killing a guy about two years ago by now so if there's been a lot of it around but um\nBut I was wondering you may you mentioned earlier about\nIf a person you know if they didn't make a lot of mistakes and the person that we believe that killed my brother he um he seemed to be [noise] he was so far he's gotten away with it and so how do you find out about a person if you um\nYou know where they're from but see I'm just wondering if maybe he had done this before you know what I mean he was because every little detail he seems to have now and when\nAnd where it seems to be a first time this is what you're saying\nI I certainly feel for you know I'm very sorry about go walk through the uh and and uh I Wish there was on the\nTicket and helped would be helpful to you but I I there really isn't I mean I I think as I say the Americans we were just very fortunate to uh to find this treasure trove of information about the about the first crime the uh but I I it's not something you can and we ... we could\nRitual and I were to sit out\nAnd saw you know there are theories of crimes like this\nWe wouldn't it wouldn't happen for us to do because it wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew what we're doing is just the way the crime set up the way the story's set up that broke for us\nUm again or he was a religious ... to my uh ... in New York a poor Bill James on goes to goes day um\nYes good morning gentlemen and when the light to ah I see a ... year back in the saddle imagine\nWhat a good luck\nWith that well I'm looking forward to it but I have um a a two part question which some comment and outlets and I'm over the uh well it's not the ad in New York it's it's over the Internet\n[laughter] probably start is now we have\nEspecially with all these cases at at hand ah people at the FBI or consider that profile lace so I like to know\nIf you put this in a more modern contacts how a such a a FBI profile of Mike Mike ... sky out\nLike for that I'm also I'd like to hear more about and whether it's in the book and time into somebody in a sense that got caught up including the black people who um [noise]\nWell ... by not even going to trial but get name Lynch and the last part is I I I you mentioned about the state at least at this time at the time that the ... century [noise] that sought out um [noise]\nI Am I recently read a book by um you\nKnow ... it's called how I became white this is on the ... Arab pre civil war and he actually tried to police they shot the fact that you know they had like two hours look and say she would get to a\nBlack folks but pay off their slide Dan as basically kind of painting gang basically street gangs wouldn't volunteer fire departments\nThat had competing spite thin and ... and and I like any time that whether he's familiar with the gang that came up as as sad that's long been differently than I'll listen off air over the Internet thank you so much\nFor your for your most intelligent questions you know I'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse gangs are from New York and pretty civil war because they\nAre I wrote about him in the book popular crime or they were in a there was a woman this gets back to pose there were there was a woman named Mary Rogers or who was murdered in a New York yeah and I wanted to say in\nEighteen forty five or thereabouts\nA poll poll fictionalized as as the murder of Murray rosy but the actual woman's name was very Rogers the or in the uh\nThere was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her cry for that crime but they they they it really is an odd thing that there were these fire houses that were really just just a a\nWho was on family Joe's of pretty unruly people uh\nThere was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for ... for that crime they ... it really is an odd thing there there were these\nHouses that were really just how it was an average Joe though pretty unruly people uh and they they were kinda terrorizing I so yeah I did ... that's an odd story isn't it\nDoesn't hang on I'm going to put opinion you're right there because we were to get back to ...\nAnd then the lynching piece which is definitely in the book and then the state of the police those are the other questions you have a chance to answer coming up in just a minute and Dennis and Jay please hang on for Bill James taking your questions and comments about\n[noise] [noise]\nWe've got callers coast to coast we need to talk with Bill James give us a minute here's we wrap up the last question um we talked about how there were in fact gangs of a fire departments and\nAnd I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go to you can watch the movie streets in New York right to Scorsese movie ... there's a lot of them but it's a little strange it in there and it's kinda cool though she left it because the question about what it is you had a modern police were FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI haven't asked them to do that because the that would not be in my nature I mean\nYou know what this is my book is written to say this is what I think and if you think something that's up to you I I but I wouldn't have the uh uh John Douglass monitored while the profile or has spoken and written about Alaska or one of his observations was\nThat ah the\nUm well he had several observations about the ... crime that lined up with what we believe for other reasons one was that the murderer had to be older because he is extremely organized I mean is it on a chart of how organized is this burger this guy is\nUnbelievably organized or the or and and also he he um he said that Robert ... Kelly who was accused of murder is it for us to really couldn't have done it because his mind is very disorganized but also because\nIt was not physically strong enough um we know that the Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely agile the um uh so you got something there's something\nThere but not a lot I mean I haven't I haven't asked a profile afraid of the pain and I frankly wouldn't care what they have to say because you know they got their opinion I got mine you know the book is about\nInnocence accused of the crimes that I'll tell you briefly just one of those stories and murder in Maine and night you know to a man named Henry Lambert who was quite obviously and that's that was a kid to the crime ...\nIt was just a a he was a a a knock around me was I got a an uneducated illiterate French Canadian who are who are you know ... borderline homeless drank quite a bit\nIt was accused of the crime and it was in prison for Twenty years or before a it became a cause for lab in Maine and a very good lawyer eventually what we're trying to free him and that free um the governor of Maine eventually\nA graphic added a full pardon to him on a on based on a ... on actual like in a sense a buddy that happened after effect Twenty years in jail there are a lot\nOf stories like that in this in the book it's quite on it's a terrible side effects of what happened or nothing\nBut New York police are are not relevant to this story because they were by I intend to New York city police were relatively organized relatively sophisticated not relative to now but but relative to the places where these crimes occurred\nThese crimes occurred in places didn't have a place to park they are they are they had like a city Marshall now that\nThey are so it's not it's not really uh the uh not really that connected to my book\nNo fair enough um but it just to illustration it in that movie of of how those gangs tied to operate within the government and they were everybody was vying for jobs even if that meant getting into like to keep them\nUm and and um and by the way I think a profile or a would do indoors what you've done I think you'd find I think you'd be a very proud of the way in which they ... I Hope\nSo it's not as you say not really being that I don't think I think they would endorse it and I think they would find some interesting insights in there but this is the first time caller Jay does in Chicago on coast to coast am for Bill James Dave\nAm I go ahead and say I'm\nI'm Glad to hear you back I call it call\nThank you yeah thank you\nNot really being the ... I think they would endorse it and I think they would find some interesting insights and there but this is the first time caller ... lives in Chicago on coast to coast am for Bill James Dave\nHow am I go ahead let's\nSay I'm I'm Glad to hear you back on cause the calls\nThank you miss yeah thank you\nUm I have a couple of comments first Mr james you're a large and I think and you you um didn't do your homework Bill James basically invented chamber master for baseball\nSo I have heard and uh yeah that that's his advisory capacity I Know a I heard about that on Twitter but I I really I didn't want to get too deep into that done and feel free to bring it up in in large him for that\nBut yeah I yeah I I I think he needs to be louder for that I use out of a visor initial paint advisor for the Boston Red Sox now what he banks are getting less and save a masters or his entire life\nAnd I and what is China's than about ... walk is I think you're kind of listen to the bottom of why I\nI'll forgive him for that because I Love you\nAnd what's the broader point you think I'm missing\n[noise] I think you're missing [noise] you know that you're talking to a legend\nOkay well in the bill is going to happen if I have an ... appropriately treated you as the legend you are please accept my I'm appalled at the ...\nThe average age you're saying that that gave it's awfully nice of you the uh I'd hear him boy girl with ADHD McCain but uh\nI my both my career has been working in baseball and I appreciate your knowledge during that and a first date you can comment\nI entered fair that I understand why you wouldn't want to basically can access to but I just think that needs to be sad that he has a life jacket right back and he's very very far more enjoyable to me throughout my whole life and they have your abs ... are you all you know what I'm saying though\nBut anyway the the reason I call them and that's the only thing that was a time of year like you pointed out in Nineteen Ninety or eighty nine game was assigned smarter than boxing ring you are and and then I was curious I started thinking about what was the boredom or the X. martyrs\nAnd if there's any connection to them to\nSee it it's a fair question the question we get a lot is or it could be connected to New Orleans ... murders and and the answer to that with his easy no they're absolutely not connected to New Orleans tax murder the uh but that Lizzie Borden case is not as easy to ah\nTo reject because of a time and place\nHowever it's quite a bit different than our murderers Alberta committed with a heavy acts the ... in the middle of the night the Lizzie Borden murders committed with really a a hand the hatchet hand held a hatch it in the middle of the day and and they do not have really any of the\nBut I don't have very many of the signature elements of our crime so I don't think they're connected all by camp\nOr I couldn't say that it you know an odd connection between the two crimes is that uh that you probably know that in that Lizzie Borden case there was a man staying with the uh\nUh the board and family are on the night before they were murdered and he was a a farmer who had a farm maybe ten miles from Alaska\nBut that's an odd connection\n[noise] uh and uh I think the Louis boarding pieces interesting I think it was the first thing that came to mind for a lot of people and\nAnd maybe speaks to the idea of going into a ... just connect in the sense that it was a family he was house it was\n... and then it was it it may be a crime of opportunity um in in grabbing an axe that was near a hat you know that was that the property that two inside cats um and the idea that it was in and out\nReally quickly and then nothing was stolen which is another piece because you know that was ... you know what why would somebody doing to the house\nAnd killed were it not for that that was the part of the motives piece that was presented you know against Lizzie Borden was that she still do inherent property which makes sense but it did it did give me a moment\nTo where I was thinking about the early to go to a dentist is in New York and coast to coast am for Bill James author of demand from the train bill Dennis\nTom ... it's been a wonderful program I Would thank you for taking my call I really appreciate it\nLed to have 'em\nAnd you know I'm I'm Glad you're back I listen to you all for years and I I Know your way through to the problems there are a little ...

the time of year when you could probably get away with it in Roswell New Mexico\nSo you know start north get their actual aliens walking around rouse well they might be able to blend in really well with the Halloween festivities that are coming up we'll talk more about that coming up and just a second and we'll we'll go around the horn 'em to a couple of places that are celebrating\nHalloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but uh we'll also talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of the season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween\nIn Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago\nAbout uh the Salem witch trials and how historians had been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim in it so it was fascinating go back if you're a member of\nCaused insider and listen for it but coming up next our\nThis is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this ... this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a a writer not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course\nFollowing very closely what happen tonight\nIn Los Angeles we are not competing again he extended game that the Dodgers ended up playing last night\nUh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game uh but uh but tonight a little different uh Bo Sox lead the series now three to one the Dodgers will get another shot at it coming up\nTomorrow night to send the series back to Boston three to two but but let me just say if it hadn't been for that error I'm In the top of the thirteenth the bottom of the thirteenth yeah uh it it would all be over now the boss to be going home with a trophy\nUp at the games over and for those of you that missed the first two hours of last night's show because you are following the game or you shoot to also go back and listen to it through coast insider is really interesting and I kind of a host he's afraid that the guest Michael deal in the science writer former professor\nAnyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot coms a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun\nAbout eight or\nA cover up that may have been exposed Google Earth blind spot over the experimental military base maybe where US government hides crashed UFOs that according to a defense\nInsider you'll see more about that about the the tone upon test range in Nevada um and what they have recently uncovered but\nWhat if they did well then you know they would it would become the new Roswell I'm kind of happy with the old rouse well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who Juanita Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nThat evil so Juanita is\nRecently uncovered but but if they did well then you know they would become the new Raj well I'm going to have you with the old run as well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nCan evening so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel and then you know as a professional opportunity and people move to Roswell all the time but this time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans\nWere for Halloween what do you do if if if Ross was kind of Halloween\nAll year long in a way for some people with the discussion of aliens and invading armies and all of that is if it's\nIf it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] um most people go out to grade farm which is a local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the corn ...\nAh the greatest family ah\nPut the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that were supposedly on the UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven or they can get every single year and it's just a great opportunity for people to go out and really try to experience a you know it's out on that\nFeeling of getting lost in a field like\nA UFO a crash in Nineteen forty seven\nOther people go out to bottom or break state park ah which again has and history at the bottom last and\nAnd it is out ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place to RV camp and things like that but again I'm more more of the stars and the telescopes and people get dressed up and\nThey feel that they become one or they may come down and uh you know it's just that that theory if there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with them especially around Halloween and during the UFO festival in July\n... so I I I'll be traveling through Roswell I'm I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to uh my new\nPosition will be teaching it to Kansas State and my my older my younger son and I was always wanted to do good Roswell right so we we we mapped\nIt out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of her way to dip down to the Roswell before we come back up again and it seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but\nHow much can people tour when they're out there if anybody were interested in in being able to go to the crash site or ... or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crushing Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the rival on international year from him and Research Center which um is a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the crash I'm definitely would check out the library for those who are really the seekers and do you believe\nA in addition to that we have a U.S a tour of that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first for over twenty plus years and he will take\nYou to the exact location of the timing\nOf the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival\nFor the first time last year the book or families where the crash occurred allegedly they will take you out to the crash site where a knack for themselves rent a house is still kind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land\nAnd so those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend that people check out and um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay so ... to use the word allegedly in there which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nUh we you know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the UFO museum uh the locals know who the tourists\nAre because the sticker and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that one which is a great story I bring your camera take pictures stock in the Roswell visitor center we have to amazing aliens that we'd decorate a for each holiday especially now for Halloween\n[laughter] puts on a big fall festival with our police\nOfficers and things like that for the community but um these they're about six foot aliens and people love to take pictures with them and you'll hear the story of you know are employers him on his name as ... and ... and uh you know people really come here searching for the truth\nAnd we as local we we\nDon't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you can research\nWell that'd be great thank you appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in roads will for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nAnd so our population has doubled in size we're we're a town about forty eight thousand and especially on the big anniversary of the festival um you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per year for tourism we see a little over two hundred and thirty thousand visitors\nThat on the UFO museum and Research Center\nHoney good really good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts a until all of bringing our next guest next but thank you honey you know and if I'm if I'm driving through time I get a chance to say hello okay yes\nPleased there thank you honey the Jennings is the uh the ... the director of tourism and public affairs in a rural\nNew Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a Gemini let me just tell you very funny book your sense of humor I really enjoy all the sort of a comic inside on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this ... this is this is a very unusual\nPlace in America but it has an even more extraordinary pleased in the timeline of American history that I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people to come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\n[noise] yeah All right uh the city of about forty thousand usually um they need on Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people I'm a mother of course the months it's been a quarter million so it's a matter of for a lot of people for the small city to have to the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books that should deep drill down on like a well I mean it's on a narrow subject but you picked Halloween any shame subjects or it should have\nAnd of course of the month than a quarter million though the massive amount of people that small city to have that its borders\nWell I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's not it's on a narrow subject but you picked Halloween insane that subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials are but it's it's really important I mean we just did a guest a couple of weeks ago\nAbout ... on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views on Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that\nAre ... that\nThere are other places around the world outside the Salem that had massive hanging and burnings of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people it's there are more than the first ever which wasn't the last one that was shot and do what what is the biggest wasn't the strangest or the you know the first for trout America the victim was in Connecticut in Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some vegetables in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nIt is that it's honestly it's really a problem today even in and I'm also developed countries are still people being accused for being with you but the strange thing about that to me of course the planet that I've had this problem and it's pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's still in Massachusetts\nIt's which city usa so we'll get to that season with the which we'll talk a little bit more about Salem and Salem at Halloween\nOn the way um I like to rub zombie story there\nIn the book to and then coming up next our on coast to coast am I'm a truly amazing saga of the most elusive serial killer in American history and you've never heard of that either that's coming up next our coast to coast am this is Ian [noise]\nDidn't belong to comment on the scene of a recent how storm here to describe the\nPro I was just hanging on the roof when it's normally storm starts dropping baseball size hail shingles got feed off a few when he was Savage anything to help Nobre\nI was in survival mode your football can help you win a hailstorm but that guy go insurance agency can help you get coverage for personal property damage called Geico to see how affordable homeowner's insurance can be\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nSo the ah Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look at some of those steps that we had mentioned\nMore vaguely two thousand eleven viral do Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt linkage shirt England\nA long ago turned its ... which is incident which ten people were hanged and sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw in Sweden and there's a witch memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain\nA whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some\nOf the ... and did not even all that happened in America but its Salem that sticks out\nAnd so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous\nWith the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery to the ... that's what a big question and I think it's a combination of probably doesn't different factors honestly that gets Salem witch city one of which of course [laughter] where are you know it's in the United states of America and you kind of invented marketing [laughter]\nYeah that's a big part of it but I mean I'm not a big part of it that's a small part of it about a dozen other reason why I kind of grabbed onto that monitor and kind of how long to get over the course of ... century\nIt's kind of a you know it's the moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know it's it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was the incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually for you to you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy serial killer treat the famous worlds exposition right you don't know did he do go out of their way to put up\nThat happened there but\n... and they they take advantage of that for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf the crazy people are treated the famous worlds exposition right you don't know what did he do go on their way to put up signs it happened here so\n[laughter] right there you go through and I think to to fight for that one is that you know the tragedy in Salem itself\nWas both basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was a civic part of the trials right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations were around Salem the actual the actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver's was at the time and sailing village for sale itself doesn't really have a kind of\nKind of a generational connection to it it was justified of the civic proceedings um\nAnd then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victims but was trials I mean the actual which is I live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... since I was kind of become Halloween count as well so it's a farmer which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today in twenty eight team\nYeah it gets it and this is important in a ... great distinction\nCan't help but feel do it sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims murder were executed and they protested their innocence until the end\nAnd there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy the kind of underneath the underneath their floorboards so to speak\nThen part of it that's left connected to the tragedy with more just around you know a city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and into an Eighteen\nWell go back to many central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] it really is so they they don't celebrate Halloween day I mean\nThey celebrate a season basically so that they thought it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first in October thirty first um but really the blood over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year do you want to visit sound Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowd there's a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras beads\nIt is it really is um I did talk again hundred thousand people packed the small down kind of the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know\nFive or six blocks and you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes the freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff\nSo you're you're definitely there for you know again my girls are good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans Mardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same ... did you get it Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol in consumed during this celebration\nOh definitely actually right now or in the middle of a nor'easter so that they'll cut\nTheir families to them right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween right but it was it a part of it like this is within the party\nOkay so you mentioned haunted happening but I mean is Salem known for being hunted either Salem witch Denver's ... are there are a lot of haunted houses were were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims you have monsters 'cause of the Senate most trials didn't just involved which is in the story involves\nDemons and empty and shaped sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass\nWe're all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history we're up three hundred and Thirty years of history so that is just you know a lot of people over the centuries\nSo yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening and say I'm I'm a ghost tours there's spooky places there's the other five executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky pathology around the city\nNow you've been here most of these I should say you've been there you go there to oh yeah all the time out there are two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seem to be you'll situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but that's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders and all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest that that is more in the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest as more just in the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me\nYeah what's the what's the best what's the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured well you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the one that really creepy ones is one of the Boston trailer victims\nHappened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual store
