happen to be there anyway so I turned into investigation one I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean\nIt just is what it is you just can't help but it's it's in your blood ... that's what you do you you would if you were at that beach hanging out there with them you would just be you're just dying\nTo get out of there [laughter] I can relax a little bit that despite you know just\nBy one of my friends to tell you I can relax I can show but you know I'll give you one quick examples in Finland or about ten years ago and I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and every time I went there with because ah there's been a series of ruptures of the washed up you know serious\nMasses of you know the creature and whatever they are they washed up there but I wanted to go investigate some of that and then over Spring Hill jak fighting up there but I thought it was up there I came across\nAnd I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking ice birds and part of the reason that I went there was because ah there's been a series of lobsters are the have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are they washed up there but\nI also wanted to go investigate some of that and there's also Spring Hill jak citing up there but as I was up there I came across um up a place called lake crescent\nUm and it's this little you know ... it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot a metal sculpture\nThing this thing as you enter the town and the count as the population is like three or four or something\n[laughter] I rented a car I'm like I put on the brake I gotta I I Can't\nPass a lake monstercom on site and you know my friend rolls her eyes like [noise] All right\n[laughter] well it's better than stopping the biggest you know world think it's a ball of yarn or something like that [laughter] I'm with you [laughter] that's great okay so I'm I'm before I get along you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about\nThe origins of Halloween science and Google ... them down your article that even written you you do a lot of writing your author of course\nThat you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com scary news skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too but I saw this great article for Neal and I was like oh my gosh here's the game you know and solid looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody\nWho was writing from somebody else in the book or anything like that you actually research so\nSo tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just learning the origins of Willis wean the gallows the origins of Halloween\nSee this or that I I I Want the two hundred years from now when people were researching the oranges will if when\nThey're going to come up with this conversation I'll love it might make grandkids will be be all over it there'll be like that [laughter] I Know you're\nOne of the things I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not\nBig on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween\n'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists gets all the the the conservative from time to get all touchy about that because they think it's really the the cult which\nNot but it's it's it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into and that's why I really love about Halloween is it's it's\nMore than just costumes and candy has a fascinating history I'm so basically Halloween\nA ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of folklore Rick these events and holidays there's not just one street lined back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime but basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic or deal with festival called a sigh when\n[noise] uh and uh we don't we don't have that much information about just because it was that it was so long ago and there's no the\nThe ... ... records or pre sparking fragmentary but it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the sole says\nUm and it's a time when I'm you know the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying um so it had this connection to uh to darkness but it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we ... we think we think of\nThe darkness as being you know something faster but to them there was a very ... it was much more of an\nAn analyst point of view it wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons um and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so it wasn't scary it was like yes that was a time to you know to a store or grains and to give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this man [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the um uh the the\nThe separation between the world's with especially thin porous so the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry folk or what have you there in their own world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day\nThe the the uh the barrier between them becomes more porous um and so this is why uh the the began talking about how\nSpirits would would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's were porous\nUm you know the barrier between them but also\nI'm In a leader incarnations of Halloween there was also that uh time it's porous and so what you find is that a whole would later become Halloween\nI'm there would be a it would be basically a time when it would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's ... there's other worlds but there's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so for example in the Eighteen hundreds or they were different customs that would involve the Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them but there were ideas for example that um that uh for example a woman born a Halloween would be able\nTo tell the future um and there would be the prophecy and often times the prophecy\nA was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so is it ... you know oftentimes there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would the would a light a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look look in the mirror at midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection\n[noise] um and so all these sorts of another one example was a body for Apple's you know every now and you see apple bobbing and there was there was a particular Halloween tradition that if you cut a pie appealed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he tossed it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and past and present coming together\nOh my weight and they're going to write them down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] I Do it and yet at midnight\nRight on that willfully night that I Will swing and [laughter] well what\nAre you may you may have your own little um I'll give you\nYour own little outline of what the final but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own time line to get that and I wonder\nYou know I get there are people that say Halloween oh saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I knew a lot of conservative people that they're they're cool with it you know um but um you know I always see it is fun I see it and [noise]\nOr treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to you know 'cause I I get there are people that say Halloween oh saint saint saint ... and and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um\nYou know I always see it as fun I see it\nAs a I I mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o lantern that you get to make I think of fall whether I think of orange and black colors I think a fake little cartoons\nThat we would watch like which is in the goblins and and they're very fun fun things that's how I see it and it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it and the traditions out of it and\nAnd uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're gonna have to take a break here\nBut what we have is a banner Radford with us\nHe is as an investigator and and into all the things that were into a as coast of folks here that want to learn everything um but he also you know does a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also\nGoes hunting too so stay with this kind of well let's hear it's will as we hang in there you don't know what you might here tonight [noise]\n\nA um an interesting history very rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get say panic in gets kind of crazy\nI enjoy watching the ah television shows around the time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein side like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that anytime of the year\nYou know you don't see any creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman mass can we make make I'm I'm Out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin so cool I Love it love at all\nAbsolutely you know I mean that's that's one of the you know that that's really what's associate of course these days um although your Halloween was never really mainly a children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids' kid centered of it is today a it was more of a community thing again sort of if you go back to\nGo back to win and the the theory a coping version of it which were very strict and and again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness and snow and all that um but you know you had that and then that sort of what happened was that\nUm that someone got mixed in along with all the mainstay which was November first which was you know obviously the next day which was a there are that the church a church members who have gone to heaven and then also got wrapped up to a whole day which is November second which\nBills are wrong for the phone purgatory\nAnd so there was this was interesting transition from an early\nPurely pagan I'm I'm a ritual which guide out long before you know the church was was even writing about devil like that and then you have the influence of the Catholic Church\nWith all things in a whole day and and again they were reading a bells and sometimes a do over on the cheap way a demon scary things could loud noise we're such a scare away the evil [noise] um and that sort of transform a little later on into the modern costumes because what what happened is\nI'm a you know we're talking about your work often come from and one one part of it is that a believe that a drink so and the leaders would wear animal skins I'm there and sometimes the animal heads like ... or whatnot during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it for anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring\nThe land and the animals that were given to them\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembering town to offer a small payment or food um\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody who they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring\nThe land and the animals that were given to them\n[noise] um but then later on during the late Eighteen ... Seventeen hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween for praying for the dead and this again this ties back into all day because the idea was that\nUm that on that day or the\nSoul of the word purgatory you know there were they were basically trapped between heaven and hell the needs to be prayer prayed for\nA and so the ... the wealthy members of the communities would basically a higher out there were ... they were subcontract prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called full cakes where would you type of bread\nAnd in return for paying for a for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs and rituals are going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn up of course that would lead or translate into uh the the the the uh\nThe public and I'm looking at a candle Atlanta the candle in it and the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for the idea was that they would these members go as far as to how say you know yes will pray for\nIf you have a member of your family who's a who's passed on I'm with you know holding up this this turn up with a candle in it think of this light as the the soul which wants to pray for them they would say yes and then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the turn of sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\n[laughter] I read when that's\nWhen the pumpkins came in because the pumpkins associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and our associate with the harvest and that's that sort of how the the trick or treating aspect came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn it now move on [laughter] ... says Munch on with the law boil some pepper I'm so worried candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in in that like right after the ... like you were talking about\nYeah well I mean if it ... it was interesting 'cause it 'cause of getting the ... it's sort of the things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what would happen is that if you think about it you know again there was the ... the mom and going on this and that and then uh the the during this time\nOr the the jitters had pretty strict social roles and so um and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would would would pining away with fully think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four teeth at the time who knows\n'cause that's what they did a but you know that that's\nWhat they were doing so so ... if you think about like\nDuring this time this is when people would go from house to house in the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nOr you would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era\nSo that was typically sort of a young man's you know ... a mixture of this young man's project in the the the girls and women would tend to\nBe more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the prophecy in those sorts of things so so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as as the as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory and that's that's a that's a little that's a little a little outlandish for for a\nLittle too much work for these days so that's when this sort of came down to treats and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid or not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a member of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar or are you sometimes you get an apple you're like really\nReally I I'm an apple okay and I like\nIt was it wasn't even that I like it was like some really tart apple was like you were out of your way to find a nasty apple didn't I didn't say that I'm like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go I'm a long time ago it was great you remember the good how to get there were there were years where you get full size candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that'll\nHaunted house record where you heard the green in which is right and it was very dark so if you if you rent if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get full size bars you know marathon bar and you get a handful\nNow you're the only ... I Love that I Love the marathon bars but they were all and chocolate and they've they're like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're just great harm those I I haven't\nHeard anybody mentioned those in decades oh that's\nA horrible ... you got a pool and you got a phone line is you can't replace a wish I'd been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those any more of those are saying but but we were when we would go trick or treating and and we had to kind of horrible and you know this way money all the other way and you had your son that's when they had those nasty nasty breathing thing but at the time [laughter]\nThey we were there was like one and only had homemade popcorn ball they were delicious it was the only time we ever had on there were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people\nAnd then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house that there were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like ... you know thank you yeah trigger tree thank you [laughter]\nI I should mention that because of all three answers the the ah the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the classic a poison ... and the reason the yeah and the fact is that that I mean that's\nThat's there's there's almost no truth to that uh it's it's widely talked about a friend of mine Joel Best wrote a book about that um\nAnd and you know so when you actually look at at the cases where somebody who's actually tainted these sorts of things um it it happens very rarely there there was one case of what he points to it was a case of a man and wrong\n\n\n\n\nIt was this hour from San all dot com contractor foster service confirmed judge Brett Kavanaugh to the

[laughter] I Do like\nYour let your latest book is about goes hunting and investigating what to look for what to do and also um what it used to be like in the past and what the differences are now I ... I found it interesting that you said to me\nThat people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to a spirit were years back people would get why why would you want to talk to a stranger\nYou know maybe call upon your family members somebody you know and that's true what do you know [laughter] I Know\nThat was that was that was one of the things that I ah when I was researching my book are investigating goes to those it's basically a survey of\nOf the scientific attempts to to contact the dead I'm ranging from basically pre history a but primarily through the the the Victorian era upper upper today's you know goes hunters and all that\nAnd what you find is that the the idea that I mean you know people have been talking to the dead for millennia I mean that's you know there's references or in the which of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know you're leaving Macbeth I mean banquet so there's there's there there there's no shortage of go\nIn and literature and history but you know typically\nGo were or if it's typically if people if you want to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking to 'em your your your great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently um and the the idea that somebody\nWould go into like a haunted house whether the Myrtle plantation or a year the Wally house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location and\nTalk to some random spirit that just happens to be there and say Hi can you give us inside and you don't know me but\nTell me about yourself that that's that's a that's a relatively new phenomena hum and it's it's fast and you know you go back and look at the the the answer that were held in in the Victorian era\nOffered an upper class uh places and they would have you know a lady they they've Crumpet some tea and and the and you know they try to communicate with the go and then you'd have the the spiritual era [noise]\nUm and you had people like Harry Houdini trying to research the Marjorie ... and all these spiritual is the you know came to the states and Kate Maggie Fox\nAnd and and they're you know their their stuff and so and then your hair your pride and his researching all that and then you sort of fast forward to uh the the the VP idea and you know the electronic voice phenomena and the idea that you can record to communicate with ghost\nOr through white noise and through basically a broken radio that switches channels and then you sort of fast forward to\nTo the more modern day ghost wonders with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes inventors and all that and it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of these sorts of things and look through techniques have been tried and and you know what works and what doesn't and and how do we know\nYeah I think it's a you know it's already kind of creepy enough spooky enough for even scary enough when you do get some sort of interaction when you were going to try to talk to spirit because\nUm it's it's scary when you get somebody talking to you by\nPeople take that step further and they hope in ...\nAnd you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction you don't you don't know if that's going to be somebody nice or not and are these things go wrong with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a haunted house high is the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer to go ... or looking up in the sky lights I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um and you talked about exercises and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long and James is like you know folks quick provoking clip provoking you don't know who or what you're talking to\nAnd that's what they were there with that I said you're not doing yourself in your favor thereby proclaim whatever maybe they're\nRight you don't know what it is if it's evil or not evil or what it is it All right I mean um\nYou you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that scientifically\n... there's a couple of things you know one of the first thing you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done many goes investigations myself um and as I said I I come to a more science based or someone who skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I\nDismissed everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe anywhere you sound as that goes and so for the first thing that I Do when I go into a case is try to establish a water the false viable claims that is\nWhat exactly is being claimed you know if someone saying that there's there's a mysterious sound or a laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is is is going on there and then the question is can we tested repeatable right it it\nIs it is found that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the ghost hunting you see on TV uh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality t._v. and\n... TV reality\nYou know in in scare quotes um and I and I've I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a so I've I've done you know on both sides of the camera on this\nAnd you know and my my point of view is always you know I I don't make fun of growth on it because I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do it than do it right\nYou know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem that I often see\nIs that go centers on TV and and not actually just\nAcross the board is is are you in this applies even you know amateur groups across the country if they typically engaged in what's called the anomaly hunting and that is they're they're looking for they're they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know you mess or magnetic uh frequencies of water\nEverything we tried the extent of\nPick up two bottles of super bigger fish oil get the third bottle free packed with a mega three ... and ...

T.\n[noise]\n\nBecause because I Am kind of you will is here will is wean\nIs what's going on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he also is an investigator and mysteries and an author\nAnd one of his latest book is called investigating does and it it's um\nIt's very interesting book it talks about ah well let's let's bring him back on year then we were talking about how you investigating how you first go in it to an area where somebody says there's these things happening and I'm Wondering here's a question\nThat I Want to know that I really don't know in a lot of people I don't think they have any clue either but everybody tries to be cool you know um when you look at a picture of photographs and similar talk and you know some ... there's a lot of really great people out there that they\nReally had things happening and they have great pictures impossibly something and I love that I mean\nWe all want that but then there are some people out there that want to thank things\nSo when you do see a picture how do you\nKnow what his photo shop what is not photo shop what might just be a glitch ... might be a maybe a light reflecting off or the difference between in orbit\nAnd he said gosh how the analyzing photos tell us about that\nYeah I Know that's that's a good question and I have to say that that um you know I I've I've probably looked at a two or three hundred and photographs or over the years that people have sent me I'm I'm a similar to what you've recovered [laughter] on the on the default recipient of\nOf chipper Garber photos [laughter] usually means the dogs in Texas but I I have to explain that to them afterwards\nAnd I I have to say that I've rarely encountered hoaxes um I have on occasion but I Would say\nProbably Seventy to eighty percent of the the the ghost photos of them sent our our ... by sincere people who just photographed something weird and they yeah they are not lying there not a hoax who met not try pulling over um either like hey can I follow him\nThey're just like hey this is weird you know can you can you help me figure this out [noise] um and so you know I I go into each case um you know trying to you figure it out and to help them as best I can\nAnd so one of the things I encourage them to do and I I Can't always do this myself because you know I I if if someone sends me if a photograph I can just drop what I'm doing fly off to you know to\nDenver [laughter] researcher goes photos much why not [laughter]\nBecause I haven't trademarked Willis lean and got north and south [laughter]\nSplit it with me that's all I ask\nYou know but it's um [noise] so so there's a couple of things one of them is that is I ... went one possible I Try to go to the the location or was films and try and figure it out so you mentioned earlier um one case that I'm known for which is the same if a courthouse coast case\nHappened about I don't know maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital a which is about an hour north of here\nAnd it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was a really strange glowing orbit thing that they crossed this is real and camera [noise] um\nAnd it was you know it was it was seen by deputy ah so you know that they're probably [laughter] that would that make that gave credibility right it's a deputy and the court of cameras so\nThe likelihood of being a hoax was was dropped off considerably at that point [noise]\nUm but what I ended up doing was I went to him I said the story a it was made national news and people are all this weird thing over\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I ... I went up there and investigated night I went and I went to the courthouse I looked at the camera and I talked with the deputies interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas of what it might be um and I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and you try to figure out what or alternative explanations right so I\nUsually I make a list of three four or five different things you know could be could be an insect could be a hoax could be a ghost is there is there are some I mean so you just basically any\nAnything that is even remotely possible I tried to list those and I tried to rank them terms of what most likely which which things can I find typically test where things can actually you know investigating falsify 'em and you just basically go down the list and\nAnd that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the important\nAnd it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's\nThe photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell that came from [noise] but but when possible it's good to try and replicate it so ... for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know a ... are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was a sort of image does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well again it's it would be\nI could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back in different states but I said you know if you if you do go back there if you were still there\nGo back and tried to replicate it you know take take ... take the photograph at the same place ideally at the same time a day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be might be mistaken for a ... a an image of a face or something\nI see so and I get that I get that and but you know I guess that you know that thing whatever that might be is just there like you said and it might be people might think\nWell I'll give you another example of what\nI was gonna say one of it is um you know if it's on the one question comes up as the other people see it right and so this is right there is often the case of where\nYou know there's there's an extra for example behind Sandy behind somebody\nA and actually our sense of an example this a couple of months back and they said oh this is the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there was this sort of weird goes the image or just behind her to the left um what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of ... you know it's hard to be conclusive\nAbout it without more information but I noticed\nThat no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who were nearby and no one's looking into you know strange image to the left and so that suggests that they probably didn't see that the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya I got ya hey you know it's it's hard because\nIf you know it's hard to beat conclusive about it without more information but I noticed that\nNo one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who are you or nearby and no one's looking at this strange image to the left and so that suggests that that they probably didn't see at the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya I got you hey you know it's it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see with the eyes some things are picked up from a certain angle but not another angle um they just\nYou know there's some things that are seen that he just is the way the shadow is in just that second\nYou know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked up the timing it yes look like there's no way it could be anything else but something\nCreepy or you know we're the\nSame at this place was hunting for sure you talk about uh goes hunting equipment man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work and and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking\nTo measure that that we can't measure right now it's all a new science you know\nWell yeah I mean you know one of the interesting aspects of ghost investigation is um is the uh you know of of for example I was I was doing a TV show called the mystery quest a while back and I was there with them a ghost hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and\nAnd they they brought in all this\nAll these are the ghost during the equipment and just you know there's\nCameras and emerge there's always like you know\nProbably Seventy thousand dollars with the gear\nAnd it was all set up when the cameras and lights and I are all that sort of thing and and I talked to one of the guys who brought all his stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera I mean this wasn't like a gotcha moment we're just hanging out with we were finished shooting or going back to tell us that I said why do you think\nWhy do you think it is that that we don't we still have good quality evidence of ghost or I mean even to this day and again this is you know six seven years ago said you know even the the evidence doesn't seem to be getting a better it's all these blurry or business and that and he said well I think that I think the problem the basic problem is that\n... that we don't have the technology to does that ghost and said\n\n\nUs from all the time I

scare when I heard that ... you know issues\nWe haven't been cut off 'cause I thought some of the gun on my phone but that that's cool I'm it's over so jumping back now Nineteen forty eight there's a series of burial mountains or the ... and ... well gold shot how ... how means burial mountain let's not hate oh double double your age\nAnd these young boys in proximity Nineteen thirty eight or ... that one slate summer's evening they were both raised about eleven one of them passed away now they're the ones still lives lives in the village\nAnd um they were playing and they would have put on these burial mountains and they said if you know it was a time when you could sort of people got the doors unlocked there was not the crime that there is now and children could play out lights and do stuff to do what they want to than it was sort of a late summer evening nine up past and they are approaching the very amount of shop how\nI was a huge tree growing out to the side of the burial ground\nAnd they still that today because I Would hope that a little bit of filming only a few weeks ago [noise] and they claim that this creature was sort of scripted down on his horn shoes looking up something in his hands\nAnd they definitely said hands and their claws they couldn't sail toilet well the thing if it to the stood up they would have said it was well over six foot so well it's actually it is the head now on like ... an hour sessions and and the\nCover their hair ... so to the features of of a of a dog at\nA mixture of both and they're still looking at this thing not very close to the ... they're looking out there and they can't believe what they're looking at this at very slowly it lifted his head it will be looking at something and they said he's homes and looked at them or they didn't say a glowing red eyes or anything like that now they tuned in rum\nSpices they couldn't they went off on the heels on the way home now this thing never pursue them now that's another thing that makes me think I mean we've been looking at an apex predator here and it has that\nKind of I don't know that that kind of reaction when he sees what the ultimately be pray\nAnd they did nothing now they carry the story\nAll those years they these jobs I mean this guy does now relate today and when I first went round bury it afflicts done in probably oh years ago inquiring about

correct that's correct county yeah it seems to be a passion that at all my life due to\nMy early involvement in things have been unexplained nature shall we say and I'm just in a position now where I couldn't I couldn't support all my time into the research the truth proof books\nAnd not just about ... though we'd go missing people or explained lights were driving to intelligent life forms a all manner of unexplained things around this area before continue calling I Need to tell you that this phone which I burn new\nGood quality boxers and it is almost flap\nSo if it goes that pleas remade

truth proof the truth that leaves no proof of say covers all manner of when I explained phenomena or the second one is truth proved to be on the thinking mind\nThe third one was just about ready to be published and a stop to the fourth one that was actually stopped it before the ... or a new store or a case arose in twenty Seventeen to twenty eight saying about animal mutilation and it's a place called them and I've just not I have to leave the ... the nine people and continue\nWith another truth prove book or the strange things that are happening up on on the area of coastal quite on

tough soon to tell everybody out there than it was\nThat in meeting on hearing about on talking with Paul\nI'm that it was really hard to narrow down what should we talk about because I can talk about them on and on and I just thank you and and you also like to study all sorts of things and pulling together so it was very difficult to go\nHoly cow literally pull down for a couple hours and really focusing on so that's where the horse you know we are talking about where Wilson is perfect for right now but at the time they definitely want to bring you back on with all these other wonderful things so yeah go ahead and let you get back to where we'll stories on\nThe such old old stories in the ...\nYeah that's correct to once again is their location is Kay county that these these things seem to crop up in in these concentrated areas along with all of a matter of a\nSlam phenomena interesting with his military installations in these areas I'm sure your listeners will of found they say their research\nBecause at the top of stocks than world at the side of flicks then we'd go out of stocks the world which is the oldest operational our air base in the world are still operational but you know before it was an R. E. F. base or whether it's built on an old\nWhole Roman hill for all the lens of sorts of high importance but we've we've still to move from the Nineteen forties and I have a ...\nA few small accounts from the Nineteen sixties\nOr the ... the the village of semi which is very close and fits onto the edge of the the old PRI story like flakes than [noise] the final they're walking along a cold the\nSeem it drains now when they said drains these are just lend drainage ditches because if there is still waterlogged enough to be such a well dressed for the capital to an another lifestyle to uh to to raise ... of you and he's walking along the same\nUh trains in the night and it comes to a gate\nA and\nProceed on over the top of the gate to release the class and claims that the lodge\nForward and put his hand on is I've spoke to this guy this was in the Nineteen sixties they stop and he's got no recollection of seeing a way I Will for seeing anything else just they hand that went over the top of his I'm frightened him to death when you could see the hand than they felt the hammer so there is a physical presence\nTo wherever we're dealing with didn't harm him terrified and ...\nDidn't harm him there than in Nineteen sixty seven of ... we got an proximity could've been sixty eight they could've been sixty six but we've got sixty seven and spoken to these guys\nTo men ... home on a motorbike you know ... well after a night out in the seaside town of ... which would be about six miles away\nAnd the only road into flakes and if the eight ten three nine that's why all up to the stories of the ... so it seemed to feature the road because us I suppose the place where everybody's commuting they're driving\nQuite late at night and they catch something coming out to the side of a dyke\nAnd they can see it in the red lights lighting makes conceit is topping ... as they ... they have to pass this thing and he's a lodge hack covert mind once again it didn't pursue them as we perceive some kinda river moms to to do but they said he had red eyes and it was it was a dot browning cooler\nI'm very big lean very big [noise]\nI I struggle to believe there's a breeding population of these things you know I I I honestly believe that we're ... we're seeing a glimpse into some other guy mentioned and wet at times but these scenarios this area\nAllows these things to slip through into our sphere of existence as you know talking about ... right\nYeah I mean if it's not so we're we're going to use for it funny yeah yeah ... you\nKnow this this definitely there's got to be some reason because otherwise we wouldn't have such a such gaps between the site things you would think you'd go lodge predator such as they say we obviously would need to feed you would see the damage that he left even if he was living on wild games which has\nAnd I struggle to believe there's a breeding population of these things you know I I I honestly believe that we're ... we're seeing a glimpse into some of the time mention and wet at times with these scenarios this area allows these things to slip through into our sphere of existence\nAre talking about who we are those right yeah I mean if it's not so we're we're going to use for twenty yeah um yeah\nBecause you know there's there's definitely there's got to be some reason because otherwise we wouldn't have such a\nSuch gaps between the science things you would think you could go a lodge predator such as they say we obviously would need to feed you would see the damage to the left even if he was living on wild games which is there and they are plentiful around round these per se you you would still find some kind of evidence ... we're not seeing\nThat I mean at them and I did say earlier ... into the talk you know we we are on their own mutilation is a symbol ever killing the animals have been and is choosing to remove the eyes isn't skin the face this is not the work of any known predator rhino boats\nFlakes and we're not saying that we're just getting which is getting a little cameo of stories cropping up throughout the years throughout the decades and the\nPeople in the region\nThat that is correct Tony I should imagine there's a lot more I mean like the old guy in Nineteen forty eight he told me to the story but knew nothing about it when I first spoke to him and it was only when he realized that I was taking a serious and I was doing some deep research I did actually said to me he said if you lived in this village fifty years we wouldn't even consider yellow peril\nIs it's very easy\nYou know so so a lot of the outsiders I mean they may read about\nThese things I mean I ... in the Nineteen seventies where I mean would come to that now because there's a story from the Nineteen seventies\nAnd he was first written about the I didn't research they swam a in a book called the ghost from Tucson book than\nThey are they talk to the huge ... for a bite pet dog attacking a timber walking on the eight ten three nine road jumping onto the winds screen this is in the Nineteen seventies\nAnd I can't remember the name of the officer but I I spoke to people in the village if they actually remember that I went to the there's a song flicks then the ... ... you know we're going down for two years a lot of these people won't work there anymore the the interesting thing was the the the story\nBut they also knew of the ... like you just alluded to that only people know about this thing people see these unusual things and not everybody wants to step forward and older and the for
