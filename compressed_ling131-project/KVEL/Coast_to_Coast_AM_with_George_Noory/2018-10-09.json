writes\nBooks then explore the wonders of the moral of tomorrow and delights audiences all over the planet with his visited presentations on the future of work in life\nAnd here he is on the coast to coast looking for love your cover on this book by the way by run\nWell thank you very much and thank you for having me\nSo a lot of people are concerned that the world of robots is going to take over the planet take you take our jobs and do everything else is that something for us to be concerned about\n[noise] I don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people's jobs\nBut um other tests to my website you take to try to figure out if if if your job is at risk and it it records all the answers and very very few jobs actually could have robots\nTake over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or any of the thousands of other things people do when and and that\nAre so no I don't think that's a a real concern at all I think we build these tools to increase our own productivity and we were all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit of I run about artificial intelligence or ... what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question you know what is it is is more complex than you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what they what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing\nIn common so they either me or what you see in the movies so commander data upstart truckers see three arena or\nA that would be an a machine that can do everything a person can do it's created it can teach itself new things and we don't\nWe don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that and that's called a general intelligence or\nIt is a computer program that could do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic and now we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it make projections about the future\nAnd that doesn't sound all that interesting but that's in essence of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are faster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really look\nSmart um by just using the simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy or just based on the fact that there are so many others can't\nEvery person you can't listen to every phone conversation unfortunately with artificial intelligence the kinds of tools we are developing to do very good things like that didn't apply cancer or something like that\nCan be used to to to to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded\nAnd it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading list so every camera even if it doesn't that audio can read lips as well as a human um\nYour you know you have a a device that tracks where you are and again all of these things ended up themselves aren't that technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world\nUm you know China has implemented a kind of a social\nScore yeah that's right you write\nRun a red light you lose the ... if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and uh if you if you go lower now if you don't fly on airplanes anymore and you do um\nAnd and you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't\nGet any may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are uh have that capability of of of being misused of course hopefully in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a Republican but this governed by laws the price of liberty is a turtle vigilance and so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and enforced\nThat don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nByron is every tell them telephone conversation smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even the Ninety nine percent of them were probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I I just couldn't say the technology is at a point where they could decipher you know what what but that many people are saying\nAnd then it can ah it doesn't have to understand it and the way the human understand something that decides to look for patterns and combinations of words along with um\nActions and and and just kind of build up they'll obstruct profiles on people I mean all I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to use this technology which can be I think there's so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand or let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about bombing something and the computer you know is is set up to pick up the code words like bomb ... or whatever\nAnd so with signs this uh on one hand it's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy\nOn the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian in Byron in terms of if it's OK or not\n[noise] well it is it an ...\nIn the privacy everybody's privacy on the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators arm wrestling with myself Brian ... by run in terms of if it's OK or not\nWell it is it ... it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have the societal consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know\nThe federalist papers that addressed the topic or an hour that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAll right well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called before the age we're talking a lot of high technology folks and what it does his website is his name linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com we'll be back in a moment don't touch your\nTime never missed a detail on a show or a guest sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com\n\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on his simple a\nSupposition and that is that people are machines if if you are a machine and your brain as a machine and your mind as a machine\nAnd it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an IQ of a hundred and two hundred and two thousand\nAnd two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um well my probably cost about it I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys on my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country\nDoesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe your machine because eventually we'll probably build on a mechanical version if you don't think human beings are just machines then no than a machine could never do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work the way you guys just with chips and the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of ... brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering there really is um\nThe thing is is that when a computer can play chess and when the computer can play go and when the computer can play poker and and do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really isn't caught anybody home there's nothing there\nBut does any thinking at all it's it's one losing zeroes manipulated in memory turned on and off at the speed of light um it's done with with relatives it's interesting the techniques for years for the official intelligence we'd been writing about for\nForty years it's just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere is a thought experiment called the Chinese ruined problem and it's about it ... it goes like this there's this\nThere's this rumor or that's full of these books and there was a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese\nBut people outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door to this Chinese to this library at the library and picks\nThem up looks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with out on the spine looks up the second character that citizen to another book to another book to another book to another book until it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese it's perfect and so the question is does\nDoes the librarian understand Chinese\nThose are those the library and understand Chinese did to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people\nKnow delivery and doesn't know if they're talking about Colorado coffee beans and the analogy is an apt one because that's all the computer does it runs a set of determining this ...\nProcess as a memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know it's playing chess it doesn't know any what it's talking about it doesn't know anything and so you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not does the computer understand anything or not\n\n\n\n\nIn six hours from town although I've had to cross sport is

Arizona driverless car kill the woman\nMhm yeah couple of months that makes the news which you know thousands of other people that die in car accidents don't seem to have something to be at least\nTen times better maybe a hundred times better than humans before people would accept it it's got to be so overwhelming that you say uh you know we've got to outlaw people driving because people are just unreliable awful\nIs there anything about AI that you don't like\nNo I mean certainly put simply put if they are effectively makes people smarter\nThan to say that's bad is to argue for ignorance to say while it would be better if if we all woke up within fewer IQ points tomorrow\nHey I says look study data about the past and use it to project into the future that's the collective memory for the planet for ten thousand years on this planet people learn something a ... a big deal it all out and then they die and its forgotten or maybe they talk to somebody and they messed it up now all of a sudden your life experience of my life experience but come the data\nTo make somebody else's life better in the future and so no no the technology to say artificial intelligence has died with the intelligence to somehow bad\nWe've got Joe in Long Island New York now my job go ahead\nAnd a couple of questions about what they had a corporate level you look at Eastman Kodak is competitive GM and Eastman Kodak really doesn't exist and and they were you know at that height maybe twelve years ago and uh you know that a lot of good research and uh\nThey didn't hold on a so sore the corporate level I think they they had to have made some missteps and then uh if you look at thrown safe I think uh there's\nAn obvious potential for chaos with them drones flying around trying to walk down the block and as a drone\nFlying at you or are they can be weaponized than and flowing into a a a ballpark law game as on so that's another thing that I finally just working remotely I was thinking about that movie late do save veto where the guy was\nThe star was working on the beach and they had the boy helping them one of those papers and you know if if they're really a reason to be at an office\nMost of the time and truck to an office one one\nYou mentioned corporations and he's been ... it's very interesting to me the large companies don't usually make your sleep just dug up the original doll companies uh\nI used to say only ones left and then it was just ...

Reese with us author of the fourth age Byron Isaac Asimov three laws robotics let me quickly go through them and tell me how they would\nReally transform into artificial intelligence one robot may not enjoy a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm to a robot must obey orders given to us by human beings except we're such orders\nWould conflict with the first law\nThree a robot must protect its own existence is longest such protection does not conflict with the first or second law so what are you saying is is robots\nCan't injured human beings at any cost\nThat is kind of like in conflict with they all of you know soldiers that are robotic\n[noise] yeah yeah that's true that's true you know the the the laws are are\nAre literary device so he can tell a story they don't actually get us very far um you know if I'm going to do something dangerous potentially on myself does the robot according to those laws intervene and stop\nMe ... ... if I if I Want her second dessert uh and I got a few extra pounds on me this robot say no you cannot the desert is that's going to hurt you got to say you got to protect\nExactly monitoring your blood glucose levels are too high or whatever it exactly\nExactly so like from a personal standpoint the real challenge with robots says no two people\nKind of agree on what moral behavior isn't isn't and even if you just said well we're just going to pick\nYou know Joe and Joe's moral code for all the robots even Joe's moral code is like full of provide those and well you don't do that unless it's this but if they're all they're all of these if\nIt's not so we don't really have a way to make sure robots but have a ... and like you said there's a lot of it's for the for the buck to\nThere's a robot out there called sofia which I'm going to try to do an interview with so for you because\nBut if they're all they're all of these if if and and that so we don't really have a way to make sure robots have at the ... and like you said there's a lot of incentives for them not to\nLose a robot out there called sofia which I'm going to try to do an interview with Sophia because it talks and you know styled after a woman but uh I'm going to call it in it because it's a robot but you\nCan ask a question it'll give you a response isn't it czar\nI'm unfamiliar unfamiliar with it or you know I think if you ask a question just asking what's bigger a nickel or the sun\nAnd they probably just a no\nNo no I mean it it it it'll have an incredibly narrow range of things that he can talk about uh if you ask anything like\nUm you know a wide as Mr T. pity the fool or a\n... anything just ask anything aside from how do you feel or anything like that is asking anything about live\nAnything weird ... it will be a blue hungry and I'm\nEven something like the kind of thing that you might ask or any other person you meet like um\nGive it the simplest problem you can do these systems there there's something called the Turing test which basically says if you can't tell if you're talking to a person or a a machine like through text\nThen you have to say the machines thinking at least that's what the desk says if you read the transcripts\nOf actual things that are trying to pass that you would do with one question so they have to put all these rules like you can ask about current events and you can't ask him up and you can ask ... and even then we've never had anything this past it I'm\nSylvia looks good because it looks like a person and if you take something that looks like a person\n[laughter] give it a person's voice and it says words you're kind of in the back of your head going to say oh it that's really thinking right right it's if\nYou if you say no that's just you know that that is not if they made it look like I'm a vase if all of a sudden the illusion would be broken would\nSure and I always thought maybe they had somebody hidden away in a corner talking through her and it was really them talking\nLike no no um it's a chat box with voice in a in a animatronic robot\n... mood that software get better and better and better to the point where you can ask you a mundane question ended laying in being able to answer the\nGoing rate close you know and so there are people who are working on that there's something called um there there's a the islands Center for artificial intelligence in Seattle found about Paul Allen where they're trying to get the shooters to be able to pass I think six grade science test\nA like that's the big thing it turns out computers have a hard time with common sense problems\nWe don't know how it is that we so soon as people [laughter] right right well let's do this thing we don't know how to get machines to do what's called trends for learning you can take something you learn in one place and apply\nIt elsewhere and we don't know how people do that you can train you can show a kid a little kid for pictures of the cat that ... that child knows what a cat looks like and if they see one of those Manx cats without a tail they'll say look a cat without a tail even though they never even knew there was such a thing\nRight you still like a house

to have people to service the machines you have to have people that can provide electricity to run the power lines to run the power plant he'd do all this stuff how do they think that a I is going to

traveling the four or five just to give everybody a perspective ah I take the four or five every day to work\nAnd this one particular morning\nUm I ... you know I I call people whether friends or work on on my way in which he like many I'm probably an hour in the car this particular morning nobody picked up the phone I called five people and no one picked up\nSo I get on to the four or five and I'm Around at Sunset Boulevard and um my radio is everything is off I have my left hand on the steering wheel and I hear a voice as clear as you can hear mine right now that says put your other hand on the wheel\nIf your phone rings don't look at it in fact don't answer it and then there was a pause and then the voice said there's ... there's going to be an accident\nSo I have my hands ten and two looking around you know it's a four or five so you can't move lanes in rush hour\nShow ...\nDog [noise] although we we move if those who know the traffic flow you actually move once who um are going

I mean when you think we all are telling the truth this\nWhile I was gonna say do you think everybody who's ... capability ... or ... or you wouldn't usual\nYou know I think that we are all born with different gift that we're able to happen\nTo us I have a friend\nThat is the most incredible medium you will ever meet in your life and the specificity of the messages that she gets from the other side are detailed as addresses that you've lived in in your life\nWhen\nFrom the number of into the street name so I think everybody has something different you know perhaps I have\nYou know a few weird capabilities and and the and in the world so yeah I think probably I Do\nYou actually because you're into course media you'd be way Mm you Google ... when you were experiencing is how come\nYou know I think any time you encounter something new in your world right and your kind of yeah becomes your reality you want to see you you want to know you're not the only one and I think I was looking to see how\nCommon are uncommon specifically the photograph get answers um\nI started to I started to understand and that's when I started to actually talk about it after that and it was the talking about if that really kind of ease my nerves and then\n[laughter] and then of course I turned to the movies and there are some really fabulous movies that are based on true accounts and one of them is that movie the witch\nAnd did you ain't you haven't see the which\nI have not seen you haven't\nSeen that there's a scene in which it it was based on the Salem witch trials like before the Salem witch trial and I'm\nDavid in Hawaii who is the kind of a friend of mine is the producer and and he did a lot of work at the New York public library pulling you know an original pamphlets\nFrom back in the day and there's a scene where the father or the and families circled around I'm the son who is um a possess and he says everybody must say the Lord's Prayer\nSo they all start saying the Lord's Prayer then the two twins are saying it and then they fall on the floor and kind of starts shaking um because there was a there was a a\nLike a evil entity that was around and I later talk today about he's like oh yeah that's the Lord's Prayer is how it was like a dividing rod to find them\nTo know and and I'm like oh my gosh that's been happening to me so it's weird how things happen without instructions I think that's a really interesting part about all of this is that all this to happen to me and there was no instruction book\nYou know I was able to identify were goes to war I was able to figure out how to you know get them out of a space I'm I was able to figure out how to you know help other humans um protect themselves and you know big thing I learned a lot about sleep paralysis\nYou you know the ... about ... ... [noise] well this is like the old ... syndrome\nI did for a little bit on this well he could be medical ... it could be mean to be\nPeople have woken up here relies basically because they can't lose ... syndrome but then you realize that you you you are where you can get out of it but I've also heard of the ... were you were basically ...\nYeah what I've heard what I read about in well actually what I I experience I I didn't personally experienced it um but I have a very close friend and this is how it all started that he was telling me histories of sleep paralysis and um and there's a an entity called the ... man\nYes you don't mind the whole ...\nI I I'm a friend and her on Facebook and I read her book\nRegret I think Rudy is tremendous and expert on the half she\nAbsolutely is and she is where one of the places I went to very quickly when my friend Alex started telling me about what he was experiencing um and what's interesting also is that I'm a nightmare on elm street you know created by Wes Craven\nUm a friday right um he had Wes Craven um had sleep paralysis and he modeled Freddie Krueger based on that man because it came\nTo him that's right and nightmares right it was interesting\nWith Alex is um I I did a lot of research I I read Heidi's books I talked to friends um and one thing that I've also gotten into is I'm a crystals and stones and rocks and I I've taken classes and I'm even now a certified trans crystal therapist so I\nDo this stuff is a big way now when I started\nTo yes I Am I mean I mean if you're going to go go big George which means do to take a few pictures that go send me go all the way\n[laughter] no fun\nRight and and also to serve others because that's really where the turn happened and I learned about this stone called black

for five years\nMhm yeah and the passengers twenty of them did I'm just change and it's just amazing it seems like some of the same stuff that you're talking about this lady found out a sign that said that they had a stroke and I actually\nSo they should all be did but it it's amazing I Hope you get a chance to watch the benefit of a you know I I Will tell\nYou um another one of my theory is or what I Believe is that you know I think we live in a a multi dimensional universe\nAnd I think that when people even talk about when they see spaceships um that either they've crossed into another\nDimension briefly or that ship came into our dimension that um is it possible for either to move from a dimension to mention I Do believe it's true I don't know about moving for five years and and you know whatever happens in the show\nBut um I I think that there is a possibility of that\nJulie you mentioned earlier the double yes I did\nHave you had any direct encounters with what we call the devil\nYou know I have not good I have not I have help people who have\nUm but I have not\nWhy do you think you have\nYou know I don't think I'm up for grabs that makes any sense I I think\nYeah you can't get to your show\nThey they can't they can't get to me it it is because of fear you know I think fear is\nThe source of a lot of our physical disease I think fear is the source of our um emotional issues I think fear is the reason for you know when when we don't bring into our life what what we want to bring and I don't have fear\nI just don't end this whole experience is what has brought me to those places of a fearlessness and you know might theories have is if I'm not afraid of the devil I'm certainly not afraid of him and\nLet's go to Cecilia in Roseville, California west of the Rockies ... yeah\nHi hey how ya doing good good to have you with us\nOkay um my story is I'm used to live in the house that will say L shaped and all the windows on the inside of the ... that was all windows on the inside of the L right well I used to um go to bed at night and everything they get all quiet and then I Would see this man who wore\nHats walk by my bathroom window and he that would make him in my backyard\nThat terrifying I mean\nClearly terribly and so I call the cops and they come out there and they couldn't find anybody they couldn't find any set print or anything and so they started thinking that I was like fifty one fifty [laughter] you know starting shining it's like in my eyes every time you come over because I was calling them often two or three times a week sometimes\nAnd then on one night my husband happen to be home thank goodness he always worked out of town but um he was home and I would tell them about this man that would walk by the window and stuff\nBut the men come up in ... it looked like he was inside the house and he would stand in front of the\nJust in the bedroom door way and then um my husband's set up because he didn't have a friend is I was I guess he sat up and then he goes oh my God there's no feet on this and then disappeared and we didn't see him again\nThat was wow you know\nThere are cases\nHas documented that people will see the ... man who are not in sleep paralysis and that's what you experience\nHave you on the shuttle people Julie\nYes I have similar to that person\nVery similar I think they kind of run in the same\nGod yeah see what I think there are in a different dimension in the ... with us from something some of them think were the ... dome and they're just trying to get
