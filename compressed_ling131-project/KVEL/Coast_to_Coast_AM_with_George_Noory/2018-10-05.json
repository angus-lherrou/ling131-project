Alice in wonderland that's on the way I almost want to do the show\nYes George are there are and you know in Maryland I'm so pleased to hear tonight what was being said\nAnd I have the proof that they read is the other side George when my husband\nPassed away six years ago he was a non believer it was a good Christian but doesn't believe in spirit and think oh I haven't been listening to you know all of the programs from way back when I was on and his wife and you know yes\nAnd I had this experience and I don't know who would tell them to sometimes no my husband of course was a nun believer after he passed away about just three days um but before this happened\nOn the service burial service on a hill just says he wasn't going down into the ground yeah the storm came all\nThe way it was wild win and everything it just happens so fast and then it stopped\nIt took only a few minutes it was very odd no we were leaving the cemetery my son the oldest one said mom when we were getting into in the car to go home dad came home with us\nWow I said what do you mean\nHe got in the car also\nBecause they could just smell him call was filled with his body odor and my husband was a very clean person but she had this sense about him it wasn't a smoker nothing but here comes my son said that [noise] and\nI just let it go\nCarl also because they could just smell him call was filled with his body odor\nAnd my husband was a very clean person but she had this sense about him he wasn't a smoker and nothing but here comes my son said that [noise] and\nI guess let's go let's in a few nights\nPass always sleeping and my left foot but still bothering me from the accident and we had a serious from a skill later\nAnd um I was on and said no I've followed my let's put going up in the air and they was my husband at the end of the bed lifting my left foot\nWhile you could see him\nOh beautiful yes yes yeah he always wore a white T shirt within the next and short yeah the ten short on and he passed away before he could get Ninety four\nSo sorry you're pretty good run was\nOh he wasn't perfect specimen that doctors always asked what do you do for you that it would be a Seventeen year old man in Ninety three is a little I said\nNothing she does it all the exercises you know and walk and he watches his diet my husband never had oriental alone and but George this is this thing he'd pull my leg up and I woke up and I said you know\nAnd I looked at him I sitcom that hurts my foot hurt and he says I Want you to take care of this Fort\nYou'd rather see the doctor again and he dropped it and that was it it was very upset\nI wasn't neglect the dark right after that\nYes I have been but the thing is George my mother also came to visit him I mean it you know he lives in non believers as I Do with you but they are able to churchgoers\nGood Christian Protestant but they even taught Sunday school is it a dumpster in such a thing is he told me after seven years this happened he says Alice\nMother came to visit me I said when when we lived on them you know I won't mention history but\nI says why didn't you tell me up to seven years you're telling me he said I didn't want to tell you this I said well what is it all about what she stood out to analyze dead and and he got up\nAnd there she was standing at the end of the bed and mom what what is it you know and she says well Tom I Want to know how our us isn't doing 'cause I was six months pregnant when she\nPassed away and she was concerned how might help but snowing she passed away much first she was only fifty\nFour and two how old are you know what I think you for Ninety four good for you\nAnd I'm the senior George I haven't been wanting to call it several times because we listen to you every night my son and I and he's a believe right now like\nYou know if it wasn't a believer slide it single but he's been listening to your program and he has changed and full of wonderful he believes in an afterlife and so he's not afraid of passing on this like me but I have ... ... you know how the\nChildren who are did not believe is that they just go to church all the time but you\nKnow they don't believe in the afterlife but the thing is George I had been having just first attack when I was seven years old I was going I Love to be a Catholic but I'm not Catholic I'm everything as my dad says just you know\nHow were you what were you raised\n... we were raised as just from a hard case in your church is right here right in your heart no no no you have to go to a search in church\nNever my dad listen it my dad was a Roman Catholic my grandma Nelson was also and they were the Catholic there was tree but he became a part of this and and um and then they decided that in in his late seventies he wanted to become a Bush is\nAn issue as I said dad what happened he says because the British people don't go who all\nThey don't seem to be fighting all the time was when you read the Bible you know\nIt's always fighting on George you know it was a Bible I I have read the Bible to into Bible school and everything but the thing is this happened to me when I was seven years old 'cause my two girlfriends were Catholic they went through the Sacred Heart church and um\nWell I was in there I was in a Catholic so I went to go with them seven o'clock ... masks on Sundays and I wouldn't have breakfast too because you you're going to confession\nAnd I didn't eat also but there was while they were getting dark confession done and uh I was sitting there at the Pew [noise] and I\nPass out and I had passed out my next sale on the back of the few you know so I my breathing was cut off [noise] died I yeah\nI was that's why not ... I mean this is something that to this day you know and even the priest when they came to get me to to them and they thought I was gonna um but\nYou've been through a long list me\nWhen and when my two girlfriends well right now and very nice came up to me when they came back they said\nOh this is and you know what Jesus was already a stretch and and the angel behind him you know in George I have never seen anything so beautiful\nMy life and we never had color t._v. or your bowl we had was raised us home they should back into thirty\nWere ...\nIn this version and no I tell you what I got it all and colors and when I hear your calls us a call in to say they they ... they had been up and came back\nI find it very difficult to believe some of the story because my visit was not like that I knew what he looks like yours was this beautiful George and Jesus is so high in tune\nWith a quick break in a moment Miramax was recalled mighty four years old\nSo inspiring Alice thank you and also one of the things couple of things one is\nA lot of people do feel lonely when they have these experiences because our culture isn't more supportive\nAnd so I think what else is saying is um it really helps to have programs like yours where people can hear from others and know that they're not you know isolated they're not crazy they have these experiences and there's something to at\nThe moment

very interesting research some of my colleagues and ... and others at the Institute in Atlantic sciences or looking at\nThe possibility that when a medium as getting information that is accurate as compared to when it's inaccurate there may be measurable differences in the brain and in fact that's what they found it was a preliminary study but\nIt showed that when people evaluated\nThe statement made by the medium as having been accurate or correct\nThat that ... that memory center of the brain kind of cleared out it was as though the brains of these medium for creating a space for another set of memories to come in\nI find that extremely provocative and interesting so yeah I think there there's all kinds of industries in this world and science will only beginning to approximate some of these experiences that people have\nHarry Houdini spent most of his life chasing down mediums wanting to try to communicate with his dead mother he was successful\n[noise] well I think there's been a lot of fraud there's been a lot in this direction and that doesn't mean that all instances of communication are wrong or inaccurate so you know again it's how do we know what we know and what is the basis of\nFormulating our belief our convictions and are they right or not you know it's often we get stuck in places that aren't necessarily the best path forward\nBack to the phones now we go George in Corpus Christi Texas was George\nEurope hello George either All right I'm just ah like I was like a lot of the callers call and uh\nOur beliefs are convictions and are they right or not you know it's often we get stuck in places that aren't necessarily the best path forward\nBack to the phones now we go George in Corpus Christi Texas with us George\nEurope hello George junior high or\nJust ah like I was like a lot of the callers call and uh it was harder constantly ... or\n... or humanities disturbing because of all our ills and are we going that way is is that going to be the only savior for everything that we do and um the lady before a bottle and she said the\nWas above the heart in mhm I I find that believe in it is just so hard and the soul for heart\nPills what the soul to do and the soul moves on\nAnd I just want to hear her say walk up and I think he joined so much I Love the show\nThank you Joe and scientists are beginning to think the heart is much more than a pool\nAnd the guy I mean we know that we have multiple sources of intelligence in our bodies and I think that's extremely interesting I don't know and the answer to the question are we evolve ing toward a higher consciousness or\nAre we evolving toward greater levels of complexity and technology but\nAre more allergy and our ethics haven't really changed that much I've been watching\nA show on the ... cheese and we know that you know they were catalytic to the time of the renaissance and promoting our ten language and science but at the same time there was enormous corruption and you know people poisoning other people to get them out of the way or\nYou know really creating false narratives about people talk about false news\nUm fake news you know it's been happening and I think people have managed their\nInability to resolve different points of view through violence and I'm not seeing right now that there's a whole lot of\nAlternative higher level um meaning centered altruistic kinds of principles that are certainly being communicated in the popular media by our political leaders and just not seeing a lot of\nReferences to a hopeful message for our own evolution toward something higher if we want to use that metaphor and it doesn't mean I'm not helpful because I also see that there is tremendous good in the world and often times we just need to shine a light on that\nI think eventually good beach over you won't you\nI sure hope so I mean I think if we have an option of what to believe that's a good one to believe in\nYou sound a little tentative mobile I Am a little I'm\nJewish yeah I'm a little skeptical of how much we can simply just say yes everything's going to be fine you know I'm just not\nSure that that's really where the story goes I think each of us in our life can make choices and do we want to ah grab hold of our highest potential do we want to develop our social and emotional intelligence you know those things take effort\nAnd if not people can just\nResort back to these kind of base impulses that come from the ... in the fight or flight and we don't really get that prefrontal cortex involved in a way that allows us to make wise decisions and one of the things we see about aging and talking to Alice was that\nAh we know as people grow older\nAh there is this concern that we lose memory but at the same time we gain wisdom\nSo it says so we get these ... that help us to manage our lives better and so that's one of the hopeful things at least in terms of our own life development is as we grow older we may lose some of the detail but will gain greater insight\nAlright most school the first time caller Michael driving in Ohio Hi Michael go ahead I'm sure\nIn the old okay like I just wanted to call\nBecause I had the story that I have that uh I was listening to Maryland and uh normally listen to get all night and they'll ever have anything to say\nYou know I don't have any stories of my own but this one you got one I was a kid I was hit by a truck who when I was riding my bicycle\nAnd I didn't die or anything you know I didn't like have a near death experience but I remember\nGetting hit by the truck or remember\nHitting the ground and then the next to them or have after that is the sky looking up at the sky but then I look down and I can see a circle of people around me weigh in on the ground and I was just wondering if that's like something you've ever heard of before like it's not\nA near death experience but it's definitely an out of body experience\nI live in Maryland you have something like that\nYeah that sounds very similar to my experience and again I think what's helpful in telling each other these stories is that it helps us to remember our own instances of this and yeah that sounds like a very\nA predictable kind of near death out of body type experience and it suggests that consciousness may have the capacity to move outside of our physical embodiment\nWhat is the new women experience the organization of course named a new one ritual nor will big sciences but what is the new whether experience\nWell no what it comes from the Greek meaning a direct knowing so you might think about kind of what we've been talking about tonight the difference between the objective rational\nReasons kind of discourse and then that kind of intuition that bubbles up within us and we might not have a direct reference point\nFor how we know what we know but intuitively we know it and that often can be the most reliable\nSource of guidance for us even though it doesn't have the rational logical kind of documentation to support it\nNext stop we've done Shelbyville, Kentucky Richard's calling us the rich go ahead", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city":
