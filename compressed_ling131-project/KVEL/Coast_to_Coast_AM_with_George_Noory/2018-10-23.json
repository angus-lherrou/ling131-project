good pretty good keeping to think when we go in the march\n[noise] um at this point it looks like we're going to go to Mars when I'm either SpaceX or one of us ... and we're one of its competitors takes a fair um space sexist pushing hard a following up their success with the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle with\nA developing their beer far rocket which will be a fully reusable or to stage to orbit hundred and fifty tons to earth orbit vehicle that's equivalent to a Saturn five but fully reusable or that will give us the capability to go to Mars\nUh and if they should um you know ... off the edge of the ice 'cause you know you must be ... next to the edge of the ice you know I'm very got uh the\nBlue origin company by a lead by Jeff Bezos the owner of Amazon is a is a coming up on his heels so uh we've got a new space race going on and I think that one of these outfits is going to get us to Mars right now\nYou know NASA is does great work with its robotic planetary missions any space astronomy missions uh ... their work in that field as epic bought a the human spaceflight program is dysfunctional uh they claim they want to go to the moon but they're not even planning a reasonable plan to do that\nAnd um so I think it's it's gonna be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy that privatization is taking off the way it is and that NASA is kinda like feeding away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA's human spaceflight program as dysfunctional ah I'm not happy about that at all um the uh you know I ... it would be a disaster if NASA's robotic\nSpace flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but\nI mean it's really sad to see this program that I mean that storm have it in the Nineteen sixties\nDoing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I was at a conference in Florida a month ago where a high level NASA official that actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said we're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThe moon [laughter] what what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got ... maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember back to die off so they can help people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who don't that we went to the moon jumper joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station orbit around the ... which is\nTotally crazy it's totally crazy and it's it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is going to be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirements is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission\nI mean ... let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter]\nThe the the here's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal I Want to read you an office\nIn Saskatoon now you're going to have to pay to build the building and you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill and I'd pass on that had been the and this thing\nIs that I buy the ... and you probably sell me what\nYou buy the swamp blend you probably want to sell me a lot\nBetter off with the swamp land then with this as\nWell you know with measles doing what he's doing ... sex are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching NASA just kind of not do much anymore with manned space flights in and say it's disappointing Robert really is\nWell it is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and that government built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\n... and ... and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible um I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class\nIn terms of its ability to execute great projects and ... and act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan a chaos\nAnd the the the you know so there it is but uh I gotta tell ya you know I was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while\nWould come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is\nYou know what what the incompetence who preceded us uh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the moon I was hoping ... Stein would do that but he didn't he just went along and I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance through a witness the flight to vote one of the ... uh at night to another\nTeam back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the guys that night uh the they didn't know what it was so he thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was spectacular to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time uh because shore we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get them to be usable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that Musk has done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he's reduced the cost of space launch by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram before must now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram\nTraumatic it's dramatic it's protect killer and it was done on a shoestring\nPhysical and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the guys that night uh they didn't know what it was he thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was big tech you alert to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is although I mean one might say it's about time uh because sure we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get him to be usable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that mosque is done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he's reduced the cost of space launched by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram perform us now it's two thousand dollars a\nKilogram traumatic it's dramatic it's protect killer and it was done on a shoestring compared to um what\nA NASA considers normal for developing new space systems\nI mean it was done like for one tenth the money in one third of the time\nThat anyone or it was accepting would be normal and this thing I'm at the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space and a number of other advanced fields that people thought were helpless\nUh so okay Bezos has his own money Scott blue origin but we now have three small launch companies a firefly a vector space um electron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten\nYou know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars\nA two to field a small launch systems and it even goes beyond the the space industry we now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded because people you know they were looking at future parents all this has just\nNever going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years and but people then say maybe it's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the ... and um [noise]\nI gotta tell ya I actually worked in the future program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one once we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around a table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos or Livermore it's gonna be a crackpot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably a start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what he's going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert you were in our special guest tonight for a couple of hours next on coast to coast the boys\n[noise] uh okay look um the thing to know about Iran is is okay on the one side he\nWell he is very driven is very hard working a A N T is\nA driven to want to do\nSomething great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages\nHe likes money he likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what he's about uh\nNow he he he really wants to do he wants to go down in the history books\nFor doing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that he doesn't just want to do great he wants the terminal gory for doing great so he's not Mother Teresa can be selfish\n... he he and he certainly um\nI'm not above using people are and you know if you look at some of the things about him that um didn't come off so well why can getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand\nUm that that's the other side of it so you're a ... you know there is [noise] um\n... you know self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's it's selfish for eternal glory for doing great\nIt's selfish for eternal glory for doing great the eagle ...\nIt's not exactly go it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the ... had this is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth you know uh\nUh when he gives that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core to to fight the friends 'cause he he even though I mean the odds are more against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone\nSo you know that must have to AT T and um and and and so\nBut really um [noise]\nYou know that that's the classical motive of the hero okay so I I think must gives a hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature or that as a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant to goes out\nA ...\nLooking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about\nBut you know um\nHow would you go to Jeff measles Robert\nWell Jeff measles as much calmer I'm much more laid back\nUm I don't know these cells I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh and if you look at how the two companies are run\nA they reflect the at a mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast or he wants everything done yesterday and um the company takes chances and thus far um they're winning\nUm blood is certainly a\nThere they pushed very hard being shows\nThe model if this company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush measles strength and his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why ... limited funds that sounds like a strength doesn't it [noise] um well in one sense it's obviously is a but\nThe and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time and that's why at this point space sex is racing ahead of him so this is the you know space Texas the hair um blue origins the tortoise\nAnd ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque okay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also won a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA effort the military base just doing it all with his own money okay these shows\nYou know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon's stock each year sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time\nI'm mosque knows that I'm\nYou know in aerospace a cost just people times time or the quicker you just do something the cheaper costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no cost much less\nUh because uh\nYou know a space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still or whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in that's more what the what's going on with some of the latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European bought all these experiments or ex discoveries by the way are being made now with a\nUm something it's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar and his radar that can look through the ground and see what's on the ground and um the ground penetrating radar\nOn the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water [noise]\nUh and um but it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment\nUm it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars it has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place\nI think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth some of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth are still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the ground water\nIs is as it was billions of years ago and they been down there and if there was ever life on the surface of Mars it would have retreated into the groundwater and it'd be they're still\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American Mars Reconnaissance orbiter has found\nGlaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is a a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers of pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust knows it's right\nThere and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight or a north and the northern hemisphere Mars which find a way to same latitude to San Francisco so imagine that there were glaciers\nIn San Francisco and Denver and you know uh in Washington DC you know that's the latitude that these things are and what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars\nAnd not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get at it with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that you lose life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think there's there's ... there there's two different versions of it one is the scientist saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not\nOkay contamination\nWell that's like saying if you go to France she won't know if the people there are French or not I mean that that that because they might have all gotten off the plane with you\nI'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get on with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think so there's there's ... there there's two different versions of it one\nIs the scientist saying if you go to Mars um them if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay\nContamination\nYeah well that's like saying if you go to France you won't know if

... you know anything of the possible reversal of being able to generate artificial gravity\nAnd secondly you know anything about electrical ... or ... or\nAh let me that those three questions\nWe've got one one more Robert ... one more\nOkay one more yeah the third one is um we're gonna be advisable to design a space station like a memorial type thing to to um oh human physiology reacts to Mars gravity\nAll right Robert let's take that one first go ahead\nAll right well let me just a run 'em down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one of the Learjet and anti gravity I don't know anything about that\nSecond question artificial gravity\nUm which goes along with your last question of a spinning spacecraft yeah we do know how to create artificial gravity you spin the spacecraft crates and cheer physical force that mimics gravity and that's a uh in my view or a a a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order\nTo ah prevent the deterioration of bone and muscle that you can't live um in zero gravity lawn\nBelongs to a long time so\nYeah exactly 'cause if you you know anybody who just walks around on earth the you know not an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store\nThey they get somewhat of a workout 'cause they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and and and and and and ... you know and moving it around a a worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that\nAnd so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips tomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and see your gravity we can but if you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition\nNo roller mobile do any reporter\nRight and then the the the third question was electric repulsion yeah I Know a fair amount about electrical pulse and\nI'm electric propulsion is using\nA electric or electromagnetic forces to accelerate ... pounds to very high velocity she can get about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric roster that you can with the chemicals roster\nThe problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot and that means that I'm your power is limited and therefore you're thrust is limited\nAnd what that means is that electrical pulse and systems are kind of like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to six\nAnd tomorrow to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition\nNo wrought limo bigger do anything for you\nRight and then the the the third question was electrical repulsion yeah I Know a fair amount about electric position\nUm electric propulsion is using a electric or electromagnetic forces to accelerate Afrikaans to very high velocity she'd get about ten times the sauce philosophy with an electric roster that you can with a chemical roster\nThe problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot and that means that I'm your power is limited and therefore you're thrust is limited\nAnd what that means is that electric propulsion systems are kinda like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to sixty in a week I'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town\nBut if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world\nOkay you floor of the car you know in San Francisco and um\nYou know a week later going sixty miles an hour and you've reached a the east coast and now you can go driving around the world because of your car and drive over water in this case but in any case now you you have a tremendous advantage in that your your your mileage is great but if you're going from earth to Mars\nAnd actually takes longer to get there with electric propulsion than it does with chemical bullshit\nIf because it the time it takes to speed up is longer than the time it takes to get there on the other hand if you going from earth to Saturn electric propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nI take Mars you would uh be costs you know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago or we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their grandparents' generation dead\nOr the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe and ... got much more resources to compare Mars to the moon\nTo the choice in the age of ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon the way North America compared to ... you know Greenland was closer to Europe European scotch Greene long before they got to North America [noise]\nBut it wasn't a place where you could build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources\nAnd ah so Mars is is is you know it's a much richer world\nBut you know here's NASA and frankly doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars well then they say well then we'll go to them as well but I see is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then get on with the go to them don't come off with\nSome other thing that the halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if you go to the moon fifty years ago we could go to them now\nI can you believe the next July will be fifty years since we went to the ... the first time fifty years already wherever we're at the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were crazy\nYeah I Would agree east of the Rockies Joe's with us Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead law but\nI'm Sorry they can get to go to the mall but a couple of questions are in deep space uh when we send out these probes are what you are\nOr what would you be dealing with extreme heat even open space as opposed to the top planet and would it be\nAdvantageous to us to kind of go to mercury though with some sort of probes\nIn case back here we have run away a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined what CEO to increase was uh in other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat and space help us to deal with the\nPotentially back here and also what kind of person would profile are going to Mars\nUh how would you profile a potential candidate to travel on a ship come tomorrow as\nWhat type of personal they looking for\nAll right let me take the questions when the time or the first question it'd be hot and space if you're close to the sun\nUm\nIf you are a far away from the sun it's called ... and ah if you're in earth orbit it kind of depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\n[noise] um but um\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can't you can ...\nThe reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most as much as you can\nWrite a on the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so\nYou kind of have to watch that uh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it and you get hotter much faster um now the second question\nProfiles people well okay\nHold on for a second the rubber we're going to hit the brake already school by fast with you Robert Ruben ... with us we'll be back well uh let him finish up your questions there and the interesting what kind of a personality would want to go to Mars will be back in the moment I'm coast to

to those damn dot com Robert you you have looked at profiles of people and personalities who would love to go to Mars what did they like\nWell\nI'm well there's all sorts of people that say they want to go to Mars uh [noise]\nUm I mean quite literally and and some are people that are\nYou might well want on a crew or it's going to Mars and others not a chance that the caller asked what sort of people would I select to go to Mars um and I'll tell you it's real simple it's the same sort of people that you would still like to go on a say\nA a hiking expedition with you I'm a or an exploration ah adventure of any kind\nUm they're the people who you know have a high spirits are fun to be with that sense of humor a you know or not you know a ...\nUm and and and ... and and and you know and and the people who can laugh when things go wrong and people who you know our one for all in all for one\nBachelor you want to take to Mars what's going on with the uh August concert you're working on\nA well we're having another conference or in August uh or actually this year it might be in September in Los Angeles [noise] um it could ah it it's probably going to be at one of the major universities in Los Angeles\nUm and ah I'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this lunar orbit gateway or ... or is it a gateway or is it a toll booth\nOkay you know we're going to have that one out um you know we're going to have all sorts of presentations on the latest discoveries you know it there's a Mars probe on its way it's going to land in November called inside\nAnd it's going to find out how are geologically active Mars is so that's kind of land this November and we'll probably have um a discoveries from ... um\nThere's also a new space telescope that just got into orbit um a couple of months ago which will be reporting data discovering planets going around other stars or am I guess it will have discovered hundreds by them and you will prompt discover thousands words on\n'em and it's called pass 'em you know a will you know since we're going to be in Los Angeles will have a scientist from Jet Propulsion lab coming over and\nTalking about uh uh all the latest discoveries from the rovers on Mars and the plans for the next one's\nAh probably have space X people talking about what they're up to I'm hoping to get blue origin people there too so we can hear from them\nAnd maybe some from the the the small entrepreneur me like a company like factor space just got funded by Seventy million dollars to the small launches you know the we now have small\nSatellites that can do what it used to take big satellites or to do and so small rockets make a lot of sense I'm\nAnd I'm a I myself I'm involved design of a mission to go to the moon with ground penetrating radar with for satellites each of which are the size of ... um and so little launchers like this could really play a role I'm\nAll right let's take a few more calls for you let's go to the first time caller Armand in a bell gardens California go ahead Armand\nGood evening George did you and your guest I just wanted to put something on your radar screen so to speak\nAnd that is that you may not be aware of this but there is a whole new paradigm for water planetary water on not only earth but on mark\nIf you're interested in learning more about it you can go to jail water I. N. G. L. dot com like international geo water international\nAnd the reality is that it's already been well demonstrated on this planet but the water comes from them that well below at whatever you got the across the planet\nFractured that water that hydrogen and oxygen elemental hydrogen oxygen and make its way to the surface and moved back in areas that will go and that's where the structure that happens quite often and\nCalifornia go ahead Armand\nYes good evening George did you and your guest I just wanted to put something on your radar screen so to speak\nAnd that is that you may not be aware of this but there's a whole new paradigm for water planetary water\nOn not only earth but ... if you're interested in learning more about it you can go to jail water I. N. G. L. dot com like international geo water international\nAnd the reality is that it's already been well demonstrated on this planet but the water comes from them back ... below that whatever you got the ... the planet fractured\nThat water that hydrogen and oxygen elemental hydrogen auction can make its way to the surface and moved back in areas of the ... the structure that happens quite often\nAnd on Mars the same effect is there in fact\nThe largest volcano in the solar system of the Olympics moms are bars which is over eighty thousand feet oh just perfect pitch is\nThere was a cold beer or a top\nAnd that's what ... provide Scott city or lava flows that happens so that's really where the water has always been on Mars and that's where the water is on this planet and it's time I think for us to start factoring that is true our calculations for a Mars trip\nWell Sam rubber what do you think\nWell I I it sounds interesting we certainly know there's a lot of water on Mars we found the lakes via found glaciers and there's probably more to find so I think he's on the right track\nDo you think we are the Martians that a long time ago either\nOrganisms flu hear from you know shop the media writes a slow off the planet or or maybe they had a full blown civilization long time ago and the skiing I think\nI think the former is is this a good chance is true\nOr not civilizations but a microbes on on meteors a because Mars um well a couple things first of all life appeared on earth almost immediately after it could which either means one or two things\nThat life can evolve very quickly from chemistry or that life was floating around in space and as soon as the earth was cool enough for life to to prosper here the ... it landed in the seats to cold as it were\nUm and now if you think about that then you say here's Mars nearby it's being hit find meteors knocking chunks off sending them flying and hitting the earth we're hit by Mars meteorites all the time [noise]\nUm if life could evolve quickly\nOut of chemistry it would have on Mars Mars coup before earth to Mars had liquid water before or did soft life is is is a quick study evolving rapidly from chemistry it would've occurred on Mars first and then it would have landed here\nSo there is a good chance that it came for Mars the the the the a and also that is supported by the fact that we find no organisms on earth no free living organisms simpler than bacteria and bacteria are really pretty complicated they have this whole\nShirt DNA in are in a whole alphabet for transmitting genetic information [noise] um you know or imagined you you've found a um an ancient manuscript that\nI had a complete alphabet along with all the punctuation marks and everything and uh it could not possibly be the first written document that they would have to be more primitive things before\nYou know the complete alphabet and punctuation and comments and paragraphs and all this had been worked out so uh but bacteria have all that so that suggests that they came here already fully developed it could've come from Mars or maybe both earth and Mars\nGun in it for interstellar space I just lost his how did you get interested in all this Robert\nSputnik not doing it for yeah\nYeah well I was already somewhat interested I I was an early reader I was fine when Sputnik flu and while to the adult world split it may have been a terrifying event to me it was just great ah because what it was proving was that the\nUm the space faring uh stories that I was reading we're going to be true and I can remember

she sent 'em a tele Patrick distressing they'll saying to me and I picked up on it and they showed up as an aberration of some kind\nAs you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and um\nWhat environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and um you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and\nAnd I and I think that that you can sort of see there was a trauma life threatening event with my aunt she was dying and somehow she sent 'em a teller Patrick distressing they'll thing uh to me and I picked up on it and it showed up as an aberration of some kind\nOf as you say some people do get these experiences why not\nWell I I think it actually comes down to something I'm pretty mundane [laughter] I there's a lot of research out there in something called environmental sensitivity All right and I'm\nWith environmental sensitivity as it's not like psychics sensitivity it's not like I'm chip coffee and Sylvia brown and and those types of psychic sensitivity where your mediums and\nUm you have psychic abilities but something as simple and concrete as sort of our ability to taste touch and smell and that's where the environmental sensitivity is I'm so those who are environmentally sensitive are simply picking up on the environment to a higher degree than the normal population\nSo if you think about this as humans mean you\nWe both experienced the world differently we're both affected by and react to the environment in different ways\nBut the physical environment affect certain people more than others and this leads to all kinds of conditions and dysfunctions\nUm there is a researcher out there Michael J. our who categorize these environmentally sensitive people um and what he found was people who are environmentally sensitive have longstanding allergies chronic pain fatigue migraines fibromyalgia and just an overt sensitivity to light\nFound my city and smells more than maybe me and you do so I could walk into a room and be fine other people could walk in the same room and they smell cologne from all over the place to get\nAshes [laughter] so these environmentally sensitive people actually way way way more paranormal experiences than the general population\nUm there's those higher it's a really high number and what the thought is is these environmentally sensitive people are picking up on whether it's ex federal magnetic fields more than the general population in other words they have a battery antenna or biological radio\nAnd the electromagnetic spectrum than other people so we all are we all have radios with basic equipment the tune into things but some people have really really really redefined are sensitive radios\nAre and they're picking up on things and that and detecting things in the environment that normal people don't pick up for the general population doesn't\nSo this ability to truly experience paranormal phenomenon it's it's more likely to be detected a registered among this group and I think that's a fascinating thing so we have environmental sensitivity which there's a lot of research suggesting obviously it's viable and it's real\nI think in Canada you can be on disability for certain types of environmental sensitivity so there's science\nBehind it and then there's also sign saying these people are having way more ghostly encounters why is that in that kind of where we go a little further into that\nTo some of these people brand didn't realize how sensitive the yard to picking up these things do they know they get it\nI I think they do it in in in when I go out there and I my research was done I had I talked to a lot of people who are environmentally sensitive and what you find is\nYou know not only are do they pick up on things or have way more paranormal experiences but it's genetics so their mom did to wear their dad and then their grandma and so forth and so on so this is something kind of like most\nYou know genetic diseases or or whatnot this kind of passed down from generation and listen they know they're sensitive to the environment um\nJust by walking into places some people you know like I said get rashes um they can be under neon lights some people almost allergic to electricity\nOr so these types of people just experienced a different world and and believe me they know it affects them probably more negatively to that does positively\nYou know you talked about some of the reality television shows my criticism over them\nBecause they always seem that they have to have some kind of ... Leon donor\nBecause as television and you know they don't want to do this three minute one hour program and not have anything else so looks like they create these things and I think that kind of which the credibility solution a ...\nYeah I think yeah I think it it it really does too because it implies that\nEither people are misinterpreting normal things or there's over fraud\nAnd um you know every ... those those people who do this on a regular basis and are genuine no you know out of ten locations that you go to you might have a one experience it's really impossible to have you know thirty or forty experiences every time you go to a location\n'cause then it's your money in the waters and I and then you kind of lean towards that that fried types of\nThings we talked about the individual who might have the ability to spot goes too few goes more than others but what about the ghosts of cells are there some does that come back more often than others because they have an ability to do that\nUm I think it's really I guess which one is stronger and when you think about it is the person's ability to sense that goes if if I'm really sensitive to it I'm going to pick up ghostly encounters a lot more than everyone else so I might pick up on a ghostly encounter with civil war soldier\nI'm very often if I'm really\nSense I mean a good a good radio or real good radio problems she crane is the ability to pick up a weak signals from the radio station\n... isn't that much that way with the person that if that person is a receiver he or she may be more apt to pick up the ghost leasing\nExactly yeah exactly so you know ... and ... and that that kind of boils down to the environmental sensitive person um they're going to have way way way more goes the encounters and um\nSo I think it has to do to your prior question I think it has to do mainly with the person not so much that goes to encounter the environment but you have to ask you know hey I'm an environmentally sensitive person I pick up on all this stuff you know I go from place to place to place throughout my day however\nOne location I'm picking up a lot of um having a lot of grossly phenomenon happened to me um the places pretty active whereas in other places in but then you start asking yourself why why that place and then why not the other places\nUm so then you have to go into why is the location have more um\nParanormal phenomenon that other locations you know it's like those antennas we had the rabbit here was\nYou know why is this configuration picking up channel thirty three and this configuration is that you know what I'm saying you have to figure out the right combination of things that happen for um the TV to show up in a clear picture\nAnd the same with ghostly encounters you have to figure out the right sort of ingredients are variable the line up the habit goes to counter location is one person has to 'em\nAnd then there's there's probably other ones that I ... you know we haven't really identified at this point but the person not only is their sensitivity but they're\nOther ones that you know we haven't really identified at this point but the person not only of their sensitivity but their internal ... electric or consciousness about all this stuff really plays into it it's really fascinating to me it\nReally is I remember when my dad brought home a better TV him to\nYou know there was the kind that didn't just move with the rabbit ears but it had like a little knob on it is that you clicked in brought into signals better that way too and I thought for use this technology amazing how times have changed Brandon\n[laughter] I remember those [laughter]\nDo you or have you come across demonic spirits in your work\nUh no I haven't and I get that question a lot of the team a question seems to be getting more and more prevalent in the last five years or so I think you know when you have a ghostly counter or you have some sort of phenomenon happened to you it's amazing it's great\nUh and then you want to start maybe putting labels on it you know this experience what the good with the bad weather the positive with it that's when the debt\nAnd I think when you start putting negative to it then you start feeling like it's demonic mhm demonic\nTeam is more of a religious perspective than it is sort of um you know like a scientific perspective\nSo usually whoever classified this is a demon or um you know a regular goes I think there's more of a religious felt to it\nUm that's where I usually when I meet David knowledge is they're they're very religious as well um but I think there's a little little that labeling going on to me it's an experience\nUm and some people perceive it as good or bad I might perceive one experience being really positive you might have the same experience can be terrified and believe it's negative and then kind of you go towards more demonic part of thing so I I really\nJust enjoyed not joy but I have the experience I research experience and I don't try to put the theme and label on anything\nOr with Brenda ... his book is called the ghost studies his website haunted series dot com of course linked up

choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks\nThere's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environments are resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling goes come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nWe don't teach in Rochester New York Yankees\nYes I'd like to ask about possible early imprint teams on the brain that might explain to an extent why\nPeople see ghost like others and I've seen the film will be a baby ... ships being fed by humans with hand puppets made to look like the mother still wouldn't return to the wild the ships\nNoted key in on a mother a concert or a you mentioned the window we're who was searching for the pumpkin and his\nWife appeared and then those gone I've never had any experience like that but the closest I've had over in the many years I'm now sixty three I Will rub my eyes in various ways all different kinds of figures\nWill appear before me a figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have a Kurd would end me a different figures in all different kinds of actions some of them quite grotesque and I'm sure that those are not close by definition\nBut just kind of bringing us together and closing a one about imprint teens that lake with a window we're uh seen his wife\nSaying look uh uh in the back of the garage I Can't imprint teens can people be so emotionally attached immediately like a husband who was white that\nHe would see his wife worse than the rest of us would not and maybe\nI in my life with things that the rest of you would not\nMhm yeah yeah it's it I don't think that's a tough one to answer I I think that\nTake that ... you know I it's a little bit with a widower they were talking about if a little bit like he is resonating with something in the environment that's why you sing his wife he's not seeing Abraham Lincoln or whoever else so specific to him there's a there's sort of a connection to him\nYou know as as we're driving down the street in our in our cars are there's radio signals all around us but if I turn my radio station in Ninety two point five I only pick up Ninety two point five\nBecause we're matching frequencies so with a husband and wife with with ... and a mother they match frequencies and that's one of these sort of experience happened as far as an imprint goes I'm if I'm understanding that the way you're you're describing a\n... there is I mean Carl young had this idea of collective unconscious so were all born with these archetypes and the sort of um blueprints for how to really manage life um so we're sort of\nImprinted um with with with these archetypes in with sort of ancestral beliefs that are common throughout every culture that's happening so this could be me here at Ohio or you know um people in other countries we all have similar\nSort of visions and stories and things like that so I think we're all imprinted I'm In a grand gesture but it could be more specific for cultures it could be more specific for families can be imprinted I'm with certain information so you pass that down to your family\nUm so it could be more micro then macro when it comes to this collective archetypes that are out there so I think there is something to the imprint I I I couldn't answer your question differently but that's sort of my best guess that it\nIt does your religion kind of changed your views about the knees operations ghost Leon donors\n[noise] yeah I I think it's it it changes our views and it\nBasically changes our perception of an experience so you know you can have someone who is a devout religious person have the same experience as someone who is not the religious person might a perceived that as more of um like we talked about earlier a demon or an annual\nOr I'm a of of a sign from from God or aside from a deceased person that they love um whereas a person who doesn't have that religious tell to it might experience that I simply you know an experience or or\nUm a mundane thing or ambiguous stimuli so everyone's\nEveryone's past sort of influences how we perceive any sort of ... paranormal phenomenon um and that's how we talked about before you know the believers are automatically going to go to whatever they believe in\nAnd if they believe in earth found spirits everything is that are found spirit or so I think perception religion uh they play a huge part how we perceive a ghost encounters a paranormal\nPhenomenon have you ever witnessed an extra ...\nNo I've never witnessed that would you like to um [noise]\nAs long as it's not yours [laughter]\n[laughter] you know it was somewhat although I did interview a while back and and I can't remember what I said but I just kind of like yeah I'd love to have an experience like that and then someone emails me and says careful what you wish for those types of\nFoods that you know [laughter] so I don't wish\nTo be a part of an exercise but scientifically are worth my fascination I'd love to sort of be part and sort of gained some information from that or knowledge\nI Am very curious about ... and you know how they can get this demon disappearing demonize the person's system and you know be gone in ... it's really weird and remarkable it's the same time\n[noise] yeah yeah it it's but my brain always goes to there's there's so much misinformation and mismanagement of things like that and possibly fraud that I I'd have to be there to experience it for me to go okay yeah I Believe that\nLet's go to Shelley in North Dakota I suddenly go ahead\nWell hi I'm there you know I mean I'm\n...

All right let's get Brandon's take on that when we come back in just a moment brand and remember the story and let's just get your reaction to that because I Do think loved ones\nDuring moments of

go back to ... just a moment here\nSally in North Dakota has a situation where her daughter died sadly in a car crash but she's getting visitation Sally how often are these visitations occurring\nShe's ... she's not there anymore okay we'll get your reaction to that brand and what do you think's going on\n[noise] well that that's actually becoming more and more common um and I've heard more and more stories about this in the last ten years but this this idea that\nYou know this is somehow um goes are utilizing electric electrical equipment\nTo communicate so that's like phones tax emails these types of things um you know typically people will report they'll get hang ups from a family members number who's been deceased for whether it's five days or five years\nUm then they'll get text messages from them you know after their death or you know these types of things and there's a there's a book out\nThere that I'm a pair psychologist Dr column Cooper rose called telephone calls from the dead which encompasses a great ... less a bunch of these um phenomenon\nThat are happening and then there's phantom menace messages which has recently came out as well which goes over this as well it's hard to really know that to me I mean listen to the idea that um\nGhosts or consciousness or wherever you want to call it is ... electric off of electrical equipment has been going on for a while so\nYou know to to know the exact or how that's happening I'm not sure uh but anytime we talked about this and numerous times today anytime there's some sort of trauma or crisis or life threatening events like she was talking about\nUm it increases the probability of these types of things happening I'm so we we the only thing we can do is try to see these consistency there's similarities and then try to find the answers are the best we can from the back and\nHow do you change the skeptics mind Brandon can you\nUh [noise] I think you could um put some some doubt and education\nIn there about what could possibly be happening uh it's it's a challenging it's challenging because you know at this point goats are measurable phenomenon\nAnd the paranormal it's difficult to study in a sort of a logical scientific way and this is mainly because paranormal experiences are you know there are radical their episodic\nThey're poorly documented um their random and they're not repeatable will which is essentially it's everything that the scientific method have 'em for these things are are tough and and that kind of why most people go into its fraud or mental illness or imagination um\nYou know we didn't matter is that a cop out them to be able to just to see that\nI I think it's an ... a cop out would be an easy answer to it so that's the idea is\nIf it's if I'm presented with something that I don't know the answer to\nUm rather than spend hours and hours of researching it I can just say about a person's misunderstanding or it's fried earth over active imagination and then I could go on living my life in my normal views and it doesn't blow my mind at any kind of way so it's an easy way to sort of you have an answer to something that\nYou know it's it's pretty mind blowing phenomenon um but you know there's all this stuff out there that that some people point to is evidence like pictures navy piece\nUm but there's really no fall up after that um and then those things nowadays are easily fake I I think really if and this is kind of what I tell people out in a paranormal investigator is is you got to it's about collecting data about sample size it's about\nBeing consistent and what you do and that's how you that's how you progress\nAnd then what you do and that was over how you\nGot to tell you progress or advance a field you know similar questionnaires at all these people are using when they do investigations\nSimilar methods um you know if sample sizes huge in academia and was skeptics as well is that you know if if you have a sample size of three hundred people that's pretty impressive\nIf you give questionnaires if every paranormal team gave a questionnaire to somebody and they did a hundred investigations a year and there's\nYou know I don't know three hundred paranormal teams out there your sample sizes getting pretty big and then academia takes notice because you have a hundred thousand\nQuestionnaires that are just waiting to be analyzed and then you start getting some variables are um some similarities inconsistencies and then you have a measurable phenomenon\nSo you know it's it's hard to argue I'm with someone who has a close mine but if you could just push him towards a piece of research or a book or something like that and maybe they pick it up then that helps you know and that goes for the opposite end to what people are just adamant believers there's\nThere's things you can push a more towards the middle with which is to me is the best place to be\nLet's go to Tom truck driving in Pennsylvania I'm doing\nFine how are ya great thank you\nYeah I Want to talk to you guys I'm a long time listener first time caller so there wasn't a little bit of a story\nI Am a back in Nineteen Seventy four Nineteen Seventy five I was ten or eleven years old we vote biggest in New York to a small house and upstate New York\nAnd I woke up in the middle of the eye and I don't know why but there was a man standing there and he was it does but the thing that she didn't even hear the Spanish Military uniform\nAnd I'll never forget it I close my eyes open it back up to look at me like a slap myself a couple of times myself we weren't studying in school or anything like that\nAs long as it can really are open them up and he was right in my face and then I close my eyes and he was standing back\nAgainst the wall Street Journal look kinda slow but he was funny and I just walk through the wall whoa\nDid the uniform looked like it might have been from the Eighteen hundreds or something like that some\nEarly night he ... he had the ... both on the shoulders and uh I don't know who might not a spike but I don't know that they had you know and he had a moustache she was a male\nWas there any kind of battle in that area a long time ago\nI don't think so in upstate New York you know farming community in an old farmhouse what the heck is a guy doing you know it's just I've never had it in others freeze with being in my whole life again you're not good for now\nLet's bring the expert in Brandon what's a Spanish so you're from the Eighteen hundreds doing their\n... this is ... this is a fascinating story and and these are the stories are really gave me the most excited about this phenomenon right so how could there be a ghost of something that shouldn't be there right so if you have a house for a hundred and fifty years and there's no tragedy happening\nAnd all of a sudden there's a civil war goes that appears there right in this house is I'm In Montana where there shouldn't be civil war goes why is that\nWell I think and and I go over I have a whole chapter devoted to sort of that is in my book um you know to me it's not so much location specific when it comes to a lot of these hard things that happen so let's say let's go back to our caller Patrick distress messages right\nSo I'm In Ohio\nAnd um I get into a car accident and end up dying I send us hello Patrick distress message to my brother and a Montana and the it he wakes up in the middle of night sees an aberration of me and my in my clothes while I'm driving or whatever and I say good bye I Love you\nNow the operation didn't happen where I died it happened in Montana where my brother was living right now let's\nSo let's say we skip I had a hundred and fifty years into the future someone buys my brother's house and know tragedy happened there are no nobody died there was a it was it was great place to live for all those years they walk into a room and they see an operation of me\nAnd they go what the heck is going on here now the operation of me is it because I died and my brother's house it's the endpoint of might tell a path a distress call to my brother that he's picking up on so in that case that the the heat the caller's talking about maybe there was someone that lived in that farmhouse\nWho had um I'm a a a cousin or a family member or perhaps even a husband who was battling in the ... the Spanish Army and as he was dying he sent this tell the path that message that showed up in the form of an operation to this woman and this and the New York farmhouse", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Vernal", "day": "23"}
