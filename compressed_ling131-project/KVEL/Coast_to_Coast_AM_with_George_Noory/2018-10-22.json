incompetence and sheer terror it is the true story of the worst disaster in us naval history the sinking of the USS Indianapolis\nIt's taken more than fifty years for the full story to emerge from behind and official wall of secrecy and blame\nTo remarkable journalists have worked for years to tell the whole story\nI was totally blown away by their book it takes you right there into the water with the sailors as they struggle to survive shark attacks and the elements for days and days wow what a story a coauthor is Lynn Vincent and Sarah ... will be here to share what is already a runaway best seller of the book\nBut first I had hinted last month when ... was here that he had something else in the works\nI'm not sure when the guy sleeps but he returns to the program coming up and just a few minutes and in a sense he is returning to his roots you know the first time he was on coast to coast I Believe it's ten years ago to discuss his first book the hoopla project\nWas a typical day ... boots on the ground investigation this time of the big butt legend and David spent two years among the ... tribe to hear their tails and legends and to apply police and forensic methods to figure out what was being seen in the forests of the Pacific northwest\nSo I I Wonder about looking for an area that had a few things first of all I wanted Internet I needed a hotel and I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that Randy and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate on the area to scoop up which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring us together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approached them and I said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nI'm not going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit for what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran the big story in Hooper that live miles away someone coming into town starting to think about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and uh he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing\nBut I wanted something a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native American\nA couple of cops there knew many of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big story in Hooper that live ... miles away who someone coming into town starting to think about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing\nBut I wanted something to a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans and I found a diamond unbelievable look\nAn individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease it outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met in right away we just click like brothers and when the Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery\nAnd draw the sketch or the suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due the sketch of the suspect that is how accurate this man has\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes they immediately accept and\nPardon me I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends we did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called the tribal big foot\nWhere he went outside of hoop a and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd I'm kind of how it started\nAh you said you don't have a dog in the white meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps and the big world right\nOh bingo uh when I started the most local the most audacious\nThe most vulgar\n[laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kinda went down that path thinking well it must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around who drew the sketches Harvey myself in Harvey's wife Gina ... also an agent for in Oklahoma\nWe were set in stone disbelief because the sketches were very human like yeah they were huge yeah they had hair all over the body there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss\nAnd they didn't look like apes they didn't have that apes characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera\nAnd it was just shocking and\nWhen the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady in to a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it studied the Shockley what you look like\nAnd when you talk of the authors they would consistently say this is another tribal people he's on animals these are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with him at least and coexistence right\nYeah ... ... in the tribal area at the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map and he said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see him\nSo we think about the ... areas the trinity river like great salmon and steal head area\nA has just so much wildlife and if you drive through hoop uh from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains and I've ever seen anywhere in the world\nAnd there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I I Know that they're seen eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou uh I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but can you summarize as a law a man and a former law man at the state of the evidence about whether you'd say there is that there is there's sufficient evidence that something is real here right now we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it and many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a a a PHD named Melba catch him and Dr catch him\nWas one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs tissue blooded cetera that we'd bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America to test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many of them were ... were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA and then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva\nAnd all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA\nAnd what they showed was that the bypass had went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the females side to the Arab region to ah Jerusalem to\nA Jordan ended that part of the world\nThis was when I was sent to Gen bank and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her write a white paper about this and during that process of getting the DNA ...\nPart was is that we got nuclear DNA and what the showed was that the ... went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the female side to the ... Arab region to ah Jerusalem to\nA Jordan ended up part of the world\nAnd this is when it was sent to gender and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen back came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her write a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting DNA one of the places that they used was when we see in a crime lab completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that the the samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't know this but you and I work together to introduce melt with two of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\n[noise] she wants to some of this but she didn't listen to all of that and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you are strapped all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science which people don't in\nWhatever you want to call them and before the break David Was explaining how he and some colleagues had collected up a whole bunch of samples dozens and dozens of samples that were submitted to\nMarry a a very precise DNA kind of testing the paper that was written by Dr Melba catch them maybe had some personal I'm a observations that didn't belong in the paper but the the DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\nWell that's the part that I I don't think a lot of people understand it a this wasn't some half ale treatment it was\nIt was the best of the best that DNA was sent to force certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake all of the ... got the same results or it was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you could see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her now people are going to say well how do you know that's big for their well pick for heroin looks different than any other mammal hair in the world\nAnd I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big for her and help a physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a raft of all the different mammal hairs in North America\nAnd when you look at a big for her it's entirely different so if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle it never went on to DNA but if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using their hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with is the real deal\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that nobody did to extract this DNA and to get the results\nAnd there's a lotta different what attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together\nAnd it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes that's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nAll the different mammal hairs in North America\nAnd when you look at a big but here it's an entirely different so if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle it never went on to DNA but if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using their hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that number did to extract this DNA and to get the results\nAnd there's a lot of there's a lotta attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together\nAnd it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes that's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's kinda like the UFO world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very bitter conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their make their passion to different levels um to the point of\nRoger let 'em material um and ah will stab people in the back end will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence ... ... at a minimum\nUm people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's human but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part but the second says it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual\nBut it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part that everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with a human match on gender thing\nAnd when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours\nAnd how could that be\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break\nAn irrigation pipe and it was kind of surmise that\nSay a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appears that a big foot was trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all matched this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this\nThat people haven't read the study they've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia of the data and read the report because it's available online and see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit Melba she's a genius scientists that figured this out\nUm it's unfortunate\nYeah because it got down to a row and under the under the bus and she did as well um you you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or are they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it\n...\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I mean a lot of times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really a\nTremendous writing in some of these old articles a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading and often making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories you have in the middle there are all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eight now did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seem to admit that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded\nIs two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as the description twenty four used eighth gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else\nNow the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U. S. sixteen and Canada three in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the bulk of them and then the states with the most articles about it\nA whirl Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana eleven New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six and then the numbers keep going down from there but\nAgain it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article and the missing\nBut they started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell out of Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentations his genius\nIs a lot of people say oh you know if you're overlay this map with the maps of big foot wild man disappearances there all the same and he puts up a map of like Bigfoot the ah appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes on like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything because you know this Napa because this is a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can\nYou see how they're kind of associated the locations as the big ... [laughter] and\nBut it was his statement about giants that were found in past centuries in mountains and in a excavations that really kinda got me thinking or these giants\nThe big for that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories you're in Nevada you know the ... century showing the legends and stories about the big ... bones or a giant bones that were stashed in that came up in northern Nevada and Ah yes what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find them\nWell why did these articles pointed to um some universities would get 'em but the the more likely candidate where all these went and it's set in the articles was the Smithsonian\nYet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nLook back and some of the descriptions there's one\nReally kind of got me thinking or these giants the big for that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there were some of those stories you're in Nevada you know the ... century shown to you have legends and stories about the big ... bones or a giant bones that were stashed in the game up in northern Nevada and uh yes what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find them\n\nWell why does these articles pointed to a some universities would get 'em but the the more likely candidates were all these when and it said in the articles was the Smithsonian yet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nYou look back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book is from the Maryland that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three\nDescribing an elder a witness sees this on the south work number rubber an animal between twelve and fifteens the tie it's a shape resembling a human something the head with it which is an equal proportion to the body the seat or two feet long and Harry\nUh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the description semi modern descriptions of big\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds I I was stunned because nobody talks about it\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLose this Alison channeled Tom I'm runs around\nHe was coalition fighting the Islamic state groups

heard a hunter say there's no way I could shoot it it looked to him and\nIt ... I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that\nAnd I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got skew where they said they started looking like him or apes and animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill it's not going to happen\nThere are some are reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and they invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nYeah and uh probably the one case in you know about it the Minnesota Wild man\nThat has a lot of injury to it because I've seen pictures of it and I've seen descriptions of it and it is unusual and nobody quite knows what happens to it\nBut a lot of people just to pursue it and say oh you know it was that was a fake meant for the circus but the more you dig into that one there was something strange with that\nWell I find myself rooting for the wild man or whatever it is to get away and all these cases so I'm Glad it ends up that way you know you look at where are these reports come from there from major these are major newspapers too I mean the Boston Globe and the San Francisco newspaper LA Times ah and the and it's some great writing\nSome of these descriptions is just terrific writing\nIt it's somebody wasn't just bone and get in a when they were working on this story and the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas\nOr that's not where we associate big one sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why we do Hi yo in Pennsylvania so prominent in the numbers and it's because\nI mean that was the center of American civilization and is Seventeen hundreds or so seventies and eighties where the bigger cities where it wasn't exactly the frontier because there are people out here as well but\nUh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived nine\nOr ... and it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to look at the siding locations in conjunction to the giants sightings\nAnd skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first established civil\nIt's it's somebody wasn't just bone and get in a when they were working on this story and the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas\nOr that's not where we associate big butt sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why would Ohio and Pennsylvania be so prominent in the numbers and it's because\nI mean that was the center of American civilization and is Seventeen hundred or so Seventeen eighties where the bigger cities where it wasn't exactly the frontier because there are people out here as well but\nUh that's where the bulk of the population probably live time\nOr exactly and it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to look at the fighting locations in conjunction to the giants sightings and skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first stab Bush\nCivilization and cities that as we move west where were these locations but then even though we're thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings\nWell that's Bruce Maccabee with Ohio he's a friend and I I went to spend four or five days within earlier this year\nAnd the strange things that he's told me that have happened in Ohio in the air and on the ground it's really strange\n[laughter]\nRoost man can be a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy a boat in person and on the air and in his books uh you know it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big butter sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nWide I'd never heard of him either and a\nAgain a surprising surprising fact that they're writing about it from there and then in the ... they there's an article from there about a citing ... when you look at the descriptions that they're offering almost identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts\nAnd then when you think about present day sightings again from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\nUm you know some of the descriptions obviously you have to take him in a cultural context now I don't remember when the jungle book was written but ... the character Mobley um\nYou know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that you've collected here\nCorrect and er I people always telling me well what about the star wars creature that looks like big for me how it's kind of strange\nThan it was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's the similarity um some of the descriptions I guess I wouldn't have to leave your way here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying\nThat the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of thing which suggests to me maybe they were human maybe read they really were literally wild men out there\nWell then usually and occasionally even nowadays you hear about it for wearing clothing and kind of goes unexplainable because why would they do that but you know maybe it's\nSome association maybe they're trying to break a barrier or if they're seen maybe they think they'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared you know we could all thrown our conjecture about why that may be happening but it happens too often for people to be fabricating it I\nI hear it occasionally but not very often\n\nUm if you were to communicate with the tribe these days a ... a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the ... are there any other tribes who was a people that have a relationship one going with the whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one I mean there's there's famous stories out of Arizona New Mexico and the high plains out there where\nUh they have these and there's many times an association between and this is where they put people start their head start spinning but fact\nWe're there's this association between big foot in UFOs\nEven in the hoop a book I wrote that many of the tribal people said that they saw a UFO and coast time and space to the point where they saw Bigfoot and they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds\nAnd when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars and they're they're not once they have your trust they will tell you hey\nYou know there's this association between us and them and there are different kind of try and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did\nAnd when you start to go back and you look at the history of these certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big but people that die hard don't like it the UFO diehards or like it even less than they they're not comfortable with that at all\nBut you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are in all the way you up those are where they're from\nBut um there was enough cases are over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book you can't ignore it I thought the ... there was a couple of stories clippings where are there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures are engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really is unusual several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm and I start talking to them about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents so they own a huge dairy farm and he went out there and talk to them and there's all this I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know\nEvery once in a wall Mike how will come back from nowhere completely milked\nHe goes I don't understand it [laughter]\nThan the the same man told them he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property and something tells me don't turn around\nGet back on the horse or get back on my ATV and leave and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property I don't know how it got there\nSo dogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of the dairy farmers way out in the middle they're going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nYou know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I recall I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're at a particular this image of a big what milking a cow sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat\n[laughter] and then\nThe same man told me he said you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property something tells me don't turn around\nYour back on the horse or get back on my TV and all the and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the core of the property or how it got there\nSo dogs yeah I I think when you get the trust of some of the dairy farmers way out in the middle they're going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what a what they eat and they'll you know they're at a particular this image of a big milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of groups\n[noise]\n[noise]\nRight here we go calls for my guess Dave ... first time caller Gwen in Pittsburgh hike when\nThey're um thank you for letting me on your show first of all welcome second of all\nDavid I have had many sleepless nights listening who everything about the missing persons like it is one of the most unsettling thing that I've heard in a long time [laughter]\nSo good job on your findings um I Want him to talk about the big thing I actually think you're I really love how you're saying it how it's related wild man\nI'm I feel like drones are also at the way that we could find out more about wild land because there are Amazonian tribes that were just discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like\nYour ideas revolutionary and I feel like with them and I hadn't years will definitely have an answer because drones and my question is like it's going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones were going to be good for fighting for that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on missing people uh hasn't worked real well and you can't use the drone international park it's against the wall and there's a huge fine so probably won't happen\nThat George Bush is going to the next call I had a question for you and maybe you should kind of\nTouch on it for the people here your work on skin Walker ranch the researchers there saw something very similar to a big ... can you tell us about that\nAre actually multiple times ah it's more of the tribe that that encounters them they've seen them there as long as they lived there there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers\nAnd we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal rounds they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and uh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was\nA just outside the window and as soon as the dog's made a noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing the light on it it took off running and it went all the way through the community\nAnd you could hear it it I mean it was just taking these giant stride it knocked over garbage cans of your head alarms going off and the police officers chased it\nUh I think they they found some tracks it led to a there's a reservoir there that's just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared\nOr they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself\nI'm I shouldn't call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we've described on the program before where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin Walker rigid seen what looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floating just off the\nOff the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it ... through infrared you can see the the bowl of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel and through this tunnel this\nAnd you can hear it it I mean it was just thinking these giant stride it knocked over garbage cans you had alarms going off and then the police officers chased it\nAh I think they've they've found some tracks it led to a there's a reservoir there that's just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared\nOr they are seen similar creatures on the ranch in self\nUm I shouldn't call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we've described on the program before where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin Walker rigid seen what looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floated just off the\nOff the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it ... through infrared you can see the the bowl of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel\nAnd through this tunnel this creature started rolling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through struggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the er at the entrance to this uh this tunnel stands up it's eight feet tall I'm feature lists dark humanoid shaped\nLike a head with no neck on a on a body it's just stands up and then starts moving up towards getting Walker ridge where these guys are watching it and they can tell ya they got the hell out of there they were very scared about the whole thing but\nAre there have been multiple sightings of that by a humans by um scientists by dogs uh\nUh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and um has seen it all over the you went to Beijing so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures\nAre that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual phenomenon and we don't know\nUm west of the Rockies Kyle in Utah my Kyle welcome to the program\nHow you doing All right so in your mind\nSo [noise] so I had um you're talking about David Was talking about Joseph stealing sniff the ones you talk to keen on his saddle um he saw big foot\nIt happened in Eighteen or over five\nOf us are Eighteen thirty five he was on his way to another ... and he was with a possible at a time that the prophet and he ... he ran into a cane and uh he describes Cain as the as a tall a fear that was taller than his saddle\nAnd ah just to fill these just talked to a cane and the heat and Kaine introduced this though is that I'm a man\nI'm personally wanders here in there and I might goals will basically he she wanted to make men misery or the destroyed their souls that you brought that up I just thought\nIn mourning culture LVS ... that we have you know there's two stories are really Seamus that story than just chilies this too is Joseph Smith nephew you\nKnow his brother had an encounter the Wesley Smith in Hawaii at the dedication and the lady Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one\nCame came to read the doors of the temple\nI'm In his hand or\nA Wesley Smith said that he that was the priest and to cast came out and somebody he wants his hand and they just crashed a cash yeah king wrong and so it's interesting you say that we can and art church you know like some people who are skeptical I ate there kind of hush hush let's not talk about it\nBut as people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted but I just wanted for David like with the disappearances 'cause I've been reading this book for a little while and stuff\nI Do think it's a big foot you think it's like he does he have any idea what's going on because people are asking me you know like people don't need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you a Kyle and everyone listening here tonight is probably the the weirdo experts in their family and then there are ... social circle a you and uh and everyone listening is likely they go to person in their own circles for information about these kind of topics\nThey are to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that likely a big what type encounter or is that something else\nWell the description that Smith gave was would match big foot but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the big ... may be some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nOf Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence that he's come across that they joined the two topics\nAnd the other things like in the Smith and sent the part that's unusual is that it came and it spoke to him and he never said it mind spoke but more like it spoke to him so hard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things\nI've always stated that I'm a man of facts all of my books are filled with facts there aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion and why do I do that because there are no facts to it to establish any current pattern that points to one suspect\nWhen you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA\nBut again if you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met anybody who's read my books and they have been thousands that has come to me and said I Know exactly what's happening\nDoesn't [laughter] and I should point out that you know you did to address this may be Kyle didn't hear it but there are no credible of stories in your view of big what being responsible for recording people off as far as you know\n[noise] well no no killing them I I think only him okay there's\nThere's a story that John Green wrote about a prospect or that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man\nAnd he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and one of these ... grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended up dump them in a cave and he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them\nA it's a it's a really really good story who and the individuals or time sign an affidavit\nI followed green bleed and said this is a good way to document the stories I hear and that's kinda how Kevin came to pass\nI remember that story now yeah that is a good when is it there are some other account in one of your books about a witness claiming to see a big what type creature carrying a person through the forest\nAnd he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them a it's a it's a really really good story who and the individual at the

going to be a routine voyage across those needs the from Guam for the Philippines and all my street west down shot\nAnd right when she was in the middle of the Pacific or stays in the middle of the Philippines the on July thirty is Nineteen forty five just a few minutes after midnight\nOr she intersected course with the Japanese submarine called I fifty eight commanded by lieutenant commander Moshe Sarah I should note of caution fired six calls for he does\nIt Indianapolis with two of them\nThe first one almost completely blues without off the shift Indianapolis was a heavy cruiser\nThe second one hit or it and it shifts the vessel went down and twelve minutes and you know we've been talking longer than twelve minutes it was very very clear about three hundred men went down with a shift a\nLittle under nine hundred made it into the water alive and when they made it into the water those who survived their wounds were very optimistic if they were going to be rescued and but uh they weren't and they spent five nights and four days in the water struggling to survive\nAnd ah as you mentioned earlier they've they fought madness they've fought the hydration they've a shark\nOr eventually they fought each other because of the madness and that is the story that most people know about Indianapolis\nShe was spotted completely by accident on the about mid day on the fourth the fourth day after five nights in four days in the water and only three hundred and sixteen and survive\nSarah secrecy plays such an important part in this at every step of the way and it leads to tragedy threatened with tragic tragic results because of the secrecy of the what they were carrying\nThe water those who survive there was we're very optimistic if\nThey were going to be rescued and but uh they weren't and they spent five nights and four days in the water struggling to survive\nAnd died as you mentioned earlier they've they fought madness they've bought the hydration they've a shark\nOr eventually they fought each other because of the madness\nAnd that is the story that most people know that Indianapolis she was a spotted completely by accident on the about mid day on the fourth the fourth day after five nights for days and the water and only three hundred and sixty men survive\nSarah is secrecy plays such an important part in this at every step of the way and it leads to tragedy threatened with tragic tragic results because of the secrecy of the what they were carrying and it continued it's already continued over after they drop them off\nOr what did you share with us the house secrecy or I ... which obviously was necessary military necessity or lead to tragedy and and how you'd probably interfered with your ability to get at the core of the story\nAbsolutely I mean there were multiple areas that\nHelped secrecy and the story that led to the demise of Indianapolis and ultimately the men being\nLost at sea for five days and you know first of which being how messages were transmitted across the Pacific during the war you know there was a level of coding that had to be taken into consideration and you know one of the ships that\nIndianapolis was to report to when it arrived in the Philippines was an admiral McCormick and the message he received was garbled and so you know protocol said that oh it didn't you know didn't come through clearly and no one asked for a repeat so they didn't even know Indian Indianapolis was supposed to be reporting to them\nYou know that was one of the first thing I'm so when she didn't show up they didn't know she was supposed to show up you know um aside from that there was\nProtocol that noncombatants ... the rivals didn't have to be reported and so when she didn't arrive you only tenet thought well I guess I don't have to report that either and so\nHe took it upon himself not to say anything even though he knew the ship wasn't there and these were all put in place you know to protect our vessels during wartime but the secrecy of that and the protocols ultimately lead to her not being found you know and then\nBeyond that\nYou know we had broken the Japanese code at this time and there were a message trafficking going across the Pacific and the Philippines the reporting you know various subjects in the area well none of that was related to captain McVeigh\nBecause they didn't want anyone to know that the codes and been broken and we were using that and so you know\nHe should not have been\nThere without an escort he should have had you know\nTaking a step back Indianapolis was not you know made really for combat it was made to get to a scene or to a battle quickly and have guns and so she should've had something you know first of all that sold our second of all that had\nAny harm or ability you know the armor too yeah and armor I\nMean she was part of the treaty cruiser so her armor was exceptionally sin compared to many of the newer shift and so that was one of the reasons why she saying so quickly or you know\nSo all of these things kind of came together to form the perfect storm and so much of that played into the secrecy of this mission and why she was out there and why this information and wasn't passed along to the captain who may have made different decisions knowing that there was a direct threat in its path\nTo me that was it difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I I Know there's been so many wrong stories in wrong conclusions made about what happened there then I Would think they might still be suspicious even decades later\nWell I think a big part of it as I mentioned is that I had spent several years visiting with them and spending time with their families talking with them that you know with no other interests other than learning their story\nAnd so they I think trusted me by the time that I actually wanted to start doing interviews and putting the story down on film or you know the screenplay and eventually as a book can lend as well when she came in we had this trust built in with these men that they knew and genuinely wanted to tell\nThe accurate story however hurting however long that would take we would tell the true story\nWas uh it it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters you you you have to know these people a lot of the people who are characters in the book obviously didn't survives you're using them together I guess from people who didn't know there but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS I'm In Indianapolis oh Lynn talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat's right one of the things that we tried to do is really pulled back to land on the Indianapolis story because really the man uh before I get passionate is just to to you know\nCircle back to him\nThe man who carried the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis was an army named Robert an army major named Robert stern and and he had spent the last couple of years after the war running down all of the ... material that they feared the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bombs\nAre on the continent of Europe\nSo once that messing with complete and then burn and carry decision about components of little boys attending an island\nUm that is the final grading the editor of the European and the specific conflict and so in writing the whole book we try to pull back that lands and bring in a lot of these other characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese point of view so in addition to hash in motor we had and for your you know and the county has got easily and come highly commander\nYet a commander ... lieutenant commander how should not have as I was saying we tried to present the Japanese point of view\nIn a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great you and your passionate is um\nWell it was it and then more for published after the war first published in Nineteen fifty two Japanese language and it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America and English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two that written from commander had him at a point of view and there was a chapter on it the voted in Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War and in this World War two in general\nWe were able to really develop his personality a lot he was a commander who cared for his men he was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese that Marines and\nReally against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic Afghan military um he went around saying on doors after ... radar and more technology for his that marine because\nThat means that Marines didn't have radar right up until the end of the war\nAnd so he was very frustrated because he was saying a lot of it is rather than commanders\nGo down to solve the grave or lack of technology they're carrying you had a wife he had three sons um and eventually in addition to his\nUm [noise] book which was called on\nUm we were also able to interview his granddaughter a and yet even more information about his later life half of war\nWell as we'll find out a little bit later he was kinda ticked off because of the U.S Navy I mean the took the extraordinary step of having him testify at a court martial per capita McVeigh and then uh\nThey didn't really want to hear his version of of how things went but we'll we'll circle back around that I'm Sarah when it gets too are the moments right after these torpedoes slam into the side of the Indianapolis\nA chaos breaks out um you know we we heard that clip from Robert showing the movie jaws saying that no signal was sent a note distress signal\nAre not exactly true but sort of true why don't you pick up the story there almost describe those next couple of chaotic moments after the torpedoes hit\nSure well it was just after midnight so you know the moon was behind clouds that had been an intermittent cloudy night and so and that was part of the reason why you know\nI don't know if he would say it's lucky for how she not obey the clouds just part in the movie came out for just a moment enough for him to see the silhouette of the ship and so you know after it was struck\nThe power went out with the second torpedo and so there was no power on the ship they couldn't communicate over the first ever see you know the ... the sound system and so there was no one to say abandoned ship you know over the speakers there was no one to tell people to report to battle station\nThey had to pass that from mouth to mouth well this is a six hundred and ten foot long ship the great big ship so with the chaos happening and the ship thinking and twelve minute you have to imagine that compartments or flooding incredibly quickly you know the ship is starting to help first to\nThe star bird and then it goes down by the bell so\nMen are being trapped inside\nThe ship unable to mix tape from their apartment and you know Lynn and mentioned before they believe about three hundred men went down with the ship and even further to this because there wasn't any direct command able to be broadcast to them then people started abandoning ship very shortly after\nThe ship was torpedoed all the way in hell you know\nMen went down with her and were able to escape so these men were spread out for over a mile and a half\nWhat they believe and you know those who went down on or went off on the cyber side the low side they would have been with more of the supplies you know there were only twelve raff that they believe got off the ship\n'em but you know standard protocol at that time was to go off the high side ports side well the majority of it\nSo men are being trapped inside\nThe ship unable to his state from their compartment and you know Lynn and mentioned before they believe about three hundred men went down with the ship and even further this because there wasn't any direct command able to be broadcast to the men people started abandoning ship very shortly after\nThe ship was torpedoed all the way until you know\nMen went down with her and were able to escape so these men were spread out for over a mile and a half\nIs what they believe and you know those who went down on or went off on the ... the low side they would have been with more of the supplies you know there were only twelve raft that they believe got off the ship\n'em but you know standard political at that time was to go off the high side the port side\nWell the majority of the men went off outside\nAnd there was no supplies so they weren't in rafts they were you know\nSomewhere in even in life jacket some were holding on to flotsam that they could find in the water as long as they could until they could get to someone who could help them you know a fellow ship made or whomever and others had to just swim until a sailor would pass away\nAnd then everybody would help them take the life jacket off the dead Taylor and put it on them\nI mean this was incredibly chaotic\nSo scary and these are sixteen Seventeen and Eighteen year old and that had just got on the ship\nNot some of them not even three weeks or months earlier you know they just went on board and right before the last mission\nHadn't really gone to any drills yet some didn't know how to swim and they're just thrown into the middle of the Pacific at midnight it's pitch black they're covered in fuel oil because in a you know an effort to save the ship but the last moment\nLieutenant a red ban actually released the fuel into\nThe water and so this is very very sick oil that can only be transferred with heat so it's like tar on these men and they can't tell who anybody is they can barely breed they're swallowing it their vomiting there\nAt this point they're trying to stay alive some have injuries and they won't last much longer and you know they they say that those who head injuries didn't really make it past the first day\nBut the men who were able to escape without injuries were still suffering are from the early stages of dehydration because of vomiting this fuel oil so no one's in really great shape\nYou know by the time the sun comes up the first morning but they're very optimistic that rescue is going to come because they believe\nThere's a ship in the Philippines waiting for their arrival\nAnd there wasn't you know there were attempts to get a signal well it just didn't go I guess they they they they they weren't successful\nExactly um\nI guess within a couple of days it becomes clear that they know what's coming or if they're coming there they're going to have a hard time finding it because as you describe in the book they're spread out all over the place in these big waves are pushing the group's further and further apart right I'm\nLynn maybe you want to talk about that a little bit are you in this context there's incredible acts of heroism that you describe from some of these sailors who were doing their best to help everybody else and then at the same time there's some incredibly selfish acts of brutality that happen as well\nWell that's right um there were incredible acts of heroism and as you mentioned in as Sarah mentioned the currents they move in about one mile an hour in that area and they also move in these sort of giant eddies or world if you will\nAnd so two men that would be together\nIn the morning could be a mile apart by afternoon and and all the time these twelve sits well some days it's it's clear his glasses on the day of the rescue but Sunday's there\nThese twelve swells along with these current so over time over the course of the the five nights and four days the men become spread out over a twenty five mile area and I'm\nOne of the rescue pilot later wrote\nThat from altitude\nI read the plain looking down on a situation like that the head of one man would be the size of a human hair scene in cross section or diameter from across the room so basically\nThey were invisible and you mentioned acts of heroism access cowardice\nOne ... one real hero was I'm\nA captain park he was the commander of the Marines detachment that was aboard the ship and\nThe largest swimmer group and the water the they did as Sarah mentioned\nThe men in the water we're spread out initially over a mile and a half and then they just got further and further apart with those currents the largest group that had nothing but life jackets was about four hundred men and captain park within that group and he really than\nTwenty four hours a day trying to keep them in together the only resource that that group of men had besides their life jackets which not even all of them had life jacket\nWith a single line that was about a hundred feet long and so they form that line into a circle and the men were to tie themselves to the line and captain park would uh\nHelp them in that didn't have life jackets and several times he would get a life jacket from the dead sailor and then give it to another man who needed a life jacket and he did this numerous times\nAnd he would round up the stragglers and encourage everybody until finally on the third day he succumb to hallucinations and and he died and when he died that group became very desperate because they thought wow if this brave man can't make it how are we all going to make it\nAnd then in terms of cowardice um you had precisely the opposite happening with with and then being a selfish\nAnd men are even officers taking place on a raft for example when there were wounded men who needed the place\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\nThere's this hour from town all dot com armor

not and then it didn't make a difference\nBut he was testifying and Japanese through a translator and the translator did not translate exactly what he said\nUh correctly and commander ... could

and Japanese through a translator and the translator did not translate exactly what he said\nUh correctly and commander ... could understand enough English to know that that not enough to really repair the damage\nAnd also he was you know in this very intimidating environment and so I don't think it was really can conducive for him to sit there and argue either\nBut I'm In later interviews Sarah handout from his granddaughter that that was something he always regretted with that um he had been translated incorrectly and that had and that ... in part had been kept in the day\nAnd he was angry years later zero right at the with the retiring of the USS Indianapolis Sabrina namesake ship many years later a there was an attempt to get him to open up and share the story and he wanted nothing to do with it\nExactly you know they're a commander built or I'm Sorry captain built Tony who was the commanding officer of the Indianapolis namesake submarine when she was a\nHe commissioned bill went over and tried to talk to ... and he said they didn't believe me then they won't believe me now and he wanted nothing to do with talking with him you know but he did what\nI was actually pretty incredible as he actually wrote a letter you know\nKind of flashing forward a few years to the exoneration effort ... wrote a letter\nExplaining his side of the story and saying that the captain should never have been found guilty and you know kind of did what he could do in order to help exonerate this man\nYou tell the story in the book about it might be sixty reunion a group of survivors and kept the McVeigh shows up and he's not exactly sure how he's going to be received by by the group because\nYou know he was court martialed um he received as you noted the book these terrible letters from the family you didn't really been punished enough\nAnd um you know\nReally tripping him for years afterward so he shows up at this point six you bend and how was he received or when\nHe was received with open arms he have very much dreaded going to this reunion in Nineteen sixty he hadn't seen these men [noise] except for just a couple of them but most of these men he had not seen\nSince Nineteen forty five right after the court marshal so they decided to have a reunion and they have their reunion in the ships named safe city Indianapolis, Indiana and captain McVeigh was dreading it but when he got there they actually um\nTravelled out a dozens and dozens of survivors and their wives met him at the airport and they formed\nTo receiving lines are across the tarmac because they didn't have debt ways the way we do now they would they would just say would be playing right onto the ramp and so they formed two lines and when captain they they got to the bottom of the aircraft floating stairs\nSomeone shouted attention on deck and everybody's snap to attention and then they began to chair and the clapping and tears came to his eyes and he he couldn't believe that they were receding him so warmly and that continued through the entire reunion weekend\nSure it's a little bit about difficulty in getting materials you talk about going through archives and records are here with me you did you run into road blocks that you could not get house than if so what were they\nActually one of the the documents that really helped us pay the biggest picture was the quarter of inquiry documents and\nYou know I had tried for years Lynn had you know come into the picture and\nJoined me in this effort to get a copy of this document and the reason it was so important was that it was really the first recorded testimony of any of the survivors right after the sinking so you know just days after their rescued there in the hospital in Guam and their testimonies are taken and so\nWe tried everything to get these documents and this actually this specific report\nAnd we would come back you know oh it's last forever oh one you know we got one copy of it and it was entirely redacted and you know\nFreedom of freedom of Information Act should've allowed us to have this and then you know we contacted the the source again and our contacts said well we don't have an an redacted version doesn't exist\nAnd so interestingly enough you know a a friend or actually a a young man who became a friend was the grandson of the rescue pilot who landed in the water and same fifty three men his and\nHis grandson was actually um\nI'm an inspector general sorry I was trying to remember the title he's inspector general works with the navy and he was actually the person who got us this document and this kind of showed us really testimonies of what happened not only when the ship was torpedoed\nAnd those final moments but what was happening in the water because in the court marshal they did not allow any of the testimony is about what took place in the actual water because they didn't you know that would impact how\nMcVeigh was viewed in so it was kept strictly to what took place when the ship was torpedoed\nAnd the events leading up to that so this new quarter of inquiry document was so important because you know Seventy years later stories can change or stories can be impacted by other stories but this was the purest form of what really took place\nNot only when the ship sank but in the water for those five nights and four days\nWhen you talk about uh the wife immediately after they were rescued what it was like for the survivors where they were taken I I Would assume more of them died after because of their injuries and exposure\nWell a few did die and and if you can imagine how awful that\nWas not only for the men themselves for their families to know that they had actually made it all the way to rescue\nOnly to die of their exposure in their injuries um so I think three hundred and twenty were actually rescued is that correct Sara\nYes three hundred and twenty were rescued but only three hundred and sixteen ultimately survive so they were taken to base hospitals around the Philippine see eventually converging on Guam where\nThey had um some time to recover before they had to give their testimony\nAnd then they went aboard the USS homeland ... which was an escort terrier and they actually landed in our home city of San Diego where they were actually participated in a parade and then uh\nOh that was not only for the men themselves for their families to know that they had actually made it all the way to rescue\nOnly to die at their exposure and their injuries um so I think three hundred and twenty were actually rescued is that correct Sara\nYes three hundred and twenty were rescued but only three hundred and sixteen ultimately survive so they were taken to hospitals around the Philippine see eventually converging on Guam\nWhere they had um some time to recover before they had to give their testimony\nAnd then they went aboard the USS how ... how ... which was an escort carrier and they actually landed in our home city of San Diego where they were\nActually participated in the parade and then a very quickly they went home uh caught buses and trains back to their hometowns some of them and they got out of the navy\nSome of them had survivors leave and then got out of them stayed and made careers of the navy [noise]\nUm and you know this was the greatest generation so that that majority it and then they just kind of put this behind then they went on to have careers as engineers and fishermen and everything you can think of police officers\nThat there were those he could not hold a job and there were those who became alcoholic and um had many many struggles\nAnd almost to a man none of them talked about it and not even to their families um they held it in years and years and years um some for sixty years um but\nMostly they talk about it today that would be a lot different I think people would be out trying to get a book deal or a movie deal or something like that but these men were different\nI think about that though Robert ... character in jaws you know you got that story bottled up he becomes a short cut her as a result of being one of those guys and I'm\nA that's a very moving scene and that was great I was going to use that clip anyway I was really glad to see the coverage in in the book a zero did you always have in mind keeping that in there\nWell yeah it's really you know when they're gone across the country talking to groups about the story in this book you know one of the things that really\nComes out every time that that most people learned about this story from ... so it's an essential part of the stories history is that you know the public learned about it this way and interestingly enough some of the children of the survivors actually first heard about it and that their father was involved in it\nTo learn more about ASU online degrees tax now two three five ...\nThat's N O W two three five five one set and\n[noise]\n\n\nSarah share with me your thoughts or would you heard the news I think it was last year that the ah Indianapolis had been found a through this a mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill Tony who is that gentleman I mentioned earlier the\nCommander of Indianapolis and no bill is contacted by the navy and he called me and there they found the ship and\nI didn't know what he was talking about it for them and still dating my faculty in yeah realize what was going on very quickly started I mean this was something that several people before\nPetrol group which has the vessel that we're supposed to go for finding the ship there's been several attempts and they were the first one and what was interesting about it they said you have three hours before we released this information to the press\nGo ahead and call the survivors so villain I spent the next\nAbout four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill ... who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier this some commander of Indianapolis\nAnd you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and since there they found the ship and\nI didn't know what he was talking about at four in the morning of and so you know gaining my faculty and you know realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before\nA the ... group which has the vessels that were ... responsible for finding the shipping and there have been several attempts and they were the first ones to be successful and what was interesting about it is they said you have three hours before we release this information to the press so\nGo ahead and call the survivor so villain I spent the next three hours are calling the survivors up and being able to share with them the news that they're shifted been found and so that was a pretty incredible experience to hear their take on all of it\nWhat's their reaction in general\nIt was really\nI mean it was very somber was most of them couldn't believe it actually happened in that have happened in their lifetime or\nWhat [laughter] mostly reverence and then there was a young man by the name of a famine Lopez he was a sailor and Indianapolis in the day the ship sank hit a really good day playing dice with his buddies and so he wanted to know if they would go down and find his money stock\nThat winning [laughter] you know across\nThe board it was general you know respect and reverence for the story but you know there was a ... a couple of funny quotes here and there from the guys that you know they're always sailors that hurt\nAnd inland you know we've heard a little bit about road blocks split up to the information they uh you know where they were not entirely helpful at every step of the way to get the story told what about reaction to the books come out from the baby oh boy\nWe've been very very gratified by the reaction there is um an admiral named Hancock who is the director of naval history and heritage command\nAnd we make contact with admiral Cox at the survivors reunion and I believe it was funny if ten or twenty sixteen and we said\nWhile through we'd really like to have your the port in your health on this and um he was helpful and directing as various resources\nBut if you can imagine sending this real work at the heart that you've done to try to honor these men and honor the legacy and how the whole story of the ship and and give the entire\nHistory and draw new analysis about various things that happen in the story you can imagine taking that and then sending it to the director of naval history and heritage and and saying hey sir\nHey admiral what do you think\nOh boy we were we nervous about that that he really really has endorsed this story and I meant as his full court since he saw what he what we came up with\nWell I Know Sarah has an award winning documentary film about it sure seems like it would make a great movie I'm a big screen movie any thoughts about that\nWe are actually working on that right now so stay tuned\nOkay we'll take a couple of calls I've got some other questions about the west of the Rockies Jerry in Modesto, California as a personal connection to the story I during\nYeah are you doing my father was a on the ship was the first one of the road to rescue those shelters in the water and I still have one car being you know you you ... you know\nAnd I never saw him I ... years past ... years ago but I never saw him cry ... talk about that story\nThat's amazing what he a wiki on the USS that peace will take the oil or the bat that the you know the name of his ship that the man\nWho ... and I don't remember it's on ... stone and I would use ... before I call not yeah what was the name of the ship there needs to me she was the first one who knew him\nAnd he was talking ... huge horrific you know he tried to tell the story a little bit and my father never talk about in the about\nEgypt all that you know all those years you know\nHe was like a you know just missed part of the ethos of that generation that those\nOh yeah yeah he was doing when we're too and Korea or he was going to drink donors may first class you know but he ... he was a police officer who's officer for Thirty years without an incredible story\nAbsolutely heroic to go into harm's way like that and um if he was aboard the Basset\nOne interesting story is that the commanding officer of the ... that was considered to be a coward by some of his men and indeed when they arrived on the scene he didn't really know what he was getting into and ah he needed it\nAt that had been found could probably buy a submarine that they didn't know what exactly had happened and there was um a sailor who spotted a large shark and the water and he said look at that fish\nWell fish is another word for a torpedo and so the captain stereo he tried to get everybody out of there\nHe said he said I'm all ahead full we're going to get outta here we're going to leave the scene and his officers actually need need and lock the captain in his state room and continued with the rescue so it'd be interesting if your dad was had been on that ship\nThanks jury appreciated wildcard line running used in the morning on good\nOr my father was also in the navy and he was on a destroyer escort Cecil jade de oil he was twenty six years old he was the end and Dr\nAnd what's interesting over forty years I had opened up\nOne of his uh I guess she just you know of all of us remember was\nAnd I found unbelievable and eye witness account a letter\nOf the eye witness accounts from the doctor's point of view of the rescue of the survivors I've got the letter in front of me it's faded August fifth Sunday at sea\nAnd it's a phenomenal letter I think the uh women would love to see this\nTo read this is talk about the sharks it talks about the fact that the pool these guys up kicking the sharks off the rear end showing 'em up with the with a line given a morphine given him penicillin\nThis is an unbelievable letter from the um view of the doctor and it was my dad\nAnd he has been that some of the reunions\nBut never did talk about this\nBut the fact that I found this letter it's about five six pages of the whole account its its history its historical I Would love mindset a share this with a
