think we're watching for alien mostly I mean maybe\nIt'll British TV show what would the U.S over that base intruder detectors said they called it up I think it got to our version of it I mean I don't I don't know what else are you when they're not doing a whole heck of a lot of science and it\nSeems like with the point where either we should just built this thing out and expand it and turn it into Babylon five or something or we should just give up and let it crashed down to the earth it's with one of those two because we're at a turning point I think and are we going to go forward with an American manned space program or not it really has time for us to make that they\nSaid well we were very fortunate that we did not lose the astronaut and the one we have to literally\nGoes to four thousand instead of two thousand so\nNo that that's the real advantage when when they correct is much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that nothing nothing beats that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the person and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on us right that's right well what are the indicators I mean the market the last two days and it's really taking it on the Jim what's the cause for them is that just panic or what what's happening\n... well two things in and actually they both relate back to the good old Donald hum last week you saw 'em treasury bond you you know the yields on on\nAnd and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're on a true well what did the indicators marketed the last two days is really what's the cause is it just ... which\nWill will will to things in and actually they both were laid back to the good old Donald\nHum last week you saw 'em treasury bond yields you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year bonds shoot\nUp I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this would happen and we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to a four point three percent in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and higher or lower it so\nYou know that that was the first thing to happen but the second thing is is you know concerns over China I mean there's this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do\nIn China may be cheating and a lot of ways by China's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh if China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide\nA downturn in crash and so so it was rising interest rates and um and and and more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about\nFor the last month at twenty six forty I'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know and then a few years ago it crashed\nForty five percent of three months and then I have this kind of limp rally for years and has been waiting to go back and we said look at breaks twenty six forty that that's a sign that China is starting to go down again and it it did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat there's something wrong and and again that was the biggest concern a lot of people thinking oh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates was the first black these last two days had a lot more to do with China and Trump is really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways\nAnd Trump has been boosting the economy with tax cuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff\nAnd that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes grows to go up temporarily and what does the Federal Reserve going to do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do if the economy's overheating they raise interest rates\nIf it's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous and and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I created this great thing and the trumps wrecking it no this was predictable he's not\nYou know he's got some you know gut feelings we got to do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences\nOf things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pulled back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um yesterday's\nClose what happens when you're in a couple more D's downturns tomorrow's another five point drop then people started saying there's something wrong\n[noise] yes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this at the beginning of the year markets peaked in in late January real kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough\nWe have a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kinda like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude what happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling ensuring\nThe market it happens very quickly you'll see you know I've seen this the last seven\nStock bubbles throughout the history of everything from the Nikkei and the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash in every other one in the last century including the tech correct in recent bubbles that first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half\nMonths when people get whacked\nAnd that's the sign that that's the only way you know the the bubble\nHas finally birth the problem is by the time that comes people already in trouble and they're panicking and they get whacked hard so we did the danger sign is that we keep going down and and and literally the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just a bounce after\nYou know fourteen hundred points it may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers Seventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand um to doubt if the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes\nThe markets and the traders\nAre going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds keep going up\nThat this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not\nFifty were fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy\nEighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash\nWill happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make bubbles so dangerous um uh you know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross trial once you know when somebody asks what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early\nBecause that level to this is above\nAll this isn't a normal bull market\nCorrection a nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles go up dramatically and they crash and in half the time and they crashed twice a is dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this this is a once in a lifetime of vent\nAnd it it the science to me are building we've been telling people man this looks like a top here and if it doesn't top here and we only get the good part is we can gauge as if we only get a normal ten Fifteen\nPercent or so corruption by the end of the year than we're probably good for one more route one more Trump rally into next year before this thing blows but the right now though the odds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand the subprime mortgage crisis will boost the as bad as that time period\n[noise] ... well this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George not only ... decades in advance on demographics the baby boom peaking\nAnd and and and causing a down turn out to the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries well what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and in their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nThe low interest rates in the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries have developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kind of light went sideways and didn't deliver joined it emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty to seven\nAnd just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nLow interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries to ... we were already too much in debt so we just kind of\nWent sideways and in the laboratory emerging countries want on this free and they added sixty Seventy trillion more on top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world\nAnd and do what was your cracking you seek turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyper inflation runs in trouble\nChina is slowing and and like I said they have the biggest that Bob ... anybody in any time in history when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so\nMy view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand I recession and starcraft because they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop it they just spill the backup with money that was draining\nThis time more debt everything's more stretch the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have wars debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of like I said earlier instead of a fifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty\n... dos absolutely huge and that doesn't mean the companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back ... done for the website is his name Jerry dent D. E. N. T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff the sale of a lifetime and zero one\nCoast insiders the new version of that goes to ... am map is now available for iPhone and know Android ... listen live we're on demand anywhere anytime good acoustical stadium dot com and downloaded today [noise]\nRight again well any time you get a major downturn recession or stock crap like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure that's a good thing recessions are necessary\nThe Federal Reserve and government the recessions is bad thing they're good things um but and then you want to buy the company to survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a Super Bowl I mean the tech bubble took five years to build but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half a six\nTo seven times kind of like the bitcoin bubble here recently\nCracked and a lot of companies when other well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if it apart Amazon there oh my God I was you know like a you know\nA hundred and fifty dollars and now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies and you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually\nGet the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also go down I mean General Motors in Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent that ended up being that was it ended up being the greatest company and the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing\nSo that's the secret and and the other thing is\nEven if the earnings of companies if companies are so good that they keep their earnings flat instead of declining evaluations stock how many times earnings white people will pay\nThirty times earnings for the typical stock right now or forty and sixty or eighty for the best ... those collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down fifty percent even if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator for looking at some of the dangers what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know it it's called the smart money\nYou know if you tell us it's not a secret anymore well I I Know\nBelieve me Wall Street won't do this any way so you don't have to worry but\nBut what what happened that they're the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stopping in and then when things go down there that wants to jump in and buy when when when they see the old investors are over Boston in stocks or about they're the ones that short first I mean they're in the know\nAnd and and they can even watch all of us are doing their the sharks they eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff\nWell they you can measure\nThis action what there's an index from Bloomberg call the smart money flow index and what they do is that dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes I mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures market there ahead of everything\nWell they you can measure this\nAction what there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is that dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes I mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions in the futures markets there ahead of everything\nAnd so the market's gonna open down it opens down right at the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves there may well that's when the dumb money and most people would stop or something to protect themselves that's when those reactions made that's the dominant\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit and shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour into the clothes so they measure this indicator measures but the smart money is doing versus the dumb money and the smart money\nHas not bought this rally in fact they've been shore to get they've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom February this year after that crap\nNow they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to January top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the steep is declines and smart money buying and that\nHas been a strong warning signal to me uh in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico new\nI Am in Puerto Rico and I went through a hurricane worse than Michael\nI had to hold my windows from blowing out my condo it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here\nAnd Michael both of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blowing off all around\nMe you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stop it it it's just unbelievable it's like can you know God's got angry or something you know into through a temper tantrum don't you moved there\nWell I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and coal labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has the acres in Calais wrote\nTo islands that are like St Thomas and or or St Croix or St John and and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there in in I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family for many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working\nOn this place spending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade than it was when I first started coming in\nAnd I said to my why don't we moved here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality on a corner of the price of South Beach Miami where we used to live and and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport\nWhich I get to twenty minutes an advanced they don't even check your id they just wait to see how you're going to ...\nI'm not sure I liked that part well\nIt's fun to play it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane flight it scenic I'm I'm I leave my condo doing and landing on this island and one hour and once I got down here I realized I could qualify\nFor some tax advantages here which are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or investments for a living in the crypto geyser coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualify there's real strong tax advantage so\nI'm living much cheaper than a man of great climate I can still fly to New York in four hours director Miami in two hours and in almost anywhere in the east coast is now it's difficult if I'm coming out your way but I have to go out to California which I just did for a long time that that the long haul now but I tell\nYa I I like it down here they've been in a recession there's no civil unrest a recession for twelve years we're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent ear and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd then I'm just going to see what happens in the next uh so\nMany years the big banks down there\n[noise] [noise] yeah yeah yeah about ... and ... down here and actually a lot of the banks are by bank of popular and Santander or Spanish Banks\nBecause this is by origin more of a Spanish country but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and nice malls and stuff but they there are ... George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here\nOn the U.S postal service so people either just because they think we're in Zimbabwe or they charge some huge X when there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special\nPasta sauce and things like otherwise man this is a good deal and you know I'm Down here for other reasons but I'd say people ought to be Americans\nOught to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower education for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower um\nMy name in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that they aren't allowed to vote in our elections\nWill will most important they are allowed to freely mover immigrate they don't have to even apply and in most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities and then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico\nTo put their kids to colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then sometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving\nTo the United states why sixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida and so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants\nFrom Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people that's why they have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides in the u._s. it's better to help create good jobs down here the tax advantages rather than just out now subsidized\nPuerto Rico because the U.S as always always rubbing their best people and again it it's they're more professional educated people that are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\nSo I Want you to use your impressions of what you think will happen economic Lee Bush country seems to be mired right now ... conflict\nYou ... you know unbelievable never seen it yeah and I think it's going to affect the economy\nYeah it does it's another reason I'm kind of happy to be here and watch what's going on this was a major theme for

get into the final calls here Harry thank you again for the amazing information you always give us\n[noise] yup love the richer people George people need to hear this\nJason in Portland, Oregon welcome to the program Jason go ahead\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the market that you're doing\nAnd as we get into the final goals you think you would give me information you always\nLove to reach people George because people need to hear this\nG soon in Portland, Oregon walking to the program\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the market is the new secular and has to do with them off\nAnd I happened to get in and mid July you speak for the huge and in the canopy well is that the average company which happened to be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually doubled in value\nOn the bottom fifty thousand two hundred thousand portfolio but my question is would you um would this kind of be offered a little bit particularly until the ... election this November because\nThere are several states that are looking you then have it on the ballot and if they legalize usually when that happens there is a kind of an upswing or would you pull out of that and now as it is the nature of uh what you're talking about taking place\nWell you know yeah that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend and even block chain and crypto currency is our but all of these industries above all these these are hot sector like this will get hit strongly when we have a downturn because first of all everything gets hit\nBut the the the strongest sectors get hit the most 'cause they bubble up the most and people don't understand that same with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most in history has shown that so you do have I mean I I Would say in this case you may want to hold on just to the election and see if there's a pop and yes I Do think\nCenter and such a hot sector take your games see what happens the next few\nYears especially the next year is going to be critical and then yeah things crash that is a good sector to get back into this is\nA long term social political Trent it's going to go in that direction although there may be some backlash and the downturn just because people get a little more conservative for a while but but you are in a good soccer but yes I I don't want to be an actor when when things crash\nAnd and and that's what a lot of people miss a lot of people say well this sector will do All right because\nI went and the great depression than tire thirties and look for one any major sector you know toilet paper um utilities movies you know boos you know things that people would maybe use more than a downturn and and because of that collapse and valuations and that\nFear factor everything went down I couldn't find anything\nAny major stock sector that made money in the Nineteen thirties only the high quality bonds that so yeah take your games\nYeah again in your case I might just see\nThese elections pop and then\nThen go the other way or do fifty fifty you know it it's up to you but there is danger there you're right about that\nPeriod when the when the bottom falls out of you know what you do you how do you know when the bomb\nWhat will again I mean we have clear we look at past\nQuestions I mean everything's different this is not like you know the eighty two thousand eight to nine cracked and it's not like the seventies correction stock corrections back then were fifty percent\nThat's more typical this is more like these great resets ... de leveraging of a bubble debt and financial assets which of course stock is are the leading ones\nWhen that happens Seventy percent is kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed\nEighty nine percent for the Dow eighty nine percent so I'm looking for levels like that I think my range\nIs Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start looking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now is that thirty year treasury bond which is a been a three point four percent recently\nIf that gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent that's when I started by even though that's the best thing in the downturn\nIt's too early to buy that right now you're going to park you might just be unsafe short term bonds and CDs and T bills and stopped to preserve your money next step is moving to the long term quality bonds and then in ... and these sectors I mean commodities while in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first\nAnd then developed countries stocks and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities so I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like like like like a marijuana and pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a slam dunk winter long term [noise]\nWait for the guy you may get to buy into that a little earlier than something like you know home builders\nNext one is to do good Kentucky first time caller for civil Whelan\nHey George a lot of the show McConnell correct me if I'm wrong here but ranch cites a Republican you okay Bush dies or Democrat Democrat or\nMake then did you not say earner or did I miss understand you that you said the south was ran during the civil war\n\nYes they they would have been they would have been more even though you know they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican Party in the south and helped get Nixon elected through southern voters\nAnd that's a whole different party had to convince a lot of democratic politicians and senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so you the Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean\nRead is Republican blue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now if you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor\nThe Democratic party just like it did in the thirties where you had Republicans who were coming into that when things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people there that you know the ... they'd go to the Democrats in a downturn in a book in a bull market and the rich are getting richer\nAnd a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are our long term research shows we are going to switch from Republican area here to democratic one for a number of decades and that's just something you know the blue people are gonna like that the red people won't but all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPart a son and my work Republicans are always going to be here Democrats as it's a play of opposites that's just as important as men and women and booms in Boston inflation and deflation and every other play of opposite and it goes back and forth the same thing\nThe west has dominated the world uh since since the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century it's going to be the east and that's another trend we can clearly show to cycle so so what we do\nJust show people here's the trends this sector that sector inflation deflation this country that country blue ... I mean\nWe can do all this stuff the long term it's surprisingly predictable and that's where economists get it wrong economists think the short term predictable I'm guessing when I tell you I think this thing's gonna top now or so many months from now I'm making an educated guess that may make me sixty Seventy percent right but never hundred were nights\nCountry blue ...

myself floating on the ceiling looking down at my body and dead\nBut you know there there are ways to produce and out of body experience how there was a neurologist in Montreal Dr Robert Penn field was able to his mapping out the different areas of the brain and he if he put on like trickle stimulation on the right tempo cortex he's able to produce and out of body experience [noise]\nThat that doesn't tell me the out of body experience originates in the van that tells me that the that everybody's being will protests the out of body experience\nUm and you know the types of out of out of body

they can leave the room they can leave their house you know they can actually traveled to different locations\nAbsolutely now do you find that the the people who tend to have these kinds of experiences are believers in the paranormal or not\n[noise] I'd say no not at not at not initially\nBecause when this happened to me I certainly wasn't a believer I didn't even know such a thing as possible\nAnd I've just kind of learned about the paranormal as I go along and as I have these experiences um another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen years old and how is the second year medical student I dreamt of us ... exam the night before the exam\nAnd when I went to the exam the next day the first question on the exam is the same as the first question in my green\nCost you have the answer that you knew exactly\nSo I felt like that dream helped me past my exam but I didn't tell anyone about it because it seems so unbelievable in fact if someone had told me that story I probably wouldn't have believed that\nThe name of the book is called the borders of normal with some time or a clinical psychiatrist you by the way these stigmatized says paranormal phenomenon tell me about the book\nWell one of the reasons I wrote this book has you know as I say in the subtitle I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena because what I found and this is my own experiences well when people have these experiences they can\nBorders of normal with the subtitle a clinical psychiatrist you by the way these stigmatized says paranormal phenomenon tell me about the book\nWell one of the reasons I wrote this book has\nYou know as I say in the subtitle I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena because what I found and this is my own experiences well when people have these experiences they tend not to talk about them because they think people are gonna think they're weird or their stranger there's something wrong with him right they're losing their mind is something like that\nBut I'm trying to say that a lot of people have these experiences is quite normal to have these experiences I mentioned that the word parent or a month for example the ... parent means beside so we have paralegals working beside lawyers have paramedics Paralympics and so on so parent\nNorm I mean beside normal it doesn't mean abnormal\nAnd there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I give her reading or if I give a talk somewhere people come up to me afterwards and share with me things that have happened to them which they never told anyone\nSo I'm trying to make it more acceptable for people to talk about these things\nAnd that was really what motivated me to read the book\nDid you ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died named Dr shift ... curricula\nNo I'm not familiar with ... she or her oh her in a it was my aunt\nAnd she ... she went to a Oxford University and she got her degree in psychiatry yeah and specialized in all kinds of things and then decided she was giving all that up to study telepathy\nAnd that's all she did she wrote a couple of books was called breakthrough the creativity of but she was convinced\nTotally convinced that to love to see was the real deal and the and again the psychiatrist seen that and so you're the only only other psychiatrist I Know that has really jumped into this\n[noise] [noise] oh well I'd like to look for that ... that sounds very interesting breakthrough to creativity I'm definitely going to look for it but you know they're being on books written by physicians but near death experiences for example even Alexander a proof of having yeah\nAnd his nearest surgeon and marry the Neal she loved to have an ... she's in our therapeutic surgeon and of course Oliver Sacks is and there are just he wrote a book called hallucinations so physicians have written about these things but I haven't found another ... who's written about paranormal\nYeah you're going to enjoy them I mean she she just do the devoted her entire career to them uh she uh she passed away and a very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in a radio\nFilled in there oh no I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show or no you that's terrible ...\nHow does he got so interested in telepathy\nShe just always was and there were so many things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nWell that's good but I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor these medical center in New York\nWhere they were studying dream telepathy\nThe ability to transmit information to people who are dreaming and in that study they had Sanders and receivers and the receivers were in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to ... to ... G could measure what we call REM sleep rapid eye movement\nAnd then once the ... gene state the Centers for giving random images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on those images and try to send them to the receivers and they found that people were more susceptible to ... to ... the when they're asleep\nAnd it's also true that people are more susceptible to like to see when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happens spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with more Dr mini majors with us his book the borders of normal [noise]\nGo students ... the new version of the coast to coast am apple is now available for iPhone and no enjoyed for not only listen live on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative um that actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh there's so until you mentioned her name she was out in the hall\nAnd there was one study that was done in a hospice with dying patients and they found a lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they call them visitors\nAnd as they got closer to death these visitors became more frequent and these visitors are these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting\n[noise] so yeah I think those those deathbed visions are very common\nNow one interesting thing about death bed visions is that sometimes there are shared by people at the bedside there was one case of a woman in India who is dying and she says someone a deceased relative who came to take her to the other side and every three sisters who were at the bedside also saw the same person\nYou know it's not so unusual isn't it it's\nIt's unusual but there's been several cases like that three of in some cases where the medical personnel at the bedside saw the same vision that the dying patients saw\nAnd that's interesting because you know people who have deathbed visions the skeptics would say well that's because they're on medication or because they're confused or because they have a shortage of oxygen is the lack of oxygen to the brain they tried to get some kind of physical explanation for it\nBut it's visions are shared than those explanations wouldn't be valid because the people at the bedside wouldn't have a shortage of auction to their brains\nAnd they weren't on medication so um\nIt's hard to know how to explain that\nAnd there again the people who have these visions aren't necessarily believers in the afterlife but these experiences are quite common\nWednesday when Steve Jobs from apple computer died many you know he was quoted as saying\nOh wow oh wow\nRight now what do you think he's he was making reference to\n[noise] well I Know some people who are dying tell her relatives they see a beautiful landscape beautiful vision\nYou know I'm a bright white light you know a spiritual beings you know I'm a feeling of unconditional love you know these are some of the things that I imagine that Steve Jobs was experiencing\nYeah that could be that would be no skeptics course say what the you mentioned that you\nKnow it's the body itself is doing all these weird things near the ...\nHow can we argue against that\nWell there was one study of um\nCardiac patients who had been assassinated after cardiac arrest and this study was done by a cardiologist and he said of of the the patients who who died in ... Eighteen percent of them had a new report it in near death experience\nBut it's that experience is due to lack of oxygen to the brain than they would have all had it because they all had a lack of oxygen the brain\nNot just as a small percentage so you know that's one thing but then the other thing is that um these experiences are reported around the world not just in the U.S there's a lot of cross cultural studies that\nShow that these experiences are in many different countries and they've been getting reported throughout time\nAnd one study looked at patients who are on medication\nVersus patients who weren't on medication and the patients who weren't on medication who weren't confused and he didn't have a shortage of auction to the brain had the same experiences and were able to report them just as often as the other patients so um people are skeptical I think for a good reason and I think it's good to be skeptical\nBut it's also good to keep an open mind\nWell that's that's true in ... you you've talked about under deathbed the vision that they sometimes see a little bit more than just a family member they see other kinds of visitors as well explain that\nWell the other visitors aside from family members they could be someone that they were very close to or sometimes they report angels coming to the others I'm coming to take them to the other side\nUm especially with children and there was a pediatrician nothing more to work this dying children and he said the dying children didn't report deceased relatives because their parents and their relatives and friends were all still living\nBut they've reported seeing angels that we're having to take them to the other side I had an experience at my father's funeral where I saw two angel is one of the other side of the costs and\nDid anybody else either\nNo so I could say I know they were a product of my own brain no one I saw them\nBut in my own mind I saw those angels and they were just as clear as day standing right in front of me and I had the idea that thought came into my mind that they were called minutes during angels and they had the idea that they were minister and my father to help them make the transition it's the next level of the next world and\nThey were the most beautiful creatures and I didn't know what you make of it but that's usually when I decided I Need to start telling people about what's going on because that was too much for me to keep to myself\nDid they see you\nI don't think so okay I don't think they were there for me I think they were there for my father\nRight so they didn't acknowledge you know you know you saw them\n... ... now the other thing is when you say in terms of deathbed visions you know um if they were produced by certain chemicals then why would the um visitors only ... the people who were seized why wouldn't they be other people as well\nThe other thing is sometimes these visions of these people they're the person who is dying doesn't know there may be a a brother or sister who had died is a case where there was a car crash and ... all one rather died and the other brother was near death so the the brother that was near death\nHad a vision of his dad brother but he hasn't been told that his brother had died in the same accident he didn't know that rather was dead and they'd rather cases like that to where the the deathbed visitors the person who is dying didn't know that that person was actually dead but because of the family orange despair than the knowledge\nPre ... do the dreams you lose your thoughts on what they are\nWell there again I've had the cognitive teams I mentioned one above the memory powerful above yeah exactly they're very powerful and the question is how do we know of a dream is a cognitive team or if it's an anxiety dream\nBecause often and you know when people are sleeping during the dreams they tried to protest\nAnd what they are [noise] well there again I've had the cognitive teams I mentioned one above the memory powerful\nAbove yeah exactly they're very powerful and the question is how do we know of a dream is a cognitive team or if it's an anxiety dream because often and you know when people are sleeping during the dreams they tried to protests things that happened during the day or things that they're worried about\nSo you know for example I talked about Abraham Lincoln two weeks before he was assassinated he he had a dream that he was murdered [noise] now we could say that that was a peak cognitive dream that we could also say that could have been an anxiety dreams maybe he was worried that someone was going to kill him\n[noise] maybe I think you also had a dream where he was in ... the White House and he walked up to ... you saw your ... by ... and it was him in the casket\nI heard that too yeah yeah so that could have been ... cognitive even better than other famous person who reported a ... interview with Charles Dickens really I didn't hear that yeah\n'cause when he would put a new book you travel around the small towns and villages and he'd give readings and so on so one night before he was to give a reading into a new town where he'd never been before he had a dream that and a group of people came up to him after his reading\nAnd a young woman in red Shaw introduced himself to her with four words she said I Am ... Napier so when he woke up he thought that was very strange she didn't know anyone by that name but he remarked that the dream was very vivid\nAnd free cognitive beams tend to be very vivid I'm often when we wake up in the morning I Dream start to fade but pre cognitive dreams stay with us and we remember every detail\nSo the next day he went to give us reading\nAnd sure enough after the meeting a group of people came up to him and there was a young woman wearing a red shah and she was introduced to him as nicknamed here\nSo so this stream was pretty cognitive dream and he didn't know what to think of it or or how to explain it but he he reported he had that the cognitive dream so um it's some people for example Larry ... is a person has written about\nThe ... century cognitive beans and he's written a boat when should we pay attention to a dream how do we know if it's if the cognitive team or not and he said we should pay attention to dreams first of all the agreements week current or if it's especially vivid or if it involves death\nI heard of a case recently where um\nThis woman told her husband ... that she dreamt that she and her children died during a terrorist attack and this is a number of years ago there was um [noise] I don't know if you've heard of it there was a air India\n\n\n\n\nThis hour for dot com either on the roster hundreds of thousands are still without power thousands without homes\nOr businesses as clean up from hurricane Michael underway in the southeast in Florida Mexico beach resident Robin ... says the devastation there is overwhelming\nI sound like [noise] I don't know I don't know how long will surely [noise] for me [noise]\nAnother resident dawn Vickers says it was hard to control her dogs as murder hurricane Michael hit\nMe in the water for [noise] for ground\nMeanwhile Michael drop from a category for hurricane to a category one is that arrived to Georgia and leader we can to a tropical storm worried health officials saying estimated one hundred thousand young children have yet to have a vaccination against any of the\nFourteenth diseases for what shots are recommended the CDC released the estimate on Thursday there's increasing pressure from Capitol Hill to determine the fate of a journalist who disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in\nIstanbul more than ...

Amazon you can find different lectures and things about that and over the years of\nThis book written by a B. Y. U. religion of ... philosophy professor and over the years I was just listening to coast to coast it's just been quite remarkable that\nThere there is so much of the paranormal uh that that can be clarified and expanded upon perhaps against some understanding about the ... of of the journal nature and our spiritual nature as well and\nUm to switch to another topic really quick [noise] I'm a ... years ago I had a dream and it could've been induced by a listener on the coast to coast a lot about you ever do experience\nTo friends who passed away only about I think Thirteen Days apart from each other about twenty five days after the second one I had a dream it was very vivid now this dream as for about\nThirteen Years ago I think and uh I can still remember today um I don't remember what happened before earlier than some of the dream and I don't remember what happened after the events of the jury in my dream but\nThe but it was a very vivid and I want you to hold that thought and a retailer hot in your consideration about the possibility of\nA the certainty of Dr Christine Blasey Ford about the advance that she said happened to her\nBut yet all the people that she mentioned a single one of them knew anything about that and uh the dream that I had was that um that was my my brother's apartment\nWhere the second round the little house he passed away playing basketball one night with my brother and um he at the end of a list timing the dream the cells to my\nBrother and me I'll see you later and he looks at me and he says and I'll see you and Thirteen months and I knew he was dead oh ...\nWhat it was a a pretty young lady that was wearing like quote a charcoal grey quote um could end quote a standing next to him I didn't know who that was had seen her before\nI mean this is in a in a dream\nThat sort of all and dream and ah and I thought you know and and every you know the people that I knew that dream or\nLike when this all of a sudden the apartment was completely laid out I can tell you exactly the spot where once said everything about it\nAnd um and so ah and I I actually did try to take action I got life insurance and I figured there is a fifty

church so I think there is a connection\nYeah they're most definitely is just remarkable how this works Manny ... it's it's you know let's call it the gods factor or whatever it might be but it's out there it's real yeah the big question is why did the ... the first place what do you think\n[noise] the ... the first thing that came to my mind if it's out there to make our lives more meaningful\nIt gives us a different level or a different dimension to our lives and then somehow gives us something to feel like what we're going to even if it's a painful experience can have some meaning it can have some value\nAbsolutely okay let's take some phone calls here for you we will be given by going to Joe in Long Island New York to Joseph go ahead\nYeah Hi Maddie I Want to ask you a little bit more about the dreams are interestingly I had to dreams\nRecently that began with a preference of the day it's set of October first\nAnd I ended up at the beach I go on the water it's a little rough but this other people's while they again it's um usually warm which would be the case that I Want but I never really had a dream where it started off given the ... the day which was the same day\nIn real life so my question would be with your dream about the test the next day which was you know you had the first question it's it's\nAlmost like the dream was a personal coach for you [noise] ah so I ask you about that you know what you think and the case that trains are going to a really acting in your favor number one and then if the dream is\nNot quite calling and what and you're thinking that the aspects that are still really current and have card applications that you could cherry pick and how would you do that well first of all your first question\nHow do you know if the demons acting in your favor well I'd say is is the content of the dream a warning you know is it something that can be helpful for you and your daily life is telling you about something that's coming out for you and your life or is it about another person so I'd say it's acting in your favor\nFirst of all if it's a boat you not about another person\nAnd if it's and if the action is beneficial now in terms of Kenya cherry pick I Would say yes because it can be some super fluid sort of extraneous materials energy and that's not necessarily related to the main point is sixteen\nSo I think to a certain extent you have to take out those parts of the dream which you feel applied you in which can be helpful for you and your daily life\nBut now to Joe\nYeah that's that was good yeah\nOkay good next up we're going to marry in Seattle, Washington west of the Rockies Mary going in\nHigh school stopped there also perform because I won't right on well\nDream stay he's talking about my father is the most prominent before he died a week before he died I tell people my father walked up to death and shook his hand and went with it I'm Serious a week before he died he was talking to people he was just so happy he had been sick\nHe wouldn't tell us why you sit and read before he yeah he told the neighbor are you ready to die\nAnd she was shocked she says oh I don't think about that and no way I mean he was just\nUnusually tapping the and the night he passed it was three in the morning I was sixteen he woke me up at three in the morning and I was so silly in that\nUm my brothers and sisters and I knew most of his brothers and sisters were dead they're out on the porch there waiting for me and he said I'm going with them and I was so he said look a little kid to seal I looked out the screen I didn't see anything and oh so he ah\nI went back to sleep because that was so sleepy three in the morning he over deadly laugh I didn't know what somebody woke up the next morning and my mother's like have you guys see your dad and I told her I said mom\nHe told me last night he was going with his brothers and sisters and she was like shocked she knew\nThe ramifications but I get you know and my dad I think he was part native or something but he always told me he said when\nOlder people in the native culture get old you said they go out in the woods you're somewhere and they die I've heard some people in Alaska get in a kayak and just go out in you know the water and\nThat's what he did he want 'em\nTo the area that used to be an Indian burial ground area and they found him like two weeks later and I think for many years\nIn the south some people who really spooky and if you die in a home it likes brain that stuff to it or he didn't want to fight and the kids I think that's I think it would kinda had us fine I don't know but he knew he was dying when they found that he did not look like he was struggling they said it looked like he did that when we're on just pass\nThat's a that's a great story in in many these visitors who come to us whether they're nearly deported or strangers but the business is there like a rural or a mission for them\nWell if you're talking about the visitors that people who are dying have definitely there's the mission because they help a company that person to the other side", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year":
