population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies a year and and so this Generation Z will be smaller yeah\nThat's a big trend Ken stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next hour here on coast to coast they um get\nDaily Show up dates right to your inbox for free with the ... zone newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com [noise]\n\n\nThere and welcome back in the ground back with us as we talk about trends the incredible trends that the I guess can not just businesses should be using things like this I Would guess anybody who's doing something marketing niche you name it should be aware of these things should night\nYeah absolutely if it does it it it's mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't think about this because it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\nWell it has to a large degree um\nThe\nYou know and what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that [noise] if people are still people when when you have a\nLarge number of people that are consumer or a specific product at a small number of people I consume a specific product the large number of people will consume more now I Know that sounds ... but the the the smartphone has\nA only aged folks in their ability to consume so it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint\nBut you have to keep in mind that\nThe thing that drives commerce and the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nThat that ... that simple isn't it\n... it almost sounds ridiculous doesn't it ... I mean who is out there saying well\nOkay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff I think it's bogus people consume smaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that because the the uh let me give you an example of it you know SUVs actually\nThese were were bought by baby boomers are Twenty years ago in in vast quantities\nAnd then the the um [noise]\nUm the other companies had to figure out how to sell\nThe same number of SUVs to a generation X as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so that they kept on firing their marketing department said it kept on firing their\nTheir chief marketing officers because they couldn't come up with the secret is selling as many SUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group\nOf generation if I had to make it easy for small\nGood point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to me a couple of days ago and she said pop on you know kids are age you know what she calls herself for Cuba but she's a young woman now uh we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and you know it's funny because I'm trying to figure that\nWell good point my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to a couple of days ago and she said ... you know kids are age you know she calls herself for Cuban she's young woman now uh we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and in you know it it's funny 'cause I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born or outside of wedlock they're they're born outside of a of a marriage [noise] um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture or where Seventy five percent of the kids are born outside of the the uh\nUh marriage ... it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that though ... whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you affect change\nWell\nYou know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you you mean in terms of\nChanging what the culture is doing I think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do in right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million\nGeneration why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back to the forty years\nAnd ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies with the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up uh you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the Jew or sex drugs and rock and roll what happens in the ... the boomer hippies\nLive became Republicans [laughter]\nIn all cases [laughter]\nNo not at all cases but you know if if you if you look at [noise] [noise] [noise] that this this is ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise]\n[noise] ah\n[noise] between the ages right now I'm thirty four and fifty three we have a diminutive puppy a population of of indigenous people that were born here they were there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five\nAn eighty four as opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million born between forty five and sixty four\nWhat does that mean that means that that that particular population could not a support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nAre superimposed over where the heavy lift or should be ... whereas it was you know our our strength should be in our population it's actually smaller\nSo the net result is a you know ... instead of having a\nYou know ... ... and they should have haves and have nots with with the cushion in between\nOf generation X we don't because they were never born we're losing that cushion\nYeah well what we did and as you so you you have people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have the have nots but middle age\nAnd and I'm In a middle income or our\nOccupy exactly the same space so if you're middle ages small and then your middle income as small as well but it's a demographic issue is just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this too I mean let let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got the billions of people on line or they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because of what they do socially\nWhen I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to do just becoming a change their war I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting the bank for a dollar a year or you were converting these in the sales\nBecause the market may not be what we really want what's happening with that a\nFacebook is kind of a strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks listen it if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the customer you're the product\nUm as far as I'm concerned and I and I've got a Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry the Internet are um advertising is a bottomless pit\nYou have no idea what you buy none and there's no way to a reference any kind of success except return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet\nAnd and you just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go up your sales go up you you don't know if it's if it's a relative to how much money you spend on the Internet but uh what what's happening with a a ... a enterprise there is is not good it really isn't\nI mean it's huge trend here and to me the trend is very negative that it\nIs involved in what's negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous\nI I don't trust 'em\nA Facebook at all I I really don't I don't think I I think you have to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can be analyzed and then the ... and and that analysis puts people into categories and those categories are are sellable\nAnd and what the secretary does with that information is sell it to anybody who will pay for it\nSo there there's there's there's no security and anything that you put on Facebook nothing\nAnd well what about you know some of these wacky job so you know the idiot that killed the loving people when the Jewish synagogues ... the guy who sends out these bombs these pipe bombs they use social media to kind of spelled their hatred um how can we can't catch them a little sooner\nYou tell me I I really don't know that Robert dollars and in a a Caesar salad and they are they are truly whacked jobs and um I don't know that that's that's more a a more\nUnderstanding of the of a of a psychic graphics than a demographics as far as I'm concerned\nIn what's happening in the housing market most younger people aren't buying houses they're renting what's gonna happen\nWhile they're renting because they [laughter] a trillion dollars of student loan debt you know\nYeah but don't worry about it now what we're what we're literally facing with um\nA kids is is you have eighty seven million kids that are between fourteen and thirty three years old the kids are finally moving out of their parents' basements they're throwing loyal as trophies they don't deserve and and uh they're starting households and getting married you know starting a household is you know it could be an apartment or it could be a

have a polarized country in the country is polarized\nJust like it was in the sixties early seventies because we have a huge population of young people\nIn a huge population of old people and in

screaming without putting you down for your views and that's what it's all about that's the way it should be\nExactly yeah so so might make a comment today and it would be thank you for your position if you forgot yelling at me [laughter]\nThat's good zero in Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead I\nCan to question so it it talked about the wall Street Journal having more head for patients that are ... and one issue than ... people have that it you know then\nAnd how the system that's a nation of explosion basically it's a lot of people pick and choose a their information or even at a a professional level what what's half the size of the sense that if you look at Japan people used to like\nTwenty years ago the people just work twenty four seven almost and it just hasn't worked out it and then the federal level in Japan for people with that high octane a drive to a stay at the office till they hide or whatever [noise] ah so\nMaybe they're lacking creative conscious something my second question would be about Amazon or I Know they get criticized\nFor putting out small from prior to us and I can understand that but at the same time this stuff\nYou can find on there that you can find locally even a even in New York for example I got I got this great gloves the shoveling my neighbors snow and that's the main thing I mean but I couldn't find them locally I got 'em on Amazon from like Minnesota\nI go for the first question again\n[laughter] inside just rolling on Long Island hey I'm from Long Island too but what was the first question\nGo ahead of us that's an odd cents again Joe Joe\nYou know now that that's for an example of explosion that video you know like half of everything people get on a smartphone I think of as video based\nJust how should people if they're trying to move ahead or in the world just pick and choose how they consume information what to emphasize a because it doesn't necessarily work out to put this grand that's er into something one that's just so\nSo much of the nation like you like a carnival is sad or on the ... what good does it though the ... it's just too overwhelming\nBut where's your limits are mayors are quite a lot of information\nThat we get is it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if I'm a a lot of eat the Gen Y kids the millennials are actually tuning it out you can ask them simple questions about you know what's going on in the world and they can't answer it but ... says how do you sift through this which you have to do is you have to compare\nSeveral sources that's and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations\nI really don't\nCome to any kind of conclusions unless I've compared a variety of sources and that's what helps me with information [noise]\nIn in terms of Amazon I think Amazon is just you know ... what we did when we open the Internet we opened up the world we we just that was our view to the interests of the world and I think what's what's going down with Amazon is just\nSomething that's naturally transpiring and I think if you're just going to get nothing but bigger\nYou're going to see commerce is going to change everything about commerce is going to change\nWe've done a company that shift radios they make radios and they make darn good radio she Korean company and I I used to get my radio from them long before I started doing this show\nAnd it was simple you you go on line you order what you want it's delivered to your house in some cases it's free shipping based on the deal that they've got at any given time\nI mean you don't have to park your car you don't have to spend money and gasoline you don't want us to find a crowd it's a ... it's amazing\nIt's amazing anyway\nIt's infinitely easier you know when you look at the

they're\nReally they're very happy ... oh\nYeah and I I Would describe to that what you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes [noise] one of the things that it's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and that that's going to you know remain\nIn place and remain as as a major issue going

what about India can they do in the same thing as China are they in a different position\nThey are there are really in an entirely different position and and but they have their own problems there about one point four billion people in fact we're not really even sure how many people are in India but we we ah my best guess is that there's more people in India that there are in China\nBut they have about a two and a half trillion dollar or GDP and then went and you know may sound like a lot but when you compare that to the United states with twenty trillion GDP there's really no comparison so it it's it's not India is not enough income is the biggest problem that India has is wealth distribution\nThey literally have haves\nAnd have nots you mentioned there's no\nOne in between and uh they they don't seem to be able to get a handle on that\nWhen when you in the hands and have not search you creating civil unrest and everything else\nYeah you would think that but they kind of a

and I don't know if you heard that uh Amazon is opening now Amazon Go stores and they're planning to open up a many many more three thousand\nIn total by the end of the twenty Twenty one how do you guys heard about that I Can't I have not the water goes she sores Josh\nAnd so basically you go in and you pick up a I guess the most popular items and you just buy it right there retail wise instead of on line so it's a retail store Amazon Go\nYou're walking you pick out I guess the items that they have there and the most popular items I guess that selling that monitor that week or whatever and you just pick it up and go I guess cellphone charger things of that nature ah extra\nInterests me then I Would use their website to let you know what products are going to have in the store at any given time\nI'm sure and that that's a great thing for people or of the older generation who don't really feel comfortable with uh computers they can just walk and pick out what they want to go it's Amazon Go\nInteresting take on Sundays earlier Amazon Go soon Sam is on go go go somewhere mind with Halloween coming up you know they want\nTo think that the concern that I Would have about that is the same concern that I had with Amazon taking over a whole foods and that is a when you have a brick and mortar store retailers details of very very different a kind of business Amazon has succeeded in so I don't know let's let's see what they do with this\nCould be intriguing\nYeah could be I ... you know whenever you sometimes are people that are successful get caught up in your own success and think they can do\nEverything everything that it's right\nYeah and so the the whole whole foods thing is sort of successful but I don't know I really don't know if they're going to make it with

forty million more people if if abortion was illegal or simply because I think people use abortion his birth control I I don't think they use it as a human it's it's it's almost like a\nYou know a a

um there's always this seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it\nI I I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so in an endless was a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a a small plane or buy a ferry or vote\nOr there was no

mother\nWhere does science fit into this gross I mean the you know you're you're you're in academia um yeah ... where the science fit in\nWell I I've been doing a lot of reading and a and you know I'm not a scientist but I did I've done a lot of reading and quantum physics and\nAnd I talk a lot to uh I I have communication with folks that have passed on and and that happened randomly before but now I figured out a way to make it more regular but\nSo I've asked an awful lot of questions and I've done a lot of reading and I've met people like dean rating or just you know wonderful and very easy to talk to and explain difficult things from what I understand what I Believe is that the the paranormal the paranormal world is actually the quantum world\nSo by studying quantum mechanics and how that works I think I have a good idea of how the paranormal world works and I've come up with a model\nOr the how I I fit in what what I understand to be going on\nNow you know tell them it's almost with that model might be well\nThe idea is that uh\nThat I okay I'll I'll I'll look at it this way so I ... in the morning I take these I call them a a meditative walks so so when I'm walking my\nOne way of looking at me and said I'm I'm a a a a a particle being I Am a bean physical being but if you see that I'm I'm moving and if you look at like in in in fast motion or whatever I Would be like a blur so I'm really I'm a I'm a wave more than I Am a a a a particle being\nAnd I and my my location\nIs is not just in one place so I I kind of see that in the in the quantum world that's that's what it is everything is in wave form and we don't see the world that way because you know the ... in the subatomic world but if you take it up to the macroscopic world than you think about that ah that\nI I'm not in any one location and and uh and and that's kinda how I see it and and I think that that helps me understand how how this works and the the other thing is these near death experiences that I've had\nA like for instance I think we have many forks in what I call forks in the road of time I talk about that in the book where we experience a maybe a near death experience or a close call and I've had a couple of those\nAnd in one dimension I think that's where it comes into you know a different dimensions I think that we we might die in that particular thing that that incident and another's we we live on is if that didn't happen\nOr and and sometimes we have knowledge of what the incident might have been or maybe sometimes we don't and uh and then we can have many of these forks in the road of time throughout our our our lives and keep going from one life to the next\n... but at the same time that we're doing that there's this spiritual part of us so there's actually two part there's the physical form and then there's the spiritual form or that that is eternal and that's where I come up with the uh the title of the book which is timeless that that we don't really ever\nDie\nAnd ... you have documented thirty for pure ... cases that happened to you have there been more you just didn't put them all in the book\nYeah ah [laughter] there there's a lot more and I have I've already written the second book he'll come out next year I call it timeless deja vu and uh I have twenty eight more experiences and I I I I kind of wanted to test the waters with the first book\nOkay I have I saved some of the more well I'll just say a little bit more bizarre stuff for the second book based on the reaction of the first\nOne well sounds like we're going to have your back about the same time next year on\nAnd I and I yeah I plan to release it about you know the late summer early fall and and then I I also have a third book plan too so I I there's a lot of the incidents the they keep happening\nI I was going to ask you about deja vu because it will save a lot of it so the next Bork but ah you had mentioned the experiences where you know you may have died in one life but not in another do you think that\nSometimes we might have memory of other existence is in other pure allele universes and that's why we have deja vu\nI I\nYou were you know you may have died in one life but not and another do you think that sometimes we might have memory of other existence is in other parallel universes and that's why we have deja vu\nI I I Believe so in fact uh I I remember as a as a kid and this is interesting because I think\nChildren are very open to the spirit world or the paranormal world but third that's kind of over the years it's kind of a through our education system or sometimes maybe by their parents are different organizations it's kind of a you know drained out of them\nBut I remember as a kid thinking I Wonder if I've already died and I'm somebody else now I think I Am\nAnd it's and and I don't necessarily remember a previous life experience from that but I I remember thinking that a lot I mean a lot\nAnd ah so I I I think that's interesting that that children have those those are you know those kinds of feelings but I'll give you an incident that happened just recently with me and my son we were driving here in Southern California on a sub surface streets and I I look down just momentarily I don't know what it was something\nThat dropped onto the floor monument or whatever\nAnd I looked up and when I looked up and I thought it was just a split second here I was hurdling through a red light\nOh it was terrible and and how old's your son\nOr he's he's Eighteen okay he's sitting in the in the passenger seat and freaky no yeah he he is\nAnd we're going through the intersection and on either side of it is a car you know two cars coming right out of so what was going to happen that I can see was that we're going to get T bone from both sides and just you know ... a pinch between the two\nUh and uh at that moment everything slowed down ... everything slowed down and it was if I had all the time in the world to figure out how I was going to\nManeuver your way around a\nYeah and the next thing I Know I I I ... through and next thing I Know we're on the other side there was honking going on in the cars when everybody was safe and a time got back to normal speed again I mean I I think that\nI think what what happens is that we had we had glimpse the quantum world at that point and then the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my friends have told me there there is no past there is no future it's all just\nAn eternal now and and that that's what I felt like and I and then I thought\nThis is probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time because then another dimension which we might have had this horrible accident\nIn ... knows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour oh at each other like that you\nKnow that there could have been people killed\nAnd it's at least seriously injured and uh and we were unscathed and so or the other two cars thank God I'm so it's I I I\nThat is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I I uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm\nUp at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception pass in the north end to with the island there is a way to reach spans that go from the mainland too\nWith the island the north end and there's a middle island called past silent and we always used to stop there when when we went camping and and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you can overlook the narrow channels that\nThat that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak up for the\nYeah the exactly ... and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then\nEverything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air was like everything stocked and once again I felt this this light and the warmth and the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling somebody's watching Uber's there's a there's some helpers out there for you I Want to come back in a moment we'll talk more about some of these others thirty

things as far as I understand have never been human\nNever will be human but they are very real and very scary out out to a couple of them\nI'm One of them was a a last about Eighteen years old I was in a very low place in my life very uh down I was a not very successful I dropped out of school a out of out of the University of Washington I was living at my brother's garage sleeping on the concrete floor in a mattress\nAnd a ... just ... the night before this incident happened I I had cut across\nYou know I I was Eighteen but I was still acting like I was a little kid I'd still cut across yards and jump fences and stuff 'cause just to you know 'cause I it it just an old habit yeah anyway I went through the yard of of an old lady who all of us in the in the neighborhood thought she was a witch\nAnd uh she lived alone and there was a story I don't know if it was true that her husband had died and she left him there for a month and told the neighbors complain that you know there was something\nSome kind of odd smell and then uh anyway so she their legend grew by leaps and bounds so I was ... I was cutting through her yard and I saw a candle light in the window and I just momentarily look in there she was and she was very scary looking person she had you know this gray hair that was kind of shooting off and all direction\nYeah she had this she had the old ... syndrome right\nYes she had the ... camp as it turned out cancerous or on her nose and she had me I felt like a deer\nIn headlights I was just frozen and I was just staring at her and she had it was either it was a candle yeah she had a candle in the window and she was just staring at me and it it just scared me and finally I broke away from her gays and I ran to my brother's garage and I and I and I you know went in to to I fell asleep well\nLater that probably early in the morning I woke up to\nA very frightening site or at the foot of my mattress bad that I was sleeping on the floor there was like a a call him a fire that was coming up out of the floor and I and I thought this is the worst during this is a horrible dream\nAnd so I pinch myself I slap myself\nAnd no I was awake in this column fire then spread over me in an arc from head from foot over my head you know probably six feet in the air and kind of like an art and like pulsating fire like a current a fire going over my head\nAnd it and if that wasn't scary enough there was also this this very dim what I Would classify as the demonic low gravelly voice speaking in in ... just these guttural tones\nAnd I'm not sure how long it lasts it it might have just been a couple of minutes but it seemed like it it took forever\nAnd ah it it was very very frightening and it was it was horrible and and I after it was over I was you know my heart rate was way up I was sweating\nI immediately called my my girlfriend and and ah I told her you know something terrible happened she said well you know why don't you come over in in in the morning and I did and I explained it to her and she looked at me and she said uh\nWell you know uh I think maybe we should call a psychiatrist what do you think and I said well just forget it you know maybe I just made it up but of course I didn't\nSee it happen and I I think it had something to do with this this old lady I think that I had frightened or or made her angry\nAnd something had been some and and I it was a terrible terrible thing and that that that's one of the experiences I've had it's one of the most scary things that's a that's ever happened to me and just as as I remember it as if it would just happened yesterday I could feel the heat\nI could hear that gravelly voice it just seemed to fill the whole room and yeah it was it was it was horrible\nWouldn't want to go through that again would you\nKnow no it was it was it was very real very reel to reel\nAnd uh nothing that it it's like I think what happens is that these kinds of things you know when you're at the lowest point in your life and that's when you're susceptible a and I I think that that that they seize that opportunity\nI think so too I mean they they know when you're down they know when you're on drugs or you're drunk\nYeah and that's when they get you and they get you a good time I don't want to dwell too much on the demons but tell us the other story\nWell the other one ah also of a foolish kind of thing a ... there was actually a a ... I was in Germany I was a soldier in Germany at working at the prison the military prison in Manheim West Germany when it was east and West Germany West Germany\nAnd uh there was a a a counselor at the prison of all people of counsellors like a senior and CEO and he\nWas into a a a witchcraft so he had invited me and my girlfriend to his his room to it 'cause he was bragging about what a you know powerful war locker which or whatever that he wasn't\nAt the time I was kind of I'm kind of interest that kind of skeptical but interested\nSo we went in there it into his room and he had this very frightening set up you know very typical Satan worshipping kind of stuff upside down across uh a goats had kind of thing going on and candles and\n... and that stuff so I said well I you know I don't think this is anything that I'm interested in and I got my girlfriend and we left and\nAnd he was being very very spooky and very scary about this whole thing and and uh so I decided that I was going to look into a a you know this kind of thing so I I\nI thought maybe as a defense you know I maybe I should try to one of them you know and try to scare him or something and and uh and I also felt like maybe he was trying to move in on my girl friend too so I had a little bit of that you know kind of thing going on competitive thing\nSo I I went to the uh ... you know for soldiers they had a art rooms or like arts and crafts areas and and uh there was a a um [noise] uh ceramics instructor there and he's I asked I'd like to you know do something with some clay and he said gave me some clay and\nI had been looking at a demon knowledge the book and or or no no he had a demon algae but that's what it was and I was fashioning a a what I thought would be you know some kind of scary looking head then it would turned out to be a demon had\nNor did I in fashion and this was just you know very stupid to be doing this\nAnd as I was doing this this guy took notice of me this instructor and he had the steam analogy book and ah he said you know I'm very interested in this what is this year doing I said well I'm just trying to make this scary looking ahead to scare this guy and he said well that's that's very very ...\nIn head then it turned out to be a demon had known that I Am fashioned and this was\nJust you know very stupid to be doing this and as I was doing this this guy took notice of made this instructor then he had the steam analogy book\nAnd uh he said you know I'm very interested in this what is this year doing I said well I'm just trying to make this scary looking ahead to scare the sky and he said well that's\nThat's very very interesting you know I'm very interested in in the mineralogy and he started to get really strange you know just like the counselor at the prison he was acting very strange like they were maybe birds of a feather or something\nAnd uh so I finished this demon head and I got out of there and I took it back to the barracks and I took it to my girlfriend's room and she wasn't there at the time but her ... her girlfriend a roommate letting in\nAnd I set it up on her night stand and there was like this mirror behind it and I said okay I'm I'm gonna freak her out and then I'm going to freak her out and then we're going to go and freak out this other guy and get them to get you know get away from us\nSo I set up these scandals around it stupid right\nSo uh I was there was the intent was good right\nIt it was it was maybe a good intent but it was playing with stuff I didn't understand so I'm sitting there looking at it and the girl friend left or I mean the the uh the roommate left and I was just there by myself sitting there staring at the ... all of a sudden it's lips started to move\nAnd it started to say things in that same kind of guttural voice that I had heard of before I joined the army\nIn that that other incident that I told you about and uh it was it was it was pretty scary and I thought at first this isn't real but then they kept happening and then my girlfriend walked in\nAnd she immediately so what are you doing and I said well your roommate Libyan and then she says what does that and she pointed to it and I said oh that's this thing I made to scare you know this councilor guy\nAnd she said you you know that's very interesting because when I was in and she was telling me when I was in high school I made something that looked exactly like that and I have to throw it away because it started to interact with me\nAnd I and I said well that hey that's what this did you know and she\nShe freaked out she grabbed it she opened up the window and from the third floor she threw it out the window into the dumpster that was down on the in the parking lot\nAnd she said you don't ever play around with that kind of stuff and uh so that was the other a kind of demonic or incident that I that I had so that the the big lesson there's don't play around with things you don't understand even if the intention might be\nSomewhat good are these are forces that you you don't want to play around with it and if you are at a low point or you invite them and that's when you can have\nTrouble you think you invite them in with a weed you board\nOh I I don't play around with we'd you boards at all I think they're very dangerous\nMeat you you you you you hear the nine eleven premonition new\n\n\n\n[noise] it was

there and and and then it it kept vibrating again and then I just happened to look out the window\nAnd there was like a Greenbelt behind our apartment behind disgust house this bar and there was a Green Belt and then there was another uh apartment building maybe four stories high much bigger a complex\nAnd I I look directly into this window and there was a man standing there it looked like a man and he was very dark and he was a in kind of in the shadows but I could see there was a figure of a man and he was pointing at me\nAnd and I went out with the owning singer I Hope no not a bone and sent it will just\nIt just seemed like a guy but he was moving in a very strange way so I looked at him as soon as I think he recognized I looked at him the vibration stopped so I I don't know what he was doing or what what reason he would have for doing it or what you know obviously you had some kind of tell the kinetic powers\nBecause it was related to what was going on because as soon as he moved away from that window and there was he wasn't there that the the items stopped and I\nAnd you know and I didn't have that feeling of somebody pulling me off the bed so it was that was pretty frightening because I didn't know what he was up to whatever it was was not good I can guarantee that\nI'm going to hinge Bruce that when you went through that red light and you made it through all lives loser reason you still here have you figured out what the reason is yeah\nYeah and uh it's it's related to what the this vision I had two years ago my friend gene who came to me and told me it was time it was time to tell these stories to not be afraid to tell the stories people will come it's kind of like the old you know field of dreams build it and they will come\nA and that's exactly what what has been happening everything that he said uh is that I I I think I Do have a mission I I I I Know that you know I I think the fact that I\nHave all these credentials and stuff maybe that helps people accepted more but it it it's unfortunate that it should be that way but I think it does kind of you know give people the idea that uh you know maybe he's he's more credible but\nI you know I don't know but uh I I Do know that I Do have this mission to get these stories out and to help people understand and to support people like a scientist like dean rating in others\nIt more but it it it's unfortunate that it should be that way but I think it does kind of a you know give people the idea that uh you know maybe he's he's more credible but\nI you know I don't know but uh I I Do know that I Do have this mission to get these stories out and to help people understand and to support people like a scientist like dean rating and others in trying to figure this out\nYou know in in our you know very chronically under funded because there's you know there it's difficult for them to get funding and I think this is it's probably one of the most important things that we can we can do in our lives is is trying to figure out how this the spiritual world works\nAnd it and it gives great comfort to people when I although I don't I'm not a practicing medium I Do I I Am able to to to do it\nAnd I I share this with my friends and family members and and uh people who um you know who asked me I don't do it for money or anything just do it because I feel it's a service to my fellow a human beings\nAnd it provides them with comfort and and it doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know there Charlotte ... out there and and then and there are some real people\nThey do for a living and I don't\nI don't ah you know the grudge them to make a living of it you know a fair living as long as they're providing a a a decent service for people but uh it it is it is real it's very real\nAnd ah they've tried to that is one of the more difficult things for scientists to research although they've noticed\nThat when people say they're having a spiritual connection that later proves to be you know you know they got some things right about this person's a loved one a there is certain parts of the brain that they can pick up I guess some kind of image and I don't know if they use an MRI or what they do but\nUh so there is there is something that doesn't prove necessarily but it does show that there is something going on\nUh in in there is a a a connection being made 'em and uh so I I ... that that is the mission that I'm On the mission I mine is too is to convey what I've found out and what I asked my friend Jean and\nAnd there's another lady that passed on three years ago she was a colleague of mine and a good friend and and I also have some contact with her and I've asked them a lot of questions when I go on this walking meditation that I Do quite often\nAnd uh and connect with them and and the the things that I've learned are are are are pretty amazing and I I Want to share them with people and I and I I feel I I that I have to do it it I Want to do it but I feel like I have to do it too it's kind of like all the books I've written all the plays that I've written\nI felt compelled to do it it wasn't just something I sat down okay I'm going to write a play or I'm going to write a book it's always I feel compelled to do it I have to do it\nAnd I'm more than happy to to you know to to do this and and help people and I think I I have help some people\nWill let's go to the phones for you if they have a story I'll have you know you waited for is Bruce up it's just a question then take it away to him as a lawyer California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call and Bruce wild I promised my question Bruce I'm you spoke about your near accident in the intersection and job comment question or comment is angels\nAppear to be non denominational they appear to\nChristianity and Islam Hindu was some voters some dour some and and all of the indigenous traditions around the world whether they're called angels are being supple light whatever my question to you\nSent to metaphorically dodged a bullet in that\nIntersection how can the average man they average woman develop cultivate if you will a close personal relationship\nWith their guardian angels day by day even hour by hour or something that is tangible with absolute certainty\nWell that's that's a that's a very good question and I I Will uh started off by saying that that everybody has these abilities are often they light lie dormant sure because\nOf you know ... when we were children we probably had you know pretty equal abilities and there's some people to have a little bit more than others but then\nThrough the experiences that people have the the accepted more and more and they're closer to the the spirit world so I'd say doing whatever you can to get a closer to that spirit world some people do it through meditation\nI just let it randomly happen because the door seem to be open since age for so it never quite shut so things kept happening but now I've\nI've learned to through meditation or ... when I called walking meditation all explain it I I Can't sit still very very long so I I have trouble doing the lotus position you know kind of traditional meditation so I I go on a walk\nAnd uh that's when I can get into the I guess what scientists would call an alpha brainwave state and at that point is when I can I I'll say a prayer\nA and I I I Do believe in God and they say prayers even when I'm not meditating but any way I Will I Will ask my guardian angel or some people practicing a professional uh mediums will say these are your spirit guides you know um and I will ask them to help me\nTo connect to those that are that are passed on and to receive whatever messages they have\nAnd uh and and to help people if they have messages they want me to pass on to their loved ones which is usually what it is\nAnd I I Would say just having a practice of that I Do it almost every day my foot has hurt right now so I haven't been able to do it so I feel kind of stifles but the last couple of days but uh\nMaking a practice of that type of mindful meditation and\nWhat my spirit friends tell me that in what they told me to tell my students in the class\nIs to have what they call focused calm\nTo be focused but be very calm and as you're doing this meditation and it will it will happen it might happen slowly it might not be you know like a an immediate you know like an epiphany or are very profound at first it might just come slowly might even think it's your imagination but it's not\nIt'll it'll keep building day by day and before you know it you you have you're more in touch with these things and you can also when you when the door opens\nYou'll ... you'll go back in time and see oh my gosh I've had these experiences before and maybe I didn't I didn't recognize it so it it goes like backwards in time as well once that door has opened\n... go ahead yeah no that's the best way I can I can explain it I think\nIt's a it's a life lifetime journey and and everybody's at their own pace you know like I tell my students you know some people say\nYou know I'm like thirty five years old and these kids are like Twenty years old and I'm way behind you know I've been you know taking care of kids and working and now I'm going back to get my degree and I said everybody has their own timeline it doesn't

segment with bruise all over the sole high in his book timeless where do we get the book Bruce\n[noise] well uh you can get it on Amazon and uh I think it was on Barnes and noble and maybe some other places but I think the primary places Amazon there seems to be pretty good price on Amazon right now so\nWell that's a great way now let's talk about the story of\nHell\nYou've got a chapter about hill hill is empty colon\nHell is empty well that is the uh that's actually one of the uh the the demon stories\nAre okay okay yeah I use the quote from Shakespeare that uh uh the hell is empty all the demons are here are all the devils are here you know\nThat so I I yeah I use that and\nI bet it and speaking about health I think that's a that's a good topic ah that that's one of the questions that I asked my spirit friends\nUh I said well what happens to the bad people are they they're in the spirit world with you and\nAnd uh they that they answer that I got a was kind of interesting it was well there there are these demonic elements in in the spirit world but they're not necessarily in the same ZIP Code I guess [laughter]\nWaited to describe it uh and I think that what what I understand is that people who have done very very bad things you know on this earth and physical form a are probably hanging out with those folks and that in that area of the spirit world\nBut they do get a chance to come back and try to make it right and I think that can take a very very long time many probably many incarnations for them to\nTry to to get things right and uh I I think that goes along with with you know a lot of eastern religions to talking about bad karma and that kind of stuff [noise] uh so that that's my impression of what a what helped me maybe\nLet's go to ruin and blend or in California your neck of the words Bruce go ahead Rowland\nOh my goodness hello ms ... and Dr B Hi there I'm a long time listener and that's only a first time caller I'm missing or we met at the borders in Pasadena before it closed hearing your\nIncome a couple of years ago only sixteen years old with the numbers lady yeah I'm not sure if you remember that I sure do I do I just want to\nAh how incredibly proud I Am a both of you and especially my professor and what an honor and it's an eye on both of you are please continue doing what you're doing best ah my question\nMr ... at the borders in Pasadena before it closed during your\nOh ... years ago only sixteen years old with the numbers lady yeah I'm not sure if you remember that I sure do do I just\nWant to say ah how incredibly proud I Am a both of you and especially my professor and what an honor and it's an eye on both of you are please continue doing what you're doing best uh my question or two down to be is um [noise] can anyone tap into this\nOr is this something you're just lucky enough to be born with and able to do and I will take my question off the air\nThank you all and I I Know what you're going to see Bruce go ahead\nYeah well I think I think everybody has this the the capability to do it or do you have the inclination or are you willing to take a chance are you willing to also to protect yourself in in the process to realize that there are\nA you know folds paths here in there and uh so I I think it is it is possible for anybody like the the last caller a you know the same type of advice that we can we can cultivate these things and and do so very cautiously and carefully and and slowly\nAnd uh and it is something that and I think that the last caller to ah Thomas a had a good point he said all that it unites this idea of angels unites the whole world\nAnd I would I Would go farther and say the paranormal unites all cultures all around the world it's a connection point that we all have and I think as we learn more and scientists help us more I think that's going to connect us more and\nAnd then perhaps bring bring better times for us because we certainly need the help\n[laughter] well we sure do don't we Renee is with us in San Francisco first time caller Hi Renee\nHi guy a I'm a Bruce I'm the four oh George before I get to my question for both\nThe producer

BP's\nWell uh yeah so um electronic voice phenomena um I I\nI think that they can be very helpfully because the ... the folks in the spirit world that are residing there we'll we'll try just about any way to get a hold of us especially their loved ones uh I hear all I've heard all kinds of stories you know that sometimes they'll uh\nItems will be misplaced for a while and then all of a sudden show up in a very unique location to you know to give you a sign\nThat that they're there and that they want to connect with you and I think the voice phenomena could also be a a you know something like that that they're that they're trying to reach out and and and that is what I encountered when I Do this walking meditation is\nThat they desperately they desperately want to connect with their loved ones and pass on messages and sometimes it's very sometimes it's kind of sad sometimes it's a you know regrets too which is a very sad thing but a oftentimes it's just messages of love and and you know they're they're okay not to worry about them any more\nThan what do you mean by could be said\nWell I had this one experience where I connected with a lady had asked me if I could connect with her father I did\nA and I got some of the things you know you don't get everything right 'cause there's interference you know like with anything else yeah ah and ah I got some of the things right and then he told me and I sensed in him and sadness and kind of some like he had regrets and I said\nUh I sense that is that something you'd like to share\nYou know with me why you feel that when he he said well no and I don't want you to tell her that I have this these feelings either and it was it was very hard for me because this lady was very much wanted to connect with their fathers\nAre on it to tell her but I I couldn't tell her and I am not going to see the names or whatever but uh so\n... sometimes it's not always you know rainbows and lollipops you know\nWas was it emotional for you\nIt was it was very emotional I was sometimes they you know their messages make me you sometimes tears of joy sometimes in this case kind of I felt this man's sadness or in in the spirit world so I\nYou know it it's kind of a tough one I I did not you know relate that and I'm hoping that if I connect with them again that maybe he'll give me permission to help her understand what it is because I'm sure she's probably feeling the same thing and maybe it's an expressed by her\nAnd his ... his saying it might clear the air so to speak and maybe create a better connection and", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Vernal", "day": "30"}
