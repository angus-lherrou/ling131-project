B. ten ten so there you go\nA coming of an hour is one and two lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis or as we say up here in cannot stand left tenets colonel Robert McGinnis retired he says America is locked in a new kind of do a little Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese\nThe Russian Federation under a populist off the off the ... leader seriously threatens the west through cyberspace and military ... thanks to that country's heavy investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons\nThe People's Republic of China is a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on rapidly growing his nation economically and militarily and together China and Russia collaborate\nTo dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become the catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis author of alliance of evil is here for hours one and two\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered\nA Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland\nYeah hungry Romania or the entire a former\nSoviet satellite regimes ah that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise] we had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have\nBrought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir ... and you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nHas really fueled\nA nationalism and patriotism in a way that uh they're somewhat um I Would argue blind or to perhaps what the West is looking at it because they want to rise again they want to be a great power again and they do have them the means through their nuclear arsenal\nAnd of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that you know we have a modern weapons systems\nOr that really a push against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the oven guard a twenty time speed of sound a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a\nDefense system weapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back they are concerned about NATO and we did violate\nA the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves in a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion\nHandcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps smoothing over relations pulling back from the brink if you will because now because everyone\nIs seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet\nIn the White House or that he has to be asked to appear almost overly aggressive against the Russian how much has this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact putting said once again this week\nThat he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together and Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was the ridicule reduction of nuclear weapons\nThroughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nAh the United states I I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of give the rhetoric lower\nOr not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now if people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and like well he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of this but at the same time he doesn't want stability he does want in the tensions uh but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nWell let's pay the China you mentioned the trade wars [laughter] uh ... and how people need to appreciate how this\nTrade war strategy or terrorists uh against China is is not just economic it's also national security and that if I Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield ... is this an attempt to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't uh a cheese military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two economic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest\nTo keep both economy's going along\nAnd the Chinese and in the last year or so have seen somewhat of a ... you know there are what six and a half percent growth in the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters are but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property and Trump says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars was intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company the company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let our wealth go\nTo China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position so ah they're hopeful\nAnd I knew to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property and Trump says while we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company the company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let our wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the\nPlaying field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position so are there hopefully going to be within the month maybe in Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese\nMedia is is trying to figure out Trump and just like ambassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nIt is a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other\nUh components to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of the Russians and the Chinese becoming a bed me is is driven by ... in any way are are there still vestiges of\nA communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many\nWell as a combination of things uh I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy as it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to what they would call an amoral west\nAh and the things that they represent they paint or the wife says what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact you know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and yeah and the\nThings that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he you know even though he's authoritarian he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man\nIn the in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week you had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for Russia's constitutional court who\nEven started to you know hit at perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve\nBeyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh yeah this past march you know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to\nAh keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that food is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident in President Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing prudent and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political corps and a predatory economics strategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard\nThis online bank closing in the evening of documents and I signed for home

finally arrived\nWho do you perceive us the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard is Russia a given their provocations but also a their military capability\nOr which they're not shy to exercise around the globe um they you know the chief of naval operations animal rich and you know have said recently we were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two the old Cold War with the third one\nOr the Russians have put in place a nuclear submarine and\n... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost certainly hours not only in the\nAtlantic but in the Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course they're confronting us militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines are they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as\nWe know all about the allegations and in justifiably are the sanctions put in place because of their interference in the twenties sixteen election and here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid terms we arrested\nOr someone of course this was a Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are\nBellicose and they're you know claims against us and to a certain degree or we're pushing back you know\nPresident Trump's not a you know backing down\nAnd that I gave him if there's\nYou know some given some take but maybe a it's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy ... an issue\nAll over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a\nWay of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe you know do I say Russia is more dangerous uh China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] while we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas now why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic or weapons that are putting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours\nUm but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and\nAnd the near future and are they willing to use it as well put and says you know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nWhy the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen uh wants to fund a new counter to ah that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there\nI I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nOr that there that the mere threat the long term threatened and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with\nA defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok uh twenty eight team\nJoined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise these sorts of indicators demonstrate that these two nations are pushing back against the former dominance that we had across the world and\nArguably you know you can\nCome up with the conclusion I think that uh perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening\nOr certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry a and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to\nStand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course though not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that clearly we don't have and we're trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five of course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia is let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to\nYou have come up with the conclusion I think that\nUh perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening\nOr certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry a and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to\nStand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course though not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians

an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony in border we want to go to war maybe World War three or ...\nWell that's a that's why you know Trump has been over there you know trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more\nAnd yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need to all these other little countries you know might Russia going in and and disturbed that country and then as your right to make it clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one\nA declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked or you know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and and the like and\nWe declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so [noise] um no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's\nCapability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need that may not have\nThe wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to a you know make these tough decision so uh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in Claremont next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts than NATO and\nAnd he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise] uh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nYou know had better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even Poland which is a you know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with\nUkraine these are all issues\nOf great uh you know magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nLet's talk about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president has accused the Chinese of of meddling in\nThe mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states\nI'm the big concern as I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about\nA Chinese made computer chips in components in electronics it may have a back door\nOr even in US military equipment talked me about the series the seriousness of that threat\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly at the Pentagon you know the a defense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate said look you know even in these Chinese made you know phones you know ... you were not going to sell them in our\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is our from town hall or

Russian missile yes\nAnd that you know because we will not connect our\nPatriots and other fads to a Russian as four hundred a that's why yeah there's a it's a non ... we just won't do it\nUh and that is a major um bone of contention and of course that there are others even though we try to maintain good relations with the Turks\nAnd up until now you know subsequent to the Nineteen thirties when Ataturk tried to secular rise that nation a air to one is doing just the opposite trying to radicalize it a witness Islamic viewpoint and trying to return to the granddaughter of the\nOttoman Empire or so NATO no I I don't think that they should be a member of NATO\nYou know NATO such a complex thing for us today as we mentioned in the last hour\nOr because you know anyone could you know call for an article five say you know the Russians are picking on me please come to my rescue\nOr do we want to be tethered in the future war world to that well you know we have that alliance and to keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians and the Chinese\nAre just you know very tight now out of necessity\nThey don't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them but they want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree of his belt and road\nStrategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians in military exercises this is all painting a picture\nWhere you can see a divided world emerging or so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of you know warts and problems with it at this point might not be well advised but certainly allowing turkey into our secrets into our systems with a Russian made\nAir defense system is not a good idea you\nKnow far for me to to um stand up to the house of Saud by a given that so much of the narrative of the show he a murder has come from the Turks and also cutter or another sort of sworn enemy of Saudi Arabia is it possible\nDo you think there's anything to the the idea that that cutter turkey are trying to\nDrive a wedge between the United states and uh there's there are their allies the Saudis with it\nOf course you know that's a sort of thing that you know kind of the poker and the Internet geo political world that takes place all the time behind the scenes\nYou know who were the people that were in the you know the Saudi embassy that night so I suppose some details will eventually come out\nWith the clandestine type of operations now from one nation to another or perhaps not nation states but other activities\nTake place unfortunately all the time you know we're in a tight spot what can President Trump to he can sanction entities and individuals or even if she could show the was you know\nDemonstrated to have been murdered as it would appear to be by henchmen that were under the leadership of saw him on don't know but that could be clearly we could cancel the arms deal but I mean we've been\nNot only a hundred and ten billion it's far in excess of that and we have a lot of people on the ground working hand in glove with him\nBut we risk a relationship\nWith a with the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons\nUm and the packs of course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so you you've got to look at second and third order effects of any decision geopolitically and that part of the world\nUh otherwise you end up with no one that you can go to and work with a given your your vested interests and of course the the Yemen situation we've been helping them a great deal the rea Riyadh government\nAnd trying to battle the who tease and others of course the Iranians you know through proxies in that part of the world um I Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided and of course as we\nSee is what I call the alliance of evil Russia and China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes through a variety of proxies not just the north Koreans in the uranium but others\nI think on a era one is going to be one of those proxies to a certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you were in John Bolton supposition you had the president's ear who knows maybe you do or what would you be advising how how ... how do we counteract this how do we step back from the brink of of war\nWell I I Do believe that a boat and we will talk to his counterpart about ah you know renewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one we've got to do that or it's neither country's best interest to\nNot have a an agreement that isn't for civil the problem is and the Russians notice that a Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty was\nAh was violated or with their own cruise missiles\nAnd uh you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or you know we've done a lot of in the open a so I think that will will get something I Know that you know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July that\nYeah they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world leader ah on the west prompt\nYou know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis\nJust solidifies that viewpoint\nSo if I were both ... and I ... you know I I've I've talked to John Bolton before and so I just I kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy but he does have the president's year and I think that that's it that's going to be the top of the agenda\nAnd of course uh he'll probably try to deal with the issues in Syria um and with air to want a and of course\nIn July but yeah they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas about the fact that he can meet with the world leader ah on the west Trump\nYou know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they're great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis just solidifies that viewpoint\nSo if I were both ... and ... you know I I I've talked to John Bolton before and so I I I kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he's a real pragmatist tough guy yeah but he does have the president's ear and I think that that's it that's going to be the\nTop of the agenda and of course uh he'll probably try to deal with\nThe issues in Syria and with air to want a ... of course uh the uranium the Iranians are our problem for Israel uh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know\nThose volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs\nOr we don't acknowledge a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up to no good\nOr if there were to be regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that'll come about by the Iranian people are just getting set up with the situation with and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become a secular\nNon align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the you know the military and their diplomacy or you know to\nPromote their their sheer world view\nA and the autocratic rule view of of the removal of\nWhen I think that you find that they're not involved with a hoot teaser not involved with Assad a there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests and perhaps even to a certain degree with China\nUm [noise] and it's\nThe problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia\nRiyadh and Iran is going to continue um but it ... if you're not involved in you know in fueling terrorism such as his law in southern Lebanon\nAnd you know encouraging Hamas and you know Palestine and so forth and you know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them a uranium through\nWonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will replace their autocrats with people that are have a more a better sense of

year the Trump Administration is earmarked proximate Lee to point to a to point three billion dollars increase defense spending we had\nSeven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year and another seven hundred coming up this year\nUh is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is\nAnd I do go to ... know universally muzzled us ...\n\n\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis is witness before we go to the phones a Bob let me ask you the last three years well projecting into next year I tried the minister rationing earmarked him proximate lead to point to a to point three billion dollars increase defense spending we had\nSeven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year in another seven hundred coming up this year\nAh it it is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to salaries and that's why people often say well gosh\nYou know ... you know how can the Russians and the Chinese speech such an adversary and and competitive with us while they hide most of what they're spending on their own national security you know the answer is uh we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must ... five percent well we went through this sequester ration period in which had just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight\nTo replace you know with your new aircraft these\nAntiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing was ships you know it's an incredibly expensive to have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of of something that a Ronald Reagan said you know and this was you know obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested a seriously on all fronts by a\nBoth China and Russia especially combined as they're forming a new in alliance\nAnd so if we don't sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustained\nThe investment in long term capabilities uh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics in artificial intelligence or even in an investment in our our blue water navy uh\nUh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting it on our rights glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas scheming good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast am\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the er\nChinese tapping our electronics for information well what I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed an end date into all of these electronic chips so that everything shuts down at the same time some\nTime in the future you know it's it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nQuick question Steve is that possible Bob\nWhile I'm not an electronics are no expert however I Do understand the question\nAnd I share that concern a and that's something that I think that uh Jim Mattis our defense secretary is concerned about that things like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we\nGet a programmable and reversible inundated\nElectronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nOr ships and it's and so forth and we could find that this could be catastrophic so you know I I think there's plenty of caution today a there's a wake up call across a certainly the U.S military\nAnd I think our allies are are joining that understanding that uh this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful of\nOf the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt reminds me of um what's your ... um the u._s. was at a spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time uh I think it was maybe a near collision involved and and I'm\nI'm I'm Wondering if that that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it was ... it was ... it landed there because of being hacked into somehow\nYou know well you know that's the sort of thing that we're very concerned about a cyber the battleground has a cyber as one of the four than I point out an alliance of evil and\nGo into great detail is two\nAnd not only the threat of taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that uh we hear about every day you know this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the\nPresident's strategy and he says that there's a there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today and yet you know there's so much we don't know so you know could somewhat take on an aircraft could take down a satellite takedown of\nLos Angeles I think\nAll that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and the capabilities to prevent this in place\nOne hard line Don his intent Ohio Don good evening good morning welcome because\nRather Robert happy Sabbath a and lieutenant colonel I I really appreciate your service your patriotism and you're with them during the main things that you have do they ever consider the Bible prophecy of Daniel eight where America will attack Iran and destroy it\n\nHave to remind me of ... and Daniel late where you're looking at dawn I'm you know I I understand perhaps where you're coming from a you know I I don't know that that's something that we would do unless we perceive that the threat was a against\nYou know our key allies and against our interest in those five it claims that you know the he'd go from the west will come upon the whole face of the earth of all not touch the ground\nAnd they will destroy the ram that has the two wars and said the the ladder Warren is the bigger that comes up last than the first one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last one that comes up with being destroyed and claimed that no one\nWill help it says that you know a a nation that comes from the west will not touch the ground which means it's going to be unable or an air force\nAttack or Iran is you know a huge country and that and uh but it's also states that no one will come to her aid ah and I find that kind of injury\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt was this hour on all the time I'll Patrick toss strongly last year that person or as one of my own

I'm Sorry I'm going to have to I'll respond but then I'm gonna have to want to thank you for the call well before Kennedy was McKinley and there was Garfield and there was Lincoln and there were\nMultiple attempts and other presidents um I don't know that that certainly something changed since Kennedy but has\nMuch changed I think once the United states a sort of grew up in matured and\nWe go\nI was Catholic of course I was that was a direct assault\nOn or you know a on me in the program and all the uh nine eleven ... ...\nYou know Richard what's his name here\nSaid you're fading out on me again Tom so I'm I'm I'm Sorry I'm going to have to I'll respond but then I'm going to have to want to thank you for the call well\nBefore Kennedy was McKinley and there was Garfield and there was Lincoln and there were\nMultiple attempts on other presidents um I don't know that that certainly something changed since Kennedy\nUm\nBut has much changed I think once the United states\nAre sort of grew up in matured and became a major player certainly after the civil war or after the first World War and began to engage in multilateral trade organizations and\nUh he did all of those things that some of the founding fathers sort of warning against foreign entanglements I think is what they called they called it a\n... this these sorts of\nUm\nGames dirty wars and so forth are almost inevitable when you become entangled in in uh in other countries' business and and\nYou put yourself out there\nOr\nYou end up fighting wars on foreign lands that those words don't visited upon your own soil\nAnd yes it's it's nasty and it's dirty but one thing that the United states has I think that most other countries don't have and that is the power of redemption\nAnd I'm I'm a Canadian so I'm a bit of an inch or low over but I have strong emotional ties to the United states and I believe strongly in the idea of the United states and I believe in American exceptionalism it hasn't been fulfilled perhaps the way we'd like it but the United states\nYes they\nThey have been involved if you talk about to lend day in Chile and the overthrow the government in ... in Iran and in in the in Nineteen fifty three and in Guatemala and so forth\nJust doesn't this isn't ... to the United states\nMost other countries that have the kind of a power and responsibility at the United states has\nTo do the same thing\nBut they don't reflect upon those those dark chapters in their history the way the United states does they don't talk about it on public forums they can't they're not allowed and there was no redemption at\nLeast in the United states that exists\nWe reflect we right we Sean and we try to make ourselves better and I think we should all be thankful for that Tom thank

football game you play the Steelers it's on YouTube you can type in the Boeing halo you'll see a giant halo falling over the football stadium that day\nA giant circle and the guy or people standing in the stands not show up at standing if they have commonality here for ... for Denver it's the same game that all three sixteen showed up from John three\nSixteen in the Bible people have yes we're in young\nPeople and painted drawn three sixteen on his eye patch is three years before that game when ... when he wanted to be the of jumping ship game against Oklahoma for three years to the day he he played the Steelers he had the halo showed up here John three sixteen in passing three sixteen your age thirty one point six average per catch even CBS carry the game the rating for the game was thirty one point six\nPercent was the highest rating again God for the game but I remember there was kind of position thirty one minutes ... seconds the only intersection with third down at sixteen ... burger through the interception of people that a white horse to the top of the stadium and the one in the ... the bronco Jesus when you see this thing in the stadium you see this guy in the clouds\nAbove it with a white horse will Jesus returns in a way horse with clouds with as a symbol red revelation of Jesus return runaway horse from revelation the opening kick off in America opening kick off because it couldn't happen but I won't tell you that could be wrong but anyway go ahead and I I Want to get his facts out before my\nPhone cut off [laughter] it's ... it's remarkable and I I remember some of that not all of the details now is he not in the New York Mets a farm system now do you like football and he's in baseball now isn't it\nYeah you know what's really interesting baseball to this really fascinating but I mean the other kind of like a you when you see the halo you know the real you know there's a symbol and Jesus is coming back you know that there's no doubt that the oldest coincidences went a coincidence that they are too many even the opening kick off at the cross bar in the back of the end zone which is located tenured sleep in the end zone record shade back thirty yards\nBack toward the kicker and put herself on the twenty to start the game where you put put it for a touch\nBack there is no way that could happen to ever happen again anywhere near you know to that but it happened the beginning of that can nobody\nKnew was going to be above game until I Want to go cut wanting touch them a one point over time the merits Thomas cut the eighty or passing over time just one player was over in the overtime he more on Christmas twelve twenty five Nineteen eighty seven he ended the game the people that are three hundred and sixty\nIn your area do you get in the baseball and yes he is an\nEnergy a sort of continuing on and that in that realm he was on the pitchers man I Believe one game\nAnd he saw someone struggling in the in the states\nIt's kind of like a few when you see the halo you know they're real you know this is a symbol reviews coming back you know there there's no doubt that the oldest coincidences we're not a coincidence that there are too many even the opening tick off at the cross bar in the back of the end zone which is located tenure to sleep in the end zone rickety back thirty yards\nBack toward the kicker and put itself in the twenty to start the game where you put put it for a touch back there is no way that\nCan happen that ever happened to him again anywhere near you can do that but it happened in the beginning\nOf that community news can be a blessed game until I Want to go to one in touch them or one plant over time the marriage Thomas cut the eighty or passing over time does one player was over in the overtime he's more on Christmas twelve twenty five Nineteen eighty seven he ended the game the people that are three hundred and sixteen\nYears ago there was a baseball\nIn yes he is in n G A continuing on in that in that realm he was on the pitchers man I Believe one game and he saw someone struggling ... in the in the stands I'm\nNot sure whether they were having grass and he was getting ready to sign on that's right and you can get a pet it\nEpilepsy feet or something\nOr ... well he I thought he may be resuscitated this this individual but he will he would have\nBeen over and pray for him and the guy all of a sudden came back he got his breath and then he was joking and couldn't get his breath the ... are you going to pass out and maybe die I don't know but uh he he bent over and test the guy's leg and then maybe the prayer\nAnd um people were standing around lady couple of ladies spin around one of them are we thought that she had with the ... winter on tweeter ... ... you know one of those texts\nThat she thought she'd maybe with the miracle or because the guy was a you know two paramedics or something there and they couldn't get either to be able to brief\nHe's an incredible individual and incredibly women I think I'll\nTell you one more thing really interesting he he when he played for the Mets he paid for the Mets minor league team\nWhen he played the river dogs who are to New York Yankee team back last year round the image him he played the team and and they mocked him every every ... they go up to bat the plague hallelujah chorus music they show him on the scoreboard crying when he cried when he lost in Alabama in the in the playoff game I guess\nAnd he also the issue of the river dogs people will remember do with the black patches and the guy jumping over him you know mocking John three sixteen the Bible but what happened later in the year people last like two or three of those games I Believe but later in the year when the big thing was when they were winning three games to two or whatever all of a sudden they lost the third gaming for the game and the asteroid with him instead of them\nAnd so God remembers you know as more and more and more important\nThan the little people with people in the minor league team with the river dogs that was the major league team didn't get in and maybe you didn't move here either so maybe there's a little thing going on there with you or you know you mark their three feeling these leaks team you know ...\nThat's right Steve regard you know I'm just saying that\nYou know I don't write

America is locked in a new kind of do a little Cold War with the Russians and the Chinese\nThe Russian Federation under a populist off the authoritarian leader seriously threatens the west through cyberspace and military ... thanks to that country's heavy investment in sophisticated mass killing weapons\nThe People's Republic of China is a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on a rapidly growing his nation economically and militarily and together China and Russia collaborate\nTo dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become the catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis author of alliance of evil is here for hours one and two\nYou know I think you're correct Richard huh we did poke 'em and of course we've continued to do that they considered\nA Ukraine or the breadbasket of Russia and of course they're continuing to fuel\nThe anti key of a civil war which I call in the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland\nHungary Romania that'd be entire a former Soviet satellite\nRegimes ah that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise] we have the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have\nA brought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir putting and you know putting of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nHas really fueled\nA nationalism and patriotism in a way that uh they're somewhat um I Would argue blind or to perhaps what the West is looking at because they want to rise again they want to be a great power again and they do have them the means through their nuclear arsenal\nAnd of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that you know we have a modern weapons systems\nThat really a push against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the Auburn guard a twenty time speed of sound a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a defense system\nWeapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back they are concerned about NATO and we did violate\nA the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves in a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion handcuffs the Trump Administration into perhaps smoothing over relations pulling back from the brink if you will because now\nBecause everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House\nOr that he has to be asked to appear almost overly aggressive against the Russian how much has this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact ... said you know once again this week that he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together and Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues now of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was ridiculed reduction of nuclear weapons\nThroughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nAh the United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower\nOr not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now as people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and like well he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of it but at the same time he does want stability he does want in the tensions are but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nWell let's pivot to China you mentioned the trade wars [laughter] uh ... and how people need to appreciate how this trade war strategy or terrorists\nUh against China is is not just economic it's also national security and that if I Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later in this and it tends to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't uh a cheese military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two economic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest\nTo keep both economy's going along and the Chinese and in the last year or so have seen somewhat of a ... you know there is what six and a half percent growth in the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters [noise] uh [noise] but the fact is that\nI Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield ... is this and it tends to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't uh I uh cheese military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two economic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest\nTo keep both economy's\nGoing along and the Chinese and in the last year or so have seen somewhat of a ... you know there are what six and a half percent growth in the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters [noise] uh [noise] but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property and Trump says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through\nYour company the company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that you know economics is\nNational security we can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let our wealth go\nTo China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position so are there hopefully going to be within the month maybe and Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese\nMedia is is trying to figure out Trump and just like the ambassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans did manage you always want to keep\nYour opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nIt is a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other uh components to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of ... the Russians and the Chinese becoming a\nBed may is is driven by ideology in any way are are there still vestiges of a communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many\nWell as a combination of things uh I don't if not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy as it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to what they would call an amoral west\nA and the things that they represent they paint the wife says what Hollywood is spewing all over the world and they said you don't want that\nIn fact you know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and yeah and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he you know even though he ...\nHe still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man\nIn the ... in Russia and as a result there is a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week you had you know\nA gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for the Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hint at perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent\nIn this case to serve beyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course uh ... this past march ... they're beginning to see\nThat we need longevity and we need to have the capability to ah keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that ... is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident in President Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political coercion predatory economics\nStrategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and\nThis online banks for closing in the evening of documents then I signed for home equity loan only I didn't want

you perceive us the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard is Russia a given their provocations\nBut also a military capability\nWhich they're not shy of exercising around the globe um they you know the chief of naval operations animal rich and you know have said recently were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two the old Cold War with the third one\nOr the Russians have put in place a nuclear submarine and\n... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the\nAtlantic but in the Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course they're confronting us militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines are they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as\nWe know all about the allegations and\nIn justifiably are the sanctions\nPut in place because of their interference in the twenties sixteen election and here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid terms we arrested or someone of course this was a Chinese person or in Belgium\nYou know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are bellicose and they're\nYou know claims against us and to a certain degree or we're pushing back you know President Trump's not\nA you know backing down and that given that there's you know some given some take but maybe a it's not a favoring\nAn outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China sees China Sea\nAnd of course their belt and road strategy ... an issue\nAll over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a\nWay of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities literally across the globe you know do I say Russia is more dangerous or China certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] well we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is what their GDP about the size of Texas yeah why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic or weapons that are putting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours\nUm but they hide a lot of stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nAnd he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and\nAnd the near future and are they willing to use it as well put and says you know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which isn't there twenty Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nWhy the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen oh wants to fund a new counter to ah that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering\nAround there I I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO or and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons or that\nThere that the mere threat in the long term threatened and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with\nDefense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok uh twenty eight team\nExercise which is going to be an annual exercise these sorts of indicators demonstrate that these two nations are pushing back against the former yeah\nIts authorization act twenty Nineteen\nUh wants to fund a new counter to ah that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there I I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO\nOr and they of course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons\nAre that they're the the mere threat in the long term threatening especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with\nThe defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok now twenty Eighteen\nJoined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise these sorts of indicators that demonstrates that are these two nations are pushing back against the former you know dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can come up with the conclusion I think that\nUh perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel\nOur defense industry a and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course though not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that clearly we don't have and we're trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony and border we want to go to war maybe World War three or ...\nWell that's a that's why you know Trump has been over there you know trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more\nAnd yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need to all these other little countries you know might Russia go in and and and disturbed that country and then as your right to make it clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one\nOf the declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked a you know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and in the like and we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so\nUm no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's capability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need\nThat may not have the wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to ah you know make these tough decision so uh that I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in Claremont next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts and NATO and\nAnd he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise] uh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nYou know had better make it very clear that if\nIf we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even pollen which is a you know really a very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with\nUkraine these are all issues of\nGreat uh you know magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't backed out of NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nAnd it's not going to China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president is accused\nThe Chinese of meddling in the ... midterm elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states I'm the big concern is I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about\nA Chinese made computer chips and components in electronics they may have a back door\nOr even in US military equipment taught me about the series the seriousness of that ...\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly at the Pentagon you know the a defense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate say look you know even in these Chinese made you know phones you know ... you were not
