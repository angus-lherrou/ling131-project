everything that you do in your field what would you say has been the most fulfilling aspect of what you do\nI think the medium ship part the psychic medium ship part ... where people are killed\nWhen they receive messages Tamil loved drunk so they realize that those people are not really just dead or fix tell or whatever they may be thinking because really\nI Love church and religious organizations but they don't do as a big favor or they don't say that person's doing really well so I think that would be my primary message for people to know that when you cross over you shouldn't\nGo into a place of grief let them be joy for on the other side and enjoy that healing and wellness with them so that that's really important that medium ship brings and that ability to let people know that their loved ones doing fine\nDoes the spirit ever come to you and say the monies in the bag on the shoe\nBomber sure they do stuff like that\nYeah it's a lot of things and spirit or if you're out before you go if this applies to everyone\nBefore you go to sleep at night you ask say please tell me if you continue to ask where is it usually you get an answer if you ask me maybe three times four times you get an answer just it really hang in there with it and be diligent in your request\nKeep asking we were talking about spirit photography and you've got some of them have you taken the pictures or other just been given do\nWell when my husband was here he took a lot of pictures here we've had a camera eye to eye on his neck I took a lot of pictures so I have a lot of spare photography I have a lot of or I have a lot of where things going on and it's so interesting George maybe can tell me that the reason why we're in this comes out on film but it doesn't\nCome out with just the human eye thing at a wife has such a difference do you think\nThere is a huge difference in this very strange because for some reason the camera picks up goes or just about everything that you can see\nWith the human eye I mean I guess were restricted to to see things in a certain level a word that camera digitally and otherwise picks it up\nThat's right it it's so odd and it was a cell phone or really to the same degree that irregular ah thirty five millimeter camera would with a present it's the same thing so I have yet to figure that out spirited not tell me why but other than the fact that the uh\nThe photography scientific photography has the ability of the I just not have and that's the only answer I could come up with so far\nIs not good [laughter] how do you know you're not being tricked by some demon or something that that is to train the deceased person somebody cared about\nThat's a great question because if you do any kind of spirit work or you receive any kind of messages or you have anything at all you always have to have a blessing for a few tests the spirit you say really are you of God and that's really what I Would say and that's what I Would recommend everyone thing\nBefore they become involved in this kind of work at all so you always say are you of God and that's what I Would suggest and then team as can come and they will not come in or if you have any kind of threat around you or you're afraid of anything you know that\nThey will not get past that barrier and if you're religious you say the name of Jesus Christ or whatever you can relate to\nHave you ever witnessed an exorcist\nNo other than the movie which I did not like because books fell off the shelf by themselves very unsettling so it's not a place that I Would want to go to I I Try to avoid darkness and you don't play with the ... board\nNo and I know your feelings about the way to go out and I agree with you I have a picture in my seven steps to having book about my ...

them not remember\nFirst of all we haven't made it socially rewarding often to share dreams I mean we don't have good ways of talking about dreams most of us when we were a member of something a bit embarrassed how do we talk about this how do we tell it\nSo one of the things like you know society is a way that makes it fun and as I say socially or what have to bring a dream to the table I invented the very simple for step process to sharing a dream of a story that makes it sound you can get it done and minutes you get some help feed back in your guide to towards action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our teams I mean bad habits of parts of not is thought of it to be let out so the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get jobs do deal with the family we think that we should lie in this in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever they pay any attention\nTo those in between twilight states of consciousness you between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch it means good time to talk on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that it just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams you know sometimes it's a very interesting\nSometimes he kissed goodbye to our dream because we think that our dreams are giving us a luring pictures\nOf possibility that we cannot none of us because they're not young enough but not rich enough whenever find the right girl or the right guy and sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream because we don't think that we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space\nWhat we would like to see in our waking life these are some of the race\nThat state of consciousness you'll between sleep in the wake that's a good time to catch it means good time to talk on the list of dreaming but many people don't realize that that just seemed to 'cause they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams tell sometimes this is very interesting\nSometimes he kissed goodbye to our dreams because we think that our dreams are giving us a little ring pictures\nOf possibility that we cannot none of us because they're not young enough but not rich enough whenever find the right field or the right guy and sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream because we don't think we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space\nWhat we would like to see an are waking life these are some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you followed the simple suggestions that I also you can get your dreams that you can start dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have a with you might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nWere then you can dream wide awake the world around you will speak the language of science and symbols and things but as you pay attention and sometimes you get more alert to those pop up so the pop ups and waking life that can give you ship is because you feel my gosh there's a hidden handed work\nThat that helps to turn on the dream flown the night as well\nAs some incredible wage to dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you've had had some stories are directly related to that\nWell it's a recurring dream is coming again and again on as a hilarious story a mysterious reality is about a woman doctor for England who's complaining of the breakfast table oh Robert why do I keep having the same ethic dream when I got to do my medical exams\nThirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is the same dream of very close to the same dream it's probably because you have dreamed producers who are making a dream movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through you're trying to get you to understand the situation in trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on there trying to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I I did one of the stories I I have to sort of dream production movie company\nThat is making dreams for us and repeating the performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked how I'll dream producers might be getting very bulletin fed up with us if they had to keep on making the same\nBut just in not getting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that dreams come about I mean dreams that not all to be put in one box we do have dreamed productions where you feel and you might be quite right when you filled is that there was a production crew behind the scenes\nThat is making a certain kind of dream to you because you need to get a message and another the stories of mysterious reality as I describe but very strange woman who sat down next to me in the play in an old reality and mentored me at a certain point that are dead husband or the ...\nHe was a pop musician he'd been shot in the face in a diner in Seattle\nOn the news or the previous story and he says to her in her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies for people that they're seeing their dreams that I'm doing the music and the special effects [laughter] the fact that goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect of what's happening and dreams\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed it might be used the dream or if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you've become conscious it might be either some shadow or hidden aspect of yourself maybe if you're a high a self made people cite the wiser and fight the highest sales is the director\nI don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be\nStaging movies for you is not alien to you is not hostile to you\nAnd is probably being run by someone with a site it why is the perspective and maybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because one of the ways that dream shock is awake into doing some course correction is they dramatized and they spoof parity\nOr what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams or partial Robert in a eyeball we used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nThat's right I mean I think that here's here's where our current understanding of dreaming and currents physics or meet up I mean the current under staffed by kind of understanding I mean the really ready to revive writing and understanding about dreams of dreaming is traveling for example\nA physics tells a science tells us that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information quantum field of information\nThat contain everything we could ever possibly need to know and we have access to it according to our ability to have this information and do something with a ... in the first place what's going on I think in dreams we discovered that we have snow doorways into this whole quantum information field\nAnd depending on the work and play with prepared to do with the information my getting we can bring through more and more I mean you can set an intention any night for example to be very simple about this very simple practical\nYou can do dream in basements being juice at an intention to get guidance on any theme that interest even probably something will come through if you don't think you got anything you're awake in the middle of the night to reset your intention of navy at this point\nYou're ready to list the dream on that subject as well because he's got some rest and you're ready to take off and it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way and they've come through across history one of my books the secret history of dreaming is full of Stuart narratives affirm the documentation that suggest that dreaming is actually\nA secret engine in the history of everything and the history of credit breakthroughs in science\nAnd technology in the aughts even in business and economics as well\nSo when you say that if you wake up to what dreaming is it can take you anywhere you are literally correct it really can can take us to the hidden dimensions of reality that super string theory posit\nIt can take us into the off the lights the UCs the hand walked the job opportunities some living environment uh like uh the on death so you can talk to an ancestor beloved loved ones and\n... and others so you know this is the ... of adventure killing guidance and possibility that opens when you become a more conscious inactive dreaming\nWhat about the ability to time travel in your dreams\nWhat we do it we do it whether we know it or not they do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival function of dreaming\nYou know if I'm a mistake on the practical mystic George I think you

in power out everyday life and one of the things I Know from my own life and those I work with is the dream show you the future in a way that is actionable mean this is very important dreams show

doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact to understand what our relationship\nWith time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of many a time altogether we step into a different place and in between place from which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences\nOf what's going on in other times over together in those parallel times we're leading a power like this come very interesting when you begin to look at gifted lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and that that other parallel and I\nThink it's very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life

latest work is called mysterious realities how many books have you written Robert\nThis is the tragedy fed up with the old way George but I must tell you I'm getting nervous because I Dreamed some time ago I have a life contract that says I have to probably sixty eight books\nOut on a show that that that's still pretty\nProlific though good for you good for you and they're ... they're all fascinating works that\nThese dreams are so important I mean I I think people can you make themselves healthy in a dream that can get a better job in a dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them and dreams it's amazing what you can do with dreams isn't it\nAbsolutely and you're done with some really interesting areas for example in terms of I\nMean one of the things going on in ... but that body talk as well as the old joke in other words the dreams we see what's going on inside the body and old fashioned doctors understand if in in traditional Chinese medicine for example the front and center\nThe idea is that a dream like it was an X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show it to them that are developing my list to avoid those symptoms\nBut that's one of the functions of dreaming and and in terms of our emotional spiritual held\nOut dreams which shows the things that help us to get wild and to stay well and and it was acting up on those dreams and trying to bring their energy through you\nI've been a dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them and dreams it's amazing what you can do with dreams isn't it\nAbsolutely and you're listening some really interesting areas for example in terms of a health\nI think one of the things going on in dreams is that that body chalk as well as sold tool in other words and dreams we see what's going on inside the body and old fashioned doctors understand this and in traditional Chinese medicine for example this was front and center\nThe idea is that a dream like gives an X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show it's symptoms that are developing might enable us to avoid those symptoms\nBut that's one of the functions of dreaming and and in terms of our emotional and spiritual health\nI'll dreams which shows the things that help us to get wild him to stay relevant ended with acting up on those dreams and trying to bring their energy\nThrough you mentioned connecting with other people will you know till after the which literally means fellow feeling at a distance or or or being in touch with someone else it's a common phenomenon and dreams in fact it's surprising that more people who are related to each other either by Lovell by family or by common colds or whatever\nI'm not aware more often that they might be dreaming with ... and all of each other I mean there's a phenomenal shed dreaming or interactive treatment which we find ourselves sharing adventures with friends and other people I mean this is another fascinating phenomena and dream\nAs a matter of fact you discover if you wake up to your dreams remember more than a look at what's going on\nBut you have what used to be cold and it's being cold again super normal capacity that are abnormal but not supernatural but that'd be on the normal and we're talking about things like pre cognition\nUntil after the ... and and so on and and and and you are able to see things before they happen to see things the distance Bible to connect with other people and these are natural towels and abilities that belong to you and if you become a more active treatment you'll find that you are growing in developing these gifts to the very helpful in life\nIn terms of creative solutions for things dreams will deliver them if you can find a solution to a problem or relies\nPut the question to your dreams and see what come and I would add to that that you can do this in everyday life as well because dreaming for the it's not just about what happens when you close your eyes is what happens when you open your eyes wider so part of this part of part of the sense of all this is but\nThe world around you once again we'll speak to like a dream if you pay attention so I encourage people many of my story is done on this to notice what goes on in the amazing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a photo preoccupation on your mind and suddenly the will deliver the incidents are citing\nThat gives you not only a reflection on what's on your mind but sometimes a way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is\nPut your question to the world go down the street or go into the pocket go and your morning commute\nWithout question in your mind and receive the first unusual unexpected thing that enters your field of perception as a message from the use of the surrounds you it is amazing how specifically the world will speak to you bring a dream like message when you play that game\nIn Nineteen Seventy one Robert I did my first radio audition tape and and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them to be some radio person on the street reporter\nAnd do what I Would do when I dropped it off at a certain radio station I wanted to work at I concentrated on that person every night when I went to bed or he already had my tape I hadn't heard from him\nA mature enough after two days I'm going to sleep concentrating on the individual\nUh visualizing what he looks like I had met him one time and uh sure\nEnough two days later the guy calls me and says hey I liked his tapes and I've got something for you come on down it works doesn't it\nYes while you're send the Europe be ... and you're manifested George I'm not surprised one bit you know Mark Twain staged experiments of this guy he called them mental to Laker feedback in his day when people said telegrams he'd make a habit of writing a letter or an old fashioned telegram to someone he wanted to be in contact with\nA not mailing it he just right on\nAnd on that person a notice what followed and he said that actually almost didn't sell ugly\nWas a response so you're practicing your game that is an angel and it works I mean we know the thoughts are already thing they're already thoughts and feelings already action\nAnd if you're thinking about another person you're probably going to reach them unless they are shielded again being reached a menu of reaching a but nine way to do something good we wouldn't want to be open to be reached by just anybody with with any intention but that's a lovely creative and benign example of sending a mental sending medical with electricity is what Mark Twain\nAnd I you know I subsequently used in a lot by doing the same techniques and it's almost as if they have this inbox that you get on the same path with and you drop your little messages in there and then you for some reason they pick it up yeah yeah\nWe'll we'll do a little experiments in my groups by which one of those degrees the bell sending him it just might be a painting it might be a sculpture to not announced image to the group and people have the gas in the morning after the nicer sending walk the walk the image that was being sent\nMy to beat and it's interesting how that works and some people are very good at picking up and some people a better send to another the businesses just focused example of something that we do automatic they were connected with each other where ... where in into weaving field of interaction and it goes on and on of dreams all the time\nRobert you've talked about synchronous and explain how that ties into our

the best team in FM radio and with the two week you can hear our show for example with amazing clarity the CBC Radio too we is designed to receive long range even ask them reception and make those weak signals stronger\nThe high quality audio from the CBC Radio too we can be adjusted as well you get great voice clarity even even for music it's really something supporting the troops radio that

away\nUm I Know that I'm going to get hit with added all messed up or something\nLike ... or\nSomething like that and but I mean but I was a kid so none of this made any sense to me at all but now we have drones right so a ton of us drones are going to become a reality where they don't even have to play soldiers or whatever\nI'm saying well let's get let's get Robert ... take on some of the ...

in ordinary reality yet and hopefully you weren't\nBumped it's perfectly possible that you had long range pre cognition in dreams of situations that might develop in life\nEach corner and I realized that I'm In trouble all of a sudden and as soon as I turned to run away um I Know that I'm gonna get hit with either a mess\nOr something like ... or something like that and but I mean but I was a kid so none of this made any sense\nTo me at all but now we have drones right so I kind of a stronger and every time a reality where they don't even have to play soldiers or whatever\nI'm saying well let's get let's get Robert ... take on some of those rubber what do you think Gemini damn\nWell it's possible that you were dreaming of future developments in technology and in other ways that might manifest sounds as if you haven't run into these situations in ordinary reality yet and hopefully you weren't\nBumped it's perfectly possible that you had long range pre cognition in dreams of situations that might develop in life it's also possible that the dreams have a symbolic made not simply a Luttrell meaning but the symbolic me if I'm dreaming of of of the situation that seems very serious and talk and threatening going\nAcross the Koran stumbled in seeing this may be his EMT\nOkay maybe that symbolic is something that lies ahead to me in life which is good to have the emotional falls to the emotional or something like that maybe my dreams are actually coaching me the pairing me forward emotional situation which are not all the situation which I Need to be ready for I don't know but that comes to my mind\nThe upside down cell phone you know I just want ... holding that image I realized that might be something larger than most scary than a cell phone\nBut I sort of want to reach into that dream and grab that sell to let it be a cell phone and speak on it and see who's on the other end\nI mean this this is the way that I Am about treats I probably would I rather liked the idea of the upside down cell phone yeah it's scary but if it's my dream my actually however many years since the dream I sort of want to reach into the dream grabbed a cell phone\nOr hold it to my ear and say who is there talk to me while you and see what I get it might be that it's the kind of phony what you can talk to someone on the other side of the death you know dreams where often people are often talking to the dead\nOn phones all receiving phone calls from them and sort of want to go that direction with that tree\nRobert wire dream sometimes convoluted in mired in a confusion in a terrible and things like that why isn't that just so obvious\nWell I think that actually hit the dream saw the dream sources of many sources of freedoms and try to communicate as clearly as possible but but not necessarily not enough to follow all of this\nAh and also we need to remember the dreams are experiences that whatever report we we quote to each other from a dream is only a report it's not the full experience so it might seem convoluted all confusing or not ... but that might be because we've only brought back a few things from the dream and don't know how to put them together which is why\nI find the best way to understand the dream is to try to get your head back inside to try to get back inside the dream take a look at what is really going on when you do that you pretty quickly determine whether it's literally symbolic you can fill in some of the gets when you learn the technique could dream reentry of going back inside a dream\nI I and once we understand that I think one of the songs you are playing though something about living our whole life and play implicitly in your dreams I mean once they understand that we're having tremendous experiences and couldn't live days or weeks in a in a dream in a few minutes to talk time\nWe can begin to grasp that whatever we bring back to the dreams only partial and may be confused we might need to go beyond our service members of the tree and bring back more in order to understand what's going on\nWhat is more prevalent Lucia dream free cognitive dreams just normal regular dreams what pops up the most\nWell a lot of people ah don't seem yet to understand how to come lucid dreams the idea of listed dream it's become very popular since that movie inception and and the ideas house or you can make love to anyone in your dreams and you can be Superman that set for said there's been a sort of adolescent quality to some of the\nThe the fat solution dreaming but listen dreaming is actually easier than most people make it to themselves with me trying memorized ways of waking up that you're breathing inside of dream look at your hands if you can stick a thing go through your town that kind of stuff as I said earlier the easiest way to the ... dream is to start up loose that stay that way\nSo I didn't know how common listed dreaming is amongst the population of the moment\nAt the moment I Do know that probably everybody is having pre ... dreams but only a few people are aware of that yet I mean if you people working up to it\nI think it's it's routine I think that we do in the night whether we know it or not scout ahead of us so some aspect of consciousness checks up what lies ahead I think that's going on all the time but I think many people have yet to wake up to the fact that they can do it and could use it\nSo regular dreams what regular dreams of people I mean the dream stand the whole spectrum there are big dreams are little dreams a little dreams that I'd rather routine processing of what went on the day before commentary on how you said yourself and how fast you ate the night before and then there was a big dreams\nWhich of the dreams which you feel that you have received a message from those you might feel yourself in the presence of the highest source of wisdom all you've gone travelling you know you've gone too distant galaxy or different time period or a place with a dead or alive so\nPoint is that all of these avenues of knowledge an adventure open to everyone all the time the only thing that prevents you from getting in on this\nIs is perhaps your reluctance until now to make time in your life to amend the more of what's going on in the night to write it down keep a journal that's basic practice keep a journal writer don't give it a title unnoticed you'll

listening to calls let us go to Joe on Long Island New York Hi Joe go ahead\nYeah Hi Rob a couple of things uh my first question would be a I'm noticing some trains\nThat seem to have a scene with moving parts square that this moving parts and I would kind of compare this to say like the second half of the Titanic movie where a DiCaprio as are trying to find his way out of the ship\nThat oil is moving parts and they still has that theme of still wants to stay with us all friends in the movie or you know he still has hopes about the relationship so the idea of a dream showing moving parts\nAnd my second thing just as you're talking now I was thinking of a\nI had played a lot of basketball and I never focused on shopping and I noticed a couple of times like block shots that word near the top of the back part so I had to be shopping high\nEnergy good jumping ... yeah [laughter]\nAnd this was correlated to going to the gym a lot more and I wasn't going to the gym so I could
