tonight\nIs the coast to coast AM Studios right here in Los Angeles California standing in on this beautiful Sunday evening\nI Am your host Jimmy church and tonight my guess is my new save\nSaturday

can visit or use every single day\nAnd tomorrow and the day after that\nAnd for that singular perfect present that's all wrapped up in a boat for this planet and everyone on it it's the great pyramid of Egypt\nYou don't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving ... the great pyramid\nIs forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly leveled rock pointing exactly true north south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years\nAllegedly and yet we know nothing about it a few\nShort decades after Cleopatra's rain is pharaoh any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egypt shooting history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read I highly ... nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight\nTravelers explorers they traveled to Cairo and they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that you know and the answer air quotes\nWe don't know you know but it's really\nBig [laughter] that's that's it\nIt took nearly Eighteen hundred years to figure out the language and you would think that with all of the expedition to Egypt over the centuries that someone sometimes somewhere would have shown up who knew how to read write or speak any of it\nAnd then ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the ... mystery by Robert Duvall\nAnd that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing\nStory um you know that the Germans were aligned with the stars and it's just that that's just kind of opens up the up and and so I started reading a little bit more and uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off and and then I said I have to you know I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and I've met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shock a few months later and um you know just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing I'm with you a couple of years\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to\nThey started a you know communicating and life and my Mets a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shock a few months later and um you know it's just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um a few a couple of years in\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website and we're going to be discussing those and linked tonight on the program\nAnd you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast damn scroll down and you will see in the papers section and everything was in the rope a new is the first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight uh you and a rubber ball and Robert shock\nSat down and started discussing uh the the snakes and polished that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is a this goes back to Orion mystery so I you know while I was reading things I haven't met the gentleman yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I talk to myself if if an architect ah builds that three pyramids a and a line and and wanted to align them with a three belt starts with a wry and\nThey had to be some kind of record and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great pyramid the first one of the three with him you know\nAnd so I looked at the stature I started looking at the statue of humor and then we looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceived it that way\nAnd and so while as I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol\nOf a line that's on that are on the pedestal off that statue um I noticed it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the uh the book the that they just have co authored origins of the things which is an amazing ... by the way it is\nYeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section is developing a you know something that he knows the dreams dealer which is you know in front of the cause of the ... between the positive things and\nThere was a a so he was talking basically about the ... and this guy and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about the things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before that prevents were built if there was a schemes then it's it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember at the statue I remembered the lioness on the pedestal one thing led to another I posted something on my Facebook page\nRobert sawed and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or\nAt the um I think it was cosmic origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shocking we were sitting\nAt breakfast and I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than ... minutes and\nWe uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it is a this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight\nYeah why is it that the and one of the games are my two in general but you had the great pyramid the grades things are two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBut he's not documented the anywhere in Egypt history where you would think well you know the ... love to write everything he'd love to go to tell their story and not only that but taxes in an\nAccounting in season everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except for the grades things in the great pyramid wise is missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy on I mean you know the one answer you could give is that maybe we just we haven't found the records or the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or or maybe total absence um and of course that was the problem with this things you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nAn inscription that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something at least is things um\nThe pyramids we um you know when you are next so that when you buy the great pyramid there is a tool in front of the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years\nAfter a you know ... was alive and if you walk into that too um there's actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the ... in in in the two of them is called uh the whole rise of coup fool and next to it it's the um the you know to the contrary is great so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid\nSo they called at ... grade and coup whose job it was called their whole lives of Google\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is the glaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou earn through the pyramid yeah you would expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have right but there isn't even a general reference to two points in the direction and forget about the other something about how it was built built into the year was build\nYou know we still don't even understand the purpose\nAnd that it can do all\nThe way to monitor is um you know fifth century we see now this was in during Persian rule um two thousand years after the fact and and here what is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of details you know are you saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the plateau and then the pyramid was done at Twenty years\nUm and there were machines that were hauling up to blocks that you would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is Lugar each things you know we also have those same issues and if there was a for the dream Stella well and the inventory Stella ... we may not know anything at all\nBut yes that was the dream still a is a ... you know there was a dispute or at the turn of the um twentieth century that may\nHave those same issues and if it wasn't for the dream style a while and the inventory style or we may not know anything at all\nBut\nYet the well the thing is you know there was a dispute or at the turn left um twentieth century that may be a loss to force who is the author of the dream still up between the part of the things that he wants to build it that was actually being debated\nUm but there is a there is a small\nReference to operate but it's it's it's book in a way so there's no way you can say that um that it does definitely does not say they built it\nUm and so that's the dream Gillette even towards the all the other hand it's very direct it's typically states\nFirst of all it makes it very clear that what ... what I think overall I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same as it keeps the Greek name ... ... it's the same person\nSo that even towards us that story under critically what came to watch all the things already existed in fact it was broken heritage and then he built his pyramid and that was the pyramid is clean and it was\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now the east coast to coast damn are murals to be church or ... minute shaped exotic and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nFind out more about just log on to go see him do\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\nWalking back to the coast to coast am I ... church it's the great pyramid all my big beef or we get to the great pyramid\nOr ... minute safe Saudi and my new uh we were talking about the inventory cell and the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward and end the dreams della a tap most for\nSays mentions and in illustrates to thinks is there and desert Fox just tweeted is there a second ... well there's two ... says there\nI Know there Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... is there a second ...\n... it's a great question on so that was for that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the second things uh as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things are and that double things is in the underworld and of course he's a is\nA ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end\nBy things and these pictures are ... you know there are unmistakable\nSo so the answer to this question specific of course they have on the phone there is there are stories uh Arab historians referred to an actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build more\nSo there there was a physical things\nOn the other side of denial but it's there are things buried under the fence or that the west of a conference here that it's possible\nThe\nAim in stories daylight you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired the banks but built the great pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just to repair guy but he was there to repair and straighten up being a Great Pyramid why the discrepancy\nUh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned this yet\nBill agreed pyramid there are others that have interpreted the inventory still is saying that he was just to repair guy but he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why did discrepancy\nYeah uh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned is yet of course Egypt colleges at most ... do not accept the inventories de la as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we counter this argument so we're actually seeing is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so to your question\nUm ... the ah you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egypt she means to read it means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the ... the word for building which is a dead\nOr so the comes the combination is bad for him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a a is a is a strip of text where you know the pyramid building it was mentioned and yeah the verb that that this is not\nFurther a qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuild\nUm is that a hundred per cent proof no of course not and people have criticized even\nThe you know the fires of ... that was found in ... and the red sea\nYou know they're saying well you okay this is the ... talks about to a store and being ... a ... a a but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and uh who you mean it was a ... interview you within the other day he made a great point he said that ah he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was back field\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour activities that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up to courses and then you back so later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the view of it but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind about\nIt and there was a quite a bit of relatives or a you know pyramids the coup was dealing with uh also one of the ... why do why they could there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramid\nThere are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes\nYes yes there is a there is a reference to a head Knutson um hit Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who is a nuisance or she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he built a pyramid for her but the southern most of the three ah off the tree a green permits that are on an indie east field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but\nIn the human choice though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting Stella because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a prince says so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that she I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we we think is the poop shows that she was a print says\nSo that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then don't you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus on this Stella and that those are much further reasons why you should probably just reject this though because they're saying\nYou know if this were an old getting them story or at the time of coup who these ... ah you know ISIS on the side as we're not yet a work being worship there were not official states sanctions or in the eighties and we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nI'm like you know it's it's a contentious I I I don't want to make it sound like we have the house or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nThere's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling they don't even look like they were built by the same engineers around the same hands with the same care\nRight and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect those to be just as elegant even you know more complex yeah but they're not and they're just don't work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that departments have been a you know robbed of their stones\nAnd so what we're seeing are is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just a comment that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality a you know there are smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I but I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm I'm a middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old getting them\nNow let's get to what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yeah after we have been told over and over again\nAnd it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there\nWell clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is one of the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing um and the and what I liked about it is that it was non invasive um you didn't have to drill old she didn't have to you know like a\nA duty early explorers they've used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful and nowadays uh it's kind of like the pyramid is telling us\nYou know you wait until you have the technology to to find out about me without destroying me and I think now we're getting to that point\nYou know you wait until you have the technology to to find out about me without destroying me

I'm going to get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nHello there ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYeah go ahead Barry that yours go back ... can be\nYou like that do you like to the area [laughter] okay I\nHave to tell you what I always love hearing is that all that you may have more do you place great for me they gave the power\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I've got two questions and then I've got a great little short green quick joke about their armored collar just sit there and\nThe first\nQuestion is who is credited with Jimmy\n... or the deciphering and learning to read hieroglyphics and then the second question is\nAre Howard graphics brown go bike repair and Egypt in that area of the world the same however good things that are found in the pyramids of Mexico central and South America\nThat is\nThe ... so the question is how are you asking if there are your list here were lipstick inscriptions and go back like that that is that what you're asking\nOr no I'm asking are the ... that are written all the ... and Egypt going on a pair of ... the civil war and go backwards that the other to say my lipsticks that are found on the pyramids and Mexico and central and South America\nOh okay I understand I'm not I don't think so yeah there are different ... there are different ... and it's interesting you asking this question because you are you are basically giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak you are saying that the euro lipic inscriptions\nIn Quebec you happy in other words you're implying there is a there is there is writing there\nAnd um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be onto something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry okay although I'm not an archaeologist and I don't have any fancy degrees after my name right but there are certain things that are are in\nNot only on the stones at at going back to be but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures are they the same I don't know there is an H on the belts that looks very similar to the age blocks in boom boom who are are they related I don't know\nRight there are some astrological signs in Beckley tabby\nOr they are they representing the zodiac ah that were in then Darrow and throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world after that are they the same I don't know but uh go back early Tempe being that old\nCertainly is indicating that they were the first is the oldest is it the same language\nAnd then that no I I I don't think so but the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic she's like the I call it their knees age and the bells and when it looks like but did that age that age is repeated a\nThere's a very exciting possibility um regarding that question to ask and go back to the um and it's regarding the civil that you mentioned Jimmy there's a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I probably I might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know\nHim you know we'll do it right here on coast to coast oh there was one other uh one other point that I wanted to make about a ... a go Beckley taffy and it just got away from me bury it was right there but it just disappeared I mentioned it later on in the show thank you very\nNo problem thank for al\n... absolutely and uh the phone lines Manu I expected this ah are completely jammed up let's get in one more call them on all of them yeah let's let's go to\nThis is a who's going to go to my dad in New York my uh Europe next\nYes good morning gentlemen at great guinea and now and I guess on the ... I like to know if he\nHad looked at any of that highly effective highly of any age and I and I'm off I I think that might be the one that deals with the founding\nMedical knowledge that they have if if if I'm correct on that they take a loved one and the second part and I'll listen over there and whether he and and and the hobbit and and shock had hit it some of the um\nThe African and African American ballet who study the net net net too at\nA name on the language which is of that that ... that killed a phrase itself with say quit and when we look at people who call themselves a cabinet for\nAnd that in the kitchen you know before they get Greek came in and can say they're going to have a hit me can that college is ten minute when we got away from like can they say and also um me what you think\nWhy that it was like I think we got came up with and to me [noise] what they're fine with the little if not what it is and the African or not that I'm\nThinking that they call it a little odd ride so ... times will only saw oh sad if you follow them I'm not quite get it and I'll listen off the air\nThank you dad great okay three great questions and my new I'm going to get to them but that just goes to show you the extent of knowledge here with the coast audience or they don't play around on the\nFirst question um I I I Am all I have heard of the ... but uh the one that I have looked at more specifically\nThank you my dad great okay three great questions and my new I'm going to let's get to them but that just goes to show you the extent of knowledge here with the coast audience or they don't play around a ... the first\nQuestion um I I I Am I have heard of the ... a part of any but uh the one that I have looked at more specifically regarding medical information is\nThe first uh pirates Detroit's actually in my book um because on the reverse of two evils piracy there is an interesting\nCalendar or that's fixed Egypt colleges and I think um I found a solution to this calendar and that's described in the book\nUm and and yes it's a this is an ... so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about a pirate that's I think over sixty foot long ah is describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments and their remedies\nUm at this ... I Believe the tapes to the middle kingdom and and reaches back a most likely a probably to him or taps time so um if they were they were very skilled positions a inch Egyptians I'm\nThe second part yeah Ken Mitch and which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a ... that's an\nExcellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it your kitchen language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was the southern Egyptian culture\nAnd that script was mostly phonetic um and the evidence from that comes from children you Jay\nA king scorpions and that is I think or the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt uh probably from Bhutto\nBhutto was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably mess up with any uh with the live on and so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a fixture all so it was picked a raft\nUm so what you saw what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptians script was probably a originally Africa and maybe you know ... hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south in that\nAnd she brought up another really good point before we get to the break we've got about thirty seconds Manu ... the Greeks adapting uh the analogy a chemistry coming from candidate\nRight yes it's true I think she mentioned it's getting so uh my uh we we think that speaks was making before uh before Africa game I think it was we were I think it was the lioness and her name was make heat and by the way that's also probably an African of Africa or Joe\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast a damn it's all Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long or guessing I my new saved Sunday his paper is right there click on his website a coast to coast am we're going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us\n[noise] you just\nFind out more about tonight's gifts to log on to goose ... am dot com\n[noise] even human\nMe\n\nArizona State university offered over one hundred and fifty highly ranked degree programs one hundred percent on line\nYou learn the same degree it's your weight on campus from wherever you are on your scheduled press I don't see why mine except familiar transfer credits for information ... three five sidelined sapping\nLearned for yourself fly over here was ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report and learned to drive with Arizona State university for more information about all the one line ... lived for three five five one south and that's how I Do eat two three five five one second\n[noise]\n\n\nBack to coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church or ... minute tape study more talking about are the great pyramid and the discovery of not only chambers inside of the great pyramid\nBut his formula and his wife paper they published last week and how to locate them\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I guess ... we're talking about are the great pyramid and the discovery of not only does chambers inside of the great pyramid but his formula in his white paper they published last week\nOn how to locate them in one of the really quick minute that Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now and you can follow me on Twitter at a Jay ... radio impose your questions or comments about Tonight Show\nEither for me or or buy new right there and this question just came in before we get to a\nOn page three twenty eight of of of this report a minute this is the question this is from ... Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurement of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that those coordinates point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates to haven't\nHaven't yes um I haven't I propose\nIt's great to see this is this is when I really enjoy a about the coasts audience and and I guess like you're so there is so much information out there\nBut there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid yeah and this is one of those questions where\nThe math of the great pyramid has revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and that they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alison green who is look he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able\nTo connect uh the uh the title page of the ... Shakespeare sonnet to the coordinates or not to heaven but uh of course Allen might say it is ever\nWrite a ... to the coordinates of the great pyramid and specifically ah the the coordinates that Alan just discovered a fall right next to the ...\nWhich is next to the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have him on coast a a very soon probably next month\nAnd it is you're absolutely right in the title page of the sun it's with those Shakespeare\nAnd his work Allen greens work at deciphering that page and what he's revealed is I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it\nIt is absolutely incredible and we'll have among coast next month good okay so now that the top half of the pyramid yes a U.S said at the beginning of the show let's get to this it's a page number three twenty eight everybody in the ... the the ... report ...\nThe top half you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where we have been told there are none\nRight right and so um you know when we talked about a um a gun thing for your Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring that are found is when you get to guns and brings store\nJust before the the the floor off of the of the canal drops suddenly it's there's a depression\nAnd the way he isn't trip and one of the two ways he interpreted that is that must be a space that\nAllowed that four to cave in slightly so that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know these courses that we've just been discussing there is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in\nAnd that might correlate with uh if I go back to three twenty six will quick that could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth\nUm and and then that let's go out and so you know there's there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been a detective by me on again\nNow the row let's let's let's get to this first second and the\nUh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting at ... eighty four which is a shaft um and a ... going up words every body of one of those seven\nA and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the construction that have a different size in a different thickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as a show and going all the way to the surface and that is incorrect so I just use this illustration is is an old illustration um so that it that particular chef did not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of twenty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio\nAnd um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basically establishing in the lower part of the pyramid I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with hearing in other words there is a space at designed space not thought you know an accidental space\nIt designed space that correlates with each one of these particular course it\nNo you just got back from Egypt yeah we have to discuss the ongoing move on a project there which\nI did help them find this ... this new chamber above the grand gallery you describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw new detectors being place I'm a defining a different location and last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the queen chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up the grand gallery to the chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and there was confirmed that the scanning\nNow for the audience tell them what to move on detectors actually do where do they used for\nRights that these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so and cosmic radiation hit the atmosphere of particle called them you want is created and then you on as\nA negative they charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier ah than electron but it can pop through solid matter it travels at the speed of light it's lifetime is just over two seconds I'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones\nBut it is a is a bit heavier or didn't electron but it can pass through solid matter it's travels at the speed of light it's lifetime is just over two seconds I'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you can actually go for a person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs\nAnd in this case you can basically quote unquote X ray to pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then uh it showed up and then you have a chance\nTo see a space or because the yarns will travel more rapidly through open air than you know through solid stone so if you have a space in the ... way\nOf what you're what you're looking for than those viewers will arrive more rapidly and they ... and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors plays in the grand gallery could they be used to find the [laughter] the chambers that you're proposing in the upper half of the pyramid\nIt is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifact tool and I think they using this angle to confirm that the big void is real\nWhat it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of scan that yes that that could be some some of the lower ones maybe a you know on the graphic if we go back\nUm let's face seven twenty fifth and sixth twenty fifth it's possible that if there is a\n\n\nLose this hour for channel dot com I'm Rhonda Rochefort early Monday morning Sears Holdings filed

break this is coast to coast am [noise]\n\nUm but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that\nUm I can tell you that the uh you know the most crucial um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charter under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial\nAnd he has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another blind pouch in the back of the things I'm One of them was caused by um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves are into this things are looking for chambers\nAnd then you know the one that should be just mention of course we know from seismic analysis that there are it to our spaces under this beings\nAnd one of those spaces specifically which is what Robert shock or or was studying or years ago um is has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um it might be something in it that's of interest\nYeah he did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back a with another research expedition to bleed room right\nYeah yeah first well what we are what we would like to do first as to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced a\nSize law graffiti and maybe electric conductivity studies and to really get a very detailed look especially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know if you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven\nAnd ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw space about two meters\nA deep and uh and and then Roberts ah you know did his studies couple a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that this phase is five meters deep so we have a little bit of a death problem and then of course you know that's I of us in marketing or drilled in that area but we think that they missed it uh and I mean they\nAre they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far west from where we think the chamber is so they didn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them in of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so what we want you to do is you know just like a you know just like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non evasive study and really finding out the space\nAnd we'll be having a good idea where it is then with permission of course then work try a small probe into that space and see what's in it\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey is talked about and there's this this this rumor has been going around yea for quite a while Lew would just be great to finally put to bed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and thinks temple and there was a little depression and it's wet\nUm you can just you can just see the the water coming up and if if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber and so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber\nOr the very first thing we have to do is to a very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue whatever might be inside um you know sufficient enough itself becomes a very difficult project but it's doable Robert thinks it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly\nSpeaking of those things that just came in on Twitter this is from Baldwin is uh on Twitter and I have heard that it does\nThings may have\nBeen a woman's face and that it was changed and that is why it's head is too small forwards body\nYes well if we think\nWe think it was a female lie and so that part is partially we agree with that yes I don't think it was a person's head so um but we think that was a lie and that's there before and the head of the line this was weak carved into a what we see today\nNow um I Know that you tend to be a little reticent to talk about alien jury tee when it comes to ...

ago and I find myself in agreement with that uh that's one way you\nCould read it I you know I think I was ... data can invite that originally there used to be talking about the ... yeah right the lid off the uh South Africa as a ... right\nI have I have that's our topic is in my studio in the bunker and I have a reproduction of it hanging on the wall but and I stopped and I look at that my new and I don't have any other way to look at that step for\nThe controls hand controls an oxygen mask slain coming out of a a rocket motor on the bottom\nI I you know I don't have any problem with that I think this is a this is one way you can explain it and everything is it this day and age everything's on tables you just said it we're going to Mars\nAre the odds that there is and I I Know somebody recently published an article saying that there may not be intelligent life out there but I think I think there is it's a very likely and especially the physics of of a of the universe you know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following this\nBut it you know this one way that you can explain everything as a projection and if that's the case\nA dentist like Robert Duvall proposed in cosmic war is one way you can explain some of these contacts is it may be a message that gets broadcasts across the universe through you know through um a true Clinton fields\nAnd that message ends up on our end somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a pyramid\nUm I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is but we have to have some proof I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see some solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we hit the brake what do you have for a minute\nAbsolute owners with you guys really quickly a notion that struck me when you talked about structured spaces a look or make it quick\nCouple of quick jumps and laundry looking at the idea of a Greek scare the architect from all the trauma to the gym sins super big John talking term papers are forming old knowledge building big garbage structures uh who's to say I mean you really I mean could do\nYou know I guess people assume that the parents would be a periods are solid\nBecause they know may be just as you say is structured spaces be actually filled with Ford's\nRajiv on the rocks and everything you know arches inside big cavities like the temple\nYeah Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it that's the ...\nThe conclusions are that my news presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and boy could there be more\nYeah so I I have to you know I didn't I Need I have to mention shop here will do so he of course proposed an internal ramp years ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this is these on logistics base is basically to get the stones up the pyramid and just scan from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is that I think it's possible that the scanner was not sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that is that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm seeing that could be theological and shop here who dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know you have to pay for a but he still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know beat out as it may so we agree there are probably space is up there and um I just want to ask you a quick uh because\nThe pyramid of cool too\nIt's it's it's hot spaces inside researchers in the sixties right to offer is pure of it because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know corporate pyramid budding coffers pyramid all we have his bills only chamber\nWell let me jump in I've got to take a break right there but this is something we need to talk about when we come back or gas my new safe side hey this is all the great pyramid on coast to coast I'll be right back stay with us\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm Mm\nMm Mm Mm Mm Mm\nMm we\nAgain dial pound to five zero\nThey see the key word free bottle\n[noise]\n\nWalking back to the coast to coast am on this beautiful Sunday Now Monday morning\nHere in Southern California my new uh the phones have been amazing you ready to a head straight back to it let's do it let's go to speaking of Southern California and let's go to it's good to Monique right here in someone right up the street Monique\nWelcome Monique how are you there\nOkay he didn't do that so let's go right in order to go to Mary in New Jersey Mary Europe next on coast\n... politic you and your calf I'm kind of something like four years older or younger and somebody of a shiny unmanned standing there with the sword from the garden of Eden and he gets ... getting a block and building and the native ... and they said\nHow feeling that he said I any that I Am in that town now I think that if you buy like\nA tree of life it seems like off the Bible and the tiny ran into Egypt Abraham ran in the air for fade\nHave found that in their case a man in the air Marian ... around in there and um the lion\nKing County is where I'm defeated the woman will crush ahead of them because the evil why if they found like that and could that possibly be the original spot in the garden and you\nKnow that that is the million dollar question Mary and thank you for that uh my new guard new beaten in Egypt\nUm yeah I well first of all I I Want to recommend an author to you a merry I'm a David roles so he's a he's really done some excellent work on a ... a basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt\nUm and so you may find some answers or you know with him so I think he's producing a television series and he's written books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think in the holy if I remember this correctly\nUm but yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the uh the early ... um when they were in Egypt um I think uh there is for specially Joseph I'm that's what the role is describing Joseph real figure\nAnd ah lived in a in a in a place called a virus which is in the delta\nAnd had a palace and was that was basically a A N tuned in a pyramid and he was such an important official at the court\nAnd I'm a and then all of a sudden I'm you know this virus community disappears indices archaeological evidence at well piece together um and David role is basically saying that\nAh where are you worried historians got it wrong is that they they were looking for the biblical story in a in the new kingdom and it's it David role is finding that it was probably a couple of centuries earlier\nThis I just came in on Twitter this is from Jay and Jay says I heard the surgeon tools for found indeed you shouldn't pyramids that doctors use now true or false\nUm I well what was found is that a is a a tool that looks like a ... a like a small it's like a fish tell\n'em what on I I'm not sure that was a surgeon's tool but of course we don't know\nUh it was found in the I think it was in the northern ... a shaft of the queen chamber by a waymen Dixon um and he uh and it's now and the British Museum a with a with a with a ground ball\nUm but whether or not that was a ... and ... other than that I don't know of any surgical tools found inside of the games up here and ms\nLet's go to bill up in Oregon bill you're up next on go say to my new\nName on it Hi Jimmy yeah this is a really academic discussion tonight and I've got nothing you know nothing against that congratulate you on your discovery\nBut my question is um okay so I just want you to speculate a little bit is that you just chambers or for construction in engineering\nCould they be like for instance for architects to put gold on the Internet or could um if their theological could be you know some sort of burial chambers for for those I'm the king wanted to proceed him into the um afterlife\nYeah great question yeah great question bill I'm Glad I'm Glad you asked that because I Will speculate that I I'm I'm looking for just ...\nI think because there is obviously I'm proposing uptick ten chambers so I was thinking well what if it's the logical what could that be and I think the answer is the end they add\nSo in the ... are they are the ... was known for the center of the worship of that nine major God this kind of like the pantheon of of the ancient Egyptians\nAnd I think ah these chambers are dedicated to each one of the year these and and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one that is the crucial chamber or wherever we may find the kind of things that you just mentioned are but I'm suspecting there could be piracy both in their\nUh with inscriptions\nI'm so that would be very exciting if that if what if that were ever to be found a but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm all I think I'm with John P o die think this is still on the table that there may have been spaces there that\nHelped the workers to pull up the stones or to the top it's possible\nUm and we'll just have to wait for the next scan I think the next county will give us some new information\nNow I have heard some rumors minute that they have already gotten the inside of the new chamber above the grand gallery and have removed items from there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nYeah I I'm not I happened to those rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's put it that way\nOur ... and have removed items from there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nYeah I I I'm not I happened to those rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's put it that way\nIt would certainly help the tourism I mean in terms of less right\nWhich has dropped off I Am heard you know you just got back from Egypt I have heard from so many friends that have been going to Egypt for decades\nAnd that you can as a tourist because ... years past it was crowded all the buses were there you had to wait in line and there was a you know thousands of people on the ... the plant to but today you can burn truly be the only person there\nYeah that I had there was a couple of days when I felt like that Jimmy I um you know it was not\nThere were there are parts of think he's a plateau where I was the only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders\nSo yeah tourism has been down and they um you know they want to build a new museum and uh and of course they have to if they discover something they are the are going to show it to the world so that people come and look at it I that's why I'm hopeful that if they have something that they haven't shown us yet that we'll we'll find out about\nThis uh this is from Twitter this is from David I Love this question actually did the Nazis research Egypt shouldn't areas as depicted in the raiders of the Lost Ark\n[laughter] oh that's a good question it is a great question it's a great question the question um\n[noise] you know I I I don't know I don't know for sure I Know that Germans

applied to there's an awful lot of sand there\nYeah but well my my favorite place to look at it and and of\nCourse Robert Robert favorite place to look would be a besides the you know uh besides that left paw is in front of the two temples if we could dig deep in front of the temple is you know where people nowadays uh watch the light show\nA there could be the actual entry to this passage that we think is under the things that could be in front of this thing's temple and then the other thing is we I predict in towards the paper we're predicting\nThat there may have been also a temple or east of the valley temple a and that was dedicated to Cyrus and that would be also underground so that would be one of my favorite place and then you mentioned as things on the other side is there's things on the west side\nYou know of course if that's a great place to look a is there another sings maybe those three places will be my favorite places to go\nWhen you look at what I find the most intriguing about the gays applied to of course everything facing western facing the Nile uh there's there's a lot there have been for reasons with the causeway and the entrances and so forth but\nWhen you look at the original survey maps that were done in the Eighteen hundreds of the games are plateau there is an awful lot of that is behind the uh the pyramid complex facing\nA west in northwest there's a lot there and uh not only were the tunnels represented all the way back into the uh early Eighteen hundreds\nBut there is a construction that is represented in those original survey maps that really hasn't been explored sense\nYeah yeah that's right that's right there there there are some places in Egypt that cannot be export because there are military zones or you know for example the the northern a pyramid of why it or are we on a you know this is an incredible amazing place\nOr with the huge trends at the oval office placement um but\nThere's nothing going on since the sixties because it's a military zone so yeah I mean to your point in the in the west field way out and I do notice for a fact I don't know if this was a military zone right now but you know some areas are basically off limits and yeah there was secrets hiding under the fed potentially\nAnd who knows what we're going to be able to urge them\nWe'll be right back just as coast to coast am stay with

to an answering the questions from the coasts listeners not only\nA via the bones but of course Twitter too as well an amazing amazing\nThis is great yeah it's just it's it's such an important time for research and what is going on I think that the great pyramid is finally starting to give up or some of its mysteries so with that\nLet's let's get right back to the phones are we've got one last a segment here let's go east to the Rockies Larry out in Jacksonville, Florida a good\nMorning new fighter mourning mourning James\nUh good morning Larry Ann how are you in the hurricane were you okay\nAh where I'm located or am I got married but I'm I'm located on the east coast\nYeah but it it it it was as such a wide big storm that it it it affected everything up north there\nUh yeah I feel sorry for those people\nBut yet they've lost everything\nYeah yeah so you guys were okay over on that side\nWere good on that side we've got a little whether book brain and whatever but we're good\nAll right Larry what do you have for my new\nHere's something quick or Edgar Edgar Casey reading Edgar Casey on that land if it's a it's a paper bag right it might be interested in reading and do you does wife reading\nA first for march Nineteen sixty eight but he talked about between ten thousand seven thousand period um there was a migration of the car faith you return\nAnd then vote voted in Concord Egypt [noise] one of the leaders of this trial was re Tom ... pay the\n... current and it of course I'm well all I wanted to say was basically the chamber the team's chamber negotiation chamber it if not a to write a according to Reuters you might check that out there it's very enlightening\nAnd the original capstone with court\nOr the pyramid pyramid has rent it and it which produces under pressure five electricity\nAnd you may know all of us are right hand and maybe we're done that\nI Know I've heard the theories yes um especially you know the electricity theory I've heard about that of course at gr Casey\nProduce energy the tell your occurrence earth currents the Nile is rerouted it did route are adjacent to the pyramid or under the pyramid and the uh the purpose of it was to generate a electricity\nWell Larry let me ask you a question instead of you asked me my new a question [laughter] are you ready if I can answer ... ... ... you see a you know in Christopher done and others have talked about uh the\nThe pyramid being a machine and possibly a generator power and energy that is the case Larry what would they have used it for\n... to ... to provide a labor free energy\nYeah you know what and Larry thank you for the phone call my new that's exactly what a Christopher done\nUh as I said to me last week while he talked about it for years of course is um it wasn't a big revelation with me but that it was energy for the for the people of Cairo in Egypt\nYeah you know you know what I really love about Christopher done this that he\nHe looks at the observations and he puts it into a model that is a completely uncovered by prejudices and biases he just fits all the observations into a model and that is he you know if I if I were doing the investigation he'd be the first call to have them on board um\nYou know so I yeah I he's amazing absolutely I I Love the interview and I've read has worked before and very impressive person\nLet's go to wild card was go to Carol in Charleston D.C Carol you're up next on coast now my Carol hello Carol\nWell here quite ... several years ago\n... last only twice that both found found artifacts and thought oh man found Cleopatra him all outweigh underground oh did you hear anything about you\nKnow I as far as I Know I I I haven't looked into this in detail\nAs far as I Know but to them is not discover it but you know maybe it has been discovered and it's not published as possible\nA woman's your second question Carol\nAh without being in archaeology is how do you go about getting involved with what is that research great\nYeah that's a great question so yeah I have to I Want to make sure I explained to her every one so I'm not an archaeologist I'm also not a credential Egypt causes this is for me it started as a hobby and all of course it's a serious endeavor\nOr you have to be associated with an Institute a research place or university which I Am now I Am a you know it's supposed to be affiliated with Boston University\nUm and so then you can apply for permits and you have to you know you have to do the application you have to uh they have to review the application and they may say no\nAnd you don't have a recourse I'm also will have to see if they allow it but if it's not me it's okay or somebody else you know my my I think you know I wanted to get the information out there are other people can see it other researchers\nAnd they might be able to get a permit to investigate further and that's okay with me\nYou should do the same thing Carol are you researching on your own now\nI'm getting old and and what they found a curious why ... says that name national news twice\nYeah and and Carol or one of the things that that I like to do and I encourage others is blog ... research and in in publish in self publish yourself and and continue because once you start to do that because I Do it myself and and certainly so does my new\nThat others out there\nAre attracted to you and they will find your information and then they started sharing their information with you and you suddenly have a network right in front of you so I I I encourage then I encourage blogging\nAnd creating your own website just like my new did and and look what happens in the end let's uh let's go east of the Rockies is going to Manuel in San Antonio Texas you're up next on ... men\nDon't you hate doing and I know a thing for the kids are fading ah what I what I wanted to know like that\nYou just like my new did and and look what happens in the end let's let's go east of the Rockies is going to Manuel in San Antonio Texas you're next on those\nWho do you how you doing and I know a thing over but participating or what I what I wanted to know is like the gentleman that called before a film that there was that a bird or something\nOn the hieroglyphics on on the the the\nTwo of the game but there was also one in in uh in Peru and there was a little one the mythical\nIf those ... made me think being in the bird in the same thing oh that's a good question and you answered my question I wanted to know how can we get all this stuff and come up be bored and you say right off the bat a lot of money\nIt costs a lot of money to do stuff into\nYeah your I'm Sorry I'm not hearing I'm hearing the question\nI mean he was saying that you brought up a more why you answer this question that why hasn't this been brought up before and it always comes down to money and that's where this was his point but the first\nOr the birds a dinner represented throughout different cultures around the world on a different temples and and pyramid and we're seeing in over and over\nRight so the big the the the most important question in my mind okay which is probably the same question that uh you know a ... early research has worked confronted with when they looked at the Egyptian ... lives is if the symbol is the sound or if it\nIf it actually a means what it shows uh that's probably the most important questions so when you have a bird in an Egyptian", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Vernal", "day":
