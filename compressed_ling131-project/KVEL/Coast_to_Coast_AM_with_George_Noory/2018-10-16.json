were really ... in here you are but I've got to tell you a great story you've been on the program a couple of times but a couple of years ago when you were on with me\nYou did an experiment where you had people bring their watches in clocks that were working the whole by the radio in in you did this incredible thing and I got emails that night in for the following week from people who said oh my God\nMy watch is working it hasn't worked in years\nThe funny part about all this is ... years later we re ran part of that program on our weekend shows and I started getting emails from people after that scene George my watches are working my clock is working\nAnd I'm going what's going on here or he was on two years ago and it didn't dawn on me that we had re run that show a couple of days before that\nThe power of what you did was unbelievable\nYes you know George ... people think that when I Am on television or radio and when I ask people to bring broken house appliances broken watches all close and by the way we we have if you wish we can repeat\nThe same experience sure and so people think that it's actually um my energy that flies through the airwaves\nAnd and they come out of the radio and television but it's really know what I Do you can simply trigger I'm I'm simply and it\nHappened to the how the mind of our listeners or the viewers um big TV shows these has actually worked\nStarted my career in a very unusual way I was on the BBC Nineteen Seventy three it was my first big television show and\nTo the how the mind of our listeners or the viewers um big T. V. shows this is actually worked started my career in a very unusual way I was on the BBC Nineteen Seventy three\nIt was my first big television show and they handed me for two band and I don't know why and what made me do this but I looked into the camera and I said everybody at home going get your spoon\n[laughter] get\nBroken watches I didn't realize that I sent around ten million people through the kitchen because everyone wanted to experience this\nPhenomena first of all no one believed that spoons and folks are going to bend and watches we've come alive but they nevertheless they brought this food they broke broken launches in pocket watches and I mean it was\nMessy and then I did my my thing I said one two three work we scream three times one two three work work work and lo and behold\n... Curt exactly what happened to you people from all over England Wales in Scotland and Ireland [noise] you know there you you didn't have then um you know Twitter in face time and you you you just didn't have the Internet there were no more my phone\nWas old fashioned black phone and what happened is the BBC's telephone system\nWho didn't take the hundreds of thousands of calls from people all across Britain and he collapsed and the next day of course I was kind of the most\nFamous person in in England the newspapers ran headline stories or we get our puts England in a band so ... year is George I thought that I did\nIt I really believe that I admitted that energy that fix broken clocks and bend spoons but the day I discovered that I was wrong was in in Los Angeles\nUCLA and Dr Feldman most ... invited me to her class and of course I did my my act and I left\nWhen I didn't know George is that she secretly recorded me while and I went back to New York\nTwo weeks later she took that heavy video remember those videos in Nineteen Seventy four Seventy five and Seventy six and she put that in her a video recorder she invited a new set of fuel for those students with broken watches and lo and behold\nThere watches started teaching from that video\nNow she calls me in New York and she tells me Henri you just fix broken watches and you know scientists\nAnd I said no way what are you talking about I mean New York I didn't even know that you you're doing this experiment and that's when he told me that it's basically I'm a trigger army capital east I mean in may ... to the power of the mind of just ordinary people\nWell when you were on the radio show with me you started watches and clocks all around the world and people will just we're just our gas was amazing I first met

was packed in a I got ... formation and had him on my local show when I was the night talking we've stayed friends ever since\nLots of things have been going on in your life and we'll get into that ... while you're with us but the big story that has started to come out has been the CIA recruiting you a long long time ago what did they want with you\n[noise] okay with it all started um when I was Thirteen Years old I Lived in Cyprus and you could see how we left because my parents divorced my mother remarried Hungarian Jew living in the ... which is the capital of the Cyprus yes\nAnd he added tiny bed and breakfast type of a hotel with a Thirteen rooms\nAnd Mossad the Israeli intelligence services they found out that we're from Israel so they basically turned the hotel\nInto ease into a more safe house oh spies would come into the hotel they would check under\nYou know teachers geology ... but they were really most of the agents that were from Cyprus where a flying out to Syria and Jordan and Egypt and Iraq to spy\nAnd there were problems in Cyprus if I remember during that time period because I always used to remember them talking about Cypriots fighting with Greek people and there was something going on there wasn't there\nOh yeah there was a civil war it was it was just awful yeah but I was when I when I came to Cyprus I was only live and I didn't know English and I so people blown up I I I mean\n... out of Mormons I've seen everything uh curfews booms exploding ah so\nBeing at that age it really changes your life so I went through the whole war the Greeks were killing ... the British soldiers the Turks were killing the Greeks but why all this was going on\nI was ah I befriended their Mossad agent who told me to you know run errands for him he would send me letters we she didn't allow me to open but my task was to jump from the bicycling psycho them to the conflict\nIn the Israeli conflict any out there reason I told you the story is because I already was excited about you know the the the life for fear of spy\nYeah and I love movies so to make a long story short um when I became kind of well known in Israel I met um golden Meyer who was the\nPrime minister right\nAnd she introduced me to Ari Sharon you know these are all of your gender roles and that they are insured and introduced me to the intelligence community and they started using my abilities\nHold on right there or we're going to take a break and let's come back and pick that up right from there because you truly room in the middle of all that with some of the leaders of Israel

devices read news if your ... soup we want to enjoy our website on your moon ... dot com on your iPhone or Android rose or\nYes they introduced me to the head of Mossad uh they recruited me and I started doing some work for them which we weren't going to but they basically didn't have the technology to test my abilities\nAnd they picked up the phone in the cold the CIA\nAnd it was a CIA scientists quote kitten green who took the coal basically talks about it in a fascinating documentary called the secret life of foreign gather\nProduced by the BBC and it's on my website you can watch it um my website is already gathered dot com and um they asked the CIA to test me\nThey wanted to know they wanted information of how the mind works how ... the occurs and in Nineteen Seventy two I left is where it's great to California to Palo Alto to Stanford research Institute which is today Stanford University and I\nWent through rigorous a laboratory controlled condition test a and then I started working for the CIA doing\nYou know stuff all over the place for them but just about a year ago I asked you mentioned before the CIA release that some of the documents\nUm that concerned me and it was amazing the twin you know the press\nTo hold of this story any twin worldwide\nYes and die in these documents they show drawings that I've done um from you know inside parity cages are

listen to that very carefully because we're apt to overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook simple things if you are concerned about negative forces in your life the golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there was an esoteric and a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt they really have to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of science has from cyclical research the quantum theory rising we have made the determination over the past eight years\nThat time is not what we think it is linear time is basically a very powerful illusion that we use to organize our lives and it's a necessary illusion but if it's an illusion that means that we are selecting events\nAll the time from across in and send it to the possibilities so I don't use the term manifest I use the term select and you can select events under the right circumstances within exquisitely focused and the motive Lee charged thought and that's what's going on we are selecting\nIn the same way that when you take a measurement and the particle lab you're very decision to take that measurement will affect what you experience the same is true in our life\nCan you use these powers to affect your health\nWithout question and and I have to emphasize that we live under lots of laws and forces or one of them is a lot of physical declined one of them is a law mortality there's never been an exception to that but one must never feel that you're without devices that year without tools\nIn the book I write about extraordinary cases of spontaneous remission of diseases which doesn't mean that is going to happen to people all the time I Would never extend false hope but the cases are there the occurrences are there and we have to probe and look at these things\nVery often they correlate with intensive\nA meditation people who have meditative three hours a day have recorded instances in the medical literature of remission of diseases not all the time but it has occurred\nYou say that when you were writing the book or something weird happened with the rock band the monkeys\nOh it was George talk about us all being loose in time a couple of summers ago I was getting into the music of the monkeys just completely out of the blue and my wife thought I was going nuts my kids were memorizing\nThere I Would think you are going nuts yes you would think that no one could imagine what they have they didn't have a few good song\nThey really did they had some beautiful pop songs [laughter] and I was playing them all the time I was getting into them everybody thought I was going crazy I couldn't figure out why I was getting into the monkeys\nGeorge it was months and months later that I got a call from an editor at the Washington Post who said to me do you know Mike Nesmith who was one of the members of the monkeys I said no\nHe said that you know Nesmith just wrote a memoir and I said no and he said did you know he was at a Christian Scientists which is a a a a healing and and mentally based on a form of spirituality I said no he said well we'd like you to\nIn a a review Nesmith a memoir for the Washington Post you interested and I said of course I'm interested in I told him this story of how months before without any for thought about any of this I started getting into the monkeys\nAnd I actually put this into the review and the Washington Post to its credit included this material that was just the weirdest thing that it was almost like retro causality in a way whereas if I was loose for money or time this is why I'm saying that time is not what we\nThink it is I was completely prepared for that opportunity because for reasons that no one could understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason seemed to be off in the future so to speak but my contention is it wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once which is why mental focus is so effective\nI was sixteen when the monkeys started plane was there a long long time ago and if I remember one of the members was Mickey Dolan that's right who pleads shook his boy on television right that's\nRight and and still touring still touring\nThe yeah who is still going that's absolutely not I Love them [laughter]\nAnd do you know the name ... gallon burger money chance I don't ... wrote a couple of books one called liquid luck oh of course All right I Know the book I Know he he would conduct experiments still does in Las Vegas mhm with groups of people ... ... each each\nTrying to prove that positive thinking and the mind has a lot to do with influencing things that happen\nThat's right and and he is totally convincing these convinced me too that if you go into a situation like Las Vegas upbeat and you know just you know positive about things\nThe odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is that outlook has been validated by Syria CSP research my hero J. B. rind pioneered scholarly ESP research at Duke University in the early Nineteen thirties J. B. is now deceased and one of the things that Jay be found that he just buried this\nIn the foot notable book but it's monumental that when his subjects in the ESP lab and these were people tested under very rigorous conditions when they had a feeling of hopeful expectancy when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were a positive their scores\nSpike when they were bored when they were down cast when they were fatigue their scores depth\nAnd it was inevitable ... spike followed mood it's the same thing that he says in the book\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't happen to be Las Vegas down in you know putting that black cloud over your head for whatever reason yeah he's not going to happen for you\nIt's not going to happen and the thing that I always tell people is and again this one of these familiar things but listen very carefully to it you must really wanted you must really want it if you're a person who's attitude is neither here nor there about winning in Vegas or the lottery or money or whatever\nIt's not going to work it has to be something that you really want which is why it's so important to me surely identify your most heartfelt desires there's real power there because the power comes from an emotionally charged thought\nWe're talking with Mitch Horwitz his latest book is called the miracle club as a matter of fact we are going to tell you how you can\nGet a membership and the miracle of a little bit later on in the program is website is his name all linked up for you and coast to coast am dot com it's amazing how did how did you decide to write this kind of a book\n[noise] you know it was funny I had written a history of the positive mind moving a couple of years ago called one simple idea and I began to realize\nEvery chapter that I wrote every person who I talked about in the book I was using their methods I was road testing these things myself\nAnd I thought to myself look if I'm experimenting with these methods myself\nAnd that's what's driving my historical research why am I right about the methods why didn't I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques and it was a big step because a lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves as believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted to share\nWith readers the acts\nIf I'm experimenting with these methods myself and that's what's driving my historical research why am I right about the methods why don't I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques and it was a big step because a lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves as believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted to share\nWith readers the actual hands on things I Do in my own life\nHow powerful is our human mind which\nIs powerful in ways that our generation is only coming to understand look we are realizing that things work out there like for the\nPost surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George and lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them things that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated and clinical experiments today I think this universe is ultimately\nMental that doesn't mean that we don't\nLive under many laws and forces but if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs that the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nWe're dealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiments but the thought change the brain your sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter so if fought\nChanges the brain that fought has to be something that extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nLook we're human beings sometimes things work sometimes they do that Iraq if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try a method it works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work and then they feel project that one of the things that I write about in the book is that we live\nWithin a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws enforces the law of mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity but you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by mass the mind is the same way circumstances\nAre going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're ordinance that we experiment very clearly and very carefully\nWhich we're going to come back and talk more about your work the miracle club next hour we'll take phone calls questions and miracle stories [noise]\nDon't forget to watch a TV show beyond

there is without question you know ... experience in this country about eighty years of serious\nCyclical research serious experiments that the u._s. be Greek admissions a weapon the and George the evidence is simply overwhelming and what we're seeing in the SP lab is that the mind\nPossesses extra physical qualities there are ways that we receive and yet and give information that go beyond the

to you may be based on your emotions your enthusiasm your focus\nAnd you believe that you can just change your entire life this way you get a better job maybe find the relationship you're looking for just about all that stuff\nI Do believe that but the here's the key thing and this is really the magic key if there is one behind all of our self help systems you must want it with\nEverything in you you must want it with passionate intensity and we often tell ourselves that we want things without scrutinizing and examining our convictions do we really wanted for example\nWe say we want a job when what we really want is security we say we want a new relationship when what we really want\nMaybe is is is something else you know to move to a different city or to have a different domestic arrangement or to somehow rearrange the furniture of our lives it's very important that we get down to the essentials of what we really want before we put a label on it because I Would contend that what\nYou want over time you're going to get do people know what they want\nThat is really the key thing we tell ourselves well we want you know we say gee I Want a better job I Want romance I Want to

experienced many different laws and forces like the law of gravity as I was saying and the previous segment\nSo I think it's a mistake to think that our minds and our thoughts are the only game in town so to speak they are part of the game they are part of the game and that's important enough that's essential enough\nYou write about how people travel back into time to help their current life yeah but can't that also be dangerous\nYes it can and it's a very interesting prospect this is why I tell people be careful of what you're thinking about be careful of what you're doing because you know we like to play games with ourselves and we'd like to say\nGee you know if I could travel back into time and give advice to my Fifteen year old self what would I say well my contention is you may be doing that all the time that may be happening all the time\nLinear time is very likely a very powerful illusion that we use to organize our lives but what we've discovered\nIn the hard sciences as well as over the course of testimony from centuries is that life is intimate everything is happening now there is in and finish to events occurring at once and we select among them so it could be that we are selecting among the events past president future\nAll the time and yet these things feel very real to us very set in concrete to us but I Would contend that when you think about going back and giving advice to a young herself\nYou may actually be doing that so be careful be careful we are granted perspective we are granted some perspective but use your mind use your thoughts carefully

things that aren't prescribing they can't direct their mind in a positive way\nThey are all kinds of methods and techniques I can give them but let's face it there are times in life where we feel

questions for Mr Horwitz class envy usually is not good but there are these persistent studies that show\nThat home your family is now where you're born ... really do determine where you end up in life I see this all the time I get highly myself for heart fast city resident and\nEven though a lot of us in the city have different backgrounds and circumstances there still good people in the city when they just can't seem to get ahead and this will lead me to my second question\nAh people really have a hard time just visualizing where they might end up in that I Want to bring up the horrendous car crash in\nSkull Harry New York where ...\n...\nI ... I was reading some of their ... and many enough of these people were truly professional in their lives\nYou know one because there was evidence before the crash of something bad was about to happen I Know myself I Would have spoken up and said get me out of this debt trap but these those people Mr Horwitz of uh\nUpper middle class the all basically we remained mom no one spoke up their their very lives were coming to an end\nAnd yet you say a from a ... a higher exalted background that people should\nKnow but that that they were like many people are and society they they were conditioned to stay quiet and it ended up costing there are a lot there were twenty people killed Eighteen in a limo not one spoke up to say this has got to stop\nPull over now and they could have but they didn't like she\nDoes say if they want to their deaths\nSort of wrap all of this up um whether me in the city and seen my fellow city residents many of them\nGood enough but not getting ahead and then in skull Harry these upper middle class people not speaking up for themselves I'd like you to tie this together and so far as why to say it if I have to like sheep so many ...\nOf all of this up um ... weather me in the city and seen my fellow city residents many of them good enough but not getting ahead and then in ... Harry these upper middle class people not speaking up for themselves I'd like you to tide us together and so far as why to say it if I have to like sheep\nSo many people go to their dome and they just can't bring themselves to grab themselves by their lapels and just speak up for themselves and say gosh darn just let all of this stop and let us all come together and do something about it\nAnd she let me let me ask you because we have the story the night in happened it was a tragedy for sure but what do you mean by should tell somebody to stop what was going on inside the limo ...\nThere are indications that the car was basically use my term coming apart at the uh people are saying uh amongst the victims 'cause they had cell phones that we can't we can't even hear each other next to each other\nOr talk to the car\nWas being coming very noisy and and literally coming apart at the scenes and you would think that intelligent people and many enough for both of you these were quite professional people would noticeably higher ... middle class jobs where they should\nHave had the smart the know how justice say I'm going to speak up here get this driver to pull over and I know because you've heard me before me teeth oh that driver would uphold over no if fans who are being you know I\nI Would have wanted to be in that limo would you you would have stopped that guy\n... you know there's a lot to unpack and we'll keep is saying and of course I I read that same news coverage now you know there's a new age expression there are no accidents and I break with that expression I don't I don't abide\nBy that everything happens for a reason\nRight right one of the things I write in the book\nIs you know as I've been alluding we live under many laws enforces we experienced many laws in forces and I've never including love accident including accidents of birth for example now peer pressure as as Keith was alluding\nIs an extremely powerful force then it can be a destructive force one must never get caught up in peer pressure because it can be a kind of group mentality regardless of\nWhether it holds you too where you've been born or it keeps you from speaking\nUp if you're seeing something that you think is dangerous it's vitally vitally important that everybody acts with independent agency that doesn't mean you can escape accidents that doesn't mean you can escape tragedy but my contention is\nThat the mind is one vital element that participates that participates in other things that are going on and it is extremely important\nTo exercise it at all times you're never without devices whether you're facing a crisis or based on the accident of birth and economic class I Can't\nTell you and I would never tell anyone that there aren't crushing forces socially and economically there are but the fact is the mind is one vital tool and your belt that you can always use and it can make all the difference at a crucial moment\nIt is one thing we think of ourselves as having mines that control cognitive and motor function and that's true but there's more to it than that there's more to it that the mind is extra physical properties and it doesn't mean that it necessarily determines everything and every force that occurs or comes into her life\nBut it's one vital tool and my messages\nUse it use it always and everywhere and in every circumstance whether its environment as Keith was alluding to or whether it's a situation that you think is going to be\nHazardous never feel bound by peer pressure there is no more wanting force of your own will ineffectiveness in potency than peer pressure it must be escape\nLet's go to Tom is a long way in California you know like I'm going like\nGeorge thank you for taking my call very up the interview

man it's one of the longest chapters in the book actually oh fantastic\nFantastic I just love narrow National Guard and his whole idea that\nYour imagination you has your reality yes really the outside of events but\nIt's your own human imagination yes creates your reality yes yes\nDevil is truly my hero and for any listeners who haven't heard of him he was a British bar Baden mystic who lived and worked in America died in Nineteen Seventy two\nAnd if the caller was describing metal taught that your imagination is God and that the God of scripture\nOld Testament New Testament is really a metaphor for your imagination and everything that you see and experience including my own voices you're hearing it right now is really coming from within you it is rooted in you I Am rooted in you as you are ultimately rooted in God and that everything\nThat happens to your relationships your experience you're listening experience right here and now is really your motive fall\nInto

things using the power the mind\nIt's absolutely crazy there was a Harvard study and George this is the God's honest truth and I give the details and the miracle club there's a Harvard a clinical

your calls as well fascinating work Mitch and what's even greater about all this it really does work\nIt really does work you know I always tell people that I Would never give somebody an exercise that I haven't rode tested and I treat every reader as I Would a member of my own family every single method technique exercise in this book is something that I Would give to my own kids to use it really does work\nWe briefly touched on your thoughts about people going back into time in order to help their current life how do you do that\nYou know Georgia it's simple as just focusing mentally on what for example you might want to tell\nYour younger self that's something that's a million to us we often think of that as novelties so it's easy to picture I made the determination I write about this and the final chapter of the miracle club that once I had come to feel that linear time was basically an illusion that everything is happening infinitely and all at once\nIf you can actually enter into a relaxed meditative state and\nPicture of yourself into the scene going back giving advice to your younger self whatever age maybe you want to avert a tragedy or disaster maybe you want to dispense a piece of advice\nIt can change your life right here and now in the presence but be careful because sometimes things that we as experience as challenges or tragedies also bring maturity\nTo our life they also bring refinement to her life so you don't necessarily want to raise something that was a difficulty because that might have been a springboard to some sort of greater maturity or lesson so reflect very very carefully on what you want to tell your younger self and then imagine yourself into that\nScene imagine yourself into that scene write down what you want to tell your younger self because by writing it down you'll be able to actually have some sort of a compass point or vantage point from when you can tell whether things are different I think you will find that things will be different\nWhy do you say that it could be dangerous to do that\nWell because if we go back and we are race adverse cities we could be a racing something that taught us a vital are necessary lessons sometimes the aspects of our lives that were most proud of came to us from adversity so we want to be very careful this is not a game\nThis is not a toy is not something to play around with you want to be really sure that whatever the consequence you want to go back and encourage your younger self to do something healthy unimportant and productive but don't think of it as just avoiding tragedy because tragedy can actually be a springboard to maturity\nNow here's the sixty four thousand dollar question Mitch how does it work\nHow does it work that is the question and I don't shy from that question the fact is I don't think we manifest things I think we select\nThings I think as in the particle lab\nEverything in our lives as in super position and it becomes localized only when we focus on it as if we are almost drawing up a matrix grid and when we isolate a spot or point in time on that grid we experience\nIt as being as vividly real as my voice that you're hearing right now so\nOur actual act of life is an act of selectivity what we emotionally and mentally picture rise and focus on is the experience that we enter into because everything is happening at once and we go in and out of these things the way a particle goes from a wave state and then it collapses\nInto a localized particle state select\nVery carefully time is infinite an hour\nAnd mentally picture rise and focus upon is the experience that we enter into because everything is happening at once and we go in and out of these things the way a particle goes from a wave state and then it collapses into a localized particle state select\nVery carefully time is infinite and our minds our sensory tools are a measuring device by which we can help decide exactly what we're going to experience\nWas going to bury in Rock Hill South Carolina on the wild card line he go ahead\nHello there George what a pleasure in these are\nYes Mitchell which a lot of it is to hear you on the air I Love it when you're old coast to coast you're such a a they in positive person during a thrill the same way thank you so much appreciated our ears by not positive they think your
