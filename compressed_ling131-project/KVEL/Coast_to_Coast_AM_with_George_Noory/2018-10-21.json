morning we're coming do you live from coast Toronto, Canada affiliate\nIn Denver radio news talk contests last night I mentioned this news talk ten ten the old C F R B had been on the radio for eighty years correction it's more like Ninety Ninety years [noise] also last night\nOr should I say earlier this morning during the open line segment a number of callers shared their near death experiences or glimpses of an afterlife\nTonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time and alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist\nHarry Houdini Houdini and his wife best were fears the bunkers of psyche ability mediums and the spiritual this movement in fact Houdini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and there are fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving for unexpected punches was abdomen\nBy McGill University student backstage at the princess theater in Montreal Canadian connection there on his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wide best he would do so\nThen more than two years after his death\nHis wife best attended the sands\nConducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which forward allegedly channeled the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to\nBy Harry and bass initially best stated publicly and assigned to witness testimony that she believed Harry had in fact\nCommunicated to her from the grave later however she retired\nAnd stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the playoffs\nCommunication from Harry finally after the last say also in October thirty first Nineteen thirty six best gave up\nSaying ten years is long enough to wait for any mad Thomas ... is a writer and passionate seeker of truth on a lifelong spiritual quest more than ten years ago Thomas wrote an article which he posted online titled Houdini afterlife experiment did it work\nIn it he argues it's quite possible Houdini did communicate from the grave during a say on held in January of Nineteen twenty nine he'll be here in our one to explain how the secret coated method worked whether it was possible for the psychic medium Arthur forge we've known about it in advance\nMy that's my own idea I haven't heard it from anyone else um it seems to make sense a few phone calls hey you know I mean that guy had\nNothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it was in I just wanted to ask you about briefly about the circle sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they were ... and he were were good friends and yet\nA Doyle was a prominent spiritually so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an avowed do bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend uh and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as and they had a friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of\nA discord between them that got so much that they did\nBreak off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing\nKind of reading for Harry where she claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother and Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing [noise] um and Harry was supposedly moved\nBut he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI was he sort of out or in public didn't need any out her ...\nYeah yes yes uh thirty taco view um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow no part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in would be to sort of demonstrate against the audience was how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photo psychic act or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this\nSecret coated method that that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody method\nUm I think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this is all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of can words and the tenth word is actually a phrase\nIn each word corresponds to a number number one through can and number can can also be taken to be zero\nAnd so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the bait on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry in best verse Matt and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reach in their pocket political point oh what is the last two digits on the coin and they these were rich\nAnd pray answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly Harry I Know you can do this\nAnd that would be number eight and so it has a natural miss to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins the best held in her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating doin' verbal using these code words and she said quickly\nQuickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eight word in in the secret code emitted so so he knew that one of the numbers was age right and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix ties right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend but they have a way of doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or\nAnd there you see what I mean right so if the coins at best helping her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating to and verbal using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eights word in in the rye secret code emitted so so that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix ties right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passed number can but they have a way of doing that and that's what we're used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now tell please speak quickly lucky quick\nAnd as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just because people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical dot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry Hi and\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this call because after the message was delivered to pass and she said that it works somebody quickly said hey this was all in a book\nIt's all already published in a book this is no big deal well I thought I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within the book but they wouldn't say the name\nOf the book out of the people were saying it's unpaid da da da da da da da da and then I finally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look\nIn the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all of twenty five cents\nThey would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out and eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just all of that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book\nAnd so that book does talk about those ten words and how it used to form numbers but not out a form we're\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book and um it see I hear a bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code and the afterlife experiment that a secret message would start with the onion coded word Roosevelt that the secret message wouldn't code word to leave\nAnd the actual secret ten word message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also is a famous magician and he's a close personal friend Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book everyone's you took him at his word\nDid not look into the book and just believe that forward with a fraud\nWithout looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why was important for you to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini a and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because now we get into the sale\nAnd and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this is actually true but allegedly told them that ... I'm a skeptic I I I'm going to bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contracted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he how did for get in touch with best\n[noise] well I Hope it or not in just a minute but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked\nBecause bass and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and how all of a a little bit we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions\nAnd in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise] one of his clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the\nSpirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in his mind putting the words for give an all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to pass\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have and she says\nIt's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit we're surviving gap and sort of this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this any more they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford\nI N o v I T E if he wants to document healthy you gotta feed a ... fight is Tricia pie a leg up three fatty acids slack scene think alfalfa\nHer vitamins and enzymes replace the nutrients cooked out of most commercial dark moods\nHe calls it I guess not up all night scratching his shutting is minimal and it is such a pleasure to have my calm relaxed non shedding how back and I have to think I Know fight for that\nDon't let your dog itch scratch stink or shed like crazy come to China for help\nEight five night for two weeks one thousand eight five nine four to eight went down in the eye and oh V. I. T. [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nThomas resentful my guess is the author of leaving the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing a Houdini afterlife experiment didn't work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com or time is tight Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there the the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens [noise]\nUm Arthur Ford shows up and he Arthur for it usually works with the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show or very theatrical show where hey would work with Beth the same way they worked\nWhen they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her a well he was very poetic with are very at times very touching and romantic\nAnd ah there were statements like throw in the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this pen key words on the table and then they coated them\nAnd after it was decoded the message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that that is a nickname\nThat Harry used for her with Roosevelt\nAnd this came about through popular song right around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring\nAnd so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and your language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd did anyone noted does anyone know Arthur Ford no that Roosevelt was the ... name for best or was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends\nUm so I really can't say about that there is a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of stuff [noise] someone said that uh there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he had he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah I just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have\nKnown that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other\n... and and again he just he didn't of of forward through his spirit guide Fletcher just didn't show the word believe they used\nThe secret coding message that we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly looking be quick in and these all windy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe yes\nYes and um\nAnd she declared easy access she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on that uh this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence given\nTo me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only hurt but three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press another one is one of her life\nHotel please speak quickly looking be quick in and these all windy coated spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe yes\nYes and um\nAnd she declared the success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on set off this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence\nGiven to me by her through Ford is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only herb it's three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that it happened\nI think so in effect of the newspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around ... fourteen months after this there's a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now\nDenounced that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever\nThat this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or Rafik rather than your graphics and tell me about this reporter ... is it read ... I Can't pronounce the name but I don't remember one\nName but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited Arthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in the closet but they're hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Ford it's someone that's been paid in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says off I paid Mrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] not just you know it's really funny because\nBass heard about it well the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded in a letter 'em to that same paper where she just completely denies that there she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford said that they were in cahoots he's a liar\nI mean she's very clear in this letter goes on and on and I had never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted on a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThere and this was written to Walter wind chill the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the social they go to guy you know and um\nBut this kind of made it looked like it was a letter written to this um the Newark evening graphic\nBut it doesn't matter there may have been to let her but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters letter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity\nYou know I'm just telling you I was no party Danny fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got proved there's fraud he can fast and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point mess Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened in one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this\nYou know they don't believe in your communication you know and so and I think that this faster and she was tired of being ridiculed by her friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just told and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nAnyone says they get in touch with me after my desk and know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise] um so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sandwich and twenty nine was she re camping and changing your position\nI think it was about fourteen months\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward the ten thousand dollar prize to any one to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting to yeah\nBecause you know if he really wasn't ... boots with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas just hours Ron Tylenol dot com context for ...

Roosevelt health had noticeably deteriorated his ashes and gray complex and physical weakness raised concerns for his health among friends family and associates the president needed arrest a chance to recuperate and regain his strengths\nAccordingly president once again travel to the little White House in Warm Springs Georgia within when an entourage of friends and relatives FDR had first visited this health spa noted for healing mineral waters Twenty one years earlier in an effort to find a relief for his paralyzed lower\nBody Roosevelt look forward to two weeks of relaxation at one PM on April twelfth Nineteen forty five Roosevelt sat in the living room of his cottage surrounded by friends and family as he signed letters and documents an artist stood painting his portrait at an easel nearby\nThe conversation was lively the atmosphere congenial\nThe president turn to the artist I'm reminded her that they had only Fifteen minutes left in the session suddenly he grabbed his head complaining of a sharp pain the president was suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage that would end his life in minutes\nAmerica's longest serving president who had led the nation through the great depression and World War two was dead\nActually our father wasn't too thrilled about that because that was just not the way that he was raised by that Roosevelt name up with anything he's trying to get ahead if he was a short and early ... a full on the special in that comes out\nSo I think that a lot of things with unsavory slip than some self marrying his cousin in finding a number of tight rose about you know that name totally there was an awful lot of weight so you know he was a ... ... benefitted from the laws will name as well so\nRight and he was also governor of New York closet he would you know he was also governor of New York which is was has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah it has happened that way through history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch city I mean he didn't have\nUm these sort of\nI I think of George Bush senior trying to buy Taksim Kmart back in the ... member that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man\nAnd there was a famous TV reporter he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know well he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nIt's funny how they live amongst us but they have no idea what the hell were about it's incredible really the ultra rich off during the training and people who just hit and they don't have any idea about that so what we do you know and sometimes I Wonder if they really want to but it's not just days right\nAll right it's the time he was like they lived in the clouds make me\nHappy not contracted polio uh he ... he may not have been well he may have been president but it's certainly changed the trajectory of his life as you would imagine it would but also his politics how can you help polio affected FDR more than just physically\nWell I'll tell you what this is where I I gained a lot of a lot of respect but ah I was not necessarily you know the thing I'm not much socialist personal but you know when somebody comes on and we'll go into power for relatives to the point where they can loses her head\nAnd they fight their way back using sure will um installing ... bars over over the bed so they can use their arms and then dragging your body to try and get themselves will walk every day of school when that happened to him you know the our ways uh\nStarted to you know obviously you know whoa treatments came in and actually work he started to identify with people who are suffering and you need it loses a gigantic oyster humble pie actually changed your life\n\nRight I mean he displayed you'd have to call it of heroism or in the face of this uh this disease I mean he basically dragged he's he he had a hunch is Iran's but he would drag himself from miles\nYeah every day he had this regimen that um you know he had hello outdoors installed out in front of the Roosevelt mansion and he would\nThey have some of these races and he would use crutches and he was in which all incredible but yet it's you know twelve pounds of steel on each leg and he was dragging his off it just the\nTo the parallel bars where he's exercising bombs that and then from the parallel bars the closest route ... in front of a A R\nAnd then he's turning around and dragging himself back you know quote unquote walking trying to fix stops\nAnd you know I mean if this is talk about ironclad well I mean it was that was that was a was really something else or you\nWant to come back that that part and then of course he ended up in Warm Springs Georgia where the warm waters with cheapest wage and when you met children and other people with other selections and that's\nReally ... his wife to identify with people in need and suffering so it really changes what sugar\nAnd then there's the fast track or to the White House I'm just sort of ... we we we've got about five five minutes before we head into the break at the bottom of the hour but let's just give me a sort of a sudden they'll sketch of you know his\nJourney to the White House or does it start with Governor of New York or is it under secretary of the navy\nInteracts with the White House started ... or ... Wilson and turtle huddle house actually rule Woodrow Wilson was his idol colonel house was Woodrow Wilson's won't be able to know that the time if he was a it was it was a hostile and playing\nAnd um they were followed it all in love with this communist ideal and um you know of course they didn't know anything about it but it was just a new rate than\nIt was through at um ... house and I'm\nI'm a few hours from actually going to let the assistant secretary of the navy and from their intended user Roosevelt man and with the political connections in New York to punch for governor and then once governor I'm you know it was a it was a jump to the White House\nOne and he asked them to come out of the time when a\n... some things that I wanted to do\n'em over want it to do\n... you know what I find if he was a it was it was a startling point and um they were followed it all in love with this communist ideal and um you know of course they didn't know anything about it but it was just really great that\nIt was through at a friend's house and I'm\nI'm a few hours can actually look into the system secretary lazy and from their intended to use ... million and that the political connections in New York to a bunch of governor and then once governor I'm ... was a\nIt was a jump to the White House one\nAnd a half inches from out of the time when a\nIn him really some of the things that I wanted to do\n'em over want it to do but you know he would like it kind of\nGoing to cooperate very well with with some of those were his ideas\nAnd now we don't have to jump right to a jump right to the White House and you know start at the he originally ran on cash pots and everything and we realize that the the oldest working you flip and what you know with a socialist end of it\nAnd uh you know with ... and you become friends with the suffering so\nRight well we'll get into the the new deal in the depression and and and so forth and and the fact that it will do this after the break but I just wanted to mention the idea that someone in a in a confined to a wheelchair or and it had a such a debilitating disease polio\nOr for that person to to rise to the White House at a time when as you point out in who murdered FDR at a time when\nA physical handicap like this was also also equated with sort of few moments of mind and how would that would I guess the complicity of the media that sort of agreed you know to to not talk about it he never would have been president\nYou know it's amazing the parallels even if the co-op it's a very sympathetic maybe they'll just like you know ah like today without whether I Know like ... percent\nSure [laughter] yeah yeah\nAbsolutely halo suffering as he gets a free pass off at\nThe top of the thing is to guys will have to talk about when you get back but uh it's it's it's all history repeating repeating itself with the Russians\nAnd the White House and you know just all kinds of things it's incredible uh happening again and well known catches it you know they felt they are\nBut how is it sets a that no one sort of you know noticed store or said hey wait a minute or president does not is in a wheelchair or he can barely walk is he equipped you know this is thinking back then you know obviously we know better now but\nThe idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago\nOr ... no one would take notice of that\nWell they they they pick their camera shots well and actually out there who people for out of the day that this was the guy who said he would he can really think on four or five thought processes that was really really really\nDo what you would do is eat like with ... someone ... you will lose their arm and that helped with the ... or something at the time\nHe would appear to be walking pick a couple of stops so they take it I guess you know behind the podium users will be different than the shops and you know they they do remarkably well so they they are to ward off the fact\nThat a case anything do you eat painting insurance shopping to go public and claimed that you know five minutes experienced it so it was shortly and for X amount of hours\nSo I mean propaganda and all those oils for Walsh anything back down you know it's just that the new deal with smaller and easier to control\nI just didn't have other things that you know cell phones and cameras on the phone and you know they could get twice a day at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll get the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which you're seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but ... the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely the um\n... like this is complicated I um I don't want to strike the toy eleven had changed the date in which the president was going to be sworn in from march until January\nSo we didn't go into effect until October

forth FDR's often on those lists uh you know right up there with with Lincoln and Washington\nAre and Kennedy of course I'm ... FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him and he certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in it you know horrible devastating depression like fifty percent unemployment and the banking system has failed and it's just sent paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad ah you know the president preceding Hoover had Orange County going\nAnd of course and reading and remember the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things were starting to\nWere starving children to be able to afford luxuries in the country over got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise your taxes and put some regulations on in your that fast\nAnd ah you know so here comes FDR and he realizes there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering\nSo he has this explosion of legislation a in a you know in order to help these people in or so he thought and he did he did a great deal of hell for a lot of people we put people to work and it was on the government or the government paycheck and um\nThis was the experiment from the communist the communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp and Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through\nA as friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you're on your study or and so this is was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class\nAnd there was a flood of legislation or were they just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FBI regulated it at that point everything from farms to banking to securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put every once in a work on the government do so we could have the\nCradle to grave wonderful society that style and and the Soviets had you know fooled us into thinking existed new ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we're going to escape the uh the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all this new wonderful\nPeaks and valleys of capitalism I think you meant the I think he's the communism so the ... I'm Sorry\nAbout that I hear the noise the pitfalls and valleys in ... of of of capitalism you know so right\nYou mean ... if I might you because you you are you you print the list of legislative\nUh

gold payment clause homeowners look lone act\nGlass Steagall banking act natural industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act and the farm credit act um\nAnd he I mean he did this really without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ran but through I wasn't gonna work everybody with Richard I'm Glad you did that I was\nI'm happy to bore them with your show [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was right out of almost like the communist manifesto that that he had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it ... it certainly was\nThe same basic control he was carrying just like Stalin styling just purged all of his enemies you know if you got no way of style and you know you ended up his first two wives his doctor who told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either disagree with him or to challenge him politically\nAnd Stalin did it FDR did it by ...\nIs it labor end it through I wasn't going to board your buddy with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I Will not that\nI'm happy for them with it [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was re out of almost like the communist manifesto that they had to kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it certainly it\nCertainly was the same basic control he was can just like Stalin style and just purged all of his enemies you know if you got no way of style and you know you ended up dead his first two wives his doctor who told things to um you know he he just went crazy\nUm the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either disagree with him or good challenge and politically\nAnd that kind of Stalin did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worried you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know a weary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nOkay so well all of this was going on in Europe is great war is brewing you know he's seen lots of Europe's war we're going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it so if this was a great a second new deal must be better so\nAh they start to put a you know implement and then the second new deal and they start to realize that\nSubstantial portions of it were unconstitutional so the um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get it passed than it was I mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean a tremendous amount and I know in the history books\nHistory books say a lot of things are I Know the history books paid him as this wonderful magical genie of economic success he wasn't there was an economic failure people were ah they were surviving and that was about it\nThat was about all they were doing and you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services\nWhere were you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean it was it was a it was a cat us it was it gets hot because atrophy\nHow do you use the training with the enemy act a key to gain more power lend lease just recently you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\nWell [laughter] again when he did was that was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the Senate was the same thing with the with the lend lease program he was moving you know munitions and goods and services to the to the to defeat the axis powers\nAnd he was given to the to our allies you know free France included and eventually this Soviet Union so that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time\nSo there is a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started or he had to do that because it started to realize the new deal is not working\nSo there was\nNo there was a lot going on economically in in our country and then there came to a point where he knew that we had to get into this war and the spies indeed and\nYou know we have spies who I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries have them we have spies to our spies in Germany were starting to tell us\nThey're finishing your have you are experiments and with the pizza rockets to carry the nuclear weapons to all for it to the globe\nWe'd be speaking German right now I mean they were on the brain so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nToo in the book you argue as many as ... and a half that that NPR New Japanese attack on the U.S was coming

technical producer he's twisting the novels in the dials in the doodads behind the big audio born this is the last time I will be working with Nathan he is leaving coast to coast am to go to\nFerrier school or not freer school ferrier school what is that you ask well I actually Nathan a it turns out like his granddaddy back in Kentucky is a horse lover a horse enthusiast and Nathan is going to I'm a ferry your school to learn how to care for horses who\nAre sort of like giving up many in a petty to the ... and and had a shoe horses which I think it's just a totally cool vocation kind of a throwback a I in fact I thought that job the kind of gone out of fashion sort of like ... at the bowling alley which was a great after school job for kids back in the day\nIt doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission\nAnd they were just says well I don't care I Want to go do it so styling has already beating him or\nHe doesn't need us so Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little harder to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's down on the table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a the conference in Casablanca and and then later Iran I think in a was Turan in Nineteen forty three and again for forty three correct\nHave even at this point they have their eye it sort of carving up the post war world or instill at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still it's pretty robots or you know\nThere is following the Germans are ill equipped and he'll close to do this it doesn't matter you know his generals are coming back saying it's a suicide mission and they were just says well I don't care I Want to go do it\nSo styling has already beating him or he doesn't need us so Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little harder to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging it is it's down on the table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a conference in Casablanca and and then later\nIran I think in a was\nTerrain in Nineteen forty three and again for forty three correct they have even at this point they have their eye and sort of carving up the post war world a skill at this point you know I I think she's Roosevelt still it's pretty robots\nOr you know he you know by my\nStandards in Nineteen forty he was an older guy by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was in a relatively young\nGuy um but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three um but I I Want to tackle the minute and talk about\nThe assassination squads Hitler was sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards because that bad confessions come out diaries or published a you know ... ... ... documents are declassified and then you can really go back\nAnd really and that's what I like to do um some people right to make friends I write to solve murders or call me crazy so you can really go back in pieced together the snippets of of what was going on so I'm the decay inspiring with the Nazis firing\nA was a large aspiring American history thirty three members and that they were over here to assassinate and sabotage anything as they get their hands on um operation Pistorius' or was another Nazi aspiring eight members or they were created after Pearl Harbor\nOr they attacked Chilean targets and has a stake and they were all caught and I believe each one of them except for one seven of them got the electric chair one got Thirty years in prison because he flipped on the other ones\nDid they ever get close to Roosevelt\nOh yeah absolutely they did but Stalin was closer Stalin had infiltrated\nSo much Roosevelt Roosevelt some White House it was and it was incredible so this is it this is what I was saying about the parallels to modern day and people think oh this was Seventy\nSome odd years every five years or whatever what have you oh this you know this was all history is not all of his reasons repeating\nItself okay so here we have in the White House again I'm Roosevelt was basically screwing everything in the White House and here we have another up another president who's accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House\nAnd uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communists completely and frustrated at the White House and we'll talk about that I'm sure it on the road and here we go again here's the Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating his White House\nSo give me an example of give me an example in in rows of those White House of\nSome of the the communist and the hand he's here\nFor the first communist that overhead as there was a Monday house which was um a Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth that came that were involved in um FDR's White House\nI couldn't list them all uh there\nThere were there were hundreds of them at least Fifteen higher ranking officials and half the White House winnowing communist starting with Harry Dexter white all the way through the elder us\nAnd they were in all kinds of different uh and also Harry Hopkins was turned out later he was fingered in Nineteen Ninety you know talk about Harry Hopkins the er at length later so they don't get bored on your way more coming [laughter]\nUm the or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated in the following places that I could find the agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's\nOffice the department of state the national labor relations board the labor advisory board\nOr the war productions or the price of administration the U.S Treasury Department U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee\nSo I won't bore you on with the laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were you know who were in that list or who are high ranking officials in those are in that list of ah of people so I mean he was just\nCommunists were all around them Harry Hopkins actually it was the HHS secretary of state he was one of the architects of the new deal it was one of FDR's\nClosest friends in confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know I obviously\nEvery every I couldn't travel very well because of his affliction and you know the races in a wheelchair and so far so we had to have someone fly over to talk of Stalin and so forth and uh that person was Harry Hopkins um who's Harry Hopkins actually was a friends of Eleanor Roosevelt\n'em through the\nCPU essay the Communist Party United States of America which is still in existence by the way I mentioned that or not\nAnd how they Hopkins in style and get on\nFamously\nHe was actually ... Harry Hopkins as time went by he was also architect could lend lease program to help the Soviets out So Harry Hopkins\nFamously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming the waters in America before all of this happened okay I'll get to that in a minute or he was Harry Hopkins afterwards fire afterwards\nWas fingered by a KGB the factor and I'm going to butcher this name 'em all they grew up I ski and there's a name here I just simply couldn't even begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB defectors they both identified\nHarry Hopkins is the mysterious agent Nineteen who is contacting a Soviet Union\nAbout uh the the than on a project which of course we all know is a nuclear weaponry so here we have I mean there are informants and spies all around the\nFDR so to the point where they he goes to the Toronto conference you know I mean that's the uh styling knows more about Roosevelt than Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt\nMeeting at these conferences it was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were er at the hands of or the Nazis weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him\nStalin right information right\nHe had plans in the post war world of taking a mirror America does have communist anyway he had plans are taking over America and making them a full communist country with him as a ruler so he was a little diluted in his own in his own right but how this all happened was\nTo this of course this is a new ideology communism wow this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this and that and you know we don't have\nInspires all around the FDR's so so the point where he goes to the trunk conference you know I mean that'd be a style and knows more about Roosevelt Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt\nMeeting at these conferences it was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were\nUh at the hands of a lot of these weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him styling right information right he had plans in the post war world of picking America was have communist anyway he had plans are taking over America and making them a full communist country\nWith him as a ruler so it was all diluted in his own in his own right but how this all happened was prior to this of course this was a new ideology communism wow this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this and that and you know we don't have\nTo go to work in every word is provided for\nWell Stalin had sent invitations to 'em or directors in Hollywood a union leaders are college professors ended with the target\nAnd they were were ... invitations all expenses paid to go over to Russia to see how this this work and\nThey went to a city in the city's names as a thing on it is listed in my book\nAnd they were to observe how Russia did things and how everyone was here for how this worked in how terrific it was and look at what we've done and you need to do this to your country has your you know look at you look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities\nTamerlan was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how they tried to recruit Hemingway yet had loudly\nSo it was a fictitious found that didn't exist there was made it hard work basically\nSo they can village a Potemkin village and there you go um\nHe signs all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country in the country and to this wonderful new ideology you didn't know anything about evil employers\nYou know in the new deal you've got to cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before so this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings and strength poison by Stalin style is the puppet master\nThe uh he's this guy would he managed to accomplish and his wife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the votes of the revolution and he ended up there just to make fun of style and he was nothing more than a used to keep the\nParty's journals are used to call them comrade or was it on Conrad index card used to call him a blur used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless and the party one by one knocked off everyone in the party to take control\nI mean the guy was it was just incredible ... what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nStanding stop I'm I'm Sorry I'm

[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nGive you ... the author of who murdered FDR stays with is how you do in a Steven you hold on okay\nI Am just trying to get over the story of the uh the girl they their grandfather's ashes and the cookies she wants to she was going to the great posing the famine in Russia under Stalin and what's really going on\nOver there or anybody you know [laughter] yeah well\nYou know [laughter]\nYeah well yeah it never ceases to amaze um I just wanted to take them anything because people need to know like ... you know you're on the east coast it's three forty in the morning and the three hours is a long stretch to talk so I just want to make sure you're ah you're doing OK and we appreciate you being here with us and staying up late so\nI'm I Wonder if you're talking about you know so much of the post world are so much of the\nPost war world is a result and then in the ensuing Cold War and and all of that\nReally is a result of FDR's frail condition he's greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference in your pain forty\nFour when when that post war world\nWas really carved up and style and obviously you know took advantage he seized upon\nRoosevelt ... condition or and and um FDR really didn't know what happened he just was so adamant by me you look at those pictures of FDR at the the conference\nAnd obviously he's easy looks like death warmed over but seven months before at the Tehran Conference he looks as as fit as a federal I mean ... what is going on with what happened in those seven months\nWell up until this point we've been talking about the bond that we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with them um FDR's being slowly poisoning from within the White House and I have to be very careful here not to give this book away\nBut it was a type of poison we're used to thinking of America is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and what they were poisoning with with something that was\nPlentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet\nBut the rest of the world certainly did Europe certainly did some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older so in certain situations they hit a jump on us and you know I don't think grandpa Walton would've known anything about poisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially because they didn't know it was poisonous at\nThe time so FDR as being slowly poisoning from inside the White House\nEvery time he goes away too Warm Springs Georgia to sow his ailing legs and go on a retreat so he can mentally and physically rejuvenate himself he starts to get stronger every time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or\nSo you know I [laughter]\nI did a little digging into this because it was just so what started me on this whole thing of FDR I thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient\nThat in the tiny Marcia Eighteen days a Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini at all died\nConveniently at the end of the war I thought that was a little convenient so this is what people actually we just start looking into this for and this and that I also thought it was all convenient that FDR just died of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's bunker I thought that was a little to get a little bit convenient so\nAnd when I started to dig in and I saw that the the odd deterioration of this president during this time period I said you know wait a minute I really got to look into this I didn't believe it in high school when we were taught about it back to them they actually taught history you know I mean\n[laughter] but in the book you point out how he he doctors\nI guess Dr mcentire admiral navy admiral mcentire his personal physician and his his cardiologist Dr Howard grew in\nThey were they had no idea what was going on with me and they were doing X rays and take doing all of these tests and they were really clueless\nWell and this is where you know this is where the rubber finally starting to meet the road for me they really work for what they were thinking the American public just thought oh he ... himself out for us and\nYou know he was the advance of polio and this and that and the other thing and the symptoms of the his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors Emma Ross mcentire was the White House physician he was also the vice admiral and in\nA surgeon surgeon general of the navy\nUm you know he was FDR's physician from thirty to forty five until he died a Dr Howard brewing was a commander in the navy a course FDR's a navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors\nOr he was chief of cardiology but says though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy no idea [noise] so what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so baffled as because FDR is getting sick after meal times\nThis is my first hand something was wrong in his blood pressure would bounce\nHe would go normal and then it would go it would go warring out of control three ten over one Ninety five or something and it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying very hard\nTo every any it wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything that they were giving him\nSo we know when they when they\nGot to this point they should look at you know Nineteen forty four is rolling around this guy's got to run for president again again and we've got to get to the bottom with how's it going on here so they send them to the doctor of the day Dr frankly\nFounder of the way he clinic in Boston and he was a surgeon and he is the guy\nIn America at the time so he examines after the march in Nineteen forty four\nAnd um when he comes out was is a ... a glaring statement which is now available online you can look it up at the History Channel basically saying that this is a dead men walking\nAnd do what he the laundry list of the symptoms that he reveals that FDR has does not align with the advance of polio\nThey advance they align with the advance of poisoning FDR is being slowly poison styling Stalin got him I can tell you that I'm\nStyling wants FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar confidence because he wants to rule the world\nAfter yard he wanted to set up the for policemen of the world um the United states Great Britain China in the Soviet Union so they could all police there quarter of the world actually I didn't want to share the world with I'm Sorry Stalin didn't want to share of the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world\nHe was a megalomaniac with what he did in the Soviet Union of course we didn't know that that wasn't wasn't you know reveal to us until years later\nWho wants to died that was part of the negotiation team in the U.S at\n... am on the way back from the all time or one of

and during the Nineteen sixties\nAnd what they were trying to do is they were trying to blow Winston Churchill's head off with an exploding a chocolate bar\n[laughter] you can't make this up Richard you just can't do it you know so I mean there's I mean they went back and forth you know all the time doing this so let's fast forward to the uh innocence naivete or ignorance of FDR\nWho's taking jars of caviar in cases of vodka from style on the same guy who murdered both of his wives and that the great ... I mean it's just it's it's incredible how we were we were there either really naive or really dumb\nRight what were the doctors in on it do you think because you know just minutes before NPR you know reach for his head and said I had this tremendous headache and then he collapsed\nUm I think it was his ballet and then he would do would you would give his a lay out a a a picture of cream and some grew will or oatmeal or something and then there's ... it's been described as his glass of green liquid\nUh and he was and how they did it in that in a glass of green may Clinton\nWas it the doctor when they connected to salary I I\nHow they did it in a glass of green liquid and was it the doctor when they connected to sound\nI you know I'd love to say I know everything about this I have no idea if the doctors were in on it I Do know that in Nineteen fifty seven Eleanor Roosevelt hit was tired of hearing the swirling around Washington DC about that they are being murdered I'm definitely not the first one to come up with this\nUm and she commissioned a private investigator to uh do you get to the bottom of this stuff so I Do know that um the private investigator who'd done all of that the medical records were were stolen from a lock violent with us though\nSo one of four people had those keys one of them was a doctor\nAnd a ... [laughter] it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote so the uh the books being um the White House physician and that was a ... more U.S mcentire were they in on the murder him it's only new idea\nI I couldn't say I have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit little\nIgnorant maybe and and what happened to ... the Russian painter and her driver and and and um she talks has been\nWell they just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time or two afterwards well immediately afterwards well\nThey packed up the uh I'm Robin ... in shipments off in the\nTruest Lucy Mercer who he was having an affair with among others um [laughter] and um they tried to get a Warm Springs Georgia as fast as possible so in her book\nUm her being I'm sure with off in her book she describes the place that they took to to get away from Warm Springs Georgia which I thought was a little crazy because if it was a natural death\nUm you know why I don't know why\nWould you I flew the scene right right\nYou know I mean if it's a natural death why still the records you know there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually\nUm JFK shot in Dallas they break laws to bring him to a out of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas they break law to bring him to besides the now\nThe law was the same in Nineteen sixty three it was it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it to the with us so both you know both the JFK and FDR's body removed a legally they're both at the says though we're all kinds of\nFun things happen you know this the first that could talk you know ... and they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's death\nTo him being guilty being buried they couldn't get this guy's body in the ground fast enough no nor do by the way and no one bombing\nNo autopsy knowing bombing it's just easier\nAnd crazier and crazier all the way through so I mean and there's other things in history to Richard I mean take a look at 'em you know not just this I'm going to be working on Princess Diana coming up next but there are other presidents in history who I also believe that the murder that they've lost over\nUm Warren Harding weren't hurting was it was it was obvious this guy was murdered and there's another one that we thought about but as far as FDR's concern\nI mean the the [laughter] the information in my head just exploded when I started digging and digging and digging and it's still it's still boggles my mind you know the book is going to publish for a little while now and I still even after the book is one published you know I'll find a new fact and go wow I should have put that in the book\nI mean there's got to be a volume three perhaps uh let me get the calls here ah and he's in Alabama and the wild card line any good morning locked because\nThank you Steve I'm calling to ask you about some ... she\nWas several of Eleanor Roosevelt garden party she said to my aunt who work at the state department and those remind now\nI'd also like a nation that that's an experience with the blood dinner for scrap from my grandmother which was offering it comes to handle things however it looked like British conscious blading all in the body Montana and it came time to name your isn't\nThere you go like you don't you say it wasn't a warfare and when Roosevelt because that would have been too quick\nYeah it was it wasn't people around him they were disposing of with war for him because it\nAnd she's right she's right I mean it's been the blood out to to the point where if you touch a person they'll get you know either their their brains will either bleed or they'll have an ... or something or cerebral hemorrhage and they'll also and of course I Know Dr but no my parents were both on it they're both on\nA variety of blood center so right my late father was as well sure definitely cause rooting with any thanks for calling in\nThank you uh let's go back in the wild card line is it my dad in New York\nMy hide their good morning I okay\nI have quite a three part of and I listen all over the ad finally I thought I heard um I'm against him and on the air I heard what had top play\nWell off elderly had actually our waste waste a lot of it and I'd like to know if he had no idea what happened in Haiti in theory around that\nI sat in ... and when it hit the grass and so he would be someone that we talk about that new the new deal I um [noise]\nI go in the right thing around that that there are for that show called Great Depression and so I like it starts at like ... and last late he mentioned about\nBoth out there writing connection and they are both NPR and ... a towering stable genius if you will and the White House in change somewhat different because\nI live with the cat right and then they shake it and they seem to have more to do with leading up to even out he wound up as president and of course the money that he had to go to and counting here I Can't get rabies shot like a lab or right\nOn ... and and of course he I don't see a fifty fifty shot you know we know that he has ... ... and in\nThe mind if I could just jump in because we're not talking about Trump I think if it's even working about what I think it would be kind of physicians\nAre about the Russian connection with Trump but let's just to FDR where we can do a whole show perhaps another time on on the Russian dusty and so forth but and you're right ... a big fan of FDR I Know Webster and ... and I've had dinner with him and and he waxes on\nAbout the new deal uh obviously Steve you're you're not saying that you have anything to add\nUh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing at the time I think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go because I Am to my knowledge it never been done before so I mean it\nI have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good\nTrinity and\nWell my I had if I could just jump in here because we're not talking about Trump I think if it's enough to put words in your mouth but I think you were being kind of facetious\nOr about the Russian connection with Trump but let's just stick to to FDR where we could do a whole show perhaps another time on on the Russian dos and so forth but and you're right we ... a big fan of FDR no Webster a little bit and and I've had dinner with him and and he waxes on\nAbout the new deal uh obviously Steve you're you're not a fan that you have anything to add\nUh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing at the time I think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go to my knowledge it never been done before so I mean it\nI have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good thing it helped a lot of people um it just wasn't along sustaining campaign so\nAs far as the Russians and the current administration yeah I was kind of a little suspicious as to how\nHow everyone is ... how history it kind of repeats itself and it doesn't you know um it's it's amazing how we have the [laughter] we're we're right back in the same thing when you have another red scare and in the country it's it's really it's really something else that only ... were alive you know he would it\nWould really enjoy that\n[noise] [noise] right so I think the point they're making their was that the the Russian connection during FDR's time was overt uh and today it's I guess you would to coin a phrase from uh CNN it's nothing burger\nRight I mean if I mean if they ever prove it with Trump which I don't know if they're ever going to um they may I don't know I'm not privy to that information but it's it's just interesting how\nHow how the to the history it's another red scare it's starting to repeat itself over again and here we are Seventy some odd years passed its funny which is how history repeats itself becomes relevant actually interesting book I think you'll like banks ...\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWelcome back well Steve you any they are lined up are ready to speak with you so let's try and move quickly let's go to the wild card line yet again John his Long Beach California John good morning\nThanks for having me real quick to thing one um if you look at a at Roosevelt Nineteen forty four you look so bad I have a hard time thinking that they had to kill him because he was going to die anyway that's why they got rid of Henry made room in my opinion for the night before or campaign 'cause they didn't like the\nSecond of all I don't I've read up on this path with tall and how I got away with all that stuff but Roosevelt God dollar that somebody to look at ... body patently and make sure that let's see if he would he would call 'cause I'm calling it a lot of that\nAnd I think it was for the story was that he was afraid of ... he wanted Roosevelt where can you recommend for the call that the uh Toronto in a you know and all that and gotten to do what he was afraid of but again by the fact that the dollar one of the debt I I think he did not want to want to go\nTo mark my take on it All right interesting junk in bad shape going to die anyway I like All right Steven you want to reply [noise] um\n\nI you know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils okay a lot of the things that we've been sold 'em down slanted okay I'm not suggesting what you said has been he look so bad in Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poison\nSystematically poison\nThat's why he looked so bad in Nineteen forty four this wasn't from the advance of polio and it's filled it out\nVery very plainly in my book so it's it's an interesting time in history\nIt was an awful lot of people who research this and I learned from every one of them I'm not gonna sit here and professional every little wine that's for sure\nBut um as far as a balanced I wouldn't want to rule the world he didn't he didn't have any interest in sharing anything with that fear so if you're saying something to look in the ... in the in the coffin sent someone to verify what was going on he was already being that that was already verified from the to rush\nAnd the end of the coughing or sent someone to verify what was going on he was already being where the death was already verified from the two Russians that were in front of him when he died\nSo if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting that it didn't if indeed that had happened it was probably just so he could uh you know get recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of falls propaganda\nHi John thank you that's an interesting point there ah let's see how to James in Philadelphia Hi James good morning welcome to coast to coast\nThank you Richard uh but my guess four but my question for Mr ... he's just show banning it in your research physical or did you come across or anything about ... to ... an attempted coup against a Roosevelt and the thirties and dad\nOr if it happened if you came across it how close was it a to happening and that the ... uh it was a exposed by an army general smelly butler and that one of the people involved was a I think was a Garth or\nDid you come across anything about the coup how if it if it's true how posted it come to

I just wanted to ask you about briefly about the circle is their Arthur Conan Doyle because they were ... and he were were good friends and yet a door oil was a prominent spiritually so how did that\nHow did that friendship survive or the fact that Harry was such an avowed do bunker didn't have time for spiritual listen yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out in the fine in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and\nI think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them that got so much that they did break off their friendship\nAfter a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic\nWriting kind of reading for Harry where she claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother and Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing [noise] um and Harry was supposedly moved\nBut he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI guess he's sort of outed her in public didn't need any out her ... yeah\nYes yes I started to talk over you um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow no part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate against the audience is how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photo psychic act or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this\nSecret coated method that that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody methods\nUm I think we should have turned out a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this is all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of Penn words and the tenth word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through can\nAnd number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry in that first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket political point oh what is the last two digits on the coin\nAnd they these were rich\nAnd pray answer say now\nTell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sentence like quickly Harry I Know you can do this and that would be number eight and so it has a natural and listen to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins the best helping her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating doing verbal using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eights were in in the secret code emitted so so that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can now of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend but they have a way of doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nThey would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now ...\nPoint the best helping her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating to and verbal using these code words and she said quickly\nQuickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eight were in in the ... so so that he knew that one of the numbers was age right and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix ties right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing them for can but they have a way of doing that and that's what we're used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases pray answer say now ... be quickly look be quick\nAnd as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical dot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry Hi and\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this code because after the message was delivered to pass and she said that it works somebody quickly said hey this was all in a book\nIt's all already published in a book this is no big deal well I thought and I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within the book but they wouldn't say the name\nOf the book either people are saying it's on page da da da da da da da da and then I finally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look\nIn the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised to find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all of the twenty five cents\nThey would move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out in eighty five year old book\nI couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just follow that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book\nAnd so that book does talk about those ten were and how it used to form numbers but not out a form we're\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book and um it see I hear Eisen bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coded word rose about\nThat the secret message within code word to leave and the actual secret tempered message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also was a famous magician and he's a close personal friend Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book everyone's you took him at his word did not look into the book\nAnd just believe that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important for you to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini\nA and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because now we get into the sale and and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly told them that ... I'm a skeptic I I I'm going to bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contracted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he how did for get in touch with best\nWill\nOut such an ad in just a minute but I just wanted to point out that I think that this worked\nBecause bass and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine so back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions\nAnd in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise] one of his clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit\nShe had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session\nAnd in his mind putting the word for give an all capital letters\nPutting in a letter and sending it to pass\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have and she says\nIt's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit we're surviving gap until this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither that's Houdini nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford\nI Know about title fraud so I register with home title walking discovered

somebody to visit home title luck dot com home title luck dot com\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nThomas resentful my guess is the author of leaving the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment it didn't work and that is posted up the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com that Thomas Hi Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the er the medium would reached out to her or so so what happens [noise]\nUm are there for it shows up and he either for it usually works the spirit named Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show a very theatrical show where hey would work with best the same way they worked\nWhen they were on stage and use her as an assistant and and have her a well he was very poetic with are very at times very touching and romantic and ah there were statements like throw open the curtain and all of this but what they did with they put this pen\nKey words on the table and then they coated them\nAnd after it was decoded the message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I wanted to explain that death is a nickname\nThat Harry used for her with Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song right around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring\nAnd So Harry Potter Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe\nAnd it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and your language that her husband had spoken to her and\nDid anyone noted does anyone know Arthur Ford no that Roosevelt was the ... name for best or was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends\nUm [noise] so I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of step someone said that uh there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bath who is Twenty years older than he had he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah\nI just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that\nThey would have known that he referred to as Roosevelt with the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other ...\nAnd and again he just he he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher just just didn't show the word believe they used the secret coating message\nThat we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly looking be quick in and these all windy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe yes\nYes and um\nAnd she declared that success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on set off this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary\nI Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence\nGiven to me by Arthur forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only herbal three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone\nIt's one of them as a representative of the United press another one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was the success that had happened\n[noise] yeah I think so in effect of the\nNewspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around fourteen months after this there is a hard switch where she suddenly start that they're now denounce that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever\nThat this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or we graphic rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it re Jew Jew Ari I Can't pronounce the name but I don't remember\nOne name but I think the first name is R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... writes um she had an apartment and she invited\nArthur Ford over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in the closet but there is hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Fort it's someone that's been paid you in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says ah I paid Mrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because\nThat is heard about at well the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so fast responded in a letter\n'em to that same paper\nWhere she just completely denies it there she's been a party of fraud it anyway and if Arthur Ford said that they were in cahoots he's a liar\nI mean she was very clear in this letter goes on and on and I had never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted\nOn a website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThis was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the\nSocial they go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the Newark evening graphic but it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the letter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity\nYou know I'm just telling you I was no party to any fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he can fast and then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point best Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened in one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way\nMy family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so and I think that this fester and she was tired of being ridiculed by your friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like if\nAnyone says they get in touch with me after my dad to know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise] um so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the ... and twenty nine was she re camping and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen months\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award reward the ten thousand dollar prize to any one to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if she really was in cahoots with Arthur Ford he could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer\nWell that sounds you know pretty pretty iffy whereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress\nTo be hindered by some kind of monetary motivation you know would have been much more graceful you see it I mean but it was just days after where she says I'm not going to pay the money\nRight so your your feelings are the best basically and she herself was an avowed to bunker for fifty years and uh and so the social pressure from her family was just too much and so she she caved and she recanted", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Vernal", "day": "21"}
