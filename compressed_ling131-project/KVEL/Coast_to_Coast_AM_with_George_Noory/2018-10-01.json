A. W. land air and water and it's jam packed with odd spooky raise the hair on the back of your neck true life stories of people who simply vanished as if into thin air\nThe circumstances in each of these cases are very specific to a pattern that was discovered by Dave and ... by now\nHe's looked at thousands of these disappearances and some patterns have emerged on land around ... water and as we will hear tonight in the air as well so this evening we will hear the latest including a few cases that are ongoing at this moment\nFresh mysteries that maybe you can help solve a David joins me and just a few minutes and we will jump right into it but those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with a refresher on the characteristics that make these particular cases stand out from a standard case of somebody who just gets lost in the woods or wilderness goes way beyond that\nAnd we will spend the next three hours talking about new evidence of cases he uncovered and then the last hour tonight I'm not sure what we're going to do I I think I'd like to hear from listeners your ideas about what's going on here why some people are seemingly taken by whom\nAnd whether we will ever be able to resolve this so what you're thinking caps on and be ready to jump into the discussion in our for also tried to save some time for you to interact with Dave as well in our three\nOne news note here in Las Vegas we're on the eve of a somber remembrance one year ago October first\nBut worst mass murder incident in American history unfold fifty eight people were gunned down at an outdoor concert on the strip hundreds were wounded or injured all week leading up to this date that the town is remember those who died those who were wounded those who've struggled to deal with what they witness that night\nYou know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction\nSo when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found disappearances and their parks were they had worked that bothered um didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't\nAnd they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers in the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get outstanding training or smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any of us and they don't have any listen missing people in their parks in jurisdictions\nAnd uh we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues ... refiled and they came back in the attorney called the Simon said why do you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that of the determining factor\nIn for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said well how research and then it came back and he said well you don't have any of us are missing people I said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol\nAnd you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are that detective\nSo somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or acumen to list the headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it\nAnd said no we don't have any less so years ago somebody said well if they if you are just file a request and see how many rolls of toilet paper it Yosemite National park I bet they have that I didn't and tore list\n[laughter] and of course they would but as it happened they came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my\nAuthor status as an exclusion for fees\nThat request and see how many rolls of toilet paper it Yosemite National park I bet they have that I didn't bring tore list\n[laughter] and of course they would but as it happened they came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my\nAuthor status as an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough libraries to qualify listen of such qualifier are just some arbitrary thing they said\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together the lists I Want to list from Yosemite and I want to was from the national Park Service\nAnd they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system and I can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting the list from their entire system because they still say they don't have it\nAnd I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll say it right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets\nAnd we'll put a clip boards that every park and every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating the list and they could hire an intern during the summer that can screen the monthly reports that come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now\nOf course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it\nBut as you've stated in many others after you nobody believes them they say that there's a list exists\nWell a ... if they're gonna charge one point four million more than a list exist um\nYou know it it's it's pretty clear they don't want to cooperate on this that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it and uh so we're going to explore and maybe some of the reasons behind it\nUp for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the ... points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books and the kinds of things that you look for\nSome people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people you're not going to get a lot when you read a thousand certain things started jumping out at you and when I went through my third three hundred four hundred and five hundred read of reports\nStarted making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that's about Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine search and rescue the canine ths can't find descent and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked in a canine unit on the SWAT Team for a number of years our dogs had about a Ninety nine percent capture rate\nAnd probably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time to train a dog a lot\nThere might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the scent isn't there a bad reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person was last seen they walk a foot they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out like they don't want to search or they have no interest\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change weather event\nIf the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times\nThe time of the disappearance a high high percentage of the time is three four five PM many of the victims have some type of disability illness or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can't explain what happened to them water plays a key role in this either the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water\nBoulders in granite play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world she was Seventy national park\nWell that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but granted plays much more of a role as I explained in many of the books\nThere is a location in the event called the point of separation\nYou're walking down the trail with your friends your loved one\nAnd they walk ahead of you you fall behind them at that point of separation something happens and that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that in interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's when it happens\nIt's almost like something's watching and when you went off from a group or a family that's when they move in\nYeah equipment now function and this is a this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prior books\nThere was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with the searches and then people talked about other equipment there are other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this\nAnd then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and have never been found\nIt's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared that isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a\nMedical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in the specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there is a this geographical clustering that I figured out why after I started putting pins in a U.S map when I started to track this years ago\nAnd right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada\nNow there are other locations in a lab and other countries of the world where these this exact same sort of thing is happening a lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book struggling to get rolling and people are different parts of the world read them\nThey say hey you know I live in New Zealand we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing you case same thing Canada same thing in Spain in the ... I mean\nYou'd be surprised how this fits into this little niche\nUm and it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cases and its men women is more than one ratio direct any idea why why so many more men than women maybe more men around in the outdoors and healthier alone\nYeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women\nParameters because then that information becomes key to you picking the cases that usually ruin on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and in a huge database and I would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times a lot of times they want there is a case from eighty six\nI'm an era the girl's name was ... she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody looked at the case in Twenty years and especially if they're told me I'll never see that case it's a standard missing persons case\nThere is no suspects there's no crime why can't I see it\nUm and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal uh everything else in the law enforcement world it's criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against the law to go missing if you want to fall out of society you can and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's gonna emanates from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you're somebody\nBut these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lotta times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good and I don't understand why they want us to see it\nBut there's this I called territorial behavior and many of the times they won't grant you access\nNow in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to be disclosed to the public upon the crust\nColorado has outlaws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states don't and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything um so the first thing is you got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say the storage you can't trust the media\nBecause I Would say eighty percent of the time when I finally get a copy of the report\nThe news reports are totally completely wrong\nCompared to what law enforcement said happened\nAnd I like to think back Thirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's this superficial job of collecting information\nBecause it's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that um you know reporters just regular beat reporters who getting assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case\nYou know like outside of Las Vegas ever been a couple that you and I've talked to him up before it's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement there is a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of the scene I'm who tells you specifics here the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take a further you you've heard of them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they'd really don't want to know the full story of what's going on 'cause it's too weird to explain\nYou know makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether they don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or they don't want to give me the information because they have been a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know they don't want to have to answer questions about what do you think\n\nI think that the people the front line people that you see when you go into the parks\nHeart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on\nIt's the people at the top tier in the government that are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed in communicated\nAnd it's those individuals that have this\nBig zoo this belief that if their stuff it's not yours and you're not going to get it and I don't understand it\nI Can't explain it and every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports when the sheriff's office help on a search\nAnd they had some of the report from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything and so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and I got ... I wasn't supposed to get that\nBut then it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare\nLet's talk about a couple of cases uh you you sent me some information about one Samantha Sayers what's the deal there\nSo twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete came from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle She liked to go to this a location a called ... per ...

V. E. S. P. E. R.\nAnd she went there on August first this year it's about six thousand two hundred and twenty feet elevation two miles northeast a spate of lake twenty five ... five miles east of the ocean port of Suzanne\nRound trip hike up about seven eight miles twenty seven hundred foot game going up\nAnd a Thirteen hundred foot scrambled to the top\nSo I live in Colorado I can tell you that that really isn't much here but in in Washington that's a pretty good hike and the mountains there it just sixty two hundred feet look a lot like the mountains here fourteen thousand feet well\nSamantha did a lot right she told her boyfriend where she was going when she'd be back and he was the kind of guy that kept track of her well when she didn't check in with him\nHe reacted the right way he wouldn't go he went and outlook for her while the investigation showed that she made the summit sometime too in between two and three in the afternoon and some other individual man saw her up the ... summit in communicated with her\nWell that was the subsequent investigation her boyfriend Kevin arrived at the mountain about ten pm started running the trails yelling for screaming for\nEventually published in the homeless county sheriff and the search was on so that was on August first well that search went on for about twenty two days three hundred and fifty seven air operations that is extraordinary that's locked\nHundred and five hours of drone time\nA three hundred and twenty nine hours of difference our personnel the family was on the scene everyday when you look at the area the majority of the time she was above what looked to be Timberline there isn't much up at the top of desperate to pretty wide open area\nAnd for them not to be able to find her under these circumstances is really really unusual dad cadaver dogs they had sent tracking dogs that everything you can imagine there to help\nWell eventually when the sheriff and the search and rescue personnel pulled out I mean that's that's a check on reality time if you're the family because\nYou're looking at going back to Pennsylvania without your daughter and basically just Chuck it in with no more assistance with his family had a lot of gumption they start pushing harder they did some Kickstarter campaigns\nAre trying to pay for a food and things for friends that were just standing on site and searching day and night will eventually and I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom and the mom and I communicated and I kinda gave them this road map\nAnd it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports otherwise you're just going to be replicating that exact same effort that search and rescue stung before not a lot of instances that may turn some results because\nPeople are found in areas that have been previously search that's true but if they have a lot of area where they say that they haven't searched it very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do and that Syria you really want to give it a big push\nBut the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff the sheriff wouldn't get many reports the search and rescue people weren't given him any reports and they were getting frustrated now this is the same thing I tell every family and if there's one listening out there is this what you have to do\nYou don't go to the local news media and you'll understand this church\nIs the local news media has to deal with the sheriff in that county day in and day out for the rest of their lives they can't burn a bridge they can't get 'em irritated they have to live with them but they national bureaus\nFox CBS NBC CBS the national bureaus you want to get one of those people in there and you want them to start stirring it up\nAnd then you want to send a family member down to the congressman or the senator's office and demand that they get more assistance and more help for you\n\n\n\n\nThere was this hour channels on Tom I'm wrong to run for President Trump will need just upcoming week was deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein\nRosenstein job is in question following a New York times story that he discussed possibly secretly recording the president and using the Constitution's twenty Fifth Amendment to remove him from office the president had scheduled to meet with Rosenstein on Thursday but it was put off to avoid interfering with the\nCabin a Senate hearing Rosenstein denies the news account and the president suggested he's not interested in firing the deputy A.

nine at the end of a second year going into his third year he took his first vacation in eight years\nAnd he traveled to Oregon and check into some possible residency and so he was kind of mixing business with pleasure until the family wanted to see some wildlife mother told her son at the time never to hike alone please don't do that Steven\nOn June nineteenth you flew into Portland international airport got a vehicle from run Iraq a Chevrolet Cavalier drove to Portland youth hostile checked in and paid cash for Thirteen nights I'm sort of paint Thirteen nights with his credit card\nNow law enforcement reports state on June twentieth Steven called his parents on their on his borrowed cell phone from them\nSay that he had arrived all was well checked in things were great manager of the hotel said Steven usually left before the others look he was last seen on June twenty second or the twenty third and\nHe was seen at night and a suit saying that the residency interviews had gone really well and he was happy on June twenty second\nPhone from them say that he had arrived all was well checked in things were great manager of the hotel said Steven usually left before the others look he was last seen on June twenty second or the twenty third\nAnd he was seen at night and a suit saying that the residency interviews had gone really well and he was happy\nOn June twenty second he drove a vehicle from the hostile to the salmon Huckleberry wilderness twenty five miles south east to Portland and completed the trail permit to enter the salmon view wilderness\nAnd I stopped people here right now and tell you that you may think that when you complete those trail permits and put them in a little metal box that somebody's reading those and it's going to follow up and make sure that you come out\nThose trail permits are never reviewed and they're only used to see the load of people on the trail there never checked to see if you came out there essentially worthless some don't ever count on those\nBut on June twenty third a pair of hikers ... Stevens caused the trail had early in the morning and believed it had to be a day hiker but they were there really early\nWell they exit the trail later that day and they still solve the car there and it bothered them and they felt so strongly that something was wrong that they call the sheriff and jeopardy came out random registration on the rent Iraq and the vehicle came back register to a family\nAnd the registration hadn't been turned over to ... the deputy left a message on the machine of the family who still owns the car on the registration system and he left\nWell Steven was return was supposed to return to Detroit on July second the parents were at the airport and he didn't arrive\nThey called the Portland police tried to file a missing persons report and they were told that you couldn't file a missing persons report unless you were there in person ...\nYou know so the next day hope and Larry got on a plane and flew to Portland and the ... the search and rescue finally get down the trail and a team to some assistance from the national guard cans and search teams\nSearchers face rain and wet conditions for many other days but again the searched and searched for days after he really went missing and are hoping Larry praise the attitude of the volunteer searchers but stated that they were highly disappointed in the deputies\nThey said that the search didn't last long and was terminated without finding anything endeavor dogs were later put into that area I never picked up a cent they ah they had a psychic approach them\nAnd the psyche went with them and some for service people down the trail that came to switch back look down the cliff they saw little T. P. structure made of little trees lying on the ground\nAnd they said that down there you'll find Stevens glasses and that's where he died\nSearch and rescue went down there but they didn't bring their medical metal detector and the second city needed that to find it but they never found it nothing was ever found there and they are hoping already said that they are now any communications with the sheriff in years not never with the forest service Stevens never been found\nStarting a search was two weeks after the disappearance is a very very difficult task and right here I'll say that Carol turned her when she disappeared in her park she at least left left a message on the inside of her car indicating when she was going to be out\nNow I say this every conference and I say it on every time on 'em on with you people need to carry a personal located beacon cost about two hundred two hundred and fifty bucks there's no monthly service feet and get them on Amazon\nYou activated it sends a signal to a satellite that someone needs help immediately to find new within eight feet they dispatched search and rescue I carry one every time I go out\nAnd I I Would say that probably Ninety five percent of these cases could be quickly remedied if everyone carry one of these\nWell a lot of things went wrong in this case a just a comedy of errors it's not very good meeting though I mean but I you know search that starts that late you don't have much of a chance of succeeding you\nDon't think you do um first of all he wasn't real acclimated to the area didn't understand the dangers probably wasn't dressed for success probably didn't have a backpack with them I doubt if he even had a Geological Survey map of the region\nBut when you go in an area like this there's so many things that can happen yeah I mean I tell people that you could go down this trail and if it's a trail that isn't very active you could be on the trail five or six miles down and break your leg on the trail and die on the trail\nAnd do you think that doesn't that hasn't happened because it has and something very simple like this can just ruin your life when you could just have this little device that could save your life\nYou mentioned about the psyche they've got involved in this case have you ever employed the services of a psychic or have you ever in dusty ended ... worse like it was used and they provided information that turned out to be accurate\nTell your story is um there's a remote viewer who's on coast to coast fairly frequently you will go unnamed but he he claimed he contacted me that he could find missing people\nAnd I asked him if he had ever found anybody and he gave me the name of this person and I listen to 'em and I said okay I'll I'll give you a case and during that week that I didn't talk to them I contacted this victims wife I said hey did this person to help you in finding your husband\nShe goes he didn't do anything he never found him he never gave me a valuable information my husband was found on other means by other searchers doing other things blah blah blah on and on\nGeorge I'm a guy that has really open mind and I will use anybody when somebody lies to me I won't use them ever again and that person blatantly lied to me and in other remote viewing cases there was one guy did a conference with ... a couple of years ago really nice guy\nAnd the information he gave me wasn't even close in the realm of possible\nNow there's another guy who's a remote viewer that I'm trying to work with right now hopefully he's better but as far as psychics I did a conference in LA about two years ago and there were seven or eight psychics own this row at a this outside area at the conference and\nTowards the end I walked down this row introduced myself to every one of the psychics said what I did what I could use their services for and each one of them said yeah yeah yeah we want to help them want to help for sure yeah we can do this I email each one of them the next week\nWhen I got back and I never got a response from one of them\nWere ... just about his newest book missing for one one land air or water Mardi Palan a pioneer of the San Francisco rock scene died at the age of Seventy six this past week yours or one of the best\nWe right now [noise]\nAnd I never got a response from\nWe're talking with ... about his newest book missing for one more land air or water Mardi Palan a pioneer of the San Francisco rock scene died at the age of Seventy six this past week here's a one of his best\nAnd he and his friend went to the club early they laugh\nEarly on that Monday morning Henry ... states that he dropped him off at a location and friendly at the super gas station or a Seventy third avenue\nAt two twenty three am Henry phone appears Trump pocket dial this wife while she was asleep and California and left the link the voice mail string sound screaming paintings growls et cetera\nAnd it's hard to determine when you listen to it if they are all human sounds or their animal films or what are they\nWe we have a recording of a news report that was done based on this and then includes uh some of the clips from that phone call so maybe we can play that right now and then on the other side you can tell me a little bit more about it\n[laughter] it's a voice mail unlike anything you've ever heard before [noise]\nThere are two minutes' worth it [noise]\nIt very little actual talking what are you concerned that the derby neither one of the night called inside Henry McCain cell phone it with labor date September Seventeen to twenty eight in the morning nicknames worry why her domestic\n... health and ...\nMinutes at a meeting sneaky services is a nonprofit agency and acting as they go between the police in the Liberian community suddenly they're trying to get help your family makes some sense didn't rewarding\nThe Raul selling to hide\nAll lightning moaning and hate like moaning and [noise]\nIt's actually\nThere is silent than someone either Henry or another person said yeah I think I tried it passed away\nWhen it ... what ... what ... sound like that\nNow is it dark when I had to other articulate recordings that Medicaid speaking at an event you just state auditor\nWhen he was a new\nDimension is one piece of evidence now police are reviewing deplete you tell me even the FBI is analyzing the recording and voices for who did she says the investigations in Denver here on\nTuesday [noise]\n'cause I think for which borders right and now you and certainly all areas where they came with recorded scene or a cell phone in place yes friends is the only what is this whole series they came up empty\nSo that's a news report from a Minneapolis television station or she the reporter mentioned in that report Dave that or the FBI was analyzing it the police were trying to make some sense of it have you ever seen any of that analysis or reports or did they come to any kind of conclusion what the heck that was\nNever it crammed up so tight but one thing I I've written about pass book is that the FBI follows these cases there's no reason for the F the FBI to be involved in this it's a local jurisdiction missing person that's it\nWhy is the FBI sticking their noses in this\nUnless they are interested in it for some other reason\nNow laugh tower\nThey think that phone was near Silverlake road at Mississippi street and new Brighton one mile east or the Mississippi River\nAnd many of the cases I've written about in the past and missing for one and want a sobering coincidence dealt with men very healthy man that were found and bodies of water many times in the Mississippi when this happened I thought it would be found in the Mississippi or something else really close\nWell the location where he was eventually found was searched multiple multiple times canines helicopters ground teams everything on November second this is almost two months after he disappeared for twenty\nIn the Mississippi or something else really close\nWell the location where he was eventually found was searched multiple multiple times canines helicopters ground teams everything on November second this is almost two months after he disappeared for twenty in the afternoon a kayaker was on rush lake\nOne mile south east of the last time they paying that phone and they saw body in the water and they recovered it\nThere was no violence at all to the body according to the corner the determination on the count on the cause of death was freshwater drowning Syria had been search multiple times and the FBI had that recording for analysis why was Henry McKay in the water\nNow one of the things that I presented in sobering coincidence about all of these young healthy men\nWas that many times the families did not accept the determination by the corner on the cause of death and they paid for secondary autopsy several times\nWhen they did the second autopsy they found very high levels of G. H. B. in the system of the victim\nAnd they were in levels so high it didn't make sense\nSo GHB it's commonly known as that date rape drug people\nGet it they pass out\nThey realize that they're awake but they can't move and they can't react and if you think about this\nMany of the times that these people have disappeared never has any of their friends relatives et cetera seen the point where they disappeared sometime they disappeared amongst friends\nThey couldn't explain how they got from point a to point the teenage couldn't track point to point a lotta times that happened in the winter and there was no marks in the snow point the point\nAnd if you think what GHB does to you it puts you in that state were you realize what's happening to you but you can't react so if they lead lead you say in a bank of snow\nYou would die from hypothermia\nYou wouldn't die from GHB intoxication\nIf the police to you on the water you would die by drowning not from G. H. B. and C. G. H. B. is not one of the twenty six drugs that are screened routinely by corners across the United states\nIt's only caught if you pay an extra them out to do this much more advanced screening for drugs\nAnd so it's a very very rarely if ever found in systems because most people can't afford a second autopsy and I'm not saying that that is what is in all of these cases but it showed up too many times to be ignored\nThat recording it certainly seems like he realizes he's in trouble or painter agony and then as the reporter mentioned it sounds like there's somebody on there that says something that's um\nThat's ah that's difficult to get your head around\nIt is in in many of the other cases I've written about that are related to these water unbelievably the victim is on the phone as they are going through this transition of disappearing\nOne time not far from where this incident happened a college kids walking down the street\nHe's on the phone with a girlfriend has and says where are you I Need you here now I Need you here now phone cuts off you sound days later in the Mississippi River another time a kid in east a western Minnesota\nIs missing in his parents are trying to find him and he's on the phone with him and he goes I don't know where I Am blah blah blah blah blah blah boom phone goes dead he was never found yet his car was found so these incidents that happened were there on their cell phone is something new and different\nBut when you listen to the incident as it evolves it's very uncomfortable\n\nI mean it seems like they're being abducted in that um and sometimes the bodies were found and sometimes they are and they're they're just like snatch or by persons are known by things unknown almost like no gigantic bird swooping down and matching them up\nUm you know so many ... agrees is\nCalling me all the time and saying well you know we talked about this or ... or John this YouTube say this I don't say that and I want people to understand that this is not a conspiracy theory topic because I'm not giving you any theories I'm giving you All Facts\nAnd that's the way I Want people to understand this is that it's an unusual topic that's tied together the way an FBI profile or will profile a series of crimes were linking together a series of facts to show that there's continuity here\nThat they're a pattern say and um this book I wouldn't think that you didn't have cases in the air um that would qualify under your criteria but you do you have a bunch of 'em in and it starts with looking at cleaning goals including one that here in

disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open up the phone lines you know people are going to want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs can you summarize that one\nSure I'd summer twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy five nine thirty\nKurt on the island of mall it's an island in Scotland fifty five years old I Gibbs was a war hero he was an intellect and he was a pilot we've split fires and the battle of Britain in Nineteen forty\nHe was staying at a place called the Glenn force a hotel and it sat right on the ocean northeast side of the island a mall and there was a graph airstrip there and the rooms were right next to the airfield looking at the water\nYou arrived at the hotel on December twenty F on December twenty thirty contacted the owner of a Cessna one fifty parked at the stripped and asked if he could fly it\nIn Hamilton was the attorney negotiated a price to fly the two seater and on Christmas Eve Nineteen Seventy five at nine thirty Gibbs walked out to the plane with a hotel guests named Felicity Granger\nAnd she thought she was going to go with him on a flight but he told her no she had to lay off the porches suit you can fly inland so\nShe exits the plane places the torches out on the field and he or she sees him taking off the plane flying out over the water\nNow some reports say that after he took off they saw strange lights on the water some people said it might have been a fishing boat but they could never identified the boat and they could never see where the lights went\nWell make a long story short Gibbs did return on the plane and there was a major search on and off the island for days and they found nothing and they found a sheep herders and ranchers that search all their property they got nothing\nWell on April twenty first Nineteen Seventy six it's about four months after the disappearance\nGives his body was found on the north pole\nAnd this is an amount and it's like an oil near the airfield\nAnd he has a small scratch on his chin nothing else and a shepherd took part in the original search and he walked by the spot where the body was found multiple times and never saw it now if given the jump from the airplane there should have been more injuries and broken bones\nAnd they never found the plane nothing physically was wrong with him so he could walk back to the hotel the best everyone could tell\nThe corners they did the cause of death was exposure meaning hypothermia\nAnd he gets that he probably died two hours after takeoff will they examine his clothing and there was no salt or marine organisms on the body that means he didn't go into the ocean and crawl out unanswered questions were is what was the lights on the water\nReally how did you get there\nReally how long has he been dead where was the plane and then my notes on this I write down GHB again because there's no reason for a man to die of exposure on the top of a mountain\nWhen people get cold they get up and they walk you don't lay down and die obviously the top of a mountainous colder than the bottom or where you could see humanity from the top of this mountain\nStrange case\nYou know I've seen a some people respond to some of your cases that the weird ones where the closing is missing and I've seen people trying to explain it away as saying people do weird things when hypothermia sense and they'll take off their clothes and and walk into snow and and do things that seem logical\nI'm\nWith now would you respond to those kinds of ah remarks and would have been here\nDoesn't seem to\nOne of the things is I look for cases that are insurmountable meaning that explanation doesn't fit I have several cases where somebody leaves the house and within a hundred yards of the house they find a pile of clothes\nDoesn't seem to one of the things is I work for cases that are insurmountable meaning\nThat explanation doesn't fit I have several cases where somebody leaves the house and within a hundred yards of the house they find a pile up close and personal left the house and it was Seventy degrees or later that night it got down to fifty but the person who left the house and in a hundred yards all their clothes is gone in there and a\nStack in the field has happened multiple times\nAlso I've had other cases where a parent's says might be be couldn't take off their paws so if somebody saying they remove their paws and the hypothermia good luck with that because the kid couldn't take off their clothes\nSo the cases I Try to include tried I tried to explain this rationally\nNow there's a group out there that don't want to understand this and they want to explain it away with the book you kind of stuff and that's fine but the reality of it is is that there's there's usually no rational explanation for why does stuff happens\nYou know in the alien abductions field I don't know if you've read any of that there are some cases that are almost humorous that where there'll be somebody who's taken\nBy some entities and they come back in their clothes Ron backwards or she was missing or um they got somebody else's underwear on a or they're rare cases where multiple people say they're taken and their clothing is switched when they wake up in the morning\nI'm you know there can be all kinds of explanations for why people take their clothes off a that don't involve aliens but it it reminded me of some of the cases that you have in your books where\nPeople's clothing is found its kinda folded up it's a it's neatly placed somewhere away from people and um it's not torn up as a pie bears or something it's just weird\nI've written of cases in this book and other books were special notes were made that the clothing and the body was impeccably clean like it just came out of a laundromat and the body just came out of a shower\nAnd they couldn't explain why everything was so clean\n\nAnd you have cases where bodies or kids are found they'd been missing for a couple of days they've been in the wilderness no food or water and there's not they're not really they they're not weathered there it's not like they've they've been out in the in the open up for very long at all\nCorrect so where are they where do they go\nWell the same thing applies to the water related cases\nWhen when the bodies of water it to certain things that we know certain things to the hair loss of hair\nRinks wing of body fingernails things like that and when these bodies were pulled out quarters that made statements that well the person disappeared on Monday but they've only been in the water for twenty four hours but they've been gone for six days\nWhere they were a victim for all the time and that's important for the behind finding a body especially water\nBecause it shows things that it wouldn't show otherwise\nIt's almost like it's a reaping or all harvesting that whoever whomever or or whatever is taking people it needs something from them unless it's just malicious it needs something from 'em and and some\n... some of these people never come back at all and some are just discarded or when they're not needed anymore um\nI mean I I Know you're reluctant to go that far but it it's sort of what it feels like\nOne of the questions I get all the time is are these people ever found to be abused sexually abused things missing from the body that's not the case\nIf they are found there from pretty much intact without a lot of injury to him I mean one of the things that people with federal why is that what they what they're doing is they're taking the sole\nWell I mean I don't know how you measure that yeah I don't either\nBut I've heard those kinds of allegations of uh what some other intelligence what their interest in us might be and it's it's a tough one to prove I don't know what it would take for you\nWhat kind of evidence that would take for you to reach a conclusion I guess it it would take maybe film or video of of one of these um incidence underway\nWere ... when we first started this trip together years ago people said oh he knows what it is you know it right it's got to be something mundane it's maybe some crypto topic that he just doesn't want to talk about\nWe've come a long ways and I think if you start shutting the door to early you can't see really what may be obvious years later\nAnd that's one of the reasons I've been reluctant to say anything that\nYou know maybe a possibility 'cause it may close that door for me I mean I thinking where we are today versus where I was six years ago a huge difference\nWe're talking with Dave ... missing for one one land air water in a moment I'm an open up the phone lines and you can ask David couple of questions yourself we'll be right back\nUm [noise] anyhow um when we went um he came back out of the mountain and you met up with a couple of other um searches and I'm One gentleman had found some of the\nUsa panties 'em\nAnd they tried calling in nine one one non emergency number and they tell us to ask you and they never called back and and another lady um they were and that generally smelled decaying flesh at certain points um yeah and they they tracked it down their phones they could give it in a um\nYou know I I don't know ... and it was three teams on his cell phone H ... n excuse me one of them didn't make any sense it was way off to the left or the or where you park your car it's not even with a trail is um\nAnyhow um and just kind of thinking you know I've started what this could be and I was thinking maybe portals to another dimension um big foot big slipped my the guy was within his brother has seen big foot a couple of times I've been there um and I've seen a shift it's twenty five feet above me\nAnd he is also an underground secret naval base on their own land strange enough um it's on the back side of this now in the gym creek and at all and you can\nAnd I don't know any of it could have anything to do in this case or not but it's just they're all kind of strange things that I don't know if you've been mentioning that phone call you guys had sounded like steak but he's like a big fight before\nWell gee you know we're going to get Dave to react to you dropped a lot of stuff on there and we'll get names reaction to some of that I mean all those ideas have been proposed before I I'd I suspect that he's going to tell us that we don't have enough information to ah to assign it to any one of them but they you can speak for yourself\nOr or or hit on one of those things are the cell phone hanging I wrote a about a case in Michigan\nSeveral years ago and they track this guy's phone over this area and according to the paintings and according to where it hit he would've had to have crossed a road multiple multiple times\nIn this pattern that he was supposedly tracked him and there was never any evidence he was in any of these areas and he was found deceased\nIn an area probably where he should have been and where they were originally looking but it just like this lady said the kings didn't make any sense it's probably more often than you're here\nAnd everyone kind of just ... often says well you know maybe it's just the technology we don't know maybe it's not that good there's some reason we're getting these paintings in these areas\nAnd it's disconcerting that they happen because and not only throws off the search there's never an adequate explanation as to how it got their\n\nFirst time caller rent in Redding, California Hi Brent welcome to the program\nThank you very much for taking my call what's on your mind\nTo questions for David ... you've talked about how uh people when they have come back\nThey haven't remembered anything that happened to them so I Wonder if you've looked into perhaps there are people witnessing is it that but there are somehow having their memory a race that also you've talked about the German connection so I wondered if you've ever looked into mysterious disappear to Germany if perhaps they're more common there\n\nSo German Germany is tough I I don't speak German I I don't have a contact in Germany there are a couple of people who have purchased the books that have read and I've never gotten anything back out of Germany indicating that it's more prevalent there than not\nWhat about the mines being a race but you have written about about problems that people have been remembering where they've been\nCorrect and uh that's an obstacle especially with kids it's a touchy one uh I don't think that many parents want their children to go through any regression hypnosis to try to figure out what happened because they probably want their kids to keep that memory suppressed\nNow parents adults that might be a different idea might be something to look into if there happens to be somebody that will have the claims that and is willing to those are a lot a lot of hurdles right there\nYou have some cases where kids are taken they're very young and their explanations are pretty weird so no one takes them seriously about you know I was taken away by the big smoking Beyer or something along those lines right\nYeah those are those are hard to explain and you know a lot of people a reporter won't put it in the article you know that's just the kids imagination the search for sex wow is it or is it not\nOh on the wild card line Carolyn North Carolina hello Carol\nMy I had a question and that's their bodies they have recovered have they have it done enough autopsies to look very very

topic they\nYou know I I think you are the ones that have the author of Comey Rio on right\nYeah that that had some some real interesting things as far as cooking and it's been brought up to me before that there's some belief out there that special forces have that ability and the practice when they're in the woods who knows if it's true and who knows if they do it but I've heard that before\nBut no indication that the there was some kind of nanotechnology involved than any of these disappearances based on marks on the bodies that you've heard\nSomeone corners do an autopsy they look for the marks that's one of the things that can be a contributing factor on deaf so yeah they're looking for that but the first nanotechnology I don't know if they would be\nEast of the Rockies Johnny in

sharing that when\nWe're going west of the Rockies Roger in Bellevue, Washington I Roger\nYes a thank you George I'm Mr now um I wanted to a really a story to Mr politeness or\nAbout a missing people are in the uh Bellingham uh area of a Washington state\nUh that are over several years at least a recent and in the past uh have uh turned up missing a and a later on some of their body part and mainly their feet have shown up in the uh\nIn a water\nAre in different areas and ah [noise] you know since uh during that time period or my wife and I had a\nHad the misfortune of having a miss a missing son and he was a very well trained a boy scout and uh we figured that uh you know the uh since it's been two years now\nThat uh you know it's a well nothing ... nothing has turned up in terms of evidence or anything like that so the uh the local law enforcement the closed the case and uh and because he's an adult we can't go forward with it because of his wife\nAnd a and so we're we've been kind of stuck with that but I wanted to find out as a minister of prices are being aware of this a phenomenon of uh\nOf defeat a issue and uh it's it's been a well publicized in newspapers in in over there\nKnow what I mean I'm sure you've heard of that and uh you you know if you wanted to try to contact and we have a we have links on that goes to goes website is ...\nReports from a Minneapolis\nThat uh since it's been two years now\nThat uh [noise] you know it's a well nothing ... nothing has turned up in terms of evidence or anything like that so the uh the local law enforcement closed the case and uh and because he's an adult to we can't go forward with it because of his wife\nAnd a and so we're we've been kind of stuck with that but I wanted to find\nOut as a minister a polite is is uh being aware of this a phenomenon of uh of defeat a issue and uh it's it's been a well publicized and newspapers and hand over there\nYou know I mean I'm sure you've heard of that and ah you know if you wanted to try to contact and we have a we have links on the coast it goes ... his website is can am missing dot com that's where you reach a day I I Know he knows about the ... the story because it was a widely publicized but your son\nUm what are the circumstances where did that happen and when\nOkay or if it happened in Bellingham in it happened or just on the outskirts of town and uh he basically what happened a hit and this happened two years ago October\nUh he uh\nHe had left home and uh we believe that maybe there may have been some friction at home but uh he has left home and he got into the vehicle and evidently it ran out of gas in a can didn't have any money to get cash so he took off walking\nAnd it was nightfall at the time and he tried to call him and his wife back in a that was the last that they had heard from him a ... when he had stated that his phone was dying and he was lost and lost in the woods somewhere and couldn't find its way out\nAnd uh and and then we had a a massive search uh for the next two days in a row with uh with uh the law enforcement we also had a\nHad helicopters they had dogs they had a drones are I mean they covered or that area over ten mile stretch and nothing at all showed that period and ah we were just so a broken over that\nUh and uh\nAnd since then uh I have actually personally myself I have called in and talk to a few times to some of the people that they actually investigated on it and they just basically told me that uh that they were a a ...\n... they were basically are held by the laws of the state in and of course the\nThe wife uh\nUh that uh any information given out the would be specifically only given to her and uh and that the parents couldn't find out anything you know after that so\nWell under that reason why\nYeah I'd like to try to uh maybe a get a shot at a you know talking to David his brightest and she would uh see what he thinks\nI I Would just you try that website or that okay good that is but also you can leave your a name and number with Donna and uh I'll pass on to Dave I'm that's a\nThat's a rough story to to uh tell on the radio I'm sure I thank you for sharing it with us and you know I can imagine that that's a whole that never goes you right in the fact that you just don't know it was just a is brutal\n\n... thank you Roger thanks for calling in with trying to get one more call in before we go to a break a Joe in Long Island on the east of the Rockies Bonnie Hi Joe Hi\nGeorge ah I did a couple of seasonal gigs to national parks a glacier in Denali in Alaska and one thing I Would say uh\nEspecially looking at an alley the infrastructure of the park is very limited uh they have like a road that goes to mount McKinley that ... is winding mountain road that bus it can take a bus\nNo real hiking trails and if you go off the uh\nThose roads like the flooding would be bad for hiking so\nI I Would say it and I will correlate to slip glacier are they really on the play just how treacherous a trail could be for example in glacier it would be on latches on actual trials\nThat are like twenty mile trails for like two three four miles so I I think a lot can do wrong uh and uh you know if someone was like say by themselves and they hurt their ankle and couldn't proceed\nUh then I don't know anything can happen with the wild animals that would be one thing now I don't think\nUh what's happening is some sort of Charles Manson group that all looking to just fine isolated hikers and do something\nWith them I never really got the impression although I read that like criminals with hideout Yellowstone for example I don't think that people go to those parks to like a just a pounce on someone that's an isolated hiker so I I I I Would speculate that\nThat's not what ... what is happening uh but\nUh I I think what David saying about the national parks is very little supervision people are are you know are just off on their own toward the gray and I've done that including myself a at a number of times where something happened on the trail uh nobody would have no where I was\nAnd uh one more thing on that is my world multi theory is what you said about the birds\nA swooping down I did see a Glacier National park like these tiny birds but they almost right on the ground I forget what it says it looked like something from Jurassic Park so I Do wonder if that's the ... idea of some sort\nOf ... historic bird that might be out there\nBut that's my coast to coast theory\nI'm you know the idea that they're criminals and national parks national forest I think that's probably true you know there are criminals pretty much everywhere the humans go uh in addition you have a lot of people who are row row weed out there in in the\nWilderness places and uh and would do anything to protect it and um\nYou know but those kinds of cases are generally weeded out of the David database if we're talking about people who banish I'm under very strange and specific kinds of circumstances\nAnd there was no tracks there was no indication that people are around a ... they can vanish within a few feet of their family members or the people or hiking with so it's very weird and I don't think that uh criminals being out there could explain\nPretty much any of the cases that are a boiled down and David books but a appreciate that thought or we're gonna take a break now and there's a lot of folks on the phone lines or we'll get to as many of your calls as we can I noticed a couple of folks have their own stories with a encounters strange and counters in the woods and\nYou know it's been a while since I've been a hiking out in in uh\n[noise]\nHey walking on both parts later on a couple of weeks later because we're running out of their company\nAnd it never was ever ever ever again you know anything about backyard\nI don't know anything about that specific creature or creature report but I Do know that uh the outcome uh area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff rubbery long time or the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena Utah\nSpent some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories rumble locals including the tribe\nAnd had reported the number of different kinds of creatures it's always been a UFO hotspot or at least in the last fifty or so years so there's a lot of weird stuff concentrated in the area you're discussing uh but no I hadn't heard the story about the\nThe um things pulling people out of their sleeping bags that room rock lake thanks for sharing that do appreciate it we're going to go east of the Rockies to Roy in Youngstown, Ohio morning Roy\nHey how're you doing All right what's on your mind\nHey um I remember um this evening are you guys were talking about a ... you were talking about this couldn't walk around right and uh\nAnd I literally stood up and said that it and I point out the radio because I've read all the books I've read all the for one more books I've read the skin walk ranch book\nAnd I've been following this thing for some time for several years or ... was ... when you guys were talking about that all kinds of things to come to mind a rich lived a certain number of uh disappearances\nAre a lot of disappearances happen on or near Richland and at this couldn't walk ranch that's on a rich life\nUh let's see uh a hundred percent success rate every time an individual is taking no one ever see them being taken over the skin Walker ranch we're dealing with with with something that is highly intelligent and it knows whatever's somebody's on the property or on route ... is just\nTo me I'm just saying to me are at in my opinion I think that you know the the skin Walker ranch uh is very close to uh the the phenomenon around and go for one one\n[noise] well I you know I think there are some similarities and that it is whatever it is it seems to be intelligent and it seems to know what people are doing before they do it themselves and it's still the that's for sure the only difference is there at skin Walker to my knowledge no one has disappeared animals have been other here but not people\nYou know there has not been any people are saying but there has been a you know yeah I mean that's the other side that we have had animals missing but then we've also had mutilation\nYou know it was saying that doesn't that there would be that ah\nWhen people gone missing there's been no explanation of a gouge marks on them other than scrapes with things like that no no kind of like ... or something and then they would do and you read fiction story or things like that that that that doesn't fit but as far as ritualized go\nA and a and the high intelligent or is it\nA hundred percent success rate or no one ever sees sees it ah that that to me is uh some good strong march there\nBut ... thinks thanks for sharing your impressions with is that's a lot to chew on appreciate your calling in we're going to go to a wildcard line Mario in San Antonio Texas a he has a citing he wants to tell us about welcome\nWelcome George irate a ticket for taking my call too I wanted to be my\nExperience a this year at a park in San Antonio which they added another channel miles of bike trail connect a couple of parks\nAnd um this wooded area where even do with daylight at the time almost literally me and my wife works you know by slowing down the trail of course I was a little head over and uh we got through this one area where it got kind of dark even though it was daylight but it was so would it that it was\nThe ... the shining through as much as I started kind of got kind of a dark in that area everyone I stopped to see what my wife was that I noticed some kind of a something just staring at it and it was like on on the stump they look more like a bird\nOut but uh you know you never do I mean it's kind of felt like it was like seven feet saw Dixie\nAnd just the air and then on the stump just a staring at me and my wife when she approached a me looking at something she though and we kinda look kind of stunned that each other and I said that you see that she's like yeah\nSo when they saw was just awesome we just saw it back there'll be flying away but the wingspan was so large it was a\nIt was like a regular bird you know what I mean we have ducks in a ... and all kinds of stuff they're not in a park nearby\nAnd I said that you see that and she's like yeah so when they saw it just awesome we just saw it in the back of the flying away but the wingspan was so large that was a\nIt was it like a regular bird you know what I mean we have ducks in a boost in all kinds of stuff they're not spend a park nearby but this is a real heavy area would it\nBetween parts where they had made a bike trail and that's all it is\nAnd so I just wanted to share my story 'cause I Know we didn't record it to the hospital or any park rangers they said well why don't we didn't have no evidence is too it's kinda hard to believe that a bird could be that big and we were just two people just riding bikes than a a\n[noise] a lie down some kind of report about something that we just saw\nSo a ... you said this thing is seven feet tall did it have just like a regular bird's face or or do you remember what coloring on this animal are\nAll you saw was kind of like uh maybe it's something good his eyes color glowing just like if you just see a deer in the dark school was or something like that you knew staring at you but you you could just see us up like a form of shape\nBut you couldn't really tell exact details especially when there was an that this that and I think the first thing you know I Know this was a sense that something was staring at me and asked why that sort of made me look\nAnd what not to my wife and I'm looking at it and I look at that point so I so second\nShe turned around and just try and fly away so I couldn't really saw the ad like handle arms of the detail all I knew was huge because we used to have chickens and and do stuff like that it was nothing like that\nA Mario thanks for sharing that story and that's the amount of uh that's kinda creepy stuff reshape the specific detail that you had on that uh wow that's quite an experience or Jason in Portland, Oregon as inexperienced to share with us decent welcome\nFlowed George it's an honor to talk to you I'm always nervous when I call in [laughter] no need your\nYou're among friends what's on your mind\nThank you very much um I had an encounter way up in the woods and I've had a lot of strange encounters in my life and I have a very rational go analytical brain that overrides things and so it wasn't until years later I started putting\nAll the facts together [laughter] and so the facts are I'm going I'm hiking into one of my favorite little fishing lakes\nThat basically off of an old logging road\nWell when the forest service closes a logging road what they do in this logging road had been closed for a long time\nThey bring in a major excavator and they dig a huge trench on both ends of the logging road\nAnd pile up a big mountain of the debris and boulders and things like that so it's impossible to drive a car or any vehicle down that road again\nYou can kind of hike around it and even at times on your own two feet that can be very difficult because it's heavily wooded dishes in the coast range and it's basically rain forest a terrain [noise]\nSo I'm walking down this trail and I ... I hear a motor running and coming towards me is like an ATV type the seats for people so it's a large a TV it's not a small one\nThere's two sets of identical twins are theoretically humans in hindsight I Do not think these where humans [noise] there were two\nA thirty thirty year old maybe thirty five year old male humans in the front identical twins and two girls in the back Shay about age ten\nThey were all and I'm getting even nervous and goose bumps describing this they were too perfect to believe I've been up in these woods many years number one\nThey're close on both sides were perfect not a spot is affected dirt on either of them\nThey were dressed the way you see identical twins when their kids identical the two men\nWere identical addressed which allowed in a show struck me as odd because usually adult twins you don't dress the same these were address address identically\nThe two adult males looked exactly well maybe not exactly but pretty much like a replica of the man on the brownie role of paper towels\n[laughter] it was his enough", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "Vernal", "day": "01"}
