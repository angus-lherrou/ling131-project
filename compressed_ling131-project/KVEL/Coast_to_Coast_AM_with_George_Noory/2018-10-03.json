Georgia and great to join you\nI was just mentioning climate week with just wrapped up in New York well what do they do anyway\nWell they they had a lot of people there are a lot of dignitaries or their goals from the website where that they were run it to a race ambition reduce climate change and accelerate climate action or some big notable Tony Blair former prime minister England spoke bonk he moved from the United nations\nUm actor Hugh Jackman\nUh-huh oh the ... the Wolverine spoken a so quite a quite a big group also a big public\nSteel claim a five hundred thirty five million people were reached in three hundred news articles written so a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would and and a lot of folks there\nOh man the Wolverine spoken a\nSo quite a quite a big group also a big public relations steely claim a five hundred thirty five million people were reached in three hundred news articles written so a a kind of an interesting thing but uh\nI Would uh and and a lot of the folks there I think believe that if they change light bulbs they can save polar bears\n... if we all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a wind turbine towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe and George we live in a in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo there are definitely man made global warming proponent certainly\nThey are never been a fan of that because you know I I I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there's no question about that and we need to fix that\nThere's a real pollution or you need to fix that\nScrew it I don't think the pollution is causing what they see man made climate change I think words solar cycles I think this this planet has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbon in the atmosphere in anything like that\nThere are at least for periods of the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago when we've been gently cooling since then although the temperatures go up and they go down\nAnd ah you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were so many people are conflate ing with alcohol real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment things like carbon monoxide nitrogen oxide so for a day I\nMean the mercury particulates with carbon dioxide which is a voter lists harmless invisible gas and when I speak to groups I like to say to him what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents man made climate change\nBut ... it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress and they it was on a very hot summer day and he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that the earth was warming in humans were causing that he was a computer model or\nAnd or within a year and a half the United nations form Intergovernmental Panel on climate change and just three years later we had forty one nations and the European\nCommunity sign a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases so in my opinion of the first thing is that uh the world's kinda jump to conclusions quickly on this\nBut uh you know for the last uh Thirty years or so the computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it a temperatures have warmed just a little storms are stronger the polar bears are doing fine and then the second factor though is I think a much of this is\nBeing driven forward by momentum by money [noise] uh we have a\nWind and solar and biofuel industries we have deans of sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations and there are over there is over two hundred and fifty billion dollars a year spent every year\nOn renewables to try and stop the planet from warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's been going on lately the last couple of days they've been talking about here's a one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nBut you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee a governor of Washington state just a post an article and CNN quote how does show Trump you care about climate change and he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer\nAnd that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well\nWe've had that one degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree\nYet and I think it came from the sun while I Do too but\nThat comes straight from the climate research unit at East Anglia in England they the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade maybe we've had a tenth of a degree in ... in Washington for a center say that all these forest fires that caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work\nUm the way we take care of our forests are for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved today eighty percent of the world's waste water is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago and Brazil the swimmers didn't want to swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down in Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nA a electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease yet we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming\nAnd the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun it's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference\nWith all the things you're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that you know the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change he heads when I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to feel the way you do\nThat we're dealing with a different kind of climate change\nWell if you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about uh\nUm what was Hurricane Florence and last\nYear we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas ah we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida\nBut if you look back at history this has happened before\nWe've had a twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states these are this is really nothing new\nA hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century other and and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see this storms are either getting more frequent are stronger or the U.S government also has data on\nA droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we have more droughts in the Nineteen thirties\nWe have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never showed data comparing the past to the president when we come back\nAnd also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we had more droughts in the Nineteen thirties we have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting that people still write these articles but they never show data comparing the past to the present\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green box Steve Steve's website linked up at coast to coast am dot com spell it for you first name Steve\nG. O. R. E. H. A. M. dot ... dot com\nSure well that's this is a book that tells you what your green consult doesn't tell you a written for a general audiences and businesses and um one popular business a phrase years over and over his think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green bucks a sustainable development there they're forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of the environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation\nThe idea that humans are growing too fast and and are populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction uh and the fourth is a resource depletion those for fears are really at the basis of all of a our state and federal laws about energy\n'em and they're taught in universities and taught in a high schools but if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so\nI discuss the Fort horsemen and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries or energy materials agriculture or et cetera but it's a fun to read it say a color paperback and uh\nGot a lot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also about a a eight hundred notes in the back so people can go deeper by the way for its size it's a heavy blunt\n[laughter] well I don't know about that but in lots of agreements don't put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which got to summarize with some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\nMore weeds climate change with what's happening I'm I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you know\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago\nAmazed that is could be temporary because Saudi Arabia's\n... talking about turning out a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse and now you are the biggest producer of crude no\nNo I Believe in Thomas schools theory of abiotic oil that's the planet is got in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\nI tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time what we know natural gas can be created\nBy all sorts of things including a you know camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I so I think there's probably a combination of of some that his fossilized fuel but others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase the phrase fossil fuels I like to use the coming into hydrocarbons instead\n... well you know one of my simple theories on why the abiotic theory is the probable theory is because most of the oil that has pumped on this planet is way way down there oh yeah I'd like Lance and dead animals get down there\nThey're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah\nSome of these very deep wells they find oil and you've got to kind of wonder the other thing is that a lot of it it's been you know found in the polar regions too and and uh those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but\nI Know we have shipped shifting to the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a it probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the ... of the earth\nWhat is the argument about overpopulation and then it's a major problem for all of us yeah\nSo Nineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world and up until it got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy you know the big reason for that was we had a declining um it's\nWhat is the argument about overpopulation and then it's a major problem for all of us yeah so\nNineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world in up in until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy you know the big reason for that was we had declining\nUm infant mortality we had a declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems and so bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death in the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties [noise] but they didn't\nUh first we had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion a it more than doubled or by a two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output but the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping the fertility rate is a number\nOf of uh children a woman will have in her lifetime\nAnd back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average is having five children during her lifetime well today that has dropped down to two and a half that said dropped in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological\nA sort of a state we have more women entering the workforce there waiting to have children they're having smaller families so all none of this was for seen it all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years\nAnd so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nAnd to benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles cross Phillies game five in a driving to get to the venue I saw things that I haven't seen in years because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in a room with more garbage in June ... strewn all over the place\nWhere he said was this you know for new in Los Angeles yeah I mean I'm looking at the homeless\nPeople in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so that really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call waste dump them we're ... [noise]\nUh it certainly is it it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though that if I might if I might comment the government to California keeps making housing more expensive you know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand they're they're gonna want everything to have a electric car plug in\nSo you just add about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California does isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right more would you recommend that people start doing personally to come back to ...\n... people and businesses are actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going into land fills\nA that piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United States Senate is now starting to trend down we're doing more recycling um but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we've touched on before\nUm nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide particulates et cetera are not carbon dioxide um so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide is what they're pumping into greenhouses in California to make their cannabis crop grow\nA bigger and faster its its plant food\nAnd it's right or the idea that ah that CEO to as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these pictures that where you have this dirty looking air over China if you can see the error that's not causing global warming\nAll of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gases number one is water vapor what's the biggest greenhouse gas to as carbon dioxide three has a methane those are all invisible so if you can if you can see the air\nYou gotta clean that up\nBut the greenhouse gases are are really not causing air pollution or so we need we need to get our our uh aimed at the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nYou talked about in people coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of ... ...\nYeah well we've had a basically a rate payer revolt now in Australia just this last summer in Australia um we had a a Scott Morris and take over as the uh the new a\nMinister of Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out\nAnd leading the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is called for withdraw from the Paris accords um the prime minister Morrison says is number one priority is to reduce power prices while we keep the lights on\nWait a similar thing up in Ontario by the way both Australia and Ontario electric rates have gone through the roof more than doubled over the last ten years\nUp in Ontario a premier dug for took over and within a month he had cancelled more than a hundred wind and solar contracts they eliminated\nI'm a ... the fourteen thousand dollar Canadian electric car credits and now we have five provinces opposing the Canadian carbon tax that California has said so we've got to rate\n\n\nThis

of democratic government so it's going from zero to Ninety nations\nAnd with that you know we get the benefits of legal equality and freedom of speech religion rule of law lemonade show slavery women's suffrage personal property rights a lot of other things so the world is getting freer\nOh that's a very positive thing and it's all part of this idea that everybody is better off there's a lot of people going around saying the world's going to collapse overpopulation we've got pollution we've got all these terrible things\nBut people are healthier lives and and one aspect of that is the rise of democracy\nShe what do we do with people's cars this to me is one of the most\nHeartbreaking situations people who cannot afford electricity or their gas or let's say it's the dead of winter and it's going to get shut off because they can't afford it what do we do with those kinds of folks I mean it's it's sad\nYeah that's a tough situation actually United States is in better shape than many European places because uh we have very low cost electricity um\nA price us here in the United states I often put up a graph comparing Europe almost all the ... the nations in Europe is higher or electricity prices and we have here in the United states we have the lowest cost natural gas in the world\nRight now we're the biggest petroleum producer\nBut we should we say though that nobody nobody gets shut off during implement weather or can we say that\nI Am not going to get into that I Do think many of the the uh the utilities have that sort of policy that they're\nEither not allowed to do that by law they have a policy where they're not going to do that during equipment weather and they tend to postpone things into the summer I think\nHold on Steve we've got a break and come back

question that most people want answered\nWell there are many um\n[noise] you know I speak a lot to businesses and one of the things I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the choir [laughter] yeah but the funny thing is though they don't realize that the majority of us business thinks that\nThe climate laws and the energy laws are foolish in many ways\nThe headlines are grip a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and uh the political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of of American business um thinks a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in a majority [noise] ah so it's a little bit of a strange situation [noise]\nUm [noise]\nLet's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong is is uh something that people come up with and that has to do with some of the assumptions um\nAre they concerned about anything\n[noise] well they you know back in Nineteen Ninety the United nations in the inter governmental panel on climate change predicted that a temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade oh with them\nIt has to do with some of the assumptions I'm\nConcerned about anything\n[noise] [noise] well they've you know back in Nineteen Ninety the United nations in the inner governmental panel on climate change predicted that ah temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade\nOr with a mix of five tense and the low of two tenths and if you put those on a chart those rice pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we we fed much less than that so we're we're below the estimates of the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing the\nThe rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions of the climate models are wrong and natural factors dominate global temperatures\nLet's go to Joe in Long Island New York east of the rocky said you're going to have\nA state of interesting show uh actually I Want climate change I wanted to be warmer but less than a and a comment a got a quick uh my first question would be a we just\nHad a and I sent in Indonesia unfortunately and they said that they weren't really warned\nThat that was supposed to be a week and that was working with people cut our data and all of this thing so I\nI relate this to a ocean temperatures how well monitored all ocean temperatures and the satellites come into play with anything to do with that the second question would be a political climate you know ... all I talk about the last couple of weeks twenty\nFour seven as the uh you know Brett Kavanaugh are in his shoes and uh and uh you know it does make me think that the senators\nDon't have time to study science never or the interest and really don't have a good grasp of science maybe they'd cut one course thirty forty fifty years ago and science and never really updated themselves on their own uh and uh\nYou know I don't want to pick on trial but he's already got and blamed for the recent hurricane or in the Washington Post and uh that my comment would be uh you said the nuclear ... or a industry\nUh was traditional and I think it's a like a lot of people are a potential disaster waiting to happen and I know it doesn't contribute to climate a big ... CEO too but if you look at Chernobyl that still\nOnly buried it's still active it's never been contained nobody can go within fifty miles of the place all these years later so uh you take New York for example you got to the point right now and I'm a this big metro area or something that happened with that then what happens in New York City\nSo you've got a whole bunch of things there I think there were three of them one was what are we doing with ocean temperature measurements the uh the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has I think they are the ones who put out these diving\nUm a measuring devices I forget the name of them again but they have thousands of them out there now but\nUh they've only been deployed for about a twelve to Fifteen Years so we really only have data on the ocean temperatures are from measurements are over the last twelve to Fifteen Years before that it was just you know people take 'em and ships and kind of measurements are going around and those were very accurate the um\nThe thing you said about ... ah ah what's um let's see ... the third one was the nuclear plants I think one of the big issues with nuclear plants that they need need to solve is a need to be able to shut down automatically\nWe still have plants and most of the ones that are on the world that are relying on cooling systems in the cooling systems fail fail like happened with the Saddam in Japan and then we have a chance for a big melt down so that problem needs to be solved\nUm the other big problem with nuclear is is just frankly natural gas is so darn cheap right now nobody will build a nuclear plant\nAnd I think the third one was\nUm satellites\nWell you said something about governments and\nWhat's your question yeah I'm\nJust wondering do I I think you know ... or ... defeated about five times in the U.S Congress I think the majority of ah arguably more than half of the United states so members of Congress right now do not think global warming is a dangerous problem out most of those around the Republican side of course\nAnd as I mentioned we have we have a we now have a climate revolts if you will in Australia and Ontario so I think I think political leaders are starting to get it uh this has been a disaster crisis for more than Twenty years now and we're really not seeing the disaster so\nI'm hopefully I've covered most of your issues\nI think the biggest problem we got as an ex clear from the sun that could wipe out our power grid in render a useless wherever that\nThat's possible probably a big explosion there again if the if all those ... go off in Antarctica and melt of big bunch of ... the south of the of the peninsula down there that could be there's just many many things that could occur\nUm again we need to adapt as well we can and the biggest one is an ice age boy I like this warm weather folks I Do not want to see the start of the studies that\nWe've done we've done against Robert Felix who believes were in the early stage of an ice age birthday who knows\nWalter in Pennsylvania taken away well go ahead\nBy Georgia needless to say I did talk to you once again George\nThank you sure you're out with all due respect Mr Gore on sounds a lot like a doctor Kimball ...\nGeorge with all due respect to most of them I don't think that Dr Paul Ehrlich has been discredited at all I think George I think it's just common sense\nAbout the human population on this planet tonight including side in the mind them now you know George we share this planet with myriad other species are not modern library culture may have allowed a kid or\nYou know the agent a bane of law of men but modern agriculture consumes much natural habitat in Africa the human population eat driving the our thoughts nation just as in this country are\nYou know we have largely eradicated the great a herd of buffalo bites\nAnd mhm oh so\nYou know naturally you you could not twenty million\nOr the great\nFighting sitting hers that used to be twenty million in a hurry you couldn't now ... it would be compatible with the agriculture wind up by horribly wrong we have law expansion fields of corn and soybeans in week so uh\nYou know I just think it's common sense that the human population now cannot agree ... and a lot of them\nWell there comes a point Steve is they're not that you know you can't have a population of ... billion people on the planet\nNo you can't and and you make good points well but the the the uh predictions are now that we're going to level of about ten and a half billion there is no doubt that we've radically transform the surface of the earth ah\nYou saw it in a lot of them will there comes a\nPoint Steve ... they're not that you know you can't have a population of twenty people and you\nKnow you can't and and you make good points well but the the the uh predictions are now that we're going to level of about ten and a half billion there is no doubt that we've radically transform the surface of the earth\nAh we're certainly have done that and taking over large portions of it and I think with sixty million bites and at one time estimates are those days are gone there are some good news there are some good was by the way Dr Ehrlich goes once said if he was a betting man he predicted that by the year two thousand England would no longer exist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInches

I think some people misunderstand it I did a little disclaimer inside the cover\nAnd it was kind of a play on words but uh basically what I said was in his marches big foot has not been deemed real these works or work or fiction and the point I was trying to make was in the eyes of the world\nEverything about big foot is fiction for the most part what do you go before say the Patty film or to date after the Patty film or most of the world looks at these things with a wink and a nod\nI mean when I have conversations with people about a big foot when I have conversations with people about a UFOs your typical conversation is that if somebody looking at you with a big grin on their face\nListening to what you have to say and then saying to you come on you don't really believe that\nThere was a guy who called the program years ago when our bill was still alive cool book any claim that he shot too big for ... and had them and of course I don't know what happened the guy mhm you definitely don't know what happened to the recording ... what\nAre those kinds of stories in your opinion on Senate or made a\nWell you know what are we talking about George we're talking about one person it's like a he said she said\nRight I Believe me the proof [noise] yeah I Believe that\nThese people have no ax to grind I heard that story\nA when a or did it and I'm thinking about it\nThe man was not being paid he could have easily just shut up and walked away he didn't he wasn't trying to sell anything you know [noise] ah he was reporting what had happened and the fact was\nHe like a lot of other people had a certain amount of guilt about it or having seen it\nThey really didn't know what to do with it they knew there was going to possibly be some repercussions\nAnd so they buried him a I've had a couple\nOf encounters a where animals have been killed was said to have been killed one of them was in self defense\nAnd uh this man felt this thing was going to kill him a and\nWhat are you to say about that am I to say you know you're wrong for doing that you should have you shouldn't have done that you shouldn't have pulled the trigger I mean I can only I Can't imagine\nThere and that's different than just going out into the wild look for one to shoot it\nWell that's that's correct you know if he'd like I could um well I don't know let me let you continue I have so many

think there\nShoveling against the tide but um [noise] people feel like they have a need to try to take some of these animals down a thankfully as they're doing it\nTo me there's going to you know food kitchens and whatnot but\nIt's a it's a real problem\nI had a call ... year ago\nFrom an individual who was fishing and he caught two trials and he said as soon as she kind of realize what was going on she saw a big forward\nLooking at him about eight feet away and he said he's holding the two trials the guy is ... and the big foot\nLooks at him and he went oh my God what am I going to do so in a panic he handed the to travel to the big foot\nIn the big foot took them looks at them and gave one back now does that sound real to you or do you think the guy called and made it up\nWell I'll be honest with you a that is most one of the most on memorial story\nOr if I heard that I Would have discounted are entirely however having said that I had a gentleman was canoeing in Vermont and uh\nHe had taken a lake in to a creek\nLet's hold on to that story while you were going to take a break we'll come back and talk about that I've always had suspects about that a fishing story but uh

terror in the woods William you were telling us about somebody in a canoe when a break on us\nYes yes oh well this gentleman was canoeing in a creek are up in Vermont and really he was poured urging and stomping when he came across some nice holes that he felt he could get some good trout and\nAnd uh he was lining up some trout on Iraq near him as he was catching them he was camping on the side of the creek and his plan of course being the cook 'em up\nFor dinner so he had caught a few brook trout late I'm On the rock and\nWhen he turned over the trouble gone now\nHis first instinct was that a raccoon took more raccoons stroke them and I've actually had happened to me fishing that connect quiet river\nOr where I heard a little Russell in the bushes and I turned my head and a rainbow ahead laying up on the side of the river [noise] ah I see a raccoon stick it out\nLeft and right grabbed it and went back into the grass so I Know this happens and that's what he thought so\nA little later on he was putting more fish up there when he saw a long arm extend out at all most ground level and a huge hand grasp\nThe pile of fish not just one fish in one school grabbed numerous fish and retract it back into the weeds\nAnd that when he saw that\nIt was game over because he knew this was something in the ... said he hadn't bargain for and the problem was that\nWhere it had reached out at ground level is ten would shut up about fifty feet away from them so shortly thereafter that he\nGot the guts to go over there and repack up his tent and started to\nIt was game over because he knew this was something in the woods said he hadn't bargain for and the problem was that where it had reached out at ground level his tent was set up about fifty feet away from them so shortly thereafter that he\nGot the guts to go over there and repack up his tent and started to make its way out with a canoe but he had said that\nHe thought it was a big for it obviously what else has a long hair rearm in a big hand standing out of the bushes and then he also realize that this thing had to have been crawling on its belly\nAnd other words will be sneaking along kind of like a soldier trying to sneak up\nIn ...\nAnd was able to know that he was fishing saw him fishing short when he was doing by placing these fish on the rock and then had positioned itself or in such a way where it could get up there and\nGet the fish and retreat back into the woods without being seen but according to him\nWhen he saw the first group of British\nMissing he was actually sitting on a rock smoking is pipe and he had his peripheral vision looking out towards the rock now now being mindful he wanted to catch the raccoons and the act [laughter] what he caught who is not a raccoon at all\nAnd uh he was pretty he was pretty frightened off by that\nAnd and tell us with these reports hotter people described the creature in terms of height neuro big hobby\nYeah well it it really varies I Would say a minimum you're talking\nA seven feet tall a and I had a ... point he had\n[noise] yeah a lot of people say the comical shaped head there's varieties of a a hair for coloration ranging from like a salt and pepper chew a lot of people use the term or burned or read\nA and then of course brown and black so that seems to be a variety and then we have two different basically physique\nUh it seems that you either have these kind of almost cylinder local body very early\nA beer like for lack of a better term and then there's the other one that appears again and again and it's described as being like a weightlifter or was this you know Arnold Schwarzenegger or\nTo the tenth degree type of body extremely muscular or the chest you know Bolger Utah is you know just like a real monster\nSo these these are the things that people are seeing and then it just varies a I had one I'm\nA one story called the tree stand a incident I named it where this fellow claimed that his trees stand who is twenty five feet\nIn the tree which put his feet at something like twenty feet\nAnd this sasquatch and a group above the sasquatch is it seemed that the group was distracting him making our own noises in the woods while he was bow hunting and he couldn't see because of the density of the trees and the fog that was laying in this valley in the early morning\nBut he had said he recognized as a hunter that these our noises will not real in other words they were being mimicked\nAnd that he was kind of paying attention to this and sorting out the pieces a sasquatch snuck up on him from the rear and jet Li grabbed the heel of his boo\n[laughter] think about how big this thing had to be even if he was wrong and this measurement nobody ... trees stand ten feet off the ground I mean he said twenty five feet so what if he was at twenty feet and his feet or ... I don't know Seventeen\nSomething had to have tremendous height and reach but the amazing thing about that story was the way he said that the creature gently grabbed his boots\nAnd he jumped to the point where he almost fell out of the stand and when he looked down this thing was looking up at him and he commented how he almost all what that is just wanted him to know that they can do that that they could sneak up on him and grab is blue\nAnd then it left the scene and everything went quiet again\nYou know maybe you're born big food here in the woods tell us about the terror portion what what's going on out there\nWell I mean first of all when we talk about terra or when we used the word bizarre uh in regards to big foot I ... I take the stand as to\nWhat is more terrifying is it ... is it not enough terrifying to see a ten foot tall monster walking across the shoulder road or is it more terrifying to have one slang can you in the woods or when you're hiking with your girlfriend\nThese things are out there they're frightening people a lot of the encounters a somewhat casual\nWear this scene from afar and then the people exit hastily but then there's other ... encounters where it's my opinion these things don't want the people to be where they are\nAnd they seem to exhibit behavior that in my opinion they're chasing the people out\nThere wants to monitor region they they\nDon't want them there and I think if you push the envelope a you're going to be in the sorry state of says uh when you talk about this gentleman that said he had to fish and the the big foot walked over and he gave him to him\n[laughter] he gave them one by telling you right now George that big foot if I see that big foot I'm gonna get wheels like pop\nUp on a Kansas huh [laughter] yeah we're going to speed up the film real and my legs are going to be turning like the wheels on a car running out of their\nWilliams does anybody

numerous ones the vast majority of these sightings of being hand by people who are out there doing things\nThat your normal person when they say normal I don't mean like the abnormal normal but they do and things are involved in things that the average person\nDoes not do the hunters the fishermen they're in remote areas or the loners stiffed people who were getting out and going into places for

I don't even know what to say about that you know and yet this is something that was passed on\nYou talked about mood knocking that the people were hearing what's going on with that which that's well\nYou know this is one of the things that we we see on the television\nOr relative to a big foot people running around knocking on trees with bats and sticks uh they apparently believes that this is some type of communication are between big foot you knock they knocked back or the signaling each other in the woods but\nThis is really odd this account came to me and to me if you believe this is\nIt really disapproves of the woods knocked\nBecause according to this couple a this guy's name was ... he was a a semi pro landscape photographer or and he and his wife were in an area called lower Crabtree meadows in twenty Seventeen July so this was fairly recent the two of them\nWere walking into this area\nTo take some panoramic pictures now\nSome of this guy's pictures are actually on line for sale so he says uh so he he also commented that I don't know when somebody is touted to be a professional but he had been doing this to twenty five years and never considered themselves to be a professional at any rate there in the valley\nTaking pictures and\nThere was nothing in the valley they hadn't seen any animals and then no elk there was nothing around and they heard a loud

animals and then no elk there was nothing around and they heard a loud knock emanates through the valley\nSo he's got his cameras set up under tripod the wife has a pair of binoculars and she starts scanning around and sit through a husband I see something pacing around over there on the hill fried\nAnd he says what do you mean you see something pacing she says I see something there's something on two legs over their pacing around on the hillside to do like show he swings this time around using a telephoto lens\nHe's trying to look through there she's got it now he sees it and he says even though it was so small in his land at the distance humans looking\nHe knew it was a big foot there was nothing else around there and he says he described it as looking like a ... a nervous man waiting for a bus this thing was just like pacing back and forth swinging it's arms up in the air I'm like you said a nervous man waiting for a bus\nSeem very alert to\nYeah well a show then they're watching this thing it stand still raises its head up into the air like a howling wolf\nPuts his hands by its side just like you I Would do [noise] push our voice forward and then they hear the knock you know\nWhat I I Can't even do it but you know like if you click your tongue against through your mouth\nYou got it George is like only like you know a thousand songs allowed him\nSo he said\nIt wasn't the knock at all what it was more vocalization that the creature was able to do somehow with the its throat it's tongue its mouth who knows you can ask them questions but he said it was not a knock at all so then\nThat was really you know interesting that somebody had caught such a thing you know\nYou did you in your opinion is is it ...\nI don't know George I you know apple aren't you yeah it's ... it's its own thing you know\nIt's all you know like in in a blue walk on Ford's very rarely will and he walked just standing up right it uses its arms and knock on the move along as a chimpanzee does too mhm this seems to stand up right all the time\nOr not so really\nYeah uh I mean people have encountered them uh hitting all fours\nWould look like a beer to me to do that\n[noise] yeah but a little different or I'll give you this is this is really a strange encounter a this was called the balloon is citing the balloons citing this guy had been given a gift certificate by his new wife for his birthday for balloon right\nHe always wanted one I got\nA he was afraid of heights and his wife didn't know it [laughter]\nSo did [laughter] did they came one day when a to meet up with this balloon is out in the field\nAnd uh he was scared out of his which split the he fought through it and they went for a ride and here's the guy or to try to keep the balloon\nAs low as possible and the guy kind of went to them and said you let me know when you get really uncomfortable and he said they were about five hundred feet drifting over this farmland and ... and what he is what\nHappens which is really a unusual they got to a point in their flight they were all the people in the gum Dole or with them by the way it was like just to him and his wife there were probably a five or six people and now they got to a point\nWhere the pilot or the balloon lowered the balloon over all wooded area\nSo that the ... was scraping the branches\nAnd they came down and did that and everybody was cheering and everything you know ... trying to grab a leaf off the tree and all of this then he lifted it back up again as they made it across the next field\nHe did it once again he lowered it down and they just moving slowly along scraping the tree top and they all started cheering now he said you'd think they won the lottery the way the people who are carrying on and it's gone viola\nBut here where the big foot comes in when they're scraping over the second series of trees that was bordering a field busting\nOut at the tree line as the balloon is guided along gliding along comes this big foot he starts out walking quickly looking over his shoulder and the guy said I Swear he was looking directly at me and everybody said look at that\nAnd one lady snapped a picture of the thing they kept quiet and you can't control the balloon\nThis fellow said that after this thing think took several you know very long and fast strides walking\nIt hit the deck on all fours and took off he said it looked like a racehorse at the Belmont\nRaise you see that's unusual isn't it\nWell I I mean you know I've heard of this I I have a story in one of the books that cold along came a spider where these guys were hog hunting so here we go back I told you had some accounts of ... feral hog on these guys were hog hunting\nAnd they were sitting in a field uh coming up on dusk waiting for the songs to come down the trees that were already some out in\nThe field they were in the tall grass and the grass was sporadically patched in other words there were clear areas and areas of high glass of grass working away around this field\nThey saw what he described as a furry army homemade sticking above the grass that's what they were looking at all these shows like this dome all black for they were watching this thing\nMoving through the grass in spurts similar to like a spy to want to move quickly in stops moving quickly and stopped finally they catch this thing\nCoursing and opening between two patches and it's heading towards the hogs that they were looking at which we still far away when this thing came into the opening\nHe hid it looked like a ten or twelve foot long spider on four legs with the head sticking up what they saw was the head it's scurried into the bushes or the or the grass on the other side making its way towards the hogs\nAnd as they were watching this thing it stood up and women stood up they knew it was a big foot and this thing made a lunging leap like Superman\nDive on to one of the ... some type of quick movement on the ground and left the field with the hog under its\nBizarre story William are going to come back and take promise phone calls next on coast to coast\nOkay no I'm Serious I'm\nBack in ... I think it will be out of it or I'm right now and if they can have a plan\nWas the head [noise] it's very into the bushes the grass on the other side making its way toward try hard\nMany are in the process but the latest trend is community solar what's that\nThat's where cities install solar panels and homeowners share the power Minnesota's doing this and if it's successful the program could see communities solar expand nationwide even globally\nAnd as you report says without silver there would be no solar\nExactly that's why some experts are calling for one hundred dollar silver and according to the world's silver survey demand is already exceeding supply it's starting to get exciting\nKevin our listeners are passionate do you have anything you can send them so they can learn more\nWe do George we're going to make a special offer it's our latest sky high silver report the report is a twenty dollar value but your listeners get it free just call one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\nYet leaders sky high silver reporting don't miss out on the solar revolution it's free with no obligation call one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred that's one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four hundred\n[noise]\n\nAnd welcome back our final segment with William machine and we're going to take the calls but William before we take calls where do we get the book big winter in the woods\nOr the books are there's actually four volumes the fifth one just came out uh they're available on Amazon and\nPay them back and in Kindle format\nSo you know you can have your druthers whether you're a a Kindle user or if you're like oh a paperback book which I kind of favorite myself I like the feel of\nPages and touched the old school but nothing wrong with that yup yup\nLet's go to Chicago Robert's with us to get things started hey Robert go ahead sir\nThank you George George okay on the weekend\nThank you were to ask questions first of all have you ever seen or phone or to make sure that were captured and killed and ensure a a\nN around a little clues shattering the micro this this thing really looks like the real McCoy this was in Pennsylvania now and I should go to Sharon Sharon this one may caught up and the other big what they have them and\nAnd the second question I as you mentioned that you know some men that shot a big what happened after the break ... wish that we go down like I mean they should have what kind of weapons well\nHere's an answer your first question no I'm unfamiliar with the uh two big foot in Pennsylvania [noise] uh but I have a number of historical\nAccounts one of them was quite an ... interesting uh that came from a photograph taken from a a the grandparents' house after the\nFinal grandparents had died in which was detected a work camp in Virginia at that time\nUh that was set up a after Roosevelt had established a uh the protection\nOf the parks are they they needed to start making eat grass and and access to these parks and structures so people could go in there and stay in a bathroom facilities and ranger stations so they had assembled this civilian core\nOf workers and these guys were in there basically roughing it in the wilderness in these you know only protected uh a wooded areas that were to become a national parks and they were regularly having encounters with what they called the hairy men\nAre in fact in the one in ... account in a one of my books called the hairy men one of these things came into the camp and tried dragging wanted demand off of is caught and the other men attacked it\nThrowing a hand axes and grabbing guns shooting at that thing as it ran\nA out of their uh encampment now that the odd thing is about these things\n[noise] it seems that shot\nGun fire has almost no effect on them\nAre in fact in one account called the fits into hunters this guy hit this thing at twenty twenty five yards with both roles of a seven and a half lead shot and he said the thing didn't even flinch and kept running through a briar patch\nOr in answer to your second question about\nA big what's being shot\n[noise] uh out of their uh encampment now but the odd thing is about these things\n[noise]\nIt seems that shot gun fire\nHas almost no effect on them\nAre in fact in one account called the pheasant hunters this guy hit this thing at twenty twenty five yards with both perils of a seven and a half lead shot and he said the thing didn't even flinch and kept running through a briar patch or in answer to your second question\nAbout\nA big puts being shot or in my account called the bullet\nThis guy was hunting in um\nI think it was Idaho\nAt any rate he came to an area where in the woods where he was confronted with a mountain center ridge line on three sides in front of him and he ran across what he described as a quantified ... made of sticks\nHe said this thing did not randomly form there in fact there was nothing about this pine forests that lends itself to having this quantity of sticks and branch powers or thousand branches\nFormed in this type of thing any inside had about a two foot deep layer of branches as well as well for me what he thought was like betting so his initial thought was that\nHunters had built this thing as like a shelter when they were out there but that was shown that change on this bridge line that he had initially seen coming into the place he was now seeing a dark figure standing at the ridge which started to charge in his direction down the hill\nNow he estimated that this ridge line was about a Fifteen hundred feet above the valley that he was standing in and he said that the rate that this thing was running down the hill was impossible for a man to do\nWhen this thing broke to the base of the ridge\nHe estimated now that it was about six to nine hundred yards away from his position and at the time he was a hunting with a vintage Korean War vintage am one car being\nAs it got closer he leveled the fight on it and pumped around over its head\nThinking he would scare it it kept running he described this thing as looking like the cop in the Terminator movies when that that ah cyborg or whatever the heck they called the Terminator robot was\nA posing as the police officer\nAnd how he was running relentlessly with the arms pumping and like nothing could stop them even load is gone fired a second round added he sure he hated it had no effect on them and they kept running he fired a third and fourth round\nAnd if things kept coming at him now it was closing any squeeze the trigger on the fifth bullet which is why it named a story the bullet and it finally drop\nAnd when he walked up on it he got closer we shot it with another round he got even closer to and he realized the thing was was not moving in that it was done\nAnd he left it where it was now here's the thing George\nFirst of all this guy shoot this thing in self defense he's in\nImminent danger or this things coming at him like a\nBat outta hell he's shooting at this thing and the bullet seem to be having having no effect on them and yet when he saw it lying on the ground he conceded that had been wanting to do was multiple blood patches where these bullets had actually hit it but why\nThese things can go now we all know if you go hunting\nIf you don't hit a moose ... or an Al Gore deer if you don't get a good long shot or heart shot some type of solid organs shot these things can run\nAnd hunters to lose their uh Corey not being able to find it because they can go for miles or you know they could just disappear on you if you don't get a good shot\nBut these creatures it seems like to me if you are going to take one of these things down it's gotta be a head shot it's got to be in the neck or the ...\nOr something ... much sadly then you have to take them now well I mean what are you going to do George\nRhino R. by the way I looked at the picture than Eighteen seventies series big foot\nOr they didn't have photo shop the news\nYou very very intriguing ditch they've done a couple of these are all hunters with the ... uh they're holding him up or he's obviously did one huge huge huge huge I mean you just Google\nEighteen Seventy big foot shot in Pennsylvania in the pictures and Paul\nAmazing ... and I\nI have a diary accounts or I called it the hunters diary it's it's no longer than a handwritten letter that you would write\nThe to your wife and in there they're not", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Vernal", "day": "03"}
