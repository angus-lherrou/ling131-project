person's\nHouse [laughter] well you went to a lot of funeral homes sometimes as an invited guest because you could see ... the person who died\nRight and that's what I mean in all honesty I could probably go to three funerals a day seven days a week that so many people want to talk to their loved one for the left\nHis ... always near their cash skipped during a funeral or are they\nNormally yeah standing\nAt the foot of the casket because that's usually where the life family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects and so anything that that they can hear because they're very very known them as to what people are saying about them or\nHow they look or you know they they like to know that stuff\nAnd but in the last seven or eight years this business where the table set off to the sidewalks\nThat's usually where the ... family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects and so anything that said they can hear because they're very very nosy and as to what people are saying about them or\nHow they look or you know they they like to know that stuff\nAnd but in the last seven or eight years\nThis business where there's tables set off to the side with all these photos in and their life in pictures\nAnd if there's a group of people standing around by those pictures them to Spiro will go over there and listen to what they're saying\nAnd it's funny because I've already been there where a man said see that lady with that had on over there I said yep he said well she's saying that that picture happened when we were in Missouri she's out or her mind we weren't in Missouri when that happened we were in Pennsylvania\nAnd it's like\nOkay you know I'm not going to go argue with your lady friend over there so so they're very interested in what goes on is very interesting [noise] usually well it has to be an immediate family member that invites me you just can't believe how many nosy neighbors\nThere are no harm on at\nAny rate I go to this ... this particular funeral and the man was standing at the foot of his casket and he looked at me he said you can see me I said I can\nAnd I told them why was and he said I bet my daughter bounds you she would find somebody crazy like you\nAnd I'm thinking okay and so I said well I said yes your daughter did call me and he says I ... my son doesn't know anything about this and I said to the to the daughter I said does your brother in law you called me she says oh yeah he's really into this\nAnd I just sort of look to your grandmother and gave him aside law\nAnd so he said will call my son over half recall my son over so he says to me tell my son to go home right now that my brother bill is in my basement trying to break open my gun cabinet\nOh boy\nAnd I looked at him and I said now you're telling a crazy person that I mean you know he called me crazy\nWas it was rather than trying to do so when are we just wanted the collection of gun you want to keep 'em from Sharm right\nSo I said to the sun I said your uncle bill is in your dad's house right now in the basement trying to break open the gun cabinet and the sun looks at me he goes no he's not I just saw on the half hour ago\nAnd I said point him out to me he's lucky he says you know I don't really see him I Am the

go down the basement and see what your uncle's doing oh sure enough this world who bill was breaking open the gum\nCabinet right on ... yep [noise]\nSo it it's interesting when things like that happened or were they telling me where money's hidden or a I Can't tell you how many gifts I found for wives that the husbands died right\nBefore their birthday or an anniversary and you know it's like look in this covered in his shoe box you're going to find a really pretty neck was that he got for you you\nYou give them pleasure\nI Do I Do think about it you know it would have been really nice to talk to a couple of your loved\nOnes before you couldn't do it anymore and I think people like that and it's not always wears the key to the safety deposit box a lot of times it is but not all the time\nWhen a when you're dealing with the sheets how many of them are generally know but they're dead\nEvery one of them how do you not come out of your body and look down in your spirit leads the body and look down and go holy smokes I Am dead\nSo they're not in denial\nThey are not and I know there's some psychic send me the and said that they don't know they're dead but\nI mean the middle down you don't how do you not know you and I would agree with you yeah I Know you can do\nThis now I'm not saying they're happy about it but the definitely know that they're dead\nYou know not everybody who dies moves on thinking this was all fun and games ha ha I'm dead and I'm going to happen it's gonna be depressing even for some of the ah ... yeah\nWell it's adds a lot of them are sad because they think that they won't be able to see what's going on with their family or watch their grandchildren grow up\nAnd it's like no no no no no one to go into the light you can come back and forth you're not gonna miss\nAnything plus the fact there's proof of that because if you take pictures and you'll get or herbs in pictures perfectly round circles they can be a little they can be big

or a face of who it is it's the or is like in the middle it's a dust particle don't worry about it\nYou have to want negative energy pursue what did you conclude\nWell I really believe it's pretty easy and you hate to put this out there but I it's actually pretty easy to put negative energy on somebody it's not as big of a ritual as people think\nIt is I mean if you think about it you don't care for your neighbor and every day you're well what are you fighting about you're fighting about the property line\nSo every day when you see him come out of his house and go on his garage to leave or cut his grass you're sitting there in your kitchen watching him going oh you jerk I Hope you break your knee or\nI don't know like you why don't you move you know look at it this way if I said to you George tomorrow morning at ten o'clock I'm going to have some minor surgery say a prayer for me I Will say a prayer for\nExactly and that means sending positive energy to make good energy to me but if this lady is sitting in her kitchen every time she looks at her neighbor and thinking negative stuff why couldn't deaths yet\nKnow him that person one realize this is happening to them and to find it all\nThey can eventually but remember karma you know be careful who you try to throw under the bus ... you\nNever know what goes around comes you know that's true right but I mean the recipient of the curse words oh okay do they know that it's happening to them\nThink if it's done with enough intent or if you actually go to some one\nFor his cheapest five bucks and tell them to put negative energy and somebody they pretty much know easily the three things that negative energy will effect and it can affect one two or all three of them and and no particular order is health money or relationships\nAnd ships and you know of all of a sudden you're twenty two years\nOld and you never had any problems dating and you always had a good time and all of a sudden now you're going out with a new person after\nThe second data it's All right down the toilet so something's going on but if you\nYou know if you go to somebody like me or you look at my one book that he had the instructions and how to remove negative energy one step taken off and anybody can remove negative energy or somebody you can't do it yourself\nBut you could definitely have a friend do it and once that is released and gone you're fine the same thing with health if a person he has occurred some them and they've got a bad health\nProblem and you go to the doctor you go for an MRI you go for the

talk about the dream stayed what can be conjured up that way but when someone puts a crush on an individual mhm does the individual\nWhat happens to them do they feel something did they see I think someone put a curse on me\nWell when things start going bad and you don't feel good or your relationships go down to to where you lose your job and you can find a job um then they start thinking that's when you hear on the born loser I must have a cloud over my head a ... if I didn't have bad luck I wouldn't have any lock and\nPeople don't realize that especially if everything was going fine in their life or normal in their life and everything gets going down the tubes and eventually they figure it out or they go to somebody or somebody that they know go gene that happens it's rotten luck for the last year what the heck's\nSo they don't even have to believe that all they had to do is give me their permission\nMy grand daughter got a promotion where she was working and uh apparently she got a promotion over somebody who thought they were talking that job yet and she did a cheering square and you know decent and everything's is rigged girl\nAnd strange things started happening to her I mean things that would always go well\nThings were really kind of screwed up and she called me up one day some papa I think somebody put a crush on me and and I shouldn't worry let's let's think about this from ... who would want to do this to you I mean your funk Persian you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over\nAnd I went oh huh and I said oh look up all of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes ... insured off it ended up being the person oh I Apologize and took the curse off terribly and everything's fine\nBut or stop sending negative energy to her you know war off right because I Am so\nMy question is when someone does get hit by a Kurdish mhm how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who puts a curse on them\n[noise] that's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is [noise]\nUm did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words that you have an affair with a married person believe you me a woman you know I ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to put somebody in the nose a woman gets angry at somebody\n... women meaner than men she's gonna curse that person and because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens\nAnd but the bottom line is this who cares who did it just get it off\nHow do you get it off can you do it yourself do you have to call ... ... how do you get at all\nNope you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and they can't they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and and when do speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy\nAnybody can do it you just can't do it to yourself\nUse every body susceptible to a curse what about someone who's got so much energy and positive to the gym they put up the force for you to kind of block it and she you\nKnow unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the cruises removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that maybe has to be do something\nAt every full moon or generational curses\nThey just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were first\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed\nMost people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have a curse removed off of them again it does not affect them as a matter of fact I think about it and ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's the game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York\nAnd so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time there best hitter gets up the whole stadium is going to lose you jerk don't hit the ball given out and then they clap as he does get an energy thrown on that person's\nOh yeah absolutely and that's why the home team is an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on the airplane to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's gonna be added on every other stadium that is not his home stadium\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players\nWill her ballplayers in a
