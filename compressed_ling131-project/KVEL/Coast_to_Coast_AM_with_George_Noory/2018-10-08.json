about several things including the cycle man the him which was popularized by or ... the originator of the term\nNear death experience and let us bring in Joshua when the war and right now hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight is Halloween seasonal I Love it\nOr we're going to dig into this extremely creepy thing it's like I'm anti of mirrors I also have an update for you\nAbout time warps in UFOs or later on we are going to give away some free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday a there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with you\nAnd the way I'm bummed 'cause I got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your them but at least the spirit of me will be with you OK\nWell ... you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank you\nGuys aren't the cycle meant the it's a small enclosed area set up with a cheer dim lighting the mirrors angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd the number of other people in person\nIn the cycle I'm anti um technique um and it it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager because I started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the uh a local newspaper and I found again and again\nI was going to a haunted place someone would take me into a room and said this is the most talented room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I'd find a room that had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomena\nUm there are a number of possible explanations for this for one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infant a tunnel\nRunning like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light as electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of light which\nOperates has some sort of a ... that these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know what consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite tunnel of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of these spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to describe why by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek highly polished stone but there's something about this idea\nThat when you take a reflective of substance and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience Georgian and then I Want everybody to understand this I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state none of them\nWhen you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied\nTangible three dimensional seemingly Corp portrayal figure that will appear right in front of your head to toe and this being can come up to you and not only speak to you but touch\nAnd so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psych them anti and they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother than he would take you through a period of time that could be days\nWhere he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find that reminds you of her any pictures and he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with that intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through now when this becomes\nVery scary as when you have people who experiment or you know people talked about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble and thrown a thing you know you have people who go in there\nAnd they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude that's a dangerous and\nYou are you oh well you know you get what you ask for right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a psycho Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments\nWhere you know we'll set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair and so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in\nFront of it and I'm not that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kind of stuff\nYeah I think ... and and the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face you put a slightly above Iowa level usually you have something like a candle or a little nowadays Ellie\nIn front of it I bought that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kinda stuff but yeah I think ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put it slightly above Iowa level usually you have something like a candle or little nowadays Eli the laugh in the background\nAnd maybe some white noise I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with and I've taken probably a close to two hundred people through cycle met him experience and I would say that a\nLot of people order it is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time before I met Dr moody\nAnd a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent but I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the the people\nHad some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had a full on it and\n... with us we'll come back and talk about time warp since some UFOs here's our first emerging artists Paul Ruben from Santa Barbara California was a song called the winter when\nThere's been closed since I was doing is um you can see your way to win a slowing down and go\nIn and\nSort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery of it was a Newsweek inside edition and the ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas and area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme\nUFO hot spots in the state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nAnd so uh I have of course continue now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um\nI mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way of a very cool that you played a a a group\nFrom Ashville North Carolina is a great group part\n[laughter] you know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting to play a an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context okay\nUm and I want everybody listening v the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just coincidence or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nAnd of course I never believed coincidence stern\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe and that would mean you'd believe there could be an effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does it your new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast they um of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing or back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program oh eight to do that with the big deal that should've been covered even more by the mainstream media\nBut there was not it was not\nNo I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop uh and this was a program that was of course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was it was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind\nUh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty eight teams of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow\n[noise] now later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp it which was the product of me being the first and\nYou and Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and saw the very night that I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force\nSo here I Am next area fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announced as there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around the same time George nap whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in\nThe state of Nevada and they're good one\nYes he is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine if any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings he\nGoes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management in safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient he goes on to say even more\nAnd this is the one that really gets me\nAssociated exotic now that ... that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries an unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here\nSo he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise]\nHe's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology is going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's why we we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is it didn't come from them new so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic\nWe're could've possibly come from um I also want to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to Des where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with his project and some of these topics this thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes in space time gravity wave communication worked drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there is one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and a ... with ... July twenty fifth All right so that said\nNow we move up to August August of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville\nJoined the mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry\nWhich is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb and they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beat two at ... air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore yes when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space for it so\nThat said\nI Am of the impression here that there is some kind of amazing technology\nThat is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry\nThat is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt when I'm telling you you can download this information for free if you go to Joshua ... Warren dot com\nAnd scroll down the home page there's a place where you can it says something like you know Senator Harry Reid's PDF or whatever and you can you can download that now you tell me George you think that that is all coincidence that this stuff is winding up the way it is\nNo coincidence you know that none in let me ask you this when the late president Ronald Reagan initiated and want to do in this huge Star Wars program I was convinced he was more concerned about something coming from outer space that we needed to protect ourselves from\nWhen President Trump announced the space for ...\nDo you think it was the same motives\n\n\n\nNews this hour from town hall donkey Kong I'm Rhonda rocks for [noise] in the wake of right Kavanaugh Supreme Court confirmation President

see he's a creepy looking guy but from the moment I got there I was respectful\nI asked is prevention if you go to my Web site you can click around and find some of my video that I shot you know from the moment that I actually met Robert ... and I said look I'm Joshua ...\nI have come here to understand you I'm going to report on what I find to a lot of people I'm asking for your permission and blah blah blah\nAnd so I think Robert Knight got along very well and uh so I think you should also rest assured George that you played a big role probably\nAnd helping to educate people that there is something bad happens to you if you're disrespectful to this stall and if you're nice to have to do then you have nothing to worry about so I think he is much happier so to speak than ever\nNow originally to win the Dole was first given to the family\nYears ago didn't people\nSee the dog like in the window we're running back and forth and weird stuff like that\nWell you know the the weirdest\nThing creepy is thing about the story of Robert The haunted Dahl is that he was given to a young boy a Robert Eugene auto which everybody called Eugene ore gene\nAnd gene became obsessed with this dog when gene was only like maybe four or five years old\nAnd then Jean grew up to be\nA very successful man uh had had a wife that everybody loves had a nice big house but it didn't change his infatuation with the dog\nI mean uh you might think back when you were a kid maybe there was some ploy that was special to you and there came a point when it just for the drifted away that never happened for gene auto he kept this\nThis uh ... uh till the end of his wife and treated it in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better than he treated his wife I mean\nHow little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room so are his room was an eventually moved to the attic at at the wife's insistence but you know they claimed that when finally Eugene died\nA and his wife moved out of the house in the house sat there abandoned for quite a few years waiting for a buyer to come along and I actually did get to talk to some of the caretakers who ah worked in the house during that period of time who told me about just chilling experiences\nBut nonetheless people who were in the community said at night you can sometimes walk outside the windows and you'd look up and you knew\nThat house was really one new there ever read see little Robert Daw running around the house George Back and forth in front of the windows\nI Love that next let's go to the time or in Asheville North Carolina first time caller for Tyler Tyler welcome to the program\nHey how you doing good good to be with us\nSo a Joshua I was a up on the blue ridge parkway about\nFourteen years ago it was around uh August and I spirits who crazy life on to make it to make a brief I was up a around like black Baltimore area me and my friends were just hanging out up there\nAnd then all of a sudden like this huge deep dark fog just kind of swept in in the afternoon like we were watching the sun to all of a sudden it's super thick fog just said and\nThere were like six to eight what looked to be like jeep headlights off in the distance thought nothing to do that about five to ten minutes later they started heading writer at like right at us we've got to thinking about it\nWe're at and overlook there was no way it could have been linked jeeps or anything\nWe started watching them in like this belief at this point they get right up on us about two hundred feet away and then they just like broke apart and just started like bugs and all around and we took off um come to find like\nFor two years I thought I was crazy me and my two friends were like what the heck was that what's going on I don't know where he Josh\n... it was it was the wild stuff and then uh about a year or two later my my buddy sent me a link it might have been from your website or something talking about it\nAnd uh it just like connected the dots I've I've been really trying to contact you we're not trying but you know willing to talk to you that for about twelve years now to just see what you think about it\nWhat is that Josh\nWell it's highly thank you for that call always good to talk to a fellow Asheville in another Tar Heel and um you know right on that in North Carolina you know everybody of course focuses on brown mountains or the brown mountain lights because the brown mountain lights are the most famous example\nYou've talked about them before Josh\nYeah of of this strange phenomenon where you have these balls of light that appear but actually this is widespread this goes beyond brown mountain\nThis goes all over as Tyler was saying the blue Ridge Mountains and ah you know the which is of course the part of the Appalachian chain leading over to the great Smoky Mountains there are all kinds of spots where these balls of light appear now I Believe\nThat [noise] if you I mean if you if you really want to get the scoop on this you can download a free PDF about it if you go to brown mountain lights dot com\nBut basically an eye on that website but um but what I can tell you is that there are places on earth that produce an incredible amount of natural energy\nAnd that that energy has as a byproduct of bunch of paranormal activity that spins off so you get more grossly encounter is people seeing UFOs time slips scripted all that kind of stuff but in its role as form\nIt's almost like Meridian on planet earth that acupuncture is Mike compare to the ... of energy the flow\nLunch of paranormal activity that spins off so you get more ghostly encounter is people seeing UFOs time flip scripted all that kind of stuff but and its role as form\nIt's almost like Meridian on planet earth that acupuncture is Mike compare it to the Meridian of energy the flow on a human body\nThese are places that conduct electricity and when that electricity manifest and interact in certain angles at certain cliff it can create what similar to to ball whitening\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy around western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems sometimes having a conscious that so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these ball the white\nAre just merely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightning or if they might also have some sense of intelligence and uh this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua his website Joshua ... worn dot com you've got the information coming up with a Saturday Los

about on to the world war two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us\nSo Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you were originally get started in paranormal investigator what was that one catalyst that got you in doing\n\nOddly enough George it was really an incident that happened before I was born\nReally um 'cause I I come from a large family or my mother is the youngest of ten kids and my dad is one of seven kids while in both both sides in my family they've been in\nThe mountains of western North Carolina since the late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds a but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of the family\nIn the great depression or my mother is a mother was named to Virginia Calloway that was her maiden name and when she was about Thirteen Years old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big deal back to her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything in the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties are named Claude came home from a small game hunting trip and she photographed them\nA holding up their squirrels and rabbits and stuff and when the picture develop my great uncle clogged Calloway her older brother did not have a head\nAnd they they knew that was weird but they weren't not able to understand enough about photography to realize just how weird it was so fast forward one month later a clause was sitting on the porch of the house\nAnd he was reading a copy of his favorite publication western magazine old gunslinger tails\nAnd uh his father Jack was in the kitchen fixing fixing lunch and they were conversing through an open window and at some point or jak said something to Claude Claude Napster\nAnd when the lunch was ready jak went outside and I'm here's clause magazine lying on the porch but there's no claws\nAnd I'm a long story short my great uncle called Calloway was never seen or heard from again\nShe's a good evening ladies involved in the ...\nWell yeah well you know it's actually it's not too far from where there is a national uh part these days you know the ... national park area and and and what's even weirder is that you know I mean they did everything they got the authorities involved they got you know they were searching the woods\nAnd um you know hearing this fellow my great uncle who was waiting for his lunch you know in the middle of a story\nAnd reading a magazine ... how could he have disappeared was the abducted was the rapture that way that he did he get caught up in a space time slip I mean we don't know but but you see it was compounded by the fact that this creepy photograph was taken\nOne month before and when I became an adult I went back to that area and did everything I could to try to find out what had happened and I mean I've verify the whole story with\nElderly people and ah historians and but still there's there's no explanation for this and and you see this was a big tragedy in my family or they never got over it they never had closure\nAnd I got to grow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound this created\nAnd it made me realize that some of these mysterious phenomena or they're not just legends or superstition or or old folk tales I mean the the paranormal if you want to call it that\nThere's something very real that we have to take seriously and so that inspired me to go out and sort of try to define fact ah versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties was one I really started seeing some bizarre stuff for myself with my own two eyes\nYou know let's go to the final goals here let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi merry go ahead\nI Microsoft is November ... will go go ahead and that was long it will it will\nAlso said yes how does that relate to how all souls they in Halloween\n[noise] [noise] yeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth\nMy mother's birthday is November the third the day after yours and my sister's birthday is November the fifth\nAnd I can't tell you how many people I Know who have birthdays around Halloween including Dr Moulder who builds wishing machines his birthday is on Halloween\nAnd I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months that takes you kind of close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October [noise]\nBut um as far as your particular question is concerned so the the the basic tradition of Sao on\nWhich of course we now call Halloween is built around October thirty first and this is the product of the Catholic Church\nComing into the pagan areas of Europe and trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan beliefs into Christianity\nWith their own date well November ...\nWell they they realize that you know they weren't doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with a pagan\nAnd say instead of considering October thirty first um some kind of a pagan holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period\nAnd say that well this is the evening before the spirits of the saints comeback which would be November the first\nAnd so we will say November the first is the Halloween day\nAnd the evening before that is the Halloween evening or Halloween\nAnd so then uh they sort of combined the pagan believes of Halloween with all saints day on November first\nAnd then of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate the saints\nBut just celebrate all the soles of people who have died and so you end up with all souls day uh but this is one of those are interesting examples or it goes back to you know Christmas we're going to be hearing more stories about this in a probably is Christmas\nThere was one of the um the higher ups in the Catholic Church is said look if we go out and we find a bunch of people who were worshipping a tree\nAnd we tell them you're all wrong and we cut the tree down and we punish them we're not going to win any friends instead let's go and sanctify the tree and and then what they are already worshipping\n\n\n... is our channel dot com I'm Rhonda rocks for a weekend accident enough for New York state\nKills twenty people want to limousine runs a stop sign it gets a park issue the Eighteen

Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring\nA most of Japan or easily into the range of their of of the American bombers so what the Japanese did was they spread stories to the civilians that if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and\nYou know God Knows what else civilians are enslave them\nScare the living daylights right\nAbsolutely terrified so when the Americans did invade the uh civilians were would run off the cliffs and commit suicide and now you know that's a documented piece of history just a terrifying uh\nA story but now it\nThere are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book\nIs that a group of tourists were had a peace museum near those cliffs and ah they were walking in the field near that\nThat museum and they heard the sound of what they consider they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything and then they felt a wind pass them and then later heard what they described as\nCries and screams so that\nWas pretty moving for me um\nAnother story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally um a heartbreaking and\nHe would Jima ... there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably buried alive because they were ... they were in a tunnel system of very interested tunnel system under the island and um the the entrances caved in or or\nOr the soldiers were actually burned alive or in the tunnels so there's a story that I write about\nThat one a Japanese civilian worker claims that every time he gets a call that he has to return to the mainland to any\nHe gets a knock on the door and he claims that these spirits of these are soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan so those are some pretty intense stories that a crop up and it's ... they're certainly not\nRare uh in in this volume middle\nEast what's interesting too mad is that they seem to be so prevalent all over the place something's going on\nYeah that's true and not only are they everywhere that the different one of the amazing aspects of of the world war two supernatural is that the gifts don't even necessarily have to be people because there's actually goes planes that appear especially over England\nAlmost like the flying dutchman the ship\nYeah absolutely exactly\nPeople see these planes and they're really not there\nYeah this is I'm In and I'll tell you a little story from my own\nFamily do they hear them too\nWell some do and some don't but there's one area or in the United kingdom a\nA it's a northern section of of the u._k. called derby sheer and\nIt's known as the Bermuda Triangle of um\nThe u._k. it it sounds pretty pastoral sounding so I don't know why there's such activity but there have been a lot of plane crashes there about fifty planes I think if have crashed in that area and it has quite a reputation but over the years there have been what they called ghost plane flaps\nSo for example in Nineteen eighty five a\nBunch of people a claim to seeing this huge military aircraft flying overhead one couple was I'm\nDriving down the highway\nAnd they sold this very low flying bomber cruising over the highway and they said that it didn't have any sound whatsoever which was remarkable because it was so big and ah you know I think they described it as a a for prop ... engine and it looks like a World War two bomb or\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know a either a current military plane or possibly a um\nMaybe a a bomb or going to an air show or something\nLike that was what they want\nTo counter that a lot of these people that solve this first of all there didn't seem to be a pattern a of flight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a a a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft\nDisappeared in different areas throughout that region and a couple of the people that spotted this one in particular worked uh\nFor a an airfield during World War two and a with a I Believe I'm a somewhat flight mechanics for the for the uh or a half so\nDefinitely would have known the difference between let's say a modern I guess like a Hercules aircraft and something like a B. twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it be twenty four bomber so a pretty peculiar and and there have been other\nWhat they called ghost playing flaps a throughout history and I think there was even one\nAs I was writing this book so two thousand Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\nIf the one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was going to crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least to hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust to like that yeah yeah like you want to do a different time war for something right in\nAnd the reason I looked into the these are a ghost planes stories is when I was young my parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they were\nA starting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy a ... make it sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Erie\nThat watch it with my mom was still telling that story over and over a and that's what made me think well England was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any\nAny story similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI bet they handles hundreds of we're going to come back and talk more about how to

ghosts of country music more hunted rock and roll we'll talk a little bit about that tonight\nAs well but tonight right now we're talking about his latest onto the world war two soldiers spirits ghost planes with strange ... cities Pearl Harbor was a hostage or not\nIt's extremely hearted according to a lot of the people that go there and uh many of the people towards people who were interested in history go there\nUh we'll talk about the feelings they have when they're torn Pearl Harbor\nEspecially the the USS Arizona memorial which is essentially a to a mass grave 'em and it'll tell you what a a moving experiences and again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself into the time and space around Pearl Harbor\nAnd the ghost stories that are\nHave been told about that a\nFamous area are are are pretty extensive there's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left his watch on the USS Arizona\n[noise] ah just briefly and then\nEr during that time where he left the ship\nIt was attacked us and sunk and now there's the story of this for Lauren looking sailor standing at the uh standing at the edge of the memorial kind of looking out into the bay where the Arizona ... an hour\nOr so that goes story has been told a quite a bit\nUm [noise] excuse me ...\nThere's also a story of a of\nLauren looking sailor standing at the uh standing at the edge of the the memorial kind of looking out into the bay where the Arizona ... an hour is uh so that goes story has been told a quite a bit um [noise] excuse me sir\nThere's also a story of a of all\nOf one lady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course\nUh the waves and the memorial and then when she looked at it there seem to be faces\nIn them into the picture is a very uh in that went on online throughout\nAnd not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted\nWith therapy and goes stories at places like the show feel barracks and hit them airbase areas that were a part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and one place in particular in heck I'm a there was the headquarters building that\nUh supposedly served as a morgue after the attack and had some two hundred three hundred bodies in it\nAnd the places so haunted they said that they moved to the seat cue desk which is usually inside\nThe building they now say they post the guards outside of the building because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of this ghostly activity the sound of people running up and down steps to such a degree that ah the steps the staircase itself would shake\nSo it's a it's a pretty haunted place\nThe desert Fox rumble of the Nazi hands or think leader and some incredible things happened to him to he died in Nineteen forty four mhm but what does he still haunts\nWas that's probably the most interesting a\nStory that I found a a when I when I started to research this book because I I did initially looks to see if I could\nFind the the ghosts of a lot of famous general's pat and Eisenhower as well as some of the the axis powers and Erwin ... has always been a kind of a subject of fascination for me so I started to [noise] you know try to find if there were any ghost stories about him\nUh I I thought he might be found in North Africa which is where he gained much of his fame as the desert Fox maybe\nOn the shores of Normandy he would be among those many goes that appear in Normandy he was really behind a a\nArchitecture the development of the fortifications there are in the construction of the defenses along with what was considered the their Atlantic Wall or maybe he would be in Germany but I actually found ghost stories about ... in the United states believe it or not\nSo one of the places as mount Hebron cemetery and Winchester, Virginia people claim to see this a figure\nA long trench coat a\nCap on a looking over the graves and and there are some people who say that he is actually at the the graves or he's seen at the graves of some of patents a general patents ancestors and then there's a A N in West Virginia where they\nClaimed that Romney will haunt so what's the story behind that there is a story that are between the wars ... along with a few other\nGerman generals traveled on a secret trip to America to visit some of the ... the battlefields of the civil war particularly they were looking at the way that Stonewall Jackson maneuver through the Shenandoah Valley\nSo this is why this\nStory that uh\nIrwin ... haunts these areas is is around today they think that uh he has left his spirit here because he once once visited the site now is there any historical basis for this I haven't been able to find any in most historians will tell you that it never have happened that\nThe German generals never came here are people who believed the story said it was a a secret\nMission and therefore there would be no historic record that was kind of the interesting one for me\nAnd what about other World War two infamous people who they are still show up pawns\nWell there's some really interesting stories uh for me there's there's one that Churchill still haunts a subway in a\nIn a in London that once served as kind of a temporary bomb shelter and and and people have seen his spirit there\nI found the story that Churchill actually witness to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln in World War two\nTo be fascinating ah he said that he and I hate to lay this imagery on your listeners but a according to Churchill he had stepped out of the bathroom completely naked in what's now called the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House and he had traveled to the White House on several occasions\nTo a visit with a\n... FDR Franklin Delano Roosevelt as well as other uh officials from the American side\nUh he steps out of the the bathroom and there's Abraham Lincoln leaning against the mantle and I think Churchill says something like when Lincoln turns to face him Churchill said something like ah I see you've caught me at a disadvantage Mr President and then\nA Lincoln fades away so\nThat was kind of leak you probably faded away quickly\nYes I I would've I would've got out there as fast as I could he's Lincoln has gone through enough he didn't need to witness\nNot I'm not a new Winston Churchill [laughter] you know\nSo there's some other stories about Eisenhower he haunts ah what's called the bullet which is a a train that's on display at the national railroad museum I think that's in in Green Bay Wisconsin\nOr we talked a little bit about the ghosts of Gettysburg and apparently he andme Amy maybe behind some of the haunting Z in the farmhouse that they used to own their so yeah there's a lot of um a famous ghost stories from uh some of the\nThe bigger leaders of uh the most famous leaders of World War two and disease continue these haunting\nYeah they do as a matter of fact uh you know the the bullet a I Believe has the story that some of the stories that I found out about that uh were from the Nineteen nineties the two thousands one story is that I'm\nA custodian who was a vacuuming the carpet in the bullet\n... uh was halfway finished and decided to take a break left lock the door\nOf the the train and uh went to lunch or or have a snack and then when he came back the\nSomeone had completed the\nOf vacuuming and he could tell because the lines of the vacuum cleaner were super straight up and down and according to some of the people who knew Eisenhower he was very meticulous and that's how he insisted on having his ah the bullet cleaned so that story probably uh not too long ago\nAnd you know as we talked about the ghost plane flap they're happening probably even as we speak\nBack in World War two there were actually reports of us\nBeing to some of the people who knew Eisenhower he was very meticulous and that's how he insisted on having his the bullet cleaned so that story probably are not too long ago and you know as we talked about the ghost plane flap they're happening probably even as we speak\nIn back in World War two there were actually reports of UFOs they called them to fighters they were small little disc type objects flying all over the place the pilots reported seen did you come across anything like that\nYeah I actually did a whole section on it because they were so prevalent as you point out\nAnd if based on my research and my reading about that essentially the whole modern UFO UFO era starts in World War two with some of these sightings of these strange lights and objects that the American flyers used to just call a foo fighters", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "Vernal", "day": "08"}
