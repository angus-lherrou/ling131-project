should we be as in I mean I mean Congress has just useless our government is just they're not paying to enter into this at all and it's moving so rapidly by the time they would enact something it will be too late\nThat is correct so regulation in law is not going to help us too much because I just moved too slowly and and ... it was extremely fast so uh you know that doesn't mean we shouldn't you know contacts are are are\nAre are kind of a congressional representatives correct should just try to keep the pressure on\nUh I've I've been a speaker uh at at meetings of the attorneys general the state so attorneys general in there and those guys those guys and those women can move they can move fast\nThey do things so [noise] you know a lot beyond that\nYou know you you've got to start at the
