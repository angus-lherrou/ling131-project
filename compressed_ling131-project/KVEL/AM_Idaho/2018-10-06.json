the first presidency and Corum of the twelve apostles\nI Know these regulatory announcements are the mind and the will of the lord\nAnd will bless and strengthen individuals families and their church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints for generations to come\nSome years ago one of our young married daughters and her husband asked sister rouse banned in me a very important life influencing question\nIs it still safe and wise to bring children into this seemingly wicked and frightening world we live in\nNow that was an important question for mom and dad do consider with their dear Mary children we could hear the fear in their voices and we feel spell the fear in their hearts\nAre answer to them was affirms yes it's more than OK\nAnd frightening world we live in now that was an important question for a mom and dad to consider with their dear Mary children we could hear the fear in their voices and we feel felt the fear in their hearts\nAre answer to them was a from yes it's more than OK as we shared fundamental gospel teachings and our own heartfelt impressions and life experiences\nFear is not new the disciples of Jesus Christ out on the sea of gal only fear the wind and waves in the dark of the night\nAs his disciples today we too have fears are single adult sphere making commitments such as getting married young marriage like our children can fear bringing children into an increasingly wicked world\nMissionaries sphere lots of things especially approaching strangers widows fear going forward alone\nTeenagers fear not being accepted grade schoolers fear of the first day of school\nUniversity students fear getting back to test\nWe fear of failure\nWe fail failure\nRejection\nDisappointment and the unknown\nWe feel we fear hurricanes earthquakes and fires that ravaged the land and our lives we fear of not being chosen\nAnd on the flip side we fear being chosen\nWe fear not being good enough\nWe fear the lord that the lord has no blessings for us\nWe fear change and our fears can escalate to terror have I included just about everyone now\nSince ancient times fear has limited the perspective of God's Children\nI have always loved the account of your life or in second kings the king of Syria has set a legion that came by night encompass the city about their intent was to capture and\nThe profit ...\nWe read and when the servant of the man of God was ... and early and gone for\nBeing cold and host compass the city both with horses and chariots and his servant suddenly him alas my master how shall we do that\nWas fear speaking and the ... answered fear not for the day that be with this are more than they that be with them\nBut he didn't stop there you lie ship parade and said lord I pray the open his eyes that he may see and the lord open the eyes of the young man and he saw\nAnd behold the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about\nWe may or may not have chariots of fire sent to dispel our fears and conquer our demons but the lesson is clear the lord is with us mindful of us and blessing us in ways only he can do\nPrayer can call down the strength and the revelation that we need to send her our thoughts on Jesus Christ and his uh toning sacrifice\nThe lord knew that at times we would feel fear I have been there and so if you which is why the scriptures are replete with the Lord's council be as good cheer and do not fear look and to me in every thought\nDoubt not fear not fear not little flock\nI Love the tenderness of little flaw\nIn this church we may be fewer number by the way the world counts influence but when we open our spiritual eyes they that be with us are more than they'd be with them\nAre loving shepherd Jesus Christ then continues let earth than health combine against you for if we are built upon my rock they cannot prevail how is fear dispelled\nFor the young lad he was standing right next to Elijah\nWe have that same problem is when we listen to president Russell em Nelson when we heart into his counsel we are standing with a prophet of God\nRemember the words of Joseph Smith\nAnd now after the many testimonies which have been given of him this is the testimony last of all which we give him that he lives Jesus Christ lives\nOur love for him and his gospel this bills fear our desire to always have his spirit with us we'll push fear aside for a more internal view of our more till lives\nPresident Nelson has cautioned in coming days it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding directing comforting and constant influence of the holy ghost\nThe lord said regarding the scourge of that would cover the land and with heart and the hearts of many my disciple shell stand in holy places and shall not be moved and then this divine counsel being not troubled\nFor when all these things shove come to pass you may know the the promises which have been made under you shall be fulfilled\nStand in holy places being a troubled and promises shall be fulfilled let's look at each one of these in relation to our fears first stand in holy places\nWhen we stand in holy places are righteous homes are dedicated chapels that concentrated temples we feel the spirit of the lord with us\nWe find answers to questions that trouble is or the peace to simply set them aside\nThat is the spirit inaction these sacred places in the kingdom of God on earth call for our reverence our respective others are best selves in living the gospel and our hopes to lay aside our fears and seek the healing power\nMuch like the braided strands of a rope produced a powerful and durable tool all of these inter related actions are part of a unified effort\nTo better align the focus resources and work of the saviors restored church with its fundamental mission to assist God in his work to bring to pass the salvation and ... of his children\nPlease do not focused primarily upon the logistical aspects of what has been announced we must not allow procedural details to obscure the over arching spiritual reasons these changes now are being made\nOur desire is that faith and the father's plan and in the ... saviors redeeming mission might increase in the earth and the gods everlasting covenant my ... are only objectives are to facilitate continuing conversion to the lord\nAnd to love more completely and serve more effectively or brothers and sisters\nSometimes as members of the church we segment separate and apply the gospel in our lives by creating lengthy checklist of individual topics to study and test to accomplish\nBut such an approach potentially can constrain our understanding envision we must be careful because Farah say ethical focus upon checklists can divert us from drawing closer to the lord\nOf the purpose and purification the happiness and joy\nAnd the continuing conversion in protection that come from yielding our hearts unto God and receiving his image in our countenance says cannot be obtained merely by performing and checking off all of a spiritual things we're supposed to do\nRather the power of the saviors gospel to transform and bless us flows from discerning and then and applying the inter related illness of its doctrine principles and practices\nOnly as we'd gather together in one all things in Christ with from focus upon him can gospel truth is synergistic Lee enable us to become what God desires us to become and endure valiantly to the end\nThe gospel of Jesus Christ is a magnificent tapestry of truth simply framed and woven together\nAs we learn and linked together revealed gospel truth we're blessed to receive precious perspective and increased spiritual capacity through eyes that can see the Lord's influence in our lives and ears that can hear his voice\nAnd the principal of gathering together in one even in him can assist us in changing the traditional checklists into a unified integrated and complete whole\nLet me provide both a doctrinal ... church example of what I Am suggesting\nExample number one the fourth article of faith is one of the greatest illustrations of gathering together in one all things in Christ\nWe believe that the first principles and ordinances of the gospel our first faith in the Lord Jesus Christ second repentance third baptism by emerging for the remission of sins fourth laying on of hands for the gift of the holy ghost\nTrue face is focused in and on the Lord Jesus Christ in him as the divine and only be gotten son of the father and on him and the redemptive mission he fulfilled\nFor he has to answer the ends of the law and he claim of all those who have faith in him and they who have faith in him will cleave onto every good thing where for he advocated the cause of the children of men\nExercising faith in Christ is trusting and placing our confidence in him as our savior on his name and in his promises\nThe first to natural consequence of trusting in the savior is repenting and turning away from evil as we exercise faith in and on the lord we naturally turn toward come onto an depend upon him\nDust repentance is trusting in and relying upon three ...\nAnd in his promises the first to natural consequence of trusting in the savior is repenting and turning away from evil as we exercise faith in and on the lord we naturally turn toward come onto an depend upon him\nDust repentance is trusting in and relying upon three deem or to do for us but we cannot do for ourselves\nEach of us must rely holy upon the merits of him who is mighty to save because only through the merits and mercy and grace of the holy messiah can we become new creatures in Christ and ultimately return to dwell in the presence of God\nThe ordinance of baptism by immersion further remission of sins requires us to trust in him rely upon him and follow him need five proclaimed\nI Know that if you show follows the sun with full purpose of heart acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God but with real intense repenting of your sins witnessing unto the father is that you are willing to take upon you the name of Christ by baptism\nYou pay by following your lord and your savior down into the water according to his word be whole then show you receive the holy ghost ... come the baptism of fire and the holy ghost\nThe ordinance of laying on of hands for the gift of the holy ghost requires us to trust in him rely upon him\nFollow him and press forward in him with the assistance of his old spirit has ... declared\nAnd now I Know by this that unless a man shall into her to the end and following the example of the son of the living God he cannot be saved\nThe force article of faith does not simply identify the fundamental principles and ordinances of the restored gospel\nRather this inspired statement of the leaf gathers together in one all things in Christ trusting in and on him relying upon him following him and pressing forward with him\nEven in him\nNumber two I now want to describe how all church programs and initiatives are gathered together in one in Christ many additional illustrations could be presented I Will use only a selected few\nIn Nineteen Seventy eight presidents Spencer W Kimball instructed members of the church to build up the strength of Zion throughout the world\nHe counseled the saints to remain in their native land's end the ... strong stakes by gathering the family of God and teaching them the ways of the lord he further indicated that more temples would be built and promised blessings for the saints where ever they lived in the world\nAs the number of states increased the need was intensified for member homes to become places were family members love to be where they could enrich their lives and find mutual love support appreciation and encouragement\nConsequently in Nineteen eighty Sunday meetings were consolidated into a three hour block\nTo re emphasize personal and family responsibility for learning living and teaching the gospel\nThis emphasis on family and the homeless again affirmed in the family a proclamation to the world introduced by president Gordon Hinckley in Nineteen Ninety five\nIn April of Nineteen Ninety eight president painfully announced the construction of many more small temples thereby bringing the sacred ordinances of the Lord's house closer to latter day saints individuals and families throughout the world\nAnd these enhanced opportunities for spiritual growth and development work complimented by related increases in temporal self reliance to the introduction of the perpetual Education Fund in two thousand and one\nDuring his administration president Tom assessments in repeatedly exhorted the saints to go to the rescue and emphasized caring for the poor and needy as one of the church is divinely appointed responsibilities\nContinuing the emphasis emphasis on temporal preparation to self reliance services initiative was implemented in two thousand and twelve\nAnd where we're going when we die those crews cannot\nRestored and gospel truth is that are fundamental to the doctrine of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints\nPlease consider these truths carefully they explain much about our doctrine and practices perhaps including some things not yet understood\nThere is a God who is the loving father of the spirits of all who have ever lived or will the\nGender is eternal before we were born on this earth we all lived as male and female spirits in the presence of God\nWe've just heard the Tabernacle choir at temple square saying I Will follow God's Plan\nThat is the plan got established so that all of his spirit children could progress eternally\nThat plan is vital to each of us\nUnder that planned God created this earth as a place where his beloved spirit children could be born into mortality to receive a physical body and to have the opportunity for eternal progress by making righteous choices\nTo be meaningful mortal choices had to be made between contesting forces of good and evil\nThere had to be opposition and therefore an adversary who was cast out because of rebellion was allowed to tempt God's Children to act contrary\nTo God's Plan the purpose of God's Plan was to give his children the opportunity to choose eternal life\nThis could only be accomplished by experience in mortality and after death by post marshals growth in the spirit world\nIn the course of mortal life we would all be soiled by San as we used it to the evil temptations of the adversary and we would eventually die we\nAccepted those challenges in reliance upon the plans assurance that God our father would provide a savior is only be gotten the son who would rescue us by a universal resurrection to any body to life after death\nThe savior would also provide and atonement to pay the price for all to be cleansed from San on the conditions he prescribed\nThose conditions included faith in Christ repentance baptism the gift of the holy ghost and other ordinances performed by priesthood is already God's great plan of happiness\nProvides a perfect balance between eternal justice and the mercy we can obtain\nThrough the atonement of Jesus Christ it also enables us to be transformed into new creatures in Christ\nA loving God reaches out to each of us we know that through his love and because of the atonement of his only be gotten the sun\nAll mankind may be saved by obedience to the laws and ordinances of his gospel\nThe church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints is properly known as a family centered church but what is not well understood is that our family centered knows is focused on more than ...\nRelationships relationships\nAre also fundamental to our theology the family is ordained of God under the great\nPlan of our loving creator the mission of his restored church is to help the children of God to achieve the soup colonel blessing of eggs altercation and the celestial kingdom\nWhich can only be attained through an eternal marriage between a man and a woman\nWe're from the Lord's teachings that gender is an essential characteristic of individual pre mortal mortal and eternal identity and purpose hand that marriage between man and woman is essential to his eternal plan\nFinally God's love is so great that except for the few who deliberately become sons of perdition he has provided the destiny of glory for all of his children\nAll of his children includes all who are gay and we perform ordinances for them by proxy and our temples\nThe purpose of the church of Jesus Christ is to qualify his children for the highest degree of glory which is eggs altercation or eternal life\nFor those who do not desire or qualify for that God has provided a there is though lesser kingdoms of glory\nAnyone who understands these eternal truths can understand why we members of the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints think as we do and do as we do\nI won't mention some applications of these eternal truce which can only be understood in light of God's Plan\nFirst we honor individual agency\nMost are aware of the restored church is great efforts to promote religious freedom in the United states and across the world\nThese efforts do not promote just our own interests but according to his plan seek to help all of God's Children enjoy freedom to choose\nSecond we're a missionary people we're sometimes ask why we send missionaries to so many nations even among Christian populations\nWe receive the same question about why we give many millions of dollars of humanitarian aid to persons who are not members of our church and why we do not linked is said to our missionary efforts\nWe do this because we esteem all mortals as children of God\nOur brothers and sisters and we want to share our spiritual and temporal abundance with every one\nThird more to life is sacred do us our commitment to God's Plan requires us to oppose abortion and euthanasia fourth\nSummer troubled by some of our churches positions on marriage and children our knowledge of God's revealed plan of salvation\nGods plan requires us to oppose abortion\nAndy euthanasia force\nSummer troubled by some of our churches positions on marriage and children\nOur knowledge of God's revealed plan of salvation requires us to oppose current social and legal pressures to retreat from traditional marriage and to make changes that confused or altered gender or homogenized the differences between men and women\nWe know that the relationships identities and functions of men and women are essential to accomplish God's great play\nFast we also have a distinctive perspective on children\nWe look Honda bearing and nurturing of children as part of God's Plan and the joy full and sacred duty of those given the power to participate in it in our view the ultimate treasures honors and do you have in our our children and our posterity\nTherefore we must teach and content for principles and practices that provide the best conditions for the development that happiness of children all chill\nFinally we are be loving children of a heavenly father who has taught us that male illness and female illness marriage between a man and a woman and the bearing a nurturing of children are all is central to his great plan of happiness\nOur positions on these fundamentals frequently provoke opposition to the church we consider that inevitable opposition is part of the plant\nAnd Satanist most strenuous opposition is directed at whatever is most important to God's Plan\nHe seeks to destroy God's work\nHis prime messages are to discredit the savior and his divine authority to erase the effects of the tone of Jesus Christ\nTo discourage repentance strip counterfeit rebels light revelation and to contradict individual
