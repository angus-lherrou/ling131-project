are just revved up now for you know valid reasons\nBut then say am I\nSpeaking out is enough and knocked going out to vote\nIt's interesting because we've seen these is turnout numbers are generally they they've been applying lately to presidential elections since two thousand\nWe've seen a massive jump in the amount of people who are really super passionate and paying attention at high levels to presidential campaigns that certainly what happened with rock Obama in two thousand eight and two thousand twelve\nAnd it's also I'm One of the things we've noticed is in the off years that doesn't happen all that much mid mid term elections do not seem to inspire particularly among Democrats recently the amount of passion\nOr that or has been coming from the right even remember two thousand tendency parties wave the biggest wave election in ... century basically she doesn't fourteen was also a little mini you know sort of Tea Party related wave\nA worthy candidates weren't maybe as much Tea Party but there was still pretty strong your yeah for Republicans are twenty fourteen in two thousand six he saw the opposite you saw Democrats are in the last years of the Bush administration had a really strong mid term in two thousand six but\nYou know generally speaking people aren't as passionate the numbers however for this midterm election or off the charts and it's interesting Glenn was pointing out before\nA show that were brought up on what was the sort of celebrity presidential candidate and he would have these huge rallies in two thousand eight and you remember the one in Denver

mid terms you had these huge turnout in the street\nBut no one was going to see the president in those stadiums in arenas they still with book the arena but I remember just stink bleak covering them saying\nTurn the camera around and they were half empty room\nYeah the passion was gone drawn into it we're not seeing that with Trump I mean there are these rallies seem to be as well attended as they were during the campaign is down ... sometimes more so right so there's no drop in the passion seemingly among Republicans in the same thing it seems to be happening with Democrats as much as it\nA is a positive\nFor a for Republicans keep those crowds one of the reasons why people are passionate ... because the other side so passionate and we're seeing what if you go through some of the mob stuff that's going on right now with Republicans but the numbers are interesting on\nUm and it's not low relative to normal which is our younger voters Eighteen and thirty four there at fifty one

ever done anything that's questionable in his life you're making excuses for his murder of course it's not\nIt's not no no it's different that's different that's that's the people who are tweeting and saying oh oh so he deserved today no no no no this is a horrible crime committed by a horrible state who is not our ally\nPerhaps we need them I don't know I don't like getting into these situations I

say ... shot and he did not deserve to die this way\nNobody deserves to die that that way\nHowever he's not the guy that everybody in the press is making him out to be he's not some freedom loving guy he's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood\nThe Muslim Brotherhood that he was pushing for was an Islamic state he wants an Islamic state in his own writing in the Washington Post\nSays yeah we have to have a an Islamic assist rule\nIf you dismiss as Islamic rule under surreal law then you'll never have peace in the middle east\nWell wait a minute I'm not against Islam I Am against Islamic rule

needs some adults in the room to say okay that's a separate issue but let's not paint to shockey into some freedom loving cringe because that's not true\nWe're currently fighting a proxy war with Saudi Arabia we are involved in their war in Yemen did you even know that\nPresident Trump announced a hundred and ten billion dollar arms deal with Saudi Arabia last year it was President Obama that vetoed a bill that allowed families of nine eleven victims to sue the Saudi Government\nSo\nBoth sides everybody is in protecting these guys when the crown prince came here to America he met with

Washington Post is he is he\nOr does he have a point of view that Washington happens to like about a a Saudi Arabia and that is the Muslim Brotherhood perspective\nSo you remember the Muslim Brotherhood founded in the Nineteen twenties in Egypt the only reason for being was to reject the west and establish global surreal law\nThey exported this organization all over the middle east anti Semitism towards a Jews their biggest and most effective tool at harnessing the Arab rage Muslim Brotherhood they're the ones who invented modern day jihadism\nThey are the ones who inspired Osama bin Laden and the other founding members of al ... to\nDo any administration a member from the Obama administration you cannot call them a largely secular organization when you read\nJust their motto Allah is our goal the profit our model the current our constitution jihad are planned and jets for the sake of all of the ... of our wishes they're not primarily a secular organization the Muslim Brotherhood of the calls jihad the industry of death\nAnd they mean that in a good way in their own words to a nation that protects the industry of death and which knows\nJeff for the sake of all of the law for the U.S of our wishes they're not primarily a secular organization the Muslim Brotherhood of the calls jihad the industry of\nDeath and they mean that in a good way in their own words to a nation that protects the industry of death and which knows how to die you know the league God gives proud life in this world okay that doesn't sound secular doesn't sound like somebody we should be in bed with\nWhat the Muslim Brotherhood ran up against a problem and that was one of them the kingdom of of Saudi Arabia\nBecause it was backed by the west any of these kingdoms in the middle East that have been backed by the west Jordan will be next anybody who stands in their way\nThey had to destroy but these were democracies so how are we going to do it well the Muslim Brotherhood decided to switch tactics and weaponize democracy enter the Arab Spring\nThe Arab Spring praise by everyone we told you their goal is a caliphate while it never materialized ... no no not there it materialized from the chain of events with ISIS\nWhat you were talking about the Muslim Brotherhood right and what happened to the Muslim Brotherhood did they just choose not to do a caliphate\nOh no no they were overthrown oh\nThe Muslim Brotherhood still wants their caliphate\nSo now you have two of our allies turkey Muslim Brotherhood the Saudis\nWhile hobbyists who are both Jay chasing the same exact dream a Middle East and the world dominated by surreal law both of them Ewing using jihadism as a as a means to their ...\nSo ... year 'cause show or whatever you're calling him today\nNow where you look at him he is he is a guy\nWho is a member of the Muslim Brotherhood I Want to say this no one deserves this kind of death this is not to excuse the Saudis they're bad guys\nBut so is turkey and so was he\nEverybody here all that's a Saudi progressive fighting for democracy no\nNo no no\nHe was fighting for the Muslim Brotherhood\nIn the Nineteen eighties and nineties he was one of the king's main allies he edited several Saudi newspapers which he was basically Winston Smith in Orwell's Nineteen eighty four sitting in the Saudi version of the ministry of truth editing editing out all thought crime\nMakes sure that there was never anything hostile said about ... or the king\nDuring this time he'd cozy up to Osama bin Laden he scored several interviews while al ... was fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan Saudi intelligence employed him to be the middleman between bin Laden and the Saudi royal family will in two thousand three he fell out of favor with the Saudi royals\nWhen he allowed to be published a an article critical to the ... hobbyists move and\nWhy did he do that ...\nBecause he's a member of the Muslim Brotherhood and they were at odds with the hobby is\nThe shah geared to show he was cast aside\nAnd that's when the western media fell in love with him an active\nMember of the Muslim Brotherhood not us smear or conspiracy theory in his own words yes I joined the Muslim Brotherhood organization and I was not alone\nAnd quote\nHis Muslim Brotherhood friends in clerics were all in prison in Saudi Arabia during the Arab Spring\nHe got out he came to the U.S\nHe established a political party while in exile called democracy for the Arab world now party\nThe liberals the progressives the press loved him because they heard the word democracy it's the Muslim Brotherhood plan to subvert democracy by turning it against\nItself he wants\nWanted to establish sure Rio law in the region\n\nHe was also a wicked anti Semite who wrote quote outside the context of history and logic the Jews will have to die by force\nOh\nIsrael's outside the context of history and logic and we're going to have to kill all of them\nThis is not a smear campaign when you hear somebody say that you make sure you ask them where are you doing your homework where are you getting that why is that a smear campaign\nTo say that he was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood he clearly was in his own words so why is that a smear campaign because I thought the Muslim Brotherhood was largely secular\nAsked people how much do you know about the caliphate how much do you know about the founding of the Muslim Brotherhood how much do you really know about what this man wrote this man wrote that he\n... it was a mistake to think\nThat you could have any kind of state in the middle east with out some form of Islam is this\n\nNow that's different remember then Islam\nAnd his ... believes you have to use sharia law that the ... wow it sounds like the mother Muslim Brotherhood that's our constitution that is our law should Rio law\nSo\nLet's just begin to tell each other the truth and here's the truth turkey is not a friend of ours turkey is in with the Muslim Brotherhood\nTurkey would like to have a caliphate run by them Saudi Arabia not good people Saudi Arabia huge exporter of ... and has done it here in the United states has spent money building mosques that are very dangerous here in the United states true\nThey kill him could be probably seems like it\nI don't trust the Muslim Brotherhood in Turkey but I also don't trust those guys one of them killed him probably Saudi Arabia did he deserve it no does he deserved to be called a freedom fighter\n[noise] only by either really on educated progressives\nDoes he deserved to be called a freedom
