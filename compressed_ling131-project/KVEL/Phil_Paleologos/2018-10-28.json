they can't talk properly\nBut imagine\nIf you lost your legal voice when it comes to speaking up against some government bullying that sometimes is just wrong\nAnd for instance I I think part of the governed bowling that's just wrong has to do with trying to force people to what little boys and little girls\nAnd people of all different ages together and the same showers and same bathrooms in school okay imagine this\nIn Decatur, Georgia there was a case where parents were actually stripped of their right to even protest on this transgender bathroom issue listen to this one Decatur parent\nWhen you send your daughter to school\nYou have a level of expectation that you're you're not going to be worried about you know they're not going to be you know expose the fucking that you're

to a president from using the word nationalist\nLook I I Will always a acknowledge there's a possibility that President Trump wasn't planning anything you didn't wasn't trying to do anything\nBut I think this comes down to a pretty well thought out and I think inappropriate and smart strategy for including the election campaign let me tell you why\nBecause right now he sees that the best chance for Republicans holding the house and gaining in the Senate both of which are goals\nIs to emphasize how far out of touch the Democrats have become that's why I think the Kavanaugh hearings were so important\nWhat the Kavanaugh hearing showed was that even for people who might have some doubts about president from than some of his character and his personality and this and that\nWhat you saw from the Democrats was just so infinitely worse and more hostile and more out of touch and showed such contempt for basic American Standards of of decency and due process and everything else I think that a a great horror of people on the Republican side\nSaid not that no and we have to come together and fight it and that's\nWhy this rhetoric about jobs not moms and that's also why the rhetoric about nationalism it seems to me\nI don't think there are many conservatives who are troubled by the idea of being a nationalist and let me explain to you there's a new book about nationalism by an Israeli writer named ... and it's it's worth considering because one of the points he makes\nIs that nationalism those pretty directly\nWith the idea of democracy because if you're talking about a nation state is your real try than the ideas and that's been very much the way it is in America is what patriotism means is that I find myself as an American and\nGoing back to a theater Roosevelt again in the new nationalism the whole idea was if you are an immigrant you drop the idea of carrying the flag of your former country you carry the American flag and your nationalism your tribal affiliation which you care about when we even give your heart to\nIs our nation not a race\nNot an ethnicity and the fact that\nThat there are so many people out there and the commentary and and so many Democrats who don't get that who are offended by the term nationalism I honestly don't think that's helping the Democratic side\nI think of anything it helps on\nThe conservative and Republican side by the way if you're one of those people just offended by the word nationalism\nGive me a call and tell me why\nOne eight hundred nine five five Seventeen Seventy six uh Michael in San Diego
