beginning with us from the beginning and work with us on the campaign has been really a long time very intense [noise]\nThat was presidents from this morning in a actually\nIt was a very reassuring a press availability and anyone who believes that there was some kind of secret the Trump desire to unseat Nikki Haley or whether she's planning to run against him she's not a as a matter of fact she made that extremely clear\nOr is she a presidential possibility for the future of of course he is is she just about the strongest Republican nominee one good thing go for a night for two thousand twenty four\nOr for two thousand and twenty for that matter\nYeah I think she is now she was a terrific governor of South Carolina we enjoyed having her on the show or she is a natural when it comes to politics and she handled the un job with so much dignity and class even when she had to work with Rex Tillerson\nWho was in an ideal partner for her as secretary of state the um uh she did a comment about this rumor that she's going to be challenging from for the nomination in two thousand twenty\nOf course that's ridiculous you won't and here is Nikki Haley making at about as close as clear as she possibly could\n\nThe south was enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to do the job so they seem to think\nAnd I will say this\nOn our on here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty\nI Can't promise you what are we doing it for that point so I look forward to supporting the front of him and I want to thank you for\nA President Trump said that so good and uh of course it is and it's appropriate look this doesn't mean that a Nikki Haley didn't have some disagreements with people in the Trump Administration she did a but she managed to work\nWith the president and apparently the president deserves all credit according to all observers for allowing Nikki Haley to do or job and it's very unusual for a un representative because look you're talking about such a corrupt organization\nBut she stood up for the country and did it with class and eloquence\nHere's President Trump this morning and and again this was a press availability where they both look comfortable and happy and like they genuinely liked each other or they were sitting in bright yellow chairs in ah the oval office and er here is what President Trump said about the first\nInkling he had that Nikki Haley would be leaving her job\nShe told me probably six months ago she said you know she said maybe at the end of the year the end of a two year period but the end of the year I Want to take a little time off or whether she's been a very successful you know governor of South Carolina for eight years\nAnd she um she did this and this is possibly\nYou leaving her job she told me probably six months ago she said you know she said maybe at the end of the year the end of a two year period for the end of the year I wanted to take a little time off a little winded she's been a very successful you know governor of South Carolina for eight years\nAnd then she uh she did this and this is possibly the more in tune with what's going on in the world is very dangerous and a lot of things [noise]\nBut she's a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together we solve a lot of problems or one of the process of solving a lot of problems so they just wanted to tell you that uh we will miss you will be speaking all the time but we will unless you never do is have you done a fantastic job but I Want to thank you very much [noise]\nOkay and uh then Nikki Haley talked about some of her sense of accomplishment she's completing\nHer first two years or her two years as UN ambassador\nAnd she's going to continue working there until January it's unclear what she's going to be doing after that there are some rumors we will get to those but here is Nikki Haley talking about the achievements that she sees in American foreign policy in the last two years\nMore than what has happened in two years with the United states on foreign policy now the United states does that\nMean I think that's\nWhat we did they know that if we think we're going to do something we fall when the president for that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it was NATO saying that other countries have to pay their share and it whether it's the type of what you have been amazing they\nDepend on that and they followed him like that but then if you look at things here is that the\nOne point three billion and the un I made a stronger who's made it more\nNow than we got an arms embargo which was a long time coming green\nNorth Korean sanctions um packages which was on line and generation down in a way that we can really work for the new colorizing North Korea and the Iran deal bringing attention to the world that every country needs ... can't overlook\nAll of a bad thing to do and do you have to see them for the threat that they are\nI think he will get the anti Israel violence and that Dr\n... said the president salad and moving the embassy and selling the rest of the world we have our embassy where we want to buy our and [noise]\nYou know all of those things have made a huge difference than us than that I can tell you that um [noise] he was a song again and he also strong in a way they should make American fearing perhaps\nI and this is I'm about as as strong case as you can make and none none of what she said can you argue it it's all the truth and yes she was part of it but all of this did happen under President Donald Trump\nAnd this is one of the reasons I suppose that on the CNN poll or despite the fact that there has been so much hysteria\nOn the left about Kevin on and the the various powers that are alleged to have been perpetrated by old white males led by Donald Trump\nThe President Trump actually saw his approval rating rising look as far as Nikki Haley is concerned there's a lot of talk about her replacement and some of the top that is most inflammatory is the idea that the president is going to appoint his daughter Yvonne ...\nWhy would that make any sense ... has\nTraveled around the world as she speaks very well she has dynamic she certainly would have the president's confidence\nThat she will also be a terrible choice because it would be very easy for
