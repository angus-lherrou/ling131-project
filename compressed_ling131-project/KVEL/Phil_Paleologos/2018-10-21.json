and by professor Arthur Laffer a Steve congratulations on the book and it's very well time\nAh Iraq over like thanks so much for the nice guy words that a lot of fun writing it you know with with my buddy art Laffer it was really just kind of first hand account of when we started working with Donald Trump back in a early to thousands sixteen ...\nAnd and I do think a lot of people including me a reading some of your personal descriptions of coming into Trump's office in the way he interacts with people\nIt's reassuring it's it's sort of different portrayal than what you get in mainstream media yesterday everybody in the in the press and you of course have been one of President Trump's economic advisors since the campaign\nBut uh people are fixated on this alleged shouting match between John Bolton and and um and John Kelly the White House chief of staff\nAnd are they all these stories of White House chaos that's not what you see at least that's what you indicate in the book\nBut Trump is a person who likes to actually have differing views at the table you know so we used to have arguments all the time I mean I like them I mean I like Donald Trump a lot personally is a is a fun person to be around he's actually can very gracious these very charming\nOr attempted or he would like to put two or three people on the table and district ... disagreeing positions you know are we Duke it out many\nSort of make up his mind which I think is a good thing that's what a businessman does ah so you know so what if they're shouting at each other you know he wants to have a ... he doesn't want to be surrounded by bus yes not and and I think that's a that's a good thing\nOr about Donald Trump but you know I'll correct you on just one thing is that Michael when you said that I I kind of it's coming along what I did I think you're under stadium is I this is a full fledged boom or on right now you know as you know I was out in Seattle what about a month ago when I was in your studio and I was you know by the river from Portland, Oregon Portland Maine in ... in between\nAnd everywhere I go I'll I see is you know I saw this in Seattle I thought when I see it San Francisco I see it you know Nashville, Tennessee in Denver, Colorado and uh you know Austin, Texas everywhere just a\nFriend's everywhere buildings going up skyscrapers factories warehouses biggest construction boom in history this country is going on right now everybody's so bullish on America they want to build a lot of it as foreign investment money that's coming in\nTo the United states we have what you know every time I Do your show I liked the you know I'm really cite another statistic uh first of all we got the\nIndustrial production numbers came out there like the highest ever and then we the the seven point one million you know the statistics seven point one million more jobs than Americans to fill them that's amazing\nAnd that's part of the problem we have right now with all of these people streaming\nToward the border and that caravan of let me let me go to one of the oil and I just interrupt you for one sure\nIt's interesting you brought that up I was watching CNN Today and they were saying um that the number of people crossing the border illegally has actually increased in under Donald\nTrump ally ally ...\nAnd I you know and they and they were showing the statistics and by the way the number of people cross the border under Obama what way way way way out but you know why that was right\nYeah because people didn't get jobs\nExactly there were no traps yes so\nThe real reliable cure to illegal immigration is basically a lousy economy\nExactly you know actually when we had the terrible recession more people left the United states that came in the United states so you know this was almost a sign of prosperity that people from around the world want to come here because there's a lot of economic opportunity\nAnd um that the number of people crossing the border illegally has actually increased in under Donald\nTrump a lot a lot\nAnd I you know and they and they were showing the statistics and by the way the number of people cross the border under Obama went way way way way out but she knows that why that was right\nYeah because people didn't get jobs\nExactly there were no traps year yeah so they get them off\nThe rails reliable cure to illegal immigration is basically a lousy economy\nExactly you know actually when we had the terrible recession more people left the United states that came into the United states so you know this was almost a sign of prosperity that people from around the world want to come here because there's a lot of economic opportunity but they never connected the dots on CNN on that you know\nUh but they but there's a sign that in my incidentally you and I agree and that we need a lot more legal immigrants in this country we need more\nPeople in the farm farm workers and we need more service workers and we knew him reading more technology workers and and I used to tell Donald Trump I've told you this you know it and it's in the book we say through build that wall Donald make sure it has big gate so people can come in legally\nOr the book is called Trump's ... inside of the America First plan to revive our economy but you don't believe that President Trump should allow this a ... a caravan from Honduras which is marching forward with Hondurans lags by the way that they should allow the caravan into the country do you\nUh you know I'm actually watching on the on the screen I'm watching CNN as we thought a and I'm I'm watching all these people are you know a lot you know there has to be out there has to be some orderly\nAbsolutely right yeah yeah and and then we we are absolutely agree on that let me let me go back to to one thing that the Democrats have been lying about and they literally lie about this every day and the media never call them on it\nThey claim that the tax cuts that you helped to write and help to design that those tax cuts that have been passed have caused this exploding budget deficit because they've reduced revenues that's just a flat on line isn't it\nYeah that revenues are actually out that this year so we passed the biggest tax cuts and three years and we actually have a slight increase rap is not what I Would like to see revenues higher and I think by the way as we get you know as we continue to see this economy\nOr continue to grow you you know the best way to get tax revenues and put people in the work at ... businesses profitable businesses back to the United states which is happening uh but yeah like the problem is spending and you know people I say oh you're just a rival Republican I'm not a rubber Republican the Republicans\nAnd Democrats this bipartisan spending spree that's going on my caller both parties deserve a lot of blame for that\nYou like a President Trump's a idea a vast along every department at five percent yes\nI Love that you know that's what businesses do you\nKnow that that's the thing if you're running a business\nAnd you don't have enough money coming in and your expenditures are too high you got to go to your agency and this is what businesses did during the recession they talked in their stomach\nThey tighten their belts they got rid of an efficient workers and inefficient services and things they didn't need and they save money and they became profitable getting we never do that in government and by the way I Would like us here one listener\nOf your show Paul and the
