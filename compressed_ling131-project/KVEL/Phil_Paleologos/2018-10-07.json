a great day to confront a great\nQuestion of all of our presidents of the United states which one counts as the most fascinating the most impressive the most compelling\nAnd the most in theory I think there is general consensus that would be Lincoln I mean basically no one like Lincoln and all of our history but who would be in second place and we will leave out the current incumbent President Trump because as of this telling his presidency is still unfolding\nIt would be another president who was up there on Russia more unknowns not\nWashington who is so great that he seems in approachable and almost like a statue and no not Jefferson with his complexities and as many flaws it would be that fourth Russia more presidents president we celebrate today\nThat would be Theodore Roosevelt the all American Boy\n[noise]\nAnd then use it that you're hearing [noise] it'll be a hard time in the old town tonight [noise] was used by Theodore Roosevelt as something of a theme song why because it was used for his regimen some rough riders before they went\nTo Cuba and the Spanish American war then played virtually every rally until he got rather sick of it while he was running for governor of New York in Eighteen Ninety eight before he became president of course and I I Need to answer a couple of questions the very beginning\nFirst of all the idea that I call him Theodore Roosevelt\nAnd uh not Teddy Roosevelt as he's often no well that's because President Roosevelt always lose to the name teddy when he was a tiny boy he was called cheating and he didn't like it and he never like being called teddy and he was declared\nAnyone who calls me and he doesn't know me at all\nAnd I certainly hope that by the end of this broadcast you will know President Theodore Roosevelt well there's also great confusion about the pronunciation of his name\nThere are people who say Roosevelt and they will say Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin Roosevelt than there are other people say no no they know that Franklin said Roosevelt because we have all kinds of recordings of him saying it but they'll say Theodore Roosevelt\nHe always said Roosevelt he very clearly did\nAnd I have become friends with President Roosevelt great granddaughter in other words her a grandmother was President Roosevelt delivered\nAnd I asked her is there any doubt at all that everyone in your family says Roosevelt she says no it's Roosevelt stop with the Roosevelt and then the last question about the title of this very special broadcast on the Michael Medvedev show pulling him the all American Boy\nEvery year

Princeton [noise]\nWho led us into the twentieth century which has been called the American century certainly Theodore Roosevelt would have appreciated that designation this special broadcast Theodore Roosevelt the all American Boy\nHe did finally with his father's help overcome the limitations of the asthma that almost killed him before the age of three but in a Eighteen Seventy two when\nRoosevelt was still only Thirteen\nHis father told and sickness is always a shame and often send\nYou must make your body and he was determined to do that one of the ways that he did it was traveling with his family and traveling in the saddle he loved riding he loved hunting his father gave him a gun pleased\nTo meet in this context his name is Justin Walker he's a law professor at the University of Louisville and he was a law clerk both for Anthony Kennedy and for the uh appellate court judge who God willing will be replacing Anthony Kennedy\nA judge Kavanaugh 'em and professor Walker thanks very much for joining us\nVery much for having me on the show\nAnd it's it's a real pleasure and I I Know that you actually you first met a judge Kavanaugh when he was teaching at Harvard law school where you are a student right that's right\nAnd if you look back can you think what was the most horrifying incident of uncontrolled rage that you ever saw from Brett capital\n[noise] well you know Michael I it I get the joke but on the other hand I think you know it it would be funny if this whole ... ridiculous vicious search and destroy process or weren't so tragic um you know I I took him for class and I worked with them every day in chambers for a year\nUm his students included men and women across the ideological spectrum you treat all of them with a with dignity and respect his his temperament has just as has just\nAlways been impeccable and that's what the lawyers who come before him um have said over and over and over again and again across the ideological spectrum\nNow as a as a law clerk you saw him a virtually every day right yes and um what about these these charges of alcohol abuse or did you ah ever see judge Kavanaugh showing the signs of any kind of alcoholic impairments\n[noise] Michael I absolutely not a hundred a hundred percent a hundred percent not you know there there are some accusations that had been made that you know I understand how some of his critics might say well ... will never ... you know they think they'll never ... I Believe I Know the truth but they think about you\nBut these accusations about things that he's done and how what\nAbout you know the notion that it was an open secret when he was in high school college that he was wild and crazy um if this was an open secret and all of his friends all of its queens is the time would have known about\nA and instead it's quite the opposite the people who know him best\nDozens scores of people high school college\nOver and over again said he was he he was he was not while he was not crazy he was one of the more responsible high school students college students are and and the description of him that in painted by a few uh you know outliers audio next room mate who you know hasn't you know that yeah they had a falling out or something\nOr is it just not sure\nI I think that uh Lindsey Graham has come up with a perhaps a a solution about the one kind of\nTest of a judge Kavanaugh that might satisfy the Democrats and um I Want to think as as a a professor of law now and somebody who is very well schools and constitutional law whether you think that a\nSenator Graham's suggestion would be a violation of the eighth amendment prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment here is to grant\n[noise]\nToss it mainly as a bottom well why don't we don't want to say\nOkay what he says why don't we dumped him in water and see if the slow so good old medieval trial by ordeal but do you think\nOr straight out of my python and the holy grail a and a you know I Do I I I think that this process has been really unfair to the judge Kavanaugh and also the doctor\nI don't want nothing to say\nOkay what he says why don't we dumped him in water and see if the floats in good old medieval trial by ordeal what do you think\nOf straight out of my python and the holy grail a\nAnd a you know I Do I I I think that this process has been really unfair that the judge Kavanaugh and also the doctor for I think that they have both been used by Democrats on the Senate committee or for political purposes\nOr their strategy all along has not been to try to find the truth which is a slap in the face the doctor for their ... their their strategy all along has been\nTo do whatever they have to do by any means necessary it delays for the sake\nOf delay and I think that strategy has been Trump's parents it goes back to you know housing years ago we were talking about whether or not a million documents with enough or whether it needed to be two million documents it was delayed for the sake of the way\nThat explains why her letter was not investigated in July when it was received and it was only leaked to the press against our will on the eve of judge Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation so for the Democrats talk about um temperament for them to talk about credibility\nUm [noise] you know it's it takes takes a lot of gumption when it comes to credibility judge Kavanaugh's lay out\nWhat if you were speaking to judge Kavanaugh I I Do believe he will be confirmed on Saturday probably with fifty one votes and maybe with fifty votes who knows it could be fifty to\nA but it will be confirmed and what would you advise him uh in order to to rise above and and prevail and become the great associate justice and the Supreme Court that we both know we will be\nWell I I'm not going to be presented to us and not enough to to I think that you need my advice but I'll I'll say that\nUh we saw his judicial temperament and hasn't packet of a pack of all legal mind for twelve years and the DC circuit when he was vindicated by the Supreme Court and unparalleled Thirteen ties and we also saw in the last confirmation hearing\nThat he was outraged about an outrageous process as well he should be and I have confidence that wants to use on the bench spring caught hopefully he will be that we will see the judicial temperament that we saw for the past twelve years we don't have to guess about what kind of judge Brett Kavanaugh will be it'll be the same kind of jak cheap and for\nThe past twelve years so I'm looking for that I share your cautious optimism I understand that you know it's it ... the process so farcical at times that they leave itself it lends itself to jokes but but I Do want to really you know he's serious that the people have been hurt by Kavanaugh has been hurt\nHis family doctor Ford they've all received death threats this process going\nAnd how do we think that ... and that's the last question or that will have time for testing Walker professor of law how he fits the process\nOf making [laughter] um you know I I'm just do a ... a as we were talking earlier went to Harvard yeah the Yale degree and I'm going to trust you might call to\nTo have the answers to the big picture questions more than we just learned Phil procedure at Yale I've heard that they they really learn how to solve the world's problems\nWell again this is a a gigantic problem and I want to get to that and get to that with listeners because clearly this process is broken I mean everybody hates and this has not been a good moment for America\nLet me tell you one thing and I'm going to tell you this as soon as we come back from Ray I think one thing that every single American can do to help makes this process and to stop this madness for the future what is it will get to that coming up in just a moment on them and that you\nIt
