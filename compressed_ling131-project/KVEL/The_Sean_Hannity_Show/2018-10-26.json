pollster founder of McLaughlin associates\nA John McLaughlin is with us Doug shown pollster author Fox who delivered lentil is a he joined us as well a John McLaughlin you'd think things are looking good for the Republicans in the Senate or you'd think the house is still attainable for the Republicans that they can come back\nIt's still obtainable but it's difficult because uh you have you have just over a week to go\nAnd we have a national poll it's up on our website um McLaughlin online dot com where the Republicans are within range of the Democrats where the Democrats on the generic folks have a forty six percent of the vote for the Republicans have forty four percent and you've got ten percent undecided and just like\nTwo years ago we always said there was a hidden vote\nFor Trump because we knew we were bringing in millions of new voters and we knew those voters that were undecided didn't like Hillary Clinton they say they want to change and they didn't like her corruption well now the ones who are undecided our latest national poll forty nine to twenty seven they say the countries on the wrong track\nBasically two more years like we've had and that is endless you know

doesn't pay his taxes he's an idiot Colin Powell said it best he's a national disaster he's an embarrassment to this country\nIt makes me so angry that this country has gotten to this point that this fool disposal has wound up where he has\nI'd like to punch him in the face\nI guess I'm not supposed to talk about that John\nI Know it but you know what I like some people are hoping that\nAfter this election it all goes away it's not going to go away what this is about is Donald Trump is a historic president and the reason and he's a historic president is he's not from the establishment he beat the Republican establishment he beat the national establishment he's there he's not\nHe's not only draining the swamp but he's a threat to their very existence so it's going to happen is\nThe presidential race is going to start\nRight after the election November such where the Democrats are going to put up a big field of people who are going to be all at the president and if they get the house and Nancy Pelosi the speaker it's all of them beating Donald Trump so this race November six is not just about control the Congress it's really about\nThe what the Democrats are doing to get rid of Donald Trump what the establishment is doing to get rid of Donald Trump and the sixty three million Trump voters\nAnd meanwhile Pennsylvania's economy is growing up because they are now ... securing the prosperity of natural gas that exist in their state and we can be doing the same thing up in your area and we don't do it\nYeah actually we call it the Berlin Wall my district goes into Binghamton Broome county which is on the border\nOf Pennsylvania and you see the stark difference between the southern tier which has watched so many jobs this is where IBM was actually founded now we've lost it thanks to the policies of the Democrats in poverty that have just strangled our economy\nWe're actually seeing an uptick I have a small business owner and this district our family business would start in Nineteen forty six\nAnd I've been around the district I've seen I've traveled to fifty or Seventy five businesses\nI have yet to meet one that hasn't uh praised us for tax reform and they're saying we're actually these tax cuts are we're re investing every one of them is giving a race to their employees or a bonus or both we're finally seeing a glimmer of hope we've rolled back on necessary regulation\nOr we can really open up the southern chaired a responsible gas drilling\nGovernor Cuomo votes you know will not let it happen my opponent repeatedly thoughts against that and this is how scary my opponent as we get into the fate last night he hasn't voted four times for government takeover\nOf our health care which is single payer which could cost the taxpayers of New York this was bragged about by the socialist meeting guy who's just sponsored the bill will only cost the taxpayers of New York Ninety two billion in New taxes on an annual basis\nIt would be cool [laughter] that's it I Do believe that the Ninety two billion when we're already take half your money anyway a credible any landed on\n... this is a solution not\nVoted four times for late term abortion this isn't a moderate you this is a radical you this is a guy who is trying to pretend he is that I support the president he's not going to support the president he's going to support Nancy Pelosi is going to support the impeachment cock his he's going to try and write and with all these Democrats you never shown any heart attack on\nHe's never stood up to Sheldon Silver in fact he was picked by Sheldon Silver for the job to get in the assembly now we can't take by Chuck Schumer\nWho brags about it and Andrew Cuomo funny neither of them have come to the district to help him get elected but you know who came to our district President Trump the first time in my home city of Utica New York in ... years we had a sitting president ...\nWell you also had a son Eric I'm there and his daughter a bunker up there they recognize the importance of your race and that's why they are having you on\nThis and the only thing I can say is to the the people up in the ... area in northern New York in that area you this was a district that you can win it's plus a Republican and you have about thirty thousand more Republicans and Democrats in the district\nSo you have a political edge there the key is to get the vote out because otherwise you're going to end up with a Nancy Pelosi Democrat Nancy Pelosi as speaker and that's going to be a disaster for New York I can promise you\nYeah absolutely and by the way they are raising incredible amounts of money I've been talking to my colleagues all across the country the amount of money they're jumping introduced racist to try to deceive voters Israeli it's outrageous and me and my opponent star outspending me I've always been a very independent Republican I'm One of the top conservatives in New York\nUh when I served in the assembly and still you know one of the top conservatives\nBut we have got to continue to stand up for our values and be able to witness elections to fight the fight because we've got a ticket to Washington we gotta support the president's policies which are creating unprecedented gains even an upstate New York where we have a really tough economy I mean we are actually helping her small business community are small business humidity\nAbout Ninety eight percent of my life the businesses in my region and they create most of the jobs that didn't help this live by Nancy Pelosi that somehow the wealthiest are the only one benefiting it's absolutely false we voted to make the tax cuts permanent and the reason Governor Cuomo is suing the federal government over the tax cuts\nIt because his wealthy donors\nWanna leave New York because they're not getting the lifeline that they used to get\nActually paying more it's all a lie coming from that side and we've got to fight it says this is a tough battle because the Democrats have the money\nTo deceive voters and fool them into think even if this guy is somehow a moderate he's not and I encourage everyone to support us get to vote out its most important we can beat the wall money but we need a Republican voters to understanding each pick it up\nThey're actually paying more it's all a lie coming from that side and we've got to fight it says it this is a tough battle because\nThe Democrats have the money to deceive voters are full of them into thinking that this guy is somehow a moderate and I encourage everyone to support us get out of its most important we can beat the money for Republican voters to understand the ticket really really poor\nAlright uh Claudia Tenney are running in New York and unimportant seat this will tip the balance of power one of our thirty seats we've identified on Hannity dot com\nAs the main you know ground zero seats that will do that will literally tip the balance of power so Claudia we wish you the best things for being with us and uh hopefully we'll be sending you back to Congress in eleven days you deserve it and New York deserves it we don't have many good New York politicians at all\nUm by the way just going back to direct or re what he said earlier today a they have confirmed that these Thirteen bombs were in fact real and that in fact they've been able to identify at least some forensic evidence including fingerprints\nWhich which to directly connected to the person that was arrested earlier today or more about that as the day unfolds here uh let's get to our phones as we say Hi to Danny is in Austin, Texas Danny Hi how are you glad you called sir\nYes listening to you I eat a lot and I have not been any political sense whatsoever but these Mitt terms are on leave me in court to get out and about\nA ... and you see it on an everyday I listen to a and not watch or not but I Am I'm\nListening I Hope everyone feels the same way you do this for a hundred and thirty five members of Congress every seat is important you vote for a Democrat you're voting for policy you stay home it's a half a vote for ... in the Senate if you stay home I have a vote for sure if you don't vote for the Republican\nThen you're basically voting for sure I mean it's really not that simple and we'll get the government we deserve I've been at this game a long time I've had a lot of victories I kind of loved when we shocked the world in the media\nYou know I see three scenarios that could unfold\nBut I had to say the more likely scenario based on my full objective analysis it would be a split decision whether Republicans pick up houses of pick up seats in the Senate and\nMaybe lose the house of representatives but the house of representatives as well within our power to win if people identified the thirty districts we've identified on Hannity dot com and people take it seriously and get out and vote\nI mean if every Trump voter once the success of the last two years to continue and goes to vote Republican in eleven days then that means we'll keep the house will pick up seats in the Senate and things will be a lot easier in the work will be getting done faster\nIf we don't do that then you know we get the government we deserve\nYou know I've had many ups and downs following political races in the course of my career wasn't exactly happy the two nights that Obama won especially thought he could have been defeated in twenty twelve alright it didn't happen and you do everything it can to stop the agenda on their side I'm prepared for whatever Nancy\nPelosi an Adam Schiff a Jerrold Nadler and Maxine Waters want to do to the country and we're not going to go away we're not going to cry when not going to be cry babies like they've been for the last two years and when they try to do things that are detrimental to the country and the president and they want to enlist investigations were going to be there\nAs a backstop to tell the American people the truth\nAnd then some of you will probably regret that you didn't get out and vote this you know election season so don't wait I'm telling you what's gonna happen\nWe know they only want Obamacare we know they want to open borders they don't want to fund the wall they believe in open borders\nSanctuary cities sanctuary states we know they want their crumbs back you know they want higher taxes we\nKnow they you know they don't they don't really ... they're all things hating Trump all\nThe time not exactly in the best interest of the country that keep focused on that for two years but we'll do our best\nYou know or we can win at all or we can lose it all listen all of us\nHere on the Sean Hannity show we love the dollar shave club dot com slash Hannity and you don't
