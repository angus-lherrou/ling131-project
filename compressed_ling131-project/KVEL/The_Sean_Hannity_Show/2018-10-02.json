know the search ... character assassination\nYou know character blood thinning machine\nYou got to watch judge Kavanaugh last week you know the witnesses to profess support mentioned dope corroborate her story\nYou know that the New York times that that Mrs Ramirez was calling others not sure if it was Brett Kavanaugh at was asking them if they remembered and then you saw what happened\nThat had been shut out of Canada because we had an unfair deal us drug companies have ten years to sell their name brand products and Canada before they go generic well that's up two years that's billions of dollars in many cases\nThere's no increase protections on intellectual property there are no changes in US Steel and aluminum tariffs and the deal preserves a trade dispute settlement mechanism that Canada fought hard to maintain to protect the lumber industry and other sectors guess what a better deal better deals don't happen unless you demand better deals\nLike record low unemployment doesn't happen by accident you got to cut taxes and you gotta and burdensome regulation\nAmerica can never be energy independent unless you're open Anwar unless you get rid of burdensome regulations on the coal industry and and the natural gas industry and you allow drilling and you allow the building a pipeline all of which the president has done\nBut nobody in the media talks about it because it's Russia Russia Russia stormy stormy stormy Coby Coby ... told me you know Michael Cohn it and Paul Manafort it's Robert Mueller Andrew Weissmann\nIs what the country's been talking about thirty five days you get to change all of this\nEvery bit of it now we have the senator from Hawaii ... men to shut up now she wants the FBI to investigate and ice throwing incident at a college bar you gotta be kidding me\nWhen he was in you know a young guy and yell and that apparently there was a former classmate said he threw ice at a party at somebody I let me tell you what's going to happen\nThis week Mitch McConnell and the Senate leadership most of which I don't have a lot of respect for but\nThey have been good on this I think they've handled properly with the seriousness of deserves and also the resolve that and the justice has also occurred here we'll see what senator snowflake who's running for president yesterday in Massachusetts has to do and say about it\nMcConnell saying earlier today that he wants to vote this week in the Senate now for that to happen Jamie do pre reminds us the majority leader must file cloture by Wednesday that's tomorrow will be here tomorrow in the nation's capital in order to force a final vote by Saturday otherwise\nYou vote wouldn't officially be this week I'm so for example if the cloture vote\nIs if you file cloture on Wednesday the final votes on Saturday\nIf you filed on Thursday it's on Sunday violet on friday the vote would be next Monday if you file cloture on Saturday It's Tuesday depending on when the FBI report comes in so that's going to be wide open and whether or not\nThe three Republican senators go along with endless investigations is ultimately I guess going to be up to them\nLindsey Graham who's going to join us later was on Hannity last night and I thought he had a pretty good idea I said you know what we can turn this whole election and thirty five days into a referendum on Brecht capital\nWhat would happen if something really weird did occur and where one vote short here's what I Would tell the press\nThat would appeal the verdict of the Senate to the ballot box [noise] this good man should not be destroyed [noise] saw a few legitimize this process by one vote short ... onto the next person I hate to be the next person\nHappen if something really weird did occur and where one vote short here's what I Would tell the press\nThat would appeal the verdict of the Senate to the ballot box [noise]\nThis good man should not be destroyed [noise] saw a few legitimize this process by one vote short ... onto the next person I'd hate to be the next person nominated would feel horrible that we destroyed cabin off someone would I Do\nI Would nominate him and I would take this case\nTo the American faithful and ask voters in Indiana\nAnd Missouri and North Dakota and other places for Trump once saying who was nominated to got to be president and see if they are loaders won't to appeal the verdict of their senator so if you were saying you fall ... votes short here saying how would appeal the case of the American people\nOkay I you know what at this point and thirty five days let me tell you what's at stake everything that I've been telling you about why I've been saying this for six months or longer now this is the most important mid term\nElection in our lifetime if you like the progress that I just described to you then\nIt's going to happen by the way Donald Trump this just went up on and ran on the Drudge Report Trump gain millions from questionable tax strategies according to the New York times I guess they are getting off I guess maybe they think they're losing the vote on judge Kavanaugh so President Trump participated in questionable tax\nStrategy is in the Nineteen nineties\nAnd allowed him to recruit millions of dollars in additional wealth from his father's real estate empire according to the New York times newspaper reported that Trump and his siblings set up a sham corporation to help this guy's otherwise taxable income that came from gifts from their parents\nOkay the IRS has been investigating him I guess for most of his adult life you know so I Will big shock there\nBut this is what's at stake you want you want to go back because this is the endless investigation and do you want to reward the party of slander and blood Jimmy\n'cause that's the Democratic party you know thinking this five weeks from tonight you're going to tune in to the news\nMidterms big election night big coverage all the networks\nYou have the opportunity to shock the world again if you remember they never thought Donald Trump could when they never believed that can happen now imagine you there are two things that are going to happen\nOn election night five weeks from now one is you're going to turn on your TV set and you're going to see a bunch of getting liberals\nHappy to announce that Nancy Pelosi will be the next speaker of the house and maybe even Senator Chuck Schumer the liberal from New York is going to be the Senate majority leader or you can tune in and watch the results come in\nAnd they have to announce that the U.S house of representatives remains in control of the Republicans\nAnd that the Republicans have picked up two three four five seats in the United States Senate which would render by the way Collins Murkowski and snowflake irrelevant\nAnd that even if they stopped Brett Kavanaugh he could be re nominated\nAnd next time he would get a vote\nUp or down and he would become a Supreme Court justice in spite of the slander and the mirrors and everything else and all of those anchors that had been for two years trying to destroy the president as an extension of all things Democrat you could see them\nSpiral into their state of shock\nAnd denial and depression again\nThat's not going to stop them they're just going to ratchet up the next day Donald Trump should be arrested for tax fraud Donald Trump Stormy Daniels ah Russia wants to go back to Russia let's investigate someone else's taxes from Thirty years ago with their loan applications from Thirty years ago\nYou have the power and the ability to do all of that five weeks from tonight\nYou get to decide what kind of TV you get to watch one of the the media crumble want to see them sad want to see a media freak out want to see CNN acres you know talking about white lashes again and all the other insane commentary that happened\nLet me tell you the races the states you all know what district you live in because this was a smart audience we have a map up on Hannity dot com that we're we've been putting up well updated this week we're going to put up to Seventy big race us we're going to let you look at them\nAnd if it happens to be your congressional district you might want to plan on voting five weeks from today if you live in Florida\nRick Scott has been a great governor and he's not responsible for the red tide um and of course Rhonda saying this would make a great governor there if you live in Indiana Joe Donnelly\nYou know what we can do better than Joe Donnelly supporting\nChuck Schumer if you live in North Dakota Heidi Heitkamp we can do better than Heidi Heitkamp supporting everything Schumer if you live in West Virginia you can do better than Joe mansion\nMostly supporting everything Schumer if you live in Missouri You can do better than Claire McCaskill\nSupporting pretty much everything Schumer and I know I'm ... and ... you know Martha ... Sally out in\nShe was a total rock star in Arizona served her country I guess her opponent was out there protesting you know part of the resistance and the same thing Dean Heller in Nevada another important race\nYou know all these races matter it's in your hands if you want the success because this is what you'll get with the Democrats\nThe party of smearing slander will be rewarded they will take their crumbs back they will have endless nonstop never ending Trump investigations they will try to impeach him they will", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Vernal", "day": "02"}
