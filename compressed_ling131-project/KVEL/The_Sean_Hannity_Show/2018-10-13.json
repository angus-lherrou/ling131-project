apologies Dr Sebastian Gorka is with us or how are you my friend this book is a must read for everybody and how are you going to see him\nVery excited show and thanks for having me or I didn't think uh this title would be as appropriate as it is all through last Seventy two hours but man we are in a fight right now for the future of the republic\nIt is a fight for the future of the republic the one thing I Love about you and I've come to know you very well is that you are patriot\nAnd you understand evil in our time evil abroad that need to defend and keep America strong and you understand the political aspects of it as well because if you elect their own people and when you got to have policies of appeasement again in that renders us more vulnerable\nJust look at the last eight years what do we have we had a commander in chief who started his presidency with an apology tour and then he blamed all the bad things in the world on America what resulted the rise of ISIS Russia invading its neighbor Chinese Chinese re militarized ...\nOf the end of the Obama administration just one metric pick take politics out of it for a second\nWe had sixty five million refugees in the world that's more than we had at the end of World War two when you don't have American leadership the world is the most dangerous place now that's over thanks to Donald Trump now we have a commander in chief who believes that even exists read his wall so speech\nListen to what he says about ISIS about what the Chinese are doing what he said at the un line yes\nAbsolutely absolutely so that's why I wrote why we fight but but you're absolutely correct we have domestic issues here even exist not just outside of our borders look what they did to the godly man Brett Kavanaugh in the last fourteen days a man who\nHad the probably the cleanest most spotless record in an American public life goes from being\nA stand up standing federal judge to amass rapist they will use every tool because they lost the election and that's why the next thirty days are so important showing\nIt means ah everything and good luck everything's riding on this I don't know if you would have asked me three weeks ago I Would have leaned in on the side that history would would win out because the party that wins the White House\nUsually ends up losing seats in a midterm election that totally not happened three times only probably picked up seats three times in the last hundred years the last was after two thousand and one an attack die on number eleven September eleventh\nUm but there's so much at stake here and that is what literally jumps off the pages I'm reading through your book that we'd better defeat Americans enemies\nAnd we'd better do without apologies tactic orca we don't get to do that if we're not in power right\nWe we have to take very seriously this concept of the left so the left has been taken over by the radicals thinking about the fact that JFK would not be allowed into the Democrat Party today a hardcore anti communist strong on national security\nHe wouldn't be allowed into the DNC what do we have we have the crazies we have the capacity\nOf course has is we have the Maxine Waters and control who have made a pact with the devil may have said very simply\nThe ends justify the means we want power and we will use any tool well guess who use that philosophy in the past that philosophy drives to the labor camps to drive to the ... drives to death camps whether you are right wing extremists whether you're a fascist or whether you're a communist that's the philosophy\nAnd we've got to stop that shall we have to stay true to the principles of the republic you\nTalk it in a book about a will to winter and and again the title why we fight defeating America's enemies with no apologies and here's what we can't have any more and you talk about the will to when you talk about will\nIs if you go back to Vietnam we lost fifty eight thousand brave Americans and we allow that war to become politicized it is and we pulled out yeah in Iraq and Afghanistan\nWe pull out leaving it dates of our withdrawal and we lost nearly six thousand kids in the end so many others comeback without their arms and legs in their in their faces\nJust figured fighting for their country we cannot commit American troops ever again unless we are willing to win the war if we're not willing to do what it takes to win the war than we are not get involved ever period unless we have to\nYou have to win these wars or else don't start to be involved in them\nSo so my book is about two things it's about all the threats we face of the country so whether it's ISIS Russia or China\nBut the second part is much more important is is the one you're hitting on it do we have the will to defeat our enemies because Vietnam is a great example we were the most powerful nation in the world and a bunch of guys with wooden sticks and rusty rifles defeat us\nHow's that possible because we lost the war at home because we allowed the left to undermine our will to win\nAnd and one of the most important things is the individual real to win in addition to the the ... of the threats\nI have full vignettes of American heroes I go back to the bombing was two hundred years ago I talk about a Korean hero adjusted pulled her talking about a man who spent six and a half years as a naval aviator in the Hanoi Hilton but the last story is very very important for what we are seeing right now and it's wicked chambers\nMost kids have no idea who would occur chamber this\nThis is a man who was Kevin old before Kavanaugh was born in Nineteen forty eight the\nFirst live televised Senate hearings was a man who would it could chambers who have been a communist agent of the Soviets who went on record saying\nHey I'm no longer communist but I Need America to know where the communist oh in the government including algae his he was a guy who was working for the Soviets what happened to this man who stood up for the truth\nThey accused him of everything cheating on his wife ... of of the death of being responsible for the death of his brother none of it was true but what did he do he had the will to fight\nHe stood out for the truth justice justice Kavanaugh will have the social and his his his his a scary thing the Democrats have done this before don't be surprised at what they did to Capitol they've done it seven eight years ago\nI they have done it every election in my lifetime they play the race card the jet rye or you know they divide America old versus young rich versus poor black versus white this is the identity mastered and I keep playing them in their own words it's not like I'm making it up\nQuick break we'll come back more with Dr
