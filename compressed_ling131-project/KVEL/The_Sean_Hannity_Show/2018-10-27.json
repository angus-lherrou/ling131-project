swabs and if you want to white and your teeth on average two shades and five minutes and six shades in seven days been tried power\nTo include you know truthful I was deployed over there I've told this story it before but we would\nTo include you know troops well I was deployed over there I've told this story before but we would at Bagram Air force base when I was a commander\nOr we would you know we would get out there as soon as we heard a firefight was going on and we'd be overhead to protect them and are eight ten but often times uh you know the the the firefights happened before we could get there and Americans lost their lives\nAnd as we would we would line up on the taxi way as the cat the flag draped casket would come through and there's ... there's a silence there and everyone is leading giving our final salute to these American heroes\nWho perished over there fighting the Taliban and their affiliates\nAnd for her to be able to say that she's OK with an American going to join the Taliban to fight against us I mean that in and of itself should have had her suspend her campaign and Arizona and should make a different choice to not vote for years and said this is really personal\nFor those of us who served in were shot at by the Taliban and and saw Americans perished over this\nUh you know I hear the emotion in your voice and understandably so I mean you ... said six deployments that's amazing\nYeah well again it was an absolute honor there's so many Americans who have done that and more of those on the ground in the air and on the C I mean this is this is you know why we fight to protect our way of life and our freedoms and our liberties are in it you know this and it is you know in addition to this\nA comment saying it's okay for an American to join the Taliban to basically commit trees and she also was protesting right after nine eleven protesting our troops in a pink to to\nA flyers handed out at protests that she led depicting our troops as skeletons and saying stop the U.S terror in the middle east so\nThis isn't just a one off for her uh this is the pattern she advocated is shut down Luke air force base\nI hosted the president President Trump at Luke air force base on friday to see what an amazing national security treasure it is she's trying to cover up or tracks and with George Soros\nChuck Schumer and the millions of dollars that are flowing in to you know cover their tracks and Turner into something that she's not in the greatest political cover up in Arizona history\nA lot of people think she's moderate a lot of people think she's right of center\nA and it's just not true and we\nGot only coming out on a three weeks before the election I mean it's almost on a daily basis it's like you know a a deep dive dumped has been made but I Would think that this was common\nKnowledge or had to have been common knowledge about her I mean I I wouldn't underestimate remember the allegations against the blind shakes attorney that she invited to Arizona State university I mean that's another slap in these two people\nYeah absolutely look at you know we are sort of joke that the Democrat Party should have done better in internal opposition research on her before they had Herbie Chuck Schumer is top recruit\nFor them to try to flip the Senate majority we knew about her radical cats uh we've been telling people about it in Arizona every single day uh and that and the last few weeks or right some some videos and and things are coming out every single day but unless you're on conservative radio conservative TV Fox\nOr another on social media you're not finding out about this and so we still have another a number of independents and Republicans who are not Tunisia and unfortunately that need to know every time we have to put up and add to put some of these statements and like you just played it cost us about seven hundred thousand dollars\nTo make sure the message gets out to the voters as they are voting every single day right now and she's had so much money dumping into her you know and if people do want to support of course they can go to mix Sally for Senate dot com because we really do need to help or to make sure Arizona's are aware\nOf Arizona are aware of all of this they will never vote for her if they're aware of your heroes background they absolutely will vote for you\nUm I've only got to get to know you in recent months and I got to tell you I'm more impressed every single time I talk to you and I think it'd be a great senator from the state of Arizona I Hope you're not going to turn into Ben Sasse and run away from me after you get elected but I'm ... more than ...\nYou know it's on you may not remember but back when I was a major in the air force I took on the Pentagon because they were making our service women wear ... when they were in Saudi Arabia and I put my career on the line and I actually sued the department of defence\nAh fought for eight years and got legislation passed to overturn this and I actually went on the Hannity show during that whole thing ah to talk about how important it was to protect our religious liberties and not say\nIt was a very you know that that was that was a gutsy move I mean I I don't like the idea if American\nSoldiers are are on foreign soil and were there to protect them and help them which is usually the case\nAh I don't think that we need to go by their customs were Americans we get to follow her own customs or else you don't want us there then you don't want us there\nExactly that's exactly oh luckily we were there it was with the U.S military policy it was ridiculous I stood up for it I thought for it took me eight years but I finally got legislation passed as a citizen or to\nOverturn it and make sure that our values were so there were set up for it yeah\nWell I really wish I knew both love and why didn't president anew and here I'm a bit more than a million dollars if you're not\nPaying attention to this race in Arizona you need to pay attention Christian cinema you know supporting radicals like the Taliban while Martha ... doing her six tour of duty twenty eight years serving our country ah she's got one of those crazy pink hats on you know talking down our troops and accusing them didn't you choose them of torture as well\nUh she was aligned with the radical uh anti border patrol a group down at the border trying to help uh you know help\nWith illegal immigration and that group ah ... accused the border patrol of torture yes it was a ... again radical extreme group that she was very much involved in a in the inner path\nWhat do you think the president needs to do with the seven thousand people that are marching towards our southern border if they make it to the border what's the best put playing for the president\nOr this is absolutely ridiculous we have got to stop them from coming in the president needs to use all elements of power that he has shown we're seeing little mini caravans coming in every single day though because they're taking advantage\nOf our loopholes in the law\nUh I work very closely with President Trump often called the good that bill that was also the Knicks Sally bill that would provide thirty eight billion dollars for the border wall to\nSecure our border and close the loop holes at the cartels are taken advantage of\nIt has to stop every single day right now there's people coming in in ... uh and that's a a sector that is being overrun right now all they do have been down there many months yeah they're released\nInto the interior of the United states sixteen thousand five hundred family member units in September the highest ever recorded\nThis is not certain President Trump's fault if the Democrats fall for obstructing a closing these loopholes and securing the border and the president as frustrated as the eye and he needs use everything he's got enough to to get to to put pressure on Mexico\nAnd then they use for building a wall and funding and fully funding all yes and you have\nBoarded our bales thirty eight billion dollars including building a wall yes or\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell it's on I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on that House bill I'm getting my asking for it right now because\nIt's being misconstrued by the Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people who have family\nWait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many hours\nScholars including building a wall Yes sir\nWould you vote to repeal Obamacare the both of John McCain decided to change his mind on\nWell Sean I did vote to repeal and replace Obamacare on our house they'll I'm getting my asking for it right now because it's being misconstrued by the Democrats they're trying to uh you know invoke fear in people who have family\nMember wait a minute I Know Arizona didn't how many Arizona's lost their plans lost their doctors and are paying infinitely higher rates because of Obamacare\nYes Obamacare as they held in Arizona there's only one choice in fourteen if it really happy that there's no choice people lock their health care coverage we had people right now a tree that the conditions you can't get access to health insurance because of the failures of Obamacare\nSo I work hard to make sure that we were moving away from that I and and towards something that gets more choice for people\nMore flexibility at the state level more free market get the federal government you know to not be doing that one size fits all top down penalty taxes mandate it's failed\nAnd so we you know I voted yes again I've got millions of dollars attacking me right now misconstrue ring that vote I I voted to protect people with preexisting condition oh that's good intentions but their policies are wrong we need more conservative policies to bring the cost down and provide more options for people to get access to insurance\nRight Martha McSally a really a rock star a hero who served their country unimportant race for the Republicans as they not only want to maintain control of the U.S Senate but also to build their majority in the Senate\nIt'll make votes for Supreme Court justice is a lot easier going up against a very radical leftist in the name of Chris and send them a thank you so much a Martha McSally for all you've done for your country and and the positions you take and ah you should win this race\nFar and wide when the people of Arizona fully understand the record the background and the radical views of Christ and send them a thank you for being with us more than a Sally\nThanks on if you sign a flashlight on that and their advocacy and if people want to how they can go to make Sally for Senate dot com you need your support and help and donations weaken my next thing thanks so much\nThank you rod as in Florida crushed view on the Sean Hannity show how are you ride\nA yes or legislation on the show dedicated listener concerns my concern is the Supreme Court list that the person that\nThat actually a presented when he was ... was okay and the reason why my concern is is because magic closed is already a put the news out there that they do smear campaigns\nAnd they've done a ... they want us to have the transparency and so we've given transparency like open up our playbook so they can actually investigate every person on that list so whoever President Trump actually nominates they've already got a team investigating that specific person to attack on a smear campaign\nWell that that's all you get from the Democrats that their only play book that's all they have that one oh one one or two one oh three one by one oh nine that this is it you know and you know it's interesting to watch the Democrats now are trying to urge caution on blue wave and temper expectations", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Vernal", "day": "27"}
