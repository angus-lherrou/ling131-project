in your hate Trump media Wall Street journal today media continues obsessing over whatever they want to talk about but Chancellor Angela Merkel the president referred to this last night at the rally with Ted Cruz has now offered government support\nOr to efforts to open up Germany to us gas which was a key concession to President Trump is each you know the president right we're paying Seventy two cents of every dollar for NATO\nThe western alliance that we have the our Western European friends you know worries most about the the power of Russia the military threat of Russia the hostile regime of Russia\nYou know and we're paying all this money and what is Angela Merkel do but she makes Russia and putting rich again by giving them billions of dollars that energy contracts which is the life flood of\nNot just Germany but of all of Western Europe and meanwhile we've got the largest supplies of natural gas energy in the entire world and what you ought to be doing is working with an allied nation that is helping to pay for part of their defense\nSo that in fact they don't have to worry about ... no but she decided she when she was going to make Russia rich again um during a debate that was held\nThe other night and the Pennsylvania synagogue a Democratic House candidates drops in palm [laughter] you can't make this stuff up democratic Pennsylvania congressional candidate Scott while

with that ... that's going to take you for your career\nAnecdotally what does the president thirty thousand inside another thirty thousand outside a hundred thousand plus our as BP's yeah guess how many people were watching rock Obama less than two thousand people less than five hundred watching crazy uncle Joe Biden\nYou know the president look in the economy you know this this this should be about yes immigration do you know we get stuck with a confrontation at our border precipitated by the people from Honduras that are coming across the border and God Forbid and we're going to protect our borders we have to\nOr else who's going to be a hundred thousand five hundred thousand it's never going to stop but if we had that wall up guess what wouldn't be happening today that caravan would be nonexistent nobody wants to people on either side of this to get hurt Mexico needs to do their job and turn the people around and say go back to your home country\nWe'll see what happens I don't hear one Democrat talking about what the answer is there and everyone gets worked up the president says I'm not a global is I'm a national what isn't national ... means America First\nLess than five hundred watching crazy uncle Joe Biden you know the president look in the economy\nYou know this this this should be about yes immigration do you know we get stuck with a confrontation at our border

entire world we're going to take care of our people our country our way of using our constitutional republic and the media hates the president showing\nHate it's funny to watch all these Democrats now beginning to lower expectations on the blue wave that's interesting I guess they don't have as much confidence Republicans debating Democrats in early voting in some key states don't take a lot of solace and that just look at it as anecdotally just know that your vote is going to matter here\nYou know we put up to fifty top racist that we think are going to be the balance of power Democrats only need a net gain of twenty three states that's not a lot\nNow what if we only when the Senate and picked up Senate seat so it's not the best case scenario and I'd like I'd rather when everything I like to win it off so let's fight like we want to win it all\nLooks like Heidi Heitkamp is pretty much to spend to her campaign after outing of sexual assault victims were actually victims plural it might be hearing a little bit something about her tonight on Hannity I'm just guessing it might be her\nApparently a prominent North Dakota politician caught on tape my project very posh and it will be shown exclusively on Hannity might gas that's Heidi Heitkamp just guess\nI don't know for sure you've seen the tape Linda yes you maybe yeah don't lie to the audience have you seen the the blender

theloop vandalized by two men actually I think they caught him on video\nThey picked up a Boulder and throw it through is window unbelievable does anyone know these two got a Boulder through his office window and\nOr is it the third Republican office now hit with vandalism and less than two months\nUnbelievable scary I by the way on the other side of it let me just say this apparently an explosive device was found near at George Soros is home and his mailbox the New York times reported in a billionaire left this global list or George Soros doesn't like\nSean Hannity any funds a lot of groups that would love the show to go away I Want to be clear with everybody this crap it's got to stop\n... you know we we can settle differences at the ballot box\nI've had my wins over the years and I've had my losses believe me wasn't fun to hear Fox News projects Brock Obama's going to be the forty fourth president of the United states not once but twice you know what you go out and then you fight the next day for the things you believe it\nIt just happens isn't that been slow to political ... cycles I just hate to stop the momentum that we got\nLove Obama when you hear the economy's improving remember who started it and then goes on to mention himself what Ninety two times and thirty eight minutes that's a record even for him\nCan you imagine if the Republicans when everything was going to happen in the media I think they're ... they're not going to they're going to be able to contain themselves they're gonna lose\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter]\nJonathan Alter over at conspiracy TV MSNBC you can kiss democracy good by of geo peak keeps Congress\nUm where a democratic Republican side note then you've got\nA the producer of the Ellen program one more money in the U.S

money\nUnbelievable it looks like the vice president saying the illegal caravan as being finance he said the president of Honduras told him that that this was organized by leftist groups in Honduras and being financed by Venezuela you know I Know that we're watching but as you know anywhere between seven and fourteen thousand and growing\nIn this caravan Washington Examiner rightly points out there's been over five hundred and Twenty one thousand people apprehended at America's southern border and other ports of entry from October first\nTwenty Seventeen through September thirtieth twenty eight heat that's half of them over a half a million people build the wall\nSarah quarter is are reporting visa be gate would a gateway pundit\nYou know that um apparently Guatemalan intelligence she
