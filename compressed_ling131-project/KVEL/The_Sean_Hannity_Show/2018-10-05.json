it matter if there's any corroborating evidence\nYou know one thing is I'm watching Susan Collins a speech was so well thought out\nBased on facts and the standards that she uses to evaluate important issues I mean that's why she kept it to her so pretty much the whole time nobody knew what she was going to do\nThat was just not a a non partisan speech it was a speech\nIn a robe minder of the dignity that we can have them in spite of big disagreements and talked about the law the constitution the role of the Senate advice and consent and a little bit of a class and she made all of these left\nAnd frankly it was ...\nIt was spectacular nothing short of spectacular now I Know a lot of people are spending a lot of money and then it's probably only going to get worse for her because she clearly followed her conscience on this issue and\nShe had it ... it was obvious she missed nothing she had followed every single solitary detail of this process\nDid all the work you would ever want or expect from a representative\nAnd and now I guess the left is about as unhinged they'd been I don't even think it's safe to walk the Senate halls at this point\nSenator Lindsey Graham\nOf South Carolina I Would argue it would not have happened but for him and he joins us on our news maker line um you know you told me something when I was in Washington earlier this week\nAnd I asked you I said well what are you know about Susan Collins and\nYou'd you basically describe what I learned about her today I was blown away and I don't get blown away very often I really I'm too cynical I'm from New York I've been in radio Thirty years I'm a tomorrow I start my twenty third year in the Fox news channel\n[noise] well uh you know I'm I'm In a\nPolitical system this deteriorating\nI think what you saw today somebody step forward to maybe say that the biggest winner of the speeches the judiciary because here's a wholesale attack on the independence of the judiciary one at all costs what you saw the day was a person embracing the rule of law not the rule of the mob what you saw today was a woman\nNot being intimidated which you saw today was a good man Brett Kavanaugh being save a strong woman which you saw today was everything good about the Senate good about the country and I'll have my differences with Susan Collins Collins going forward\nBut this is as close to McCarthyism is our hope ever witness in my life\nAnd if anybody turned it around and it was senator Collins\nAh you know senator you had a moment in this process to and and that moment came\nWhen they were going the hardest after judge Kavanaugh I don't think any of us will forget anytime soon the things that this man was accused of and and and I saw the outrage even with Susan Collins that\nRemember the accusation by Julie sweating it was that well it's almost on a weekend basis that that judge Kavanaugh and others\nWere routinely drug in girls lining up in halls gang raping\nThem and it happened frequently and I I Know that some\nPeople brought up the issue of the judges temperament he addressed it in his Wall Street journal article that came out last night\nHow was one supposed to act\nIf you're innocent to the charge of drugging teenage girls and participating in gang rapes of teenage girls I don't know what the appropriate reaction is but I Would think if you're innocent it is one of the anger\nAnd and the frustration Eighteen days ago nobody thought any of those the judge Kavanaugh\nWell yeah I think I think most Americans saw a man who was\nFighting for his family his reputation his life I did not do this went through a logical explanation of based on a calendar that very few people in the world Cape except him and his dad\nAnd just a warning to everybody you know this is not may you're trying to ruin my life I'm not evil and I I I think he reacted consistently been innocent but let me tell you a pivotal moment here when the sweat Nick allegation came out it was breaking news allegation number three and a very new and\nEvil level right so I thought I read it and I said it made no sense to me from the very beginning that a person would go to one party\nOr where people were drugged and raped and go to to less less than that made no sense ... and she said this sounds bad and I said yeah Susan is going to be this way for a while to come\nRead it here's my take on it and being in the law for most of my life prosecutor defense attorney and a judge this doesn't have the ring of truth she said you know that makes sense followed anybody keep going back and putting themselves in that situation and the friends not tell anybody and you've got to remember is ...\nAnd she worked through the process you took each allegation on its own she went to\nAll the major decisions that judge Kavanaugh\nAnd spent a lot of time talking to him and this is a big say every I think they should be in every civics class in the country\nEvery high school student should probably have to listen to senator Collins explanation of why she voted the way she did and what the rule of law is all about\nYou know I Am we have an election and thirty two days to me senator I look at your when Senator or I I Know how close you were to Senator McCain right and who recently passed\nAway and I I've always admired him for being a war hero and I even said I've never regretted not a day not a second supporting him for\nPresident in oh wait over ... it was the right decision then\nAnd I stand by at the day I had a lot of disagreements when he came back and voted no on the health care repeal I was frustrated then I remember he said that how would these people on radio and TV and you know I understood\nSenator McCain that's you know he kind of had that side of him and I knew\nIt really well um but he also talked in that speech to about civility I don't know if there is not consequences for what has just gone on in the last Eighteen days political it sounds ballot box\nI mean so here the consequences a party that will do anything to maintain power should probably never have it are the best thing you can do to stop this and the futures deny them their goal of having more Senate seats more house seats they won't power too bad and what it says and say\nListen I I you know went through the record the allegations don't hold water in terms of him being some kind of gang rape the serial sexual predator he is a very reason logical judge I looked at everything they said about him\nI compared it to the facts and I'm voting yes here's what I Want the voters to do all the voters to remember\nWhat the Democratic Party will do to get power and that they're being driven by people who would assume somebody guilty simply because they don't like their judicial philosophy remember this America do you really want these people in charge of your government [noise]\n[noise] well I think that's a great question you know there's something you mentioned earlier I saw I I'd\nNever known Susan Collins that well I Know that look look the Republican Party is not a model out for dinner if you want to and\nI'd love to I I I found somebody today that I had no idea the thorough illness under which she makes her decisions and I I Will back time I respect I ...
