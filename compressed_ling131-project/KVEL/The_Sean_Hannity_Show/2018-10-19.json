they can't win on the electoral basis we saw that with Donald Trump defeating Hillary Clinton that was the last straw\nFor the George Soros who's in the far left the media matters all of these people once they went down in the presidential election that all of them thought they were going to win because they have the media in their pocket and still do then they said you know why\nWe got to abandon

justice\nOr equal application of our laws needs to be looking at Hillary Clinton she ... the biggest obstruction of justice slam dunk case ever but the problem here is we had one party literally before the American people you mentioned Kavanaugh abandon\nAll principle constitutional law and the and and literally core values that have served us so well which are due process the presumption of innocence the Republicans for the first time in their life that something right they handled it with the seriousness of the topic deserves\nThey were thorough they did it right and at the end of the

overlooked it they they well they do not Harris\nYeah yeah well because now they're in concert there the the American media is in concert with the Democratic party and that's I don't think that's ever happened before in this republic\nWhere the the eighty percent of the media now is promoting a political party so it's going to be fascinating to see the backlash in the election coming up in November I Do believe there will be one I don't know the extent of it\nI don't think anybody does anything anyone that says they know that doesn't know I don't think a lot of people saw what happened on twenty sixteen ...
