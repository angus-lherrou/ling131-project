um\nSo there you have ten is the Senate hopeful Democrats Phil Bredesen staff literally explaining away why he's consciously lying to the people of tendency that he would never support\nSomebody like judge Kavanaugh but we're down eight and we're trying to get more Republicans on our side and when he gets in there and he'll be the real liberal that he always wants to be and do the right thing you won't be concerned about reelection this is just a political move in a political statement and um\nI I mean it doesn't get any more sick than this\nBut goodness our friends over at project Vera tops wherever the catch all these people including top campaign workers were Bredesen exposing what was the truth would their undercover cameras\nYou know you know based it's all supposed they're reticent snap saying that Britain's him a liar when he said he would vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh is purely a blatant political move\nAnd uh when I asked for comment all they said was well project very tossed posed as a fake volunteer and and you secret video recording equipment to capture uninformed inspect you know the comments made last weekend by college students and youth organizers\nWell that's not exactly true is that James O'Keefe the c._e._o. of project ... is with us ah some of the more high ranking campaign members weren't they\n[noise] that's right Sean and and and thanks for higher learning this and yeah this is a coordinated campaign between the Tennessee Democratic Party in the um and the silk reticent campaign and these these workers have been working at the headquarters for the president campaign for a couple of months\nAnd it's a Greek chorus of voices all saying that it said quote\nPolitical move because this is a big deal last friday when when the Tennessee Democratic Senate candidates so bread credited announced that he was going to be voting for capping off if you were in the Senate he said I Would be voting for it was a big deal and they're all saying\nThat no it was a big lie it was a cheap political move to get really voters that weren't supporting him in Tennessee I mean like ...\nAnd that that isn't it but that isn't your a statement now that this tape and coming from their own about than Sean I don't I'm not speculating here I'm not reporting this anonymously you can actually see this video you can see it coming out of their own mouth\nThey're the ones who are saying it so we are confirming the suspicions what you just said we've confirmed that and again it's not just one or two or three if half a dozen of these people\nAre inside the campaign office they have confirmed that the people are real and and then of course you have the the bonus material what the president staffer thinks the Tennessee voters are ignorant\nHe says quote we don't have this out of these walls he says will be a good Democrat and what's happening\nNot just one or two or three if half a dozen of these people are inside the campaign office they have confirmed that the people are real and and then of course you have the onus material what this president staffer thanks to Tennessee voters are ignorant\nHe says quote we don't have it out of these walls\nHe says will be a good Democrat and what that means he'll be a good Democrat that means that he's going to do with the Schumer wing of the party once you get selected kind of see they don't want the even the Democrats don't want them to be Chuck Schumer democratic so all this is pretty amazing stuff Sean and uh\nYou know it's just we're confirming what was known for years\nYou know you you think back and you think Peter Struck and he talked about smelly Wal Mart Trump voters and you think abiding just what like last month saying that Trump voters were the ... of society just fine [noise]\nLoses a court and in a court of public opinion these forces of intolerance remained determined to undermine them roll back from progress you all\nMay this time they're not you have an online in the White House this time they have in a\nSmall percentage of the American people virulent people some of them the drugs in society [noise]\nDrags is designed so then you've got smelly Walmart people drag this society era to the mobile deplorable that we now learn this week from Hillary you cannot\nBe civil with you know we got Eric Holder saying that kick them Obama once famously saying that you know these are bitter angry people cling to their God guns bibles in religion I mean there's such hatred and contempt\nFor voters there's another tape we showed last night James I don't know if you saw the show we did run your tape and thank you for sharing it with us but an Arizona democratic senator a Senate candidate name's Kristen\nCinema literally caught on tape and twenty eleven calling the people of Arizona crazy\nAnd it's even worse than that because we found out Fox News dot com reported that she was promoting an event at Arizona State university featuring a lawyer is lawyer was convicted of aiding and Islamic terrorist organization in its leader and the lawyer in question presented\nRepresented someone who was sentenced to life in prison in the nineties for plotting to blow up the UN and FBI building and more\nWe're going to fight that person to you know just I mean it's unbelievable to me the what they're doing is they're just outright lying to people\nBut they have to show on that that's the the whole purpose behind our organization Vera ... the real nature thing the reality and the motivations behind these people and and they have to lie and the red state it's not at the Democratic red state Democrats have to lie\nIn order to get elected and when they get into the Senate they can only vote one way yes or no\nBut they have to mislead and misinform the voters\nAnd and again it's so if people think that it requires all this espionage it doesn't you walk into the office after the question staffers all tell you the same there and we'll say we don't actually believe this\nAnd if there's one thing voters won't tolerate Sean is one thing left this is not the right thing because it's just so self evident you can't lie to people you can't lie about what your intentions are you have to be honest and they cannot get elected they will not if\nThey still no you're right if they if they state what they really believe they'll never get elected so whatever you do it's like uh they just it's an orchestrated\nWind campaign and you call them or\nThe other side they will be the first time we got a bunch more coming and I was
