showing us our number\nYou are listening to the best of the Sean Hannity show and stay tuned\nMore memorable moments interesting guests and a lot of fun coming up next [noise]\nWhat we have is you know the the the AC a which is the Obamacare what you've lost with the A. C. A. as people with preexisting conditions have been paying more yeah higher premiums and they were paying before\nMany lost the doctors that they loved taxing Americans who chose not to use it which by the way the individual mandate with tax the president has gotten rid of the ... rid of that taxing companies who choose not to elect to pay for what your neighbor needs it was one big redistribution skiing\nNow if you deal with direct primary care direct access to doctors\nAnd we've talked about health savings accounts and we also talked about\nAtlas MD Dr Josh amber and Dr Lee s gross this model now has been duplicated around the country and what happens is there's no pre existing conditions prejudice at all if you can afford a cell phone you can pretty much afford a\nA direct access to your doctor no insurance no problem you pay for what you need fifty dollars a month for an adult ten dollars a month per child they negotiate directly with the pharmaceuticals so they have Ninety to Ninety five percent reduction and we have high blood pressure if you have a cholesterol problem you walk out of the doctor's office with the medicine\nAnd a greatly reduced rate than you'd ever pay at any drug store it's actually it's now been implemented in his working in over five hundred practices around the country\nIt was pioneered by my friend Dr Josh ... joins us now atlas MD and Dr ... gross president of doctors were patient care\nI'm I Am I pretty much explaining it right is there anything I'm missing and I would call this concierge care for every American\nI the only problem is Sean Everytime you talk about it are folks will start bringing and we've got regular patients\nFailed you'll have a lot of them too right\nWhere we have a you know or our own panel there and yeah we're fulltime family physicians but no you nailed it [noise]\n[noise] well I mean so and you have all these pace now the bottom line is I think most people like me and I have friends of mine that are doctors or you know and friends of mine that will take care of me friends of mine that will take a call at three AM if I'm not feeling well or which has happened occasionally in my life and these guys you know I ...\nMean I pay them and they take my insurance does but they do it as more of a friendship but this is something every American can have access to\nAbsolute\nYeah attacks plane how you're making it work there and how it works for your team exactly\nUh you know I think this is like a lot of things um Silicon Valley style or Netflix or Amazon Prime uh people are being be Hoover they they want a better product faster cheaper easier and and that's what Dr gross and I've done with our respective clinics\nIs just decrease the paperwork the headache the hassle of the middle man so that now medicines are pinned the pill now you can call ... ... email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cell phone\nI told this is now they implement how many places did you get this finally\nUp and running around the country I don't think you're explaining detail in off year explain exactly what this service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and\nIt's a flat membership rate based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits offices it's free tale of medicine so you can call text email your doctor we have no co pay for anything any procedure we can do in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies joined Chechens ultrasounds heart monitors lung\nHeadaches that half of the middle man so that now medicines are pay the pill now you can call ticks email your doctor now health care with your own private doctors cheaper than a cellphone\nRight so this is now they implement how many places that you get this finally\nUp and running around the country I don't think you're explaining detail enough here explain exactly what the service does and how this can be implemented for every American\nSure there's over a thousand doctors doing the direct care model across the country and\nIt's a flat membership rate based on age it's insurance free for unlimited home visits work visits office visits it free tele medicine's so you can call tax email your doctor we have no co pays for anything any procedure we can do in the office is free of charge\nStitches biopsies joy objections ultrasounds heart monitors lung monitors and then wholesome medications and labs for up to Ninety five percent savings\nI mean this is a grassroots movement and patients just need to get out and let the doctors know that this is a better way to get health care and they support it and and that's why I think we've seen this gross so much in the last several years\nAnd then what's missing is the fact that it can be duplicated now I don't know the exact complications that might exist in say a big city like New York city you know nine million people or Los Angeles and San Francisco but in small towns and smaller cities it is working Dr gross that's the point\nYet it's working everyone but I think you know people really need to understand is that you know this is not a decision between you know\nThe Ford will correct I mean we want to go down there they are trying to take down the path of socialized total government controlled health care you know at a time where people are able to choose their health care decision was based upon their individual DNA or going to take a one size fits all approach to health care it doesn't make any sense and\nYou know Democrats don't want their healthcare chosen by Donald Trump anymore than Republicans walk their health church housing diagnose Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi so you know why are we inserting the politicians into health care with it but the government can for health care system when you can have a better way through a direct primary care relationship\nWere did not leave this was the failure of Obamacare you spend billions and billions more\nAnd you get far in theory your hair because it never really was about the patient really was always about\nRedistribution of wealth and you know I can go over like I did yesterday all the top number we already have redistribution of wealth in America you have the top three percent of taxpayers paying the majority of income one percent pays almost forty percent the top fifty percent of wage earners pay Ninety seven percent\nSo what they've tried to do is ... ... for example they forced the young\nAnd generally healthy Americans to buy expensive plans that they didn't need and couldn't afford and then penalize them if they didn't get the plan\nWhen they would have been better off paying for one check up a year right out of their own pocket and also getting a catastrophic plan if God Forbid they had the accident or got cancer or\nAt a young age which rarely happens had a heart attack right Dr amber\nYep this is a one size fits none model um it's too expensive for young healthy people and it doesn't provide the service that older adults need in an affordable timely way and so we need to streamline the whole system the problem is that politicians have always tried to ensure everything but now we're to the point of ensuring\nMedicines that cost a penny a pill I can get a thousand ... thighs I'd a blood pressure medicine for four dollars and Ninety cents\nSo the big box retailers will show you Ninety pills for ten dollars highway robbery we knew cancer or for for six dollars a month in some cases\nThe fact is now we just need less insurance that means health insurance is can compete on quality\nAnd and lower their price just like Fifteen minutes we'll say Fifteen Percent on car insurance we need to get back to a competitive model for the patients are in control and cares affordable and insurance is just for the big stuff but the rare stuff\nAnd where are you with Congress though in other words these are solutions no insurance no bureaucrats you know doctors being able to do what they do their the innovators in this upfront pricing lower cost no government mentally aren't all that is true\nHow do you get Congress how many people are in Congress that are supporting your model I Know for example Rand Paul and I think Lindsey Graham or two people say well block grant the money and then let the states determine how to do it themselves which would then would I think open a path for people like you to expand I didn't even greater level\nAll health care of local I mean that's the important thing you know the health care should be between you and your doctors\nAnd one thing that's clear the calorie is not coming from Washington to save us now if we wait for a solution from Washington it's not coming we need doctors and patients to get the other six cause problems themselves and that's exactly what this loop and the movement does is it eliminates\nAny asking for permission from from Washington to take care of our fish\nYou know well look I Hope that these people in Washington and here you but as it is interesting that the one look every American worried about their health care rightly so every American has been burned by broken promises you know and the fact that the Democrats have this perception that somehow they're the great\nThe great solution the healthcare after the Obamacare debacle is laughable to me but unfortunately with voters three weeks out of an election that's how some of them feel as I read these polls\nSo uh anyway I really appreciate both of you being with us Dr Josh number Dr Lee as gross the probably one of the defining issues that caused people make people think the Democrats are actually going to help them and it's not\nA we appreciate your time eight hundred nine four one shown as a toll free telephone number if you want to be a part of the program I Will take a quick break we'll come back on the other
