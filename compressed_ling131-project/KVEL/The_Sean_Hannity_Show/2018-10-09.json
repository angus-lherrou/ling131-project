the capital issue but the bigger bomb that come out\nOf the testimony of James Baker memories the top legal counsel at the FBI has to do with the issue that we discussed three weeks ago which was Rod Rosenstein saying that he wanted a surreptitiously\nRecord Donald Trump and maybe we can get some cabinet officials in both the twenty Fifth Amendment\nAnyway it turns out that not long after that twenty Seventeen meeting where Rod Rosenstein reportedly discussed wearing a wire to record conversations with President Trump\nRemember this was this was chronicle by both\nThe deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe in and his lawyer Lisa Page that Peter's drugs boyfriend they went into the office of a third FBI official a girlfriend rather sorry Lisa Page was it was she was his voice ...\nHe was her she was his girlfriend right enough you're interrupting me anyway went to the office of a third of visual general counsel Baker\nThey told Baker what Rod Rosenstein said\nSo now we've got three witnesses that say that Rod Rosenstein talked about\nSurreptitiously taping Donald Trump after Rosenstein comments were reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape from\nAnyway but it appears that you know that\nIt was signed talked about surreptitiously taping Donald Trump after Rosenstein comments reported in the New York times about what three and a half weeks ago he sent out word through intermediaries that he didn't really mean it that he was speaking sarcastically oh you you want me to put on a wire and tape Trump\nAnyway but it appears that you know that's not how top FBI officials took it the thing that struck me the most was the theory is look on Baker's face when he was describing it according to a source\nClose to the investigation of bakers house interview he was ... bay and that may have been page took it seriously because they took it seriously but then he took it seriously other words they all thought he meant it which now I Know the president met\nComing Thursday night into friday morning friday the storm will be between Cape Hatteras in Norfolk go right to see to the south of New England no problem in the northeast from it but it is going to be a big problem even in the Carolinas or because of the fact that there's more rain coming\nSo you're going to you're basically saying this is going to come up through the Florida Panhandle it's going to sort of veer right hit the Carolinas hard and then go out to sea\nYeah won't have to ... you'll see forty to sixty mile an hour winds maybe guts to hurricane force\nAlong the outer banks and forty or sixty mile an hour winds Charleston Columbia uh Augusta places like that as it moved so it's going to accelerate through there where we are looking at the devastating wind\nPower with this hurricane is Panama City that is ground zero for the worst part of this storm and you folks over there you ... you got you got remembered the way that northeast a fighter Florida shape\nEven though to the east Appalachia cola or the wind won't be as bad you're still going to get tremendous storm surge in there because all that water it's to the east of the storm is piling up\nAnd heading in there and do that by to Florida I think Tallahassee is probably going to get wind gust eighty Ninety miles an hour and they're not the power out in Tallahassee during hurricane Kate which went very close to the Ninety percent\nOf the power was knocked out in Tallahassee and I think you're going to see Ninety a hundred percent power outage or with this there I'm I'm just saying the when should be higher in Tallahassee at least that Gus with this\nAnd we'll have severe weather breaking out later tomorrow afternoon demonic possibilities tornadoes are from Florida and then prove southern Georgia coastal South Carolina North Carolina or during the day Thursday as this moves up rapidly northeast\nIt's a scary aren't so why do we get landfall and uh what would you recommend that people I Know a lot of people live on that coast I've been there a number of times it's actually it's so beautiful um and that but\nThere are a lot of homes right on the water so\nHow between three and nine PM tomorrow thinks where we're going to have landfall and I think things are really going to deteriorate\nVery very rapidly um it appears tomorrow morning midday and afternoon in there you just got to get out I mean well you know again what for its you know we had a hundred hundred and ten mile an hour winds there was a bad storm it was spread out\nThis is this is much more of a hey make or other kind of thing where it's a it's a knockout punch it with a hundred and twenty a hundred and thirty mile an hour winds and a lot of folks\nYou can see what's going on with this you saw with Florence Saturday I kept trying to organize couldn't quite do it you see it on the cloud photographed the eyes getting tighter and tighter and tighter and that means that this storm is intensifying as it comes to the coast\nIs look there's nothing magical about it and I we I wrote\nI wrote on this weekend I I Know that sounds pompous but you got people saying we've never seen anything like this it's already started with a climate ambulance chasing\nThis has been telegraph so far in advance and even from late last week you could see that was going to be a major problem coming up into the Gulf of Mexico and that was going to be what we call rapid rapid development feedback we see that happen every now and then\nAnd we are fortunate with uh Florence said it was you know it was off its peak this is going the opposite way and that's what hurricanes do when given the ideal situation and that's what this it\nSo it really hits landfall I Would say if I'm looking at my own but your website actually so you have a hitting land it's really going to start getting we're up about noon tomorrow we'll a little before\nRight and that and then the the landfall I think sometimes between three and nine PM it Panama City will get that down in ... I Believe that may be on with the on TV Tonight we will be honing in on this we get a lot of people in that area of course you know and as you've been harping about what twenty eight days away\nAnd uh we all we want to know people that listen you know I I appreciate let me be beyond here want to take care of your down there but we want you to listen and get the heck out of there if you're ordered out of there because it's a bad storm\nRight to do a bust started the official weather man of the Sean Hannity show please you know whatever your local officials tell you I'm what I'm hearing from Joe is if you're a coastal person you're going to want to move inland probably a little bit more uh westward rather than eastward because it's going to make a right turn ...\nAre there because it's a bad storm\nRight to Joe ... started the official weatherman of the Sean Hannity show please you know whatever your local officials tell you I'm what I'm hearing from Joe is if you're a coastal person you're going to want to move inland probably a little bit more\nUh westward rather than eastward because it's going to make a right turn it looks like it's centered right through the Atlanta area\nRight into the coastal areas of the Carolinas and uh and then straight out to see maybe getting is upward as northern as Virginia but look at whatever your local officials tell you if they tell you got to evacuate don't be pride poll just suck it up take the day or to\nMake sure you're safe and secure but put that as a top priority\nOr All right thanks so much for being with us Joe ... weather bell dot com thank you uh eight hundred million for one show and if you want to be a part of the program president now even he's saying what I'm suggesting is that is that the U.S would end up ah like Venezuela if if the Democrats win the midterms\nThere's some truth to that there's a little bit of payback I see for Senator Lisa Murkowski the geo pale Alaska apparently is going to either reprimand or totally disappeared now Lisa Murkowski I Would assume a primary\nTell you the one person I'd love in Alaska to run against or would be Sarah Palin maybe Governor Palin could make a\nA political comeback I think the people there would like like that a lot um\nThere's a guy out this was a fascinating race cars you wouldn't think anything in California\nWould be in play although there are very important especially in Southern California there are very important congressional seats in play and that would be from say just south of Los Angeles Orange County down and through San Diego and I know they've had massive population shifts down there\nBut you wouldn't think state wide that you'd have a gubernatorial race that is now is closed as it is it's a five point race between Gavin Newsom and the Republican businessman a guy by the name of John Cox we've got to get John cops on the program and I'm going to tell you why it's happening\nBecause the people in California are fundamentally understanding what Gavin Newsom is proposing is an economic disaster for that state went oh free health care for everybody it doesn't matter if you're in California legally or not\nAnd also the cost of it being not only a sanctuary city like San Francisco but a sanctuary state\nWell that means that that includes health care that's the criminal justice system that the educational system\nAnd if people not paying taxes are in the state illegally and maybe some illegal immigrants do but they're certainly available to use services under what Gavin Newsom is proposing for everybody\nIt's basically putting a sign out that would say hey free health care in California just make it here and we'll take care of you\nAnd you know people are going to do they're going to make it there and use the California health system and I remember California already has a state income tax of Thirteen and a half percent\nYou know add that to a federal income tax and the fact that you can no longer the duck after the tax cut plan passed you can no longer caught or deduct rather your state income taxes on your tax return\nMeans that if you do make money in California you're paying that much more in taxes so the people of California are hit harder than any other state in the United states and New York is where I Am is right behind them\nJust ridiculous the amount of the burdens that they're putting on the people of California and Dianne Feinstein is up for reelection it's gonna be interesting to see if ah Gavin Newsom will pull her down in terms of the polls but anyway we'll we'll have to watch that raised a little more closely and see what happens all the way we do have\nAn attempt by the ...
