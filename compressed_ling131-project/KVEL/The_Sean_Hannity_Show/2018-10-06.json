indication at all I'm reading though that the FBI is moving expeditiously and it seems like they're very close to probably completing their work\nBut if we start with professor Ford professor Ford claimed that these four people were at the party nobody remembers any such party that she describes and the one person that was supposedly was an eye witness\nTo the alleged abuse in her case was mark judge and he said absolutely it didn't happen and then if you look at the ... if you look at the ... case this was in the New Yorker\nAll the New York times couldn't print the story and and they actually brought up the fact that after calling dozens and dozens of people to corroborate they discovered that Mr Ramirez was calling former yell classmates and asking them if they remembered and that she wasn't short short herself if it was Brett Kavanaugh\nSo that should go away and this one I think is the worst of all and I I guess there's no standards at NBC News anymore if they're going to put on somebody that they can't corroborate the stories whose changing or story almost you know by the hour seemingly\nWell even the Democrats um declined to fully embrace Julie sweat next story\nBut on the original story that Christine for a story I think what we're going to find and what we're already finding um is that the people who gave statements to the Senate Judiciary committee like Peter Smith and mark judge amazingly enough\nThey're telling the FBI at the same thing I told you this shirt committee which they have no memory at all to support this\nNow I think it's probably a good thing to get additional recollections or you're not remember\nA Senator Whitehouse and other Democrats made a big deal with this party entry into Brett Kavanaugh calendar July first Nineteen eighty two thirty six years in three months ago by the way\nUm they didn't listen who is that the party and it didn't match up with a\nRecruiting for it to counter this but they thought this was a big deal so\nLet's talk to those people and I think my feeling is that that I think there are three additional people calm Bernie and squeeze a who had not been interviewed earlier a and I think you're going to find three more people who don't know anything about\nA Christine ports are allegations so uh I listen I I I don't think this FBI thing\nFBI investigation is a bad thing I think that they will find out that there is no evidence to support this very good find out actual real evidence to support it than I've changed my mind but I don't think it's fair\nWell if you go through I thought it was really devastating new report by Rachel Mitchell um now he's the independent prosecutor she prosecute sex crimes\nAnd she was hired by the Senate and I think rightly by the Republicans that they wanted to be extremely courteous and thoughtful and and take this very seriously and not make a political so\nThey brought in an independent prosecutor to to question professor Ford who showed incredible respect to her but she pointed out that he said she said cases incredibly difficult to prove itself\nAnd then she goes on this cases even weaker than that and then she Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to ...\nAnd the prosecutor to to question professor Ford who showed incredible respect to her but she pointed out a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to prove itself\nAnd then she goes on this cases even weaker than that and then she Dr Ford identified other witnesses to the event those witnesses either refuted her allegations or failed to corroborate them and for reasons discuss below I don't think that a reasonable prosecutor would bring this case based on the evidence before the committee\nAnd then she went on to list all the issues there was no consistent account and she gives the example after example of when the alleged assault happened I mean the dates keeps shifting back and forth dramatically actually the failure to previously identified judge Kavanaugh as the assailant\nAre inconsistent descriptions of the alleged assault a failure to remember key details who invited forward to the party how did you get to the party where did the party even take place\nHow did you get home from the party um and and it goes on from there but every case is similar in as much as there is no corroboration there are a big holes in the stories\nAnd at some point when do we ask\nIs this becoming a witch hunt we know that that Bert Katz says her friends sending out emails\nAnd she's a woman that went after Paula Jones and supported Al Franken so she's not exactly consistent on the issue of of sexual misconduct and they're sending out letters to the deer so and so do you know anything please call us it'll do those letters when ours\nI Know some core operation you know the ... case right here at times they said they called they talked to dozens of people not to me that says twenty four people or more I mean that is a lot\nOf people can look at it on on the Rachel ritual thing you know she was a lot of criticism her and um I think that the the way she approached it was not\nA really good way given the limitations of a Senate hearing where they have to be interrupted every ... minutes but she did ... I was working day and her questioning of a Ford about her therapist Andrea therapists notes and the white we even know about this because remember\nFord says it took place in the summer of Nineteen eighty two she did not tell anybody for ten twenty thirty thirty six years\nTo two thousand twelve and she ... she says she's in marriage therapy with her husband and she tells\nThe therapist about that and she later also tells an individual therapist\nAbout that as well and she checks the therapists notes and the therapists notes do not mention the name Brett Kavanaugh and she says as a matter of fact it's only her husband remembering that after session she brought up Brett Kavanaugh's name that is the only evidence\nThat it took place in the therapy sessions and by the way you would think such therapy sessions and the ... there are would be confidential but of course she gave them to the Washington Post so they're probably no longer a confidential so even even her account of how she finally\nMentioned it to someone after thirty six years raises a lot of questions\nIt really is amazing now we have Judiciary Committee Democrats now they're wanting to investigate the quote ice throwing incident in college no this is what it sounds\nLike you're telling the truth but that's what they say\nWell now we have the Democratic hope uh Hawaii senator the one that said the men to just shut up and sit down and Renault yeah Geraldo is now saying that she wants that investigation into the ice throwing incident\nI'm at a ball game and on top of that now they're questioning the veracity about was he truthful about his drinking he said he lives here he liked to drink beer than he likes to drink beer now he said yeah there were plenty of times like a lot of college and high school kids I drink too much fear\nBut they're saying well he must a blackout and those have been\nUm nobody would know that but Brett Kavanaugh nobody would know unless he said that somebody I blacked out\nCorrect so this is a fishing expedition this is now a destroy Kavanaugh expedition they don't care about anything except destroying him so here you know ... question ... go ahead where were these artists\nThat things have changed yeah I'm from an emphasis on the the sex misconduct allegations too was he truthful about his drinking and I think that's a reflection of the fact\nThere really isn't any evidence to support the sex\nOr allegations and now they're talking about whether he told the truth about drinking although mentioned many times in his testimony that he did um in fact\nDrink today rocks published an article about his testimony about his drinking that never quoted a single word of his testimony about his drinking\nTrick is mischaracterized what he said and then knock it down\nOr are they going to let it go there thank you so much Byron York uh with those actors on Washington Examiner eight hundred nine four one showing us our toll free telephone numbers we continue from Washington DC we'll get the very latest from Senator Lindsey Graham who's been in the forefront of a literally pointing out the madness that this has now evolved into\nA listen we all have\nJust gotten through summer and a lot of you have you know little sun spots\nAnd skin irritation from the summer all the good friends at ... and Jen you so well they now have a brand new product it's there's sunspot correct her and you can watch sunspots age spots red inflamed patches vanish right before your eyes ... from the swamp and the sewer it's the Sean Hannity show\nWe'll get to your calls we have Lindsey Graham and much more Hannity tonight\nNine eastern on the Fox news channel as we continue [noise]\nNow now now the same name Sean Hannity damn right Sean Hannity show\nTakes me Sean Hannity right here on TALK hazy out [noise]\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender\nWe've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates stays locked buddy of rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "Vernal", "day": "06"}
