in this\nCountry but if you're rich like the Trump you can set up a system like this\nAnd they detail in the most extraordinary way how this is done and I'm not an important thing to know now is that the IRS is being caught by the Republicans over and over again so they have no investigators are very few investigators to ferret stuff out like this so it's open\nSeason for people who can hire a

times article very very long article fourteen thousand words did Trump or his father or other members of the family engage in something illegal\nWell you know what I'm I Can't tell a you know I haven't looked at the water hundred thousand pages of documents that they seem to provide 'em you know there's there are a few things in here which is proven to be true that was probably beyond the pale of law\nUm what what what bothered me about the uh the article is the the authors obviously showed their bias in several places\nUh one of which where they say that uh the rich never really pay their full freight um and ah there's a couple of places where they're under\nExplanation allows them to make some rather crucial accusations which if I knew all the facts I might be able to disapprove mhm so I'll give you an example if you if I may sure\nUm suppose that I buy a house for half a million dollars I put twenty percent down and I borrow with a mortgage the remaining four hundred thousand dollars with the purchase price now\nWhat is that worth to me\nWhat is that included in my network is why if I gave it away at that point what what the value of the gift be one of the value of the gift will be a hundred thousand dollars because\nIt would be subject to the mortgage and so now let's say there's a downturn like there was in the Nineteen nineties or two thousand three or two thousand eight when everybody lost value in real estate and now my real estate is worth only four hundred and twenty thousand dollars\nAnd like a lot of clients of mine decided when the downturn came that was a good time to give away real estate to their children\nSo now it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars I give it to my children what's the gift that I report on my gift tax return watch four hundred and twenty thousand dollars minus a four hundred thousand dollar mortgage twenty thousand dollars left that would be the value of the gift\nNow a decade later there's been improvements all around the neighborhood\nOh it's worth four hundred and twenty thousand dollars I give it to my children watch the gift that I report on my gift tax return watch four hundred and twenty thousand dollars minus a four hundred thousand dollar mortgage twenty thousand dollars left that would be the value of the gift\nNow a decade later there's been improvements all around the neighborhood knew Tony retailers developments of of of various sizes\nAnd I show my children sell that house for several hundred thousand dollars or have to pay off the mortgage so they keep three hundred thousand dollars I'm not even going to talk about taxes at that point but they kept three hundred thousand dollars and then\nOne could say that they got Fifteen times the valuation of the gift you see that was perfectly legal they did but the article doesn't explain leverage of real estate\nSo as a result I mean you can easily said my gosh how could that ever happened how could you ever invest in something\nAnd then sell it ten years later for Fifteen times what the value was one it was given\nReal charge recharge is my guest season attacking estate planning lawyer or read you said there were a couple of things that that jumped out at you and if they could be proven to be true it would be problematic what what's the most serious one\nOh well that's the one that I really found to be a very serious is there's this there's there's a statement that when Donald Trump's a casino was in very bad shape or you know just drowning in debt that apparently his father\nA center an emissary

fourteen or Fifteen family in the ...\nNow but the most important thing is those trusts were created before much of the tax laws that Fred and Mary trust marry a Trump were subject to a were passed\nSo for example the Kennedys died before the uh Nineteen eighty six a generation skipping tax was introduced so they could pass wealth down to their grandchildren without a an extra level of a state tax at every generation\nBut I'm sure that they had some dental Joe Kennedy was not exactly the cleanest a a living person alive and I'm sure that there are there were problems or ways that he
