to ward off ... or osteoporosis more recently they've been told they need vitamin D supplements as well\nJust around the Sacramento work study published in ... at the end of two thousand Seventeen indicated they're not effective what\nDid the experts think about this research to find out we turn to Dr Robert wrecker O'Brian professor of medicine and chief of the division of endocrinology a crane University School of medicine he directs the osteoporosis Research Center\nThat the rabbit cracker welcome to the people pharmacy proud to be with you\nDr wrecker you have studied bone and preventing osteoporosis for much of your professional career you are if I'm not mistaken endocrinologist by trade\nI tell us a little bit about your perspective on vitamin D and calcium and other minerals we know that they're absolutely essential for bone strength but this study that was published in jama not too very long ago\nChallenged a lot of people's thinking especially with regard to dietary supplements like calcium and vitamin D it was a meta analysis they reviewed a number of randomized clinical trials and concluded\nThat taking supplements don't do anything to prevent fractures compared to placebo why do you challenge that\nWell our towns that are on the basis of first of all it's a meta analysis and in general I have skepticism about them because they tend to be biased to the no and this particular study examined do very large number of meta analyses [noise]\nUh I Can't even remember the number but it was in the in the range of something like forty or fifty and they were hugely different\nIn their study designs and so I I really don't accepted meta analyses are are a problem because uh the study designs are always different you know and the\nDifferent studies that are included in in the case of nutritional studies it's particularly a problem because these studies are all double blind placebo controlled trials well that's the design that pharmaceutical companies use to test to a drug for four years\nOut of Africa say on safety [noise] but in the case of the pharmaceutical agent the placebo group has none of the pharmaceutical agent on board\nBut on the case in the case of a nutritional supplements and everybody has some of the nutritional supplement in question on board or they'd be disease you can make 'em\nTo note and right I mean thirty ... suits\nOr they'd be disease you can make 'em disease to\nNoon and right I mean thirty ... to their diet and in other words we're all getting calcium and we're getting some vitamin D either from sun or from food\nRight and so you don't have a zero placebo and you can't expect\nTo be a linear benefit a print something like this and prevention infractions from the lowest to the highest levels in the blood and some of the some of the studies for example in this in this particular\nMethod analysis to even have measurements of certain vitamin D levels dunno all over the place in other words it in some of them didn't have baseline once on some of them didn't have a treated once you know so it's one of the problems of nutritional studies in double blind placebo controlled trial they're they're they're just not good\nTwenty three thirty four or you can find it on the website people's pharmacy dot com\nYou can also download the free podcast from I to me\nThat people pharmacy in ... rain gauge

about keeping bones\nBrain dot com today we're talking about keeping bones strong and healthy what traditional interventions can help should you be taking calcium pills or do you need to be drinking lots of milk what about vitamin D supplements how well do they work to prevent osteoporosis I\nGuess to Dr Walter Willett he's professor of epidemiology and nutrition at the Harvard th Chan School of public health\nAnd he's professor of medicine at Harvard Medical school his book is eat drink and be healthy the Harvard Medical school guide to healthy eating updated and expanded welcome\nBack to the people's pharmacy Dr Walter Willett it's so nice to have you back on our air\nWell thank you and good to be back with your [noise] that's\nThe way we saw a study a last year that was published in the journal of the American Medical Association which was a meta analysis I'm thirty three clinical trials they looked at supplements of calcium and vitamin D\nAnd whether or not that kept people from breaking bones they concluded\nDid not make any difference what's your take on this research plate\nWell this area of calcium and vitamin D and bone health is a really a complicated area and ah I think this meta analysis didn't really help us sort out the complexity and as far from the final answer on this topic [noise]\nAh there were several issues about one very important issue is that the amount of vitamin D and the foreman which are the way in which vitamin D is administered can make a very big difference in results\nThat are this study lumped together a randomized trials for vitamin D\nThat gave the vitamin D in different ways I including giving it in one injection for a whole year of very large amount or sometimes once every month and especially when Kevin once you're in very large amount there is\nPretty strong evidence from a large trial that that actually can increase the risk of fractures that's of course very on natural way of giving vitamin D traditionally record in the sun\nAnd get a little bit every day I Am much more sort of steady form of administration and that we don't totally understand why giving a huge amount all at once can be bad for your but there's some reasonable hypotheses why that could be a problem and the evidence suggests that it is if you do look at the studies\nThat gave a reasonable does more than the old idea of four hundred international units and gave it in a more constant way are those are do show some benefits of vitamin D a ball and fracture risk [noise] another problem with is\nA limitation of this analysis was excluded studies that were done on institutionalized or individuals like people living in an assisted living or nursing homes\nAnd um those you know there are people too it's true that there are levels of vitamin D may be on average lower because he may not get out in the sun as much but uh in those kinds of studies the quality of study can actually be higher because you have a better chance of making sure people received their dose\nOn a regular basis and some of the trials are included in that ... there was a ... large loss to participation or people are taking their vitamin\nD so now she's become almost a plague basically that anybody with a guy who can connect with the Internet ah basically can do in a matter of Alice ... villagers piling up\nAh basically can do and I'm not an ally ... villagers piling up with that analysis that I really I think misleading [noise]\nA good bit of news is that there will be several quite large and I think pretty well done studies\nThat look a vitamin ... that will become they've finished already in fact a few months ago they're actively analyzing their data and so hopefully within next year we'll have quite a bit more evidence on this important topic\nNow Dr we'll let you have been involved in literally hundreds of research studies over decades and a lot of your work has been in in the field of nutrition and I I've I've long wondered why it is\nThat some investigators think that they should treat nutrients like drugs and so you know you've mentioned these very large injectable doses of vitamin D fifty thousand a hundred thousand units and\nAnd then they ... they look in amazement when they go well that that wasn't helpful or maybe it was even counterproductive\nAnd you say well Mother Nature never intended us to get this gigantic amount of vitamin D all at once rather than the way it was supposed to be which is a small amount every day so why do you think they even designed those studies that way\n[noise] I had a good question I think maybe it's a little naive I'm at in some ways it's\nThat I wouldn't criticize people too harshly for doing\nThose studies or just that they need to be very careful about the conclusions vitamin D is stored and if you could get the benefits from a single dose once a year that would be very nice but I think the issue it turns out that that doesn't look like Kevin there could actually be some harm but\nIt's just if we generalize the findings from those kinds of very abnormal kind of trials to conclude that vitamin D isn't in general beneficial ... that's the real problem\n[noise] catch it will let the other nutrients that was included in next meta analysis much calcium\nAnd you and we have talked about ... ... supplements in the past but not all of our listeners have heard your idea about calcium supplements so please talent should we all be taking calcium supplements to keep our bones strong\n... another good question and again this is complicated because we know that vitamin or the calcium is absolutely essential that plays many functions including keeping our heart rhythm are orderly I die as a critical part of\nComposition and so we have to get some calcium so the issue is how much and we also know that like most essential nutrients if you get too much you actually can cause harm so uh it's finding that sweet spot\nAudits are are real aim and the amounts of calcium that we need\nOur I think a ... not totally clear at this point in time but the way the amount of calcium requirement is set in the United states is on the basis of very short term studies that last just two or three weeks basically looking\nAt how much calcium can we sort of forced into the bone during a period of ... just a few weeks and that\nAlmost surely will give us a misleading answer because we know that you get some short term changes in bone density that do not reflect what happens in the long run that's very well established and so we have requirements that are set on these very short term studies\nAnd you get results saying we need a for over fifty twelve hundred milligrams a day which means almost for sure you need to be taking a couple of servings\nMilligrams a day which means almost for sure you need to be taking a couple of servings a day of dairy products to get up to that level whereas the world Health Organization has a step back and looked at the bigger global picture and they noticed what it's actually been known for quite a few decades\nThat the countries that consume the most dairy and have the highest calcium and takes actually have the highest fracture it's in the world that's northern Europe in the United states in countries that do not consume dairy\nAnd have a much lower calcium and takes the story of course are getting some calcium or they have the lowest fracture rights so we I think we can't conclude from that kind of study that\nA calcium and ... cause it's fractures but it does say pretty clearly that we don't need to have these very high and takes a calcium and Jerry to ... to be able to have low rates of fractures\nUK looked at the evidence and they came up with seven hundred milligrams of calcium instead of five hundred milligrams that the world Health Organization sued was adequate far below the U. S.\nNumbers so whether we need five hundred seven hundred I think is uh that's probably closer to uh the correct answer not to twelve hundred milligrams and of course if we need seven hundred or you can get to that with a if you're ever going to die without any\nDairy products at all but one serving of dairy would be fine and I think if you're concerned about calcium or five hundred milligrams a day dose could be a pretty good dose or it will easily given that we all pick up some calcium from lots of different foods that were easily get us to seven or eight hundred milligrams a day\nDr Willett\nIf my memory serves me correctly you grew up on a dairy farm in the mid west and I grew up on a dairy farm in Pennsylvania so I'm very fond of dairy products uh I'm I'm curious as to whether you think we have\nThat number again eight hundred seven three two twin the three thirty four on line and people's pharmacy dot com\nYou can also download the free potash provide genes or from our Web

osteoporosis or our supplements a waste of time and money\nOur guest is Dr Walter Willett professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T H Chan School of public health\nDr Willett is also professor of medicine at Harvard Medical school he's co author of eat drink and be healthy to Harvard Medical school guide to healthy eating updated and expand it\nDr Willett [laughter] you know the vitamin D story is so fascinating to me because\nThe epidemiology and you are sort of in some respects you know the father of epidemiology and the twenty first century I mean you've been guiding so many um of your medical students and your colleagues in this field\nThe epidemiology suggested vitamin D is essential for so many things and yet some of the randomized double blind placebo controlled trial suggests that just\nAdding vitamin D may not be producing the benefits that we expect and there are a bunch of studies that are in process right now so we'll have to wait to see the results but if taking vitamin D\nDoesn't lead to the outcomes that we would hope for\nWhat does this say about sort of a natural process of actually getting sun exposure to boost your vitamin D levels it'll drive the dermatologist crazy but is it possible that the supplements won't live up to expectations\nAnd it's certainly possible that the subtle and she won't do what we think they might do based on blood levels that more reflect\nA sunlight exposure but there are major problems were randomized trials when it comes to studying nutrition and ... the supplies to some other areas as well but ah probably first and foremost that when we look at cancer\nThis is a process that developed over many decades and most randomized trials go on for just three or four or five years\nAnd for looking at cancer cardiovascular disease or that's just a little tiny window in a in a process that goes on for for many decades and it's easily possible effect we will miss some benefits they're entitled to just one example\nThat are most of the randomized trials for not showing that vitamin supplements benefit cardio\nMost of the randomized trials of not showing that vitamin supplements benefits cardiovascular disease but for the physicians health study this was one study that went on for twelve years\nAnd a little bit longer for some people there was a significantly lower risk\nOf a total cancer incidence we're taking a multiple vitamin supplements in that study looking in that study for the it'd only going on for eight years so that would not have been seen was a modest benefit but still an eight or ten percent reduction and tore cancer incidence is actually pretty important\nAnd it would have been missed in every other study that's been done just simply on the basis of a not being long enough so I think many of the trials are naive ah\nOne of the problems is of course that and many of the trials even by four or five years many people are not no longer taking supplements so you're really not testing that hypothesis that people get tired of it you need a lot of commitment and the physician's self study was people who are really very committed they were physicians you knew it long term studies were important and so that\nThe long term study was possible also there's the issue that\nWhen we give a nutritional supplement uh it's not like a new drug were the people getting placebo are not getting any of that drug\nBut in the context of a nutritional study of almost everybody's getting some of the nutrients that were testing and so many people already may have sufficient intake of that nutrient and adding more producers\nWill expect no benefit if they already have enough but it may be that there's twenty or thirty percent or even ten percent who are not getting enough and would benefit for more and that would be missed in almost every study that's been done because there's not enough statistical power to pick up the benefits in\nA even a fairly substantial sums up [noise] so all these problems of to ration of this study compliance are adherence to taking the supplement and and the fact that in the background many people are already getting enough of what's being tested all those factors go together to make it really difficult to do\nIs strong studies in giving a supplement a in a randomized trial context\nThat they will it it's clear that a cancer development in the long term process the development of heart disease can take place after many years\nOsteoporosis is also something that doesn't happen overnight it it builds up gradually we recently like yesterday I think got an email from a woman named Mary who said\nThat she um has been diagnosed with osteoporosis she broke her shoulder and that's what led them to the diagnosis Seventy nine years old and vitamin E. three level is sixty three she says I'm assuming she actually means or twenty five I dropped the vitamin D\nAnd she says I Can't take the best spots beneath that my doctor has prescribed they just make me sick what can I Do to improve my bones\n[noise] well it's really hard to be specific about any specific guys share and it goes situations worse in ... we'd want to know a lot more about a person that low blood levels ... grams per a leader is\nPretty good vitamin D level and it's the team's probably unlikely that more vitamin D is going to be beneficial and of course calcium intake is a\nNecessary one would want to know if a person is getting adequate calcium from their diet and if not at a modest supplement that\nMight be good or changing a diet is another possibility\nModest supplement that\nMight be good or changing a diet is another possibility and for going to have some dairy yet there's a lot of evidence suggesting that yogurt is a pretty good for him\nTo get the dairy some of these drugs do have access to the end and can't be tolerated but I think when we're really need to look at the overall picture about one factor that\nIs absolutely important and comes through an every study is that physical activity helps build up bones and reduce fracture risk it reduces fracture is both by reducing the risk of falling through improving muscle strength\nAnd also bones respond to the mile stresses of physical activity by essentially getting stronger so the one thing that surely should be part of the package for everybody is to incorporate\nA physical activity and that but it's important to remember that\nIt's really stressing the bones\nSo that out walking around or jogging or jumping will help your legs and\nHelp prevent hip fractures but that won't have the upper arms or the upper body and the arms\nSo uh it's important as as we get older to include resistance training that gives a little bit of a workout to all the bones in our body and you can do that with some rubber band kind of a simple exercises you don't need to even go to a gym to do that but with some but simple strength building as\nA as lots benefits and refresh reduction is probably one of those and often ignored\nYou pointed out that it's important to get enough calcium in your diet and you mentioned the benefits of yoga but what about people who don't tolerate milk even yogurt they may be lactose intolerant perhaps they're allergic there's there's quite a few of them now where else in the diet do they get their calcium\nAnd we'd get calcium through a lot of different foods but for the green leafy vegetables are particularly\nGood source whole grains have a modest amount it with a a diet that is what we think is sort of healthy Mediterranean diet with whole grains fruits and vegetables or a a a maybe a little bit of cheese or yogurt or if you're a ... if you'd like to us intolerant you usually tend to have some\nCheese and modest amounts her which is an option but you can get quite a bit of calcium without any dairy products however if you're concerned a modest calcium does I think it's reasonable ... supplement uh like five hundred milligrams\nA day to add to the background died that will usually get people up to her at least around eight hundred\nMilligrams a day of calcium and the and the calcium is absorbed I I think supplements are reasonable way of calcium is really the focus and compared to dairy there is no calories there is no saturated fat and it costs a whole lot less so I Do think for some people are modest calcium does is is a reasonable thing", "show_name": "People's Pharmacy", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "20"}
