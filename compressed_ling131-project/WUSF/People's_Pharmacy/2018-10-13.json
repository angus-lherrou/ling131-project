their backpacks or on their bicycles and I think okay so this is a young person's thing but that's a misconception that\nThat's a big misconception there's so many misconceptions about yoga and one of the biggest misconceptions is that yoga and posture it's anonymous that somehow when people say I'm doing yoga it means they're doing postures and yoga is so much more that\nIt means they're doing postures and yoga is so much more than that I'm postures or just one of the elements of the yoga tool kit [noise] they're really for me now to mention the yoga tool kit their postures which is\nWhat everyone thinks about and knows there's breathing which is hugely important there's meditation again very important and then there are principles in yoga that don't get recognized very often um\nAnd as I've I've practiced I'm sixty four now and I've been practicing for more than forty years and it's throughout my yoga journey the principles of yoga things like contentment and gratitude and non harming have become more and more an important part of the practice well\nPharmacy dot com to people's pharmacy has brought you in part by brain gauge developed by you're a scientist at the University

training program and co author of relax into yoga for seniors\nFor previous book was yoga sparks\nOne hundred eight easy practices for stress relief in a minute or less Carol in a minute or less how is that possible\nGel if you can breathe you can practice yoga and if you're doing some mindful breathing that takes a minute I'm and there's so many things that that are can be a part of a yoga practice that you might not even recognize for example if um if\nYou let someone in front of you in line you know they're a someone that is a yoga practice that I'm a practice of a party ... of letting someone else go first\nUm as I was saying earlier the principals have yoga being content looking at what's right instead of what's wrong these are all part of the yoga practice so this is what I outlined in the book so their pastors breathing meditation and these little principles\nFor the finger it's so interesting to me is that\nDuring the course of the day they're all kinds of little stressors and little interruptions and you're cut off in traffic or you know just all you know some political craziness that just happens and the idea of being able to take just a minute 'cause we're all in such a hurry\nTo sort of let that stress go through a yoga practice it sounds very appealing even for people who don't want to do poses\nAbsolutely and your example of getting cut off in traffic is a perfect one or Thirty years ago when I before I was a this deeply into the yoga journey if somebody cut me off in traffic\nMy response might be to thrust my hand out the window and make a gesture I I'm embarrassed to say but I was young and foolish and that might have been what I Would do if somebody would cut me off in traffic\nToday if somebody cut me off in traffic I might stop\nTake a breath and send that person some love and kindness I mean you on that person might be rushing to the hospital to care for a sick child you just don't know what their story is\nAnd the effect of the difference between thrusting my hand out the window and making a gesture\nAnd taking a breath and just sending a prayer for love and kindness can you see how the difference in my own physiology huge on there and that's a huge\nHuge difference in your reaction which is what you have control over and who knows even if they're just a thoughtless jerk they may need loving kindness as well\nAnd when the world being nicer place if we were all letting other people in line and uh sending people loving kindness instead of\nRoad rage Carol how did you get interested in teaching yoga for seniors [noise]\nJourney to teaching yoga for seniors are started in Nineteen Ninety nine I enrolled in a yoga teacher training program it was a two year seven hundred our program a and it's part of that program we had to do some community\nProgram uh and it's part of that program we had to do some community service we had to do twelve hours of community service\nAnd for my community service I volunteered teaching yoga at the ... medical center where my husband is a cardiologist at Duke and I knew some folks there and they were very happy for me to volunteer there\nAnd this group was called um ... it was a gerontology rehabilitation program so they were mostly men because they were veterans there were some women in their sixties seventies eighties they had had heart attacks they had COPD that had diabetes these were\nPeople dealing with some serious health challenges and I walked in you know as a newly minted teacher looking at this group of older men and I thought oh my God I'm scared to death on going to kill them I Can't teach these guys ... what am I going to do [noise]\nSo I observe their calisthenics they did as part of they did an aerobics and they did weight training in this part of that\nUm calisthenics they got on all fours and they did something they called ... and slump ... Ben slump and the light will home [laughter] that's what they call that I've I've got to say that were on their hands and knees and they would arch their back up that was the hump and then they would make their spine curve down that was the slump\nAnd as a yoga practitioner and newly minted yoga teacher I realize well in yoga we call that cat cow and if they were doing that anyway if I taught it to them I probably wouldn't kill them so I I saw that many of the things they were doing in their calisthenic program were\nActually based on yoga practice it so I took those than I knew they were already doing\nAnd I added the breathing and I added the awareness and instead of volunteering there for twelve years for twelve sorry for twelve weeks I volunteered there for five years because it was really transformative they\nWere so appreciative they would come back to me and they would say my doctor says I'm doing so well whatever I'm doing I I I I should keep it up um and it was it was really amazing and one of the things that I discovered um in teaching veterans was that it's not just what you do and yoga\nIt's how you do it that really matters and because these guys were were soldiers they are soldiers athletes in our culture tend to disconnect there minding their body they have to\nYou would never break up black in in uh in karate if you were really thinking about how it might hurt you really have to kind of disconnect\nOr if they do a marathon you really have to just sort of not um disconnect to a certain extent so some of these guys really didn't know how they felt\nAnd I look at someone who would be read in the face doing opposing nice how are you are you okay yes ma'am they had no clue so teaching them how to challenge themselves but not to strain\nTeaching themselves to back off a little that was huge\nOh that's great we go to the phones in Binghamton New York Virginia would like to tell us about practicing yoga has some older adult Virginia please tell us your story [noise]\nMy hydrogen you go ahead I think I was thinking\nOf your mind to walk out of ... and she says she sort of like you got that she was forty nine now

of those things that create um bring awareness us I was a awareness to our body especially but our mind and heart even more and I think the more people develop a yoga practice\nOr or introduce the yoga they just start to see a change in them that\nYou're becoming more aware of\nMaybe better ways to live your life I'm making better decisions [noise] um and like you said Carol review the principle of the young guys and the ... the I'm finding that good versus\nIt's shown number one thousand one hundred thirty ain't that number eight hundred seven thirty two twenty three thirty

yoga for seniors teacher training program she's a yoga therapist at Duke integrative medicine in Durham North Carolina [noise]\nCarol has written extensively for numerous publications including yoga journal as well as the New York times sent the Washington Post her most recent book co authored with Kimberly Carson is relaxing to younger for seniors a six weeks program\nFor strength balance flexibility and pain relief her previous book was yoga sparks hundred eight easy practices for stress relief in a minute or less\nIf you have a question about yoga for a story you'd like to share our lives are open at eight eight eight for seven to thirty three sixty six if the lines are full and they are at the moment you can reach us through email radio at people's pharmacy dot com\nAnd Joe we have an email from Helen in West Virginia who says I've been practicing yoga for about Twenty years and I'm very pleased with several outcomes one is good posture\nI'm Still five foot seven the height I achieved in high school the other is that my balance is very good I've had some close calls on steps and I've always been able to instantly correct\nAnd finally the meditation techniques I've learned have curb my anxiety many times and here's the best part and it's in all caps yoga feels good [laughter]\nThat's wonderful and you know the the reason that people come back to doing something is because they enjoy it so to me that that's a part of the reason why we do yoga\nIs because it feels good way can be friend our bodies we can enjoy a having these bodies\nThese vehicles for our spirits\nThat's great ah we go to Dallas texas Charles welcome to the people's pharmacy\nHi thank you very much I'm I'm really interested in the program are started yoga when I was sixty two\nBecause I was having a substantial problems in my shift a walking city and I stood up and my back couldn't even touch my knees at the suggestion of a also a doctor\nWho tried to start doing some video stiff stiff showed try yoga\nAnd I've been going on every day for six days a week say on a on the ... it's been unbelievable\nI'm a I'm we've been on believable [noise] so were you able to walk without pain\nNot always going to walk without paying American Merrill do jumping jokes that I ever guns from high school\nOh that is good ... we we really do appreciate it Carol I'm\nWow well that's that's a wonderful testimonial and uh not just to you but also to your yoga teacher that is wonderful to to know that you found someone who um is clearly a very good teacher\nAnd we had a physician recommending yoga which is kind of cool because I think a lot of times\nWe get into the motive thank you all will doctors are going to recommend medications non steroid or anti inflammatory drugs or perhaps recommend an orthopedic surgeon who will do a ... a hip replacement or a new replacement so here's a physician saying hey let's try yoga first and it worked\nAnd that is that is great and part of the the reason why there's such a a moving the yoga community to research the effect\nIs because it will result in physicians making these referrals and because back pain is an area that there's very strong evidence of ethic and see a physician's referring people to yoga which is great\n[noise] we actually have an uh an email from Mary Kaye who wants to compare tai chi and yoga for seniors\nWell there are many similarities in yoga tai chi both are or what would be called a mind body\nActivity in that I'm with tai chi and with yoga you cannot be watching television and do tai chi or do yoga\nOr you might be doing tai chi moves and yoga moves while you're watching television uh but you are you're not doing the practice so you have to be completely involved with what you're doing you have to be very present in both tai chi and in yoga tai chi is a very slow\nUm\nMartial art where you're um you're staying very present you shift your weight from one side to the other so tai chi is often\nA recommended for older adults it's done and I'm Asian communities um and there's good advocacy for tai chi and balance one of the biggest differences with yoga and tai chi is tai chi as far as I'm aware as always done standing\nWhereas yoga you're in many planes of action if people can get down and up from the floor\nThey can lie down and if they can't get down enough from the floor you can do yoga in your bad but you can do yoga prone so there are movements that are done prone and ... on\nA they're also inverted movements so if you're physically able to be upside down you could do a hand standing yoga I'm not sure that they're any inverted movements and tai chi so that's a little bit of the the difference the planes of action\nOkay well we go to Ira, Texas Gail welcome to the people's pharmacy\nHi\nI'm so happy to top Carol I took your training back at Duke and number of years ago that led to say Hi\nTo [laughter]\nIs that since that time out of a sudden to yoga studios in this small farming community almost on the Oklahoma border and I have people coming from\nGreat distances because there's not a lot of yoga around here that it's so good to hear your voice again and I want you to know that your methods and your book are being shared with my classes I Do a chair yoga class twice a week and I've got a lady in there that eighty four\nBut the very best part of my other classes they all say is the ... where they can just shut everything out let their bodies come to quiet and get some time just to themselves and I ...\nCome to quiet and get some time just to themselves and I owe that to you for\nDoing so much for sharing the story for those of our listeners who don't quite know what you mean when you say chair yoga can you explain\nWell we do a lot of the positives from the chair\nWe're sitting down and we can do a lot of upper body where we can stretch our orange and Nixon round airbags like in cat cow\nWe use the chair also to get down to the floor and there was a specific way that I was taught their due to stand with your hands and that little finger on the slaves were the legs attach and we practice that in standing\nThey use the chair as they get down to the floor foot one day down than the other day I and I had one person who's now deceased and I toss her that that if they ever fell in their house to get to a place where they can pull themselves up\nAnd I was told that that he did that and and was able to do that before she passed and so it it helps throughout the life that that we have left\nAnd inquiring minds when a no deal do you have any farmers and that farming community doing yoga\n[laughter] that was not good choices\nI Do have a I have to ... per person down the road from me his name is Mike He has had a valve replacement and he came to yoga course with the encouragement of his allies and they both did yoga for a while he's now in cardiac rehab and has said that you know he'll come back to yoga when he\nCan he's he's involved in that right now and even my husband who was a farmer did classes when Mike was coming but you're right it's more women on encourage him in a because my husband is also a golfer and it helps with his shoulders and back when he gets a little bit stiffed um golf\nThanks so much for your call\nIt was a delightful to hear from you Gail and I'm so appreciative to hear that the techniques that we've been teaching\nAt Duke are making their way a out into the world because what my experience has been I'm working with older adults in people with health challenges is hearing\nFar too many times from people who say oh I went to a yoga class my doctor said let's go to yoga class so I went to this gym or this why or something and I I got hurt and the reality is that um if people are older adults who are have health challenges\nI'm walking into just any yoga class may not be the most advisable thing you want to be working with a teacher who has been\nTrained to work with older adults and people with health challenges because many of the postures that are commonly done in yoga classes may not be appropriate when people have um hypertension or they have a low bone density and", "show_name": "People's Pharmacy", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "13"}
