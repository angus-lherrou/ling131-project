children's attention\nParents may wish to take the opportunity to direct the children's attention elsewhere\nOur guest is Dr Eric Gottfried a Harvard educated medical doctor and board certified gynecologist with more than twenty five years of experience her books include the hormone cure the hormone read set diet and younger\n[noise] doctor Godfrey I think that um\nThere's a lot of confusion around hormones in general and testosterone in particular\nThere for a while there were TV commercials that were sort of highlighting ... low testosterone levels low T I think the way they refer to them and then the FDA got very excited and those those commercials seem to disappear pretty quickly the FDA basically said\nDoctors do not prescribe testosterone two men unless they have a real serious condition\nJust having low testosterone that doesn't count\nAnd there's all kinds of warnings about heart attacks and strokes are just all kinds of scary stuff around testosterone\nI Wonder if you have any thoughts about testosterone supplementation for men especially if they have low key and then ... has a question about testosterone supplementation for women [noise]\nSure well I think that's one of those situations where the pendulum swings toward testosterone and that away from it and in part I think that's in a context of one of the biggest studies that was published on hormone since time for women the women's health initiative\nSo let me talk about that for a moment then I'll come back to men because in two thousand to about twenty three percent of American women were taking hormone therapy and then when the results came out that synthetic hormones and studied in the winter health initiative were dangerous and provocative\nMuch of the time it lead to millions of women stopping their hormones\nAnd when you dropping their hormones do mean stopping after June ...\n[noise] that's right sent synthetic versions so what would studied in women's health initiative with ... and ... they're kind of I think of them it's the doubles we know\nSo we went from twenty three percent taking hormones to five percent which I think it's too low I think we actually need to be somewhere in the middle but the other thing that this did besides scaring millions of women and getting them off their hormones is that it made the FDA\nSo sensitive and so fearful of recommending hormone therapy without long term randomized trials to support the use of it and so I think we're now living in a post women's health initiative era\nWhere we don't have enough option we don't have enough\nConsensus around Safeway and to prescribe\nThings like testosterone for men or even testosterone for women so I think you know it's an unfortunate situation you know I'm not as current with the literature on little tea and men and Andrew pause means of testosterone therapy I certainly have patients who are on it\nUm and my sense is often this comes down to a quality of life decision and I can tell you you know I'm not a fan of men frosting themselves an excessive testosterone that's never a good idea\nBut for men who have a low level of testosterone and that's well documented and we're getting them back into the city logic range\nI think there's a strong argument\nTo be made for that approach\n[noise] let me ask you about testosterone for women because the FDA has pretty much discouraged its use and yet my understanding yes\nMuch discouraged its use and get my understanding is that for some women just really can make a difference for a low libido has that been your experience and is there evidence that that's the case [noise]\nThere is evidence so ... you know what I can speak to you from the evidence from what we know from the scientific literature and then I can also speak to you as a clinician on the front lines who prescribes testosterone for women\nAnd so in the first category you're right the FDA has really there's no FDA approved form of testosterone for women everything that's FDA approved it's for men and sometimes we\nYou know cut patches and do other things to try to make it work for women but the doses are very high and it just doesn't translate and this is based on a few randomized trials the one that stands out in my mind is one from the Massachusetts General hospital by ...\nWhere she showed that women after hysterectomy and after having their ovaries removed\nThat's you know the political situation where you're estrogen Andrew testosterone goes down to a very low level in those women if you get them at testosterone patch they end up having sex about once more per month compared to women not on the shots from patch\nSo this study it's what made the FDA turned down approval of the classroom patch for women this with maybe ten or Fifteen Years ago\nAnd we've really not had a lot of activities since then [noise] now the problem is just looking at how often you have intercourse isn't the best measure of a woman sexual experience and so\nThis has been kind of authority tricky issue and clinically the way that I've dealt with it is to say to my patients\nYou know what we're going to do first and we are going to get your hormones back in the balance starting first with estrogen and ... and ... song thyroid\nAnd I'm going to see where you are with your libido if you still have decreased libido and I have with that I measure that\nThen we may want to consider added on sometimes tossed room cream and I tell them you know looks and there's no FDA approved formulation for this so it means that we're basically involved in the ... an experiment here but I can also tell you after taking care of twenty five thousand patients\nThat I have a lot of patients who are on testosterone cream and say that it improves for their quality of life improves their sex life it improves their connection with their partner\nSo that the potential risks are worth it [noise] so those risks are things like liver function issues so I follow liver enzymes every uh six weeks to twelve weeks on my patients who are taking testosterone\nThere's also some very limited data that there may be small increased risk of breast cancers that we do everything we can from\nGenomic testing to buy a marker testing to reduce that risk of breast cancer as low as possible but those are some of the risks and it ends up being a quality of life decision that we renegotiate every three to six months when I see them in office\n[noise] there there may be some very specific situations where you would say well probably you don't want to take this risk or are you sure you really want to take this risk for example someone who is making her living as a singer\nI'm might not want to risk the possibility that to doctrine would change her vocal Tambor [noise]\nThat's right I mean the votes the voice lowering the fact is one of those risks that as part of informed consent with testosterone therapy [noise] but I can also tell you that with my patients I'm so careful to make sure that we're in the middle\nI'm so careful to make sure that we're\nIn the middle of the since the electric range and so side effects related to um what I Would call ... symptoms though that's total medical language translated for you\nSo for patients who have a voice Laurie in effect that tends to be when you're a super physiologic so you have levels of testosterone that are beyond the normal range\nAnother um sign of having too much testosterone is increased size of the color so you know we're watching for those things it's part of the informed consent but if you have a patient who's within that physiologic range the chance that have very low\n[noise] doctor Godfrey a lot of women are aware that they may experience some changes in sexual function around menopause off\nBut I think that most people have an idea that once you're past menopause you're not interested in sex anymore that's really not a reasonable assumption is it [noise] well\nIs there such a personal decision I Believe and I you know I'm careful not to take my own value to my own attitude about sex and projected onto my patients so certainly I have patients who go through metal pots and they have made the decision that the shop is closed [laughter]\nBut I Would say I would say that's the minority [noise] most of the patients I'm taking care of they really see\nSex not in isolation but as part of this larger picture of wellness and thriving and so you get older and I certainly see it that way I think it's you know just one facet of all the different systems that we're trying to optimize as you age\nYou can also download the free podcast from I Choose for from power Web store\nWe invite you to consider writing refused to people\nFantasy

your brain dot com\nToday we're discussing women's health issues particularly with regard to sexuality we're talking about political problems that may not be suitable for young listeners many medications can interfere with libido and sexual satisfaction are people warned about such side effects when they get a prescription\nOur guest is Dr Sara got fried she's a board certified gynecologist with more than twenty five years of experience her books include the hormone killer the hormone reset diet and younger\n[noise] doctor Godfrey ... you mentioned that when you went to your family physician with some of the problems that you're experiencing the answer was an anti depressant\nAnd you also mentioned that some of your patients come in with mood disorders and I suspect that a lot of health care professionals would prescribe an anti depressant for someone who complained of feeling down in the dumps\nThe only trouble with those drugs is that they have a fairly high rate\nOf sexual dysfunction\nA four men it may be an inability to achieve workouts and but that may be true for women as well and it may also lower libido so can you give us a your perspective on many of the medications that are prescribed that have this\nPerhaps unexpected and on disgust I mean this is not something a lot of health\nProfessionals like to talk about oh I'm I'm prescribing you Prozac and by the way it might ruin your love life how do you deal with that\n\nLove this question so I you know I think if you look at\nThe most unbiased data on antidepressants and their role in depression which you find is that they're often worse than placebo in terms of the fact that nuts for mild to moderate depression for severe depression I think they can make an argument to prescribe but\nThe majority of patients that icy have mild to moderate depression and I think they have no business being prescribed in anti depressant I think they they need lifestyle medicine they need treatments that are designed to help them with the level of inflammation in their body which\nIs at the root of why they feel depressed\nSo you know we we live in an era with a broken healthcare system if I'd step back for a moment and\nI Know because I trained within it so I'm trained as a traditional physician and it's a it's an era of a pill for every hill and I think we found that this strategy has failed\nWe need a different strategy we know that about Seventy percent of health care costs are lifestyle related\nAnd I think is a really good example so if we just if we just look at the ...\nIt is a really good example so if we just if we just look at the hormonal drivers of mood for a moment we know that about fifty percent of people who are depressed have high cortisol levels\nIs that being checked by every primary care doctor who sees the patient who complains of depression no we know that about twenty percent of patients with depression have\nA low thyroid a function and that is tested a little more often but you know I I think it's\nTo me it's crucial to do a root cause now so it's when you have a patient with the mood issue and to look at what I consider and women at least to be the hormonal Charlie's Angels to look at cortisol to look at thyroid\nAnd look it up and so for so many women will for all women estrogen and it's a master regulator and when you start to make less of it beginning in your forties sometimes in your fifties\nIt can cause mood issues and so to me the first treatment should be to get those hormones back in the balance not to reach for the Prozac or some other anti depressant\nSo you're right I mean I Wish that every patient was given\nFull informed consent about the adverse risks of being prescribed antidepressants I think we\nUnfortunately just live in a time where the average appointment with a a doctor in the u._s. it's seven minutes and it's often faster and quicker to prescribe the Prozac or whatever selects or whatever the new anti depressant is rather than to really get to the root cause well\nOnto suspecting that you have a number of patients who have come in your office and after you get done talking with him and eventually they say well you I Am having some libido issues and and sex isn't like it used to be\nYou find out that yeah they're taking some ball to or they're taking so Alexa or they're taking lecture pro or filling the blank there were a dozen of them and millions or tens of millions of people are relying on these medications on a daily basis whether\nThey're helpful or not how do you how do you interact with a patient who is complaining of sexual dysfunction but has been on it into depression for months or years\nWell we know we know from the best statistics that went in for American women over the age of forty and taking antidepressants and that's the number is double in my practice so about half my patients come in taking an anti depressant so what I Do is\nI'm not someone who immediately removed every pharmaceutical that a patient is taking I don't think that served them well\nBut what we want to do is take a look at\nOK what's happening with your body right now where it's working well what ... what some of the intelligent design that we can enhance\nWhat's happening with your Mormons and could we start to naturally balance those hormones and once you start feeling better start to withdraw the anti depressant so there's some antidepressants that she can stop and not have dramatic withdrawal symptoms from\nThere are others where that's far less the case such as like the pro and so I have a strategy that I use with\nBalancing hormones and also you know not just for the woman's but what's happening in terms of the nutrients are you eating the foods that support a good mood are you getting the exercise that you need which I think it's one of the best form of anti depressant\nI think of it not as you know it's good for your heart but it's also incredibly good for your mood you know what about your connection with others are used socially isolated purpose and meaning so it's to me it's a much broader context from which to discuss whether someone should continue taking an antidepressant and similar to\nWhat I said about taking hormones\nIt's not a yes no answer it\nWhat I said about taking hormones it's not a yes no answer it's more okay you've been taking the symbol to for ten years how do you feel on it what were you like before\nHave you gained weight what can we do to support you better what are your goals do you want to get off that you know not just going to project my own views about anti depressant on to all of my patients so that gives you a little flavor I Hope of how I approach this in my practice\n[noise] absolutely on ... you have mentioned rude cause ... so I'm guessing that all these things go into your root cause analysis [noise]\nYes definitely you know I I started with\nFood [laughter] and it's I feel like food and such important information for your body I don't think of it as calories I don't think of it is you know fuel I think of it as information for your DNA tell us more about that if you would please sure [noise]\nWell you know I think if you look at\nAn ancestral health perspective we had a certain way of eating\nIn our paleolithic times that was a good match for DNA and what's happened in the past especially one hundred years is that the way that we've eaten has dramatically completely changed\nNow that is also along with the change that we talked about earlier with stress with high perceived stress\nAnd the two kind of are in lockstep so I'm a big fan of starting first with someone's diet and that doesn't ... it doesn't matter whether they're coming Sunni because of decreased will be no or they're coming to see me because they want to reduce the risk of breast cancer or\nUm they're having menopausal symptoms and can't sleep at night it doesn't really matter what the chief complaint is what matters is you know this kind of systems beings to Nelson starting first with food so I Want to know where your nutrients coming from when are you eating what are you eating whom are you eating with\nAnd how can we take where you are right now and make sure\nThat you're getting the nutrients that you need the macro nutrients micro nutrients the copper zinc selenium
