such as a lever a bill both these insurgents have some pretty serious side effects especially when you use them every day for years what else can you do for sore knees hips and fingers\nTo learn more

... radio at people's pharmacy dot com but number again ... eight eight for seven to thirty three sixty six\nThat the genesis we understand it osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis can you tell us what we're talking about here what is it do we have any idea what causes it um\n[noise] well it's a complicated question um I think we don't know with a hundred percent certainty what causes\nReally almost any form of arthritis\nWe know that osteoarthritis or the the incidence of osteoarthritis increases as we age so I think aging plays a very important part of that but we used to think about osteoarthritis as sort of wear and tear up the joints\nBut it turns out that that paradigm is is probably not true I mean certainly aging and using your joints may increase the risk that you damage your joints but not everybody who ages or over uses their joints gets that kind of damage so we think there are probably a very complicated\nI'm a matrix of of causes number one might be genetics we know that if you have a first degree relatives that has osteoarthritis you are at higher risk\nUm there may be some um association with other co morbidities with trauma early in life so if you had a joint injury that sets you up for osteoarthritis so that the conscious may be a very varied and different in many different patients so I Know one of the costs\nMaybe I'm very varied and different in many different patients\nSo I Know one of the controversies has been around exercise so you do long distance runners have a greater likelihood of coming down with osteoarthritis of the knees or the hips\nAnd it's my understanding it's not very clear that not every athlete develops arthritis but those who are engaged in sports like football where they're going to damage their joints they may be a greater risk\n[noise] yes that's true that's actually been some really nice studies of older runners um men and women in their sixties and really we don't see 'em a significant increase and osteoarthritis mostly in the news that we look at it in those cases [noise]\nPharmacy is brought you in part by brain gauge developed by newer a scientist at the University of North Carolina to

immunology at the medical school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n[noise] doctor Janice we think about arthritis in terms of joint pain are there other areas of the body that are affected especially by the inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis [noise]\nAbsolutely and and when we think about rheumatoid arthritis we really think about it as a multi system disease it does not just affect the joints and sometimes patients are surprised about that um many times a patience with rheumatoid arthritis will have involvement of their eyes and they'll have very dry eyes\nAnd many patients don't think to tell their rheumatologist about that\nUm and I think that's very important and sometimes the dryness can be very very profound\nRheumatoid arthritis can also involve the lungs many patients with rheumatoid arthritis will have interest is your lung disease or inflammation of their lungs for most patients it's not clinically important but rarely some patients can have very severe lung disease that can be life threatening\nUm it can involve the nervous system um it can involve the heart of and we know that inflammation in general\nCan lead to cardiovascular disease and that's true in rheumatoid arthritis and really other forms of autoimmune diseases such as lupus um that we often see an increased rate of cardiovascular disease even among young women\nAnd we have a um an email from Melissa who says I cured my mild rheumatoid arthritis by curing my leaky got so perhaps the digestive tract as involved as well\nYeah there's been a lot of interest in looking at\nUm what we eat and are a sort of got micro Flora and whether that may play a role in\nBody inflammation um I think we're not sort of there yet in terms of making recommendations but I certainly have heard these stories where people have sort of mild systemic inflammation whether it's been diagnosed as arthritis or not and they change their diet and they feel better\nUm and you can't refute that but what's behind that is not really clear will\nThis idea of leaky got is a little\nIt sounds better if we say intestinal permeability it's and it's more a more acceptable and to have the gastroenterologist I'll tell you yeah we see this um eight eight eight\nFor seven to three three six six is the phone number to call if you'd like to join the conversation we go to Dallas texas Lucy welcome to the people's pharmacy what's this about swimmers me we've heard of ... year but me\nI uh I've enjoyed my entire life in college I'm going to college I have a\nFormal author artist and I said it's because\nOf wear and tear of joined a brush stroke since I was five\nAnd now I'm having actually I've noticed in my fifties and I was wondering if I'm not covered or logical problems I don't know if that's really where it is but it's a chronic condition as you go to the only thing I ever told me is\nPainkillers injections and ah as I Am planning for is for driving for over a decade\nDr Janice\nOver a decade sector\nJanice you want to respond to I'm Lucy at all well we can't diagnose of course we can't diagnose and of course we can't tell her what she should be taking but we might tell her what she should be asking her doctors\nSo it's interesting I I have to say that I've not heard of swimmers need but when I think about swimming we think about it being relatively safe form of exercise for people with arthritis\nAnd so it does make me wonder whether a there might have been you know obviously if you've been a a very avid swimmer ends you know what I'm very regularly and maybe I'm had an injury to some of the supporting structures maybe ligaments or tendons and sometimes\nA injury to some of the supporting structures can lead to arthritis later in life and that and I think about this I'm Wondering whether that might have been the case um I I I think the question to ask to physicians that are caring for you would be\nYou know what form of arthritis are we talking about it sounds like it might be osteoarthritis but I Can't tell for certain um and you're right that that the the alternatives 'em and choices for therapy are very limited so anti inflammatory as other ...\nLocal injections but I Would say exercise and physical therapy might be very helpful\nFor you very much and good luck Lucy or here's a question for you Dr Joe's because what Lucy is raising is is intriguing to me and that is how do rheumatologist such as you and your colleagues\nDiagnose whether it's rheumatoid arthritis one of those other inflammatory forms of arthritis or osteoarthritis how do you figure out what's going on both tests what else you do\n[noise] so actually blood tests are really not that helpful um we really talk to our patients I think that's the most important thing we do is we find out when did it start\nHow did it happen what has been your experience in terms of pain or stiffness do you have other medical problems that might predispose you to one or another form of arthritis or a lot of what we do is really talking to patients\nAnd finding out more about what's going on with them and then doing a physical examination in between our history with the patient and the physical examination we're pretty close we can get pretty close to a diagnosis X rays sometimes MRIs and blood tests may\nI support our diagnosis but we're not going to make a diagnosis really on any test\nWell when you talk about I'm predisposed and conditions we do have an email from Jean in Elizabeth West Virginia she wants to know if there's any connection between a past diagnosis every medic fever and rheumatoid arthritis now [noise] so\nI don't think so um rheumatic fever really um it's a very interesting disease that we're seeing more in the western world now we used to not see this very much but it's it's a it's coming back and we've seen it a few times\nUm patients with rheumatic fever I'm have a response to an infection has struck the cocktail infection and they can develop an acute form of arthritis [noise] um and then off and have a cardiovascular disease but I don't think that that's a predispose you to development of rheumatoid arthritis\nMale Lucy also mentioned that she'd gotten injections\nAnd I'm guessing that injections into the joint with something like a cortical steroid are not uncommon I Know that a lot of my tennis buddies who have injuries we'll get an injection maybe into their back maybe into the hip maybe into their knee\nI've heard that that can be counterproductive on occasion can you help us understand the the benefits and risks of a cortisone type injection into a joint\nThere's no doubt that many patients with arthritis will get good\nTo a joint there's no doubt that many patients with arthritis will get good relief with a steroid injection and for some patients that can last a good long time so it's a very good option for many patients\nThe concern is is that over time often there is a set of laws diminishing returns and so they last\nYou know they don't last as long as they did initially and so people get repeated injections there's some concern that repeated critical steer injections into a joint may increase the risk of the development of osteoarthritis the data around that are really not altogether clear\nAnd we go back to the phones in Aberdeen South Carolina Maggie welcome to the people's pharmacy your question please [noise]\nHello Hi I'm I guess I actually have two questions I'm\nThe first is because I have ... I have osteoarthritis uh do do you know genetics on both sides and I'm In my mid fifties have had to hip replacements\nAnd looking at a potential for a knee replacement um is there a cure for osteoarthritis or is it just a degenerative disease that you can only really just manage the pain\nSo the simple answer is no there is no cure\nYet I think our understanding of the pathogenesis the disease has increased substantially over the last years and we're now identifying targets for therapeutics so\nI think that there will be at some time in the future I don't know when what we call it disease modifying drug for osteoarthritis but we are not there yet and you have a second question for us Maggie\nTo people's pharmacy has brought you in part by brain gauge developed by you're a scientist at the University of North Carolina to attract brain health home research and clinical applications are available homes subscription options are also available online at gauge your brain dot\nCom today we're talking about arthritis our guest is Dr ... joined us the reeds foundation distinguished professor of medicine and chief of the division every mythology allergy and immunology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill\nShe's also a rheumatologist with a UNC Thurston arthritis Research Center and director of the un see real mythology fellowship training program\nIf you have a question about arthritis or a story you'd like to share alliance or open at eight eight eight for seven to three three six six if the lines are full you can reach us by email we're at radio at people's pharmacy dot com\nThat Janice topical and sent in fact in the U.S I think there's only one that's approved and that would be that close to al ...\nAnd what's amazing is if you go to Italy if you go to France if you go almost anywhere in the world can\nBuy them without a prescription ya so people who travel do sometimes stock up [laughter]\n[noise] yeah so they can actually be very helpful and as we were talking about before the break we know that oral and sets have significant side effects particularly on the gastrointestinal tract\nAnd particularly an older patients we like to use ... because they can be very helpful and really do not cause any GI irritation so in that regard I think they were very very helpful [noise]\nThey're very useful for um the small joints and a button maybe not as much so for the large joins I think they're worth a try for patients because they really do have much less toxicity systemically than the oral drugs\nSo perhaps better fingers and thumbs than for hips or and knees are maybe in between\nRight so it's probably not so much the hip is joined us so far away from your skin yeah that I Can't imagine that the that the drug is going to actually get there that\nPeople have told us that they're nice sometimes go a little better and even elbows but what do you think about the FDA warning because when you look at that warning in the prescribing information it makes it seem as if the topic goes are just as dangerous as the\nMorals and I don't get it it's interesting I don't think I've ever read the package insert for the topical so you know this is really it it's interesting but I think again\nTheir prescription medicines you're going to have a discussion with your physician about you know your individual health care and I think most physicians would say that in terms of the safety they're much more safe and in fact if you look at the guidelines\nFrom any of the major organizations regarding the treatment of osteoarthritis they are preferred particularly an older individuals because of their\nMore favorable toxicity profile\nAnd we go back to the phones Rick in Tampa, Florida what's your question please\n[noise] fellow I read I like that I think you might call I Want to go to the doctor\nI think you might call I Want to go to the doctor if there's any reason a research in genetics on genetic markers which could a folk show medicine approach to treating it possibly even preventing arthritis [noise]\nSo there's been a lot of research looking at genetics and not data goes back a good long way and I think the\nYou know probably the strongest a genetic marker that we know of are the class to antigens a chili DR antigens in\nThe pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis having said that\nUm as I mentioned earlier in the show the genes are such a small part of why we develop arthritis it's hard for me to imagine that engineering that on the front end is going to make a big difference in the long run so you know we've been looking at genetics probably good data for a good twenty five years and I think that\nThat's unlikely to be you know I'm a cure if you will\nWell speaking of a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis you can turn on television and see a whole bunch of commercials for these disease modifying drugs or what we call the TANF walkers some of them you mirror being one of the classics\nAnd the most popular at the moment can you tell us a little bit about the use drugs because they really have changed the game when it comes to rheumatoid arthritis [noise]\nAbsolutely and I think we're now in your twenty of the use of biologic demar it's the first one was the ...\nAnd you mentioned uh adult let me a map and there are many many other ones now you said ... what does that stand for the Mars or disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs um and this is a unique class um the biologic march that target specific\nCompounds that we think are important and uh the development of inflammation and in the case of\nThese drugs are primarily targeting tea an effort to win a closest factor alpha [noise]\nAnd we know that TNN is an important a mediator of inflammation and pain in rheumatoid arthritis and these drugs have really revolutionized the way we treat rheumatoid arthritis\nNot only do they decrease pain and inflammation\nThey also prevent destruction of the joint and so\nYou know twenty five years ago it was not uncommon for folks with rheumatoid arthritis to develop significant amounts of joint damage really in a short period of time\nAnd now we know if we can identify patients early get them started on effective therapy we can prevent joint damage once the first therapy you would use for rheumatoid arthritis [noise]\nSo the first therapy I use is education I think people need to understand what their diseases what makes it better what makes it worse and the kinds of therapies that are out there\nBut the first line the more that we often uses metal ... which is not a biologic medicine it's an oral medicine or can be given by injection it's once a week and it has been shown to be very effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and we've known that really since the Nineteen eighties\nUm but ... we are you know sort of first line in rheumatoid arthritis got to family members taking at my father for ... arthritis and my sister for her rheumatoid arthritis mhm absolutely\nThere are though many patients who don't respond to method trick said alone so combination therapies are often used after that if it's not effective for the addition of these biologic therapies um after that when\nYou watch TV you see the commercials and they warn you about the dangers infections and fungal infections and they even mentioned lymphoma if I'm not mistaken a kind of blood cancer so um how dangerous are they uh\nSir so um how dangerous are they are I think back to the days of of cortisone in the fifties and how we thought oh quarters or was this revolutionary drug for rheumatoid arthritis and it came in kind of business and the bus\n[noise] absolutely but we now have Twenty years of good experience so um I think for certain the TANF inhibitors and other biologic drugs and there are other classes now\nCertainly increase the risk of infection and we worry about tuberculosis we worry about fungal infections and so vigilance about infections while you're on these drugs and very very important [noise]\nThe kids are story um is not altogether clear we know that patients with rheumatoid arthritis regardless of the ... of whether they've been on any of these medicines are at higher risk for lymphoma and leukemia so teasing out how much of this is the underlying disease and how much of the drug is unclear\nBut I have um you know a sense that the risk of cancer lymphoma leukemia saw cancers is actually not um significantly increased and there are now a lot of epidemiologic studies out there that are really supporting that but infection absolutely\nJoe emails to ask if women are more susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis\nThey absolutely are two to three times more susceptible to rheumatoid arthritis than men are and that's been clear for quite some\nTime what about osteoarthritis or women more susceptible to that [noise]\nUm I think it's pretty\nEven between men and women there may be times in the women's life so in the Perry menopause women go through a period where they're at higher risk um so during the life cycle men and women may have slightly different risks but I think overall um I think it's\nPretty [noise] back to the phones we go to Endicott New York James welcome to the people's pharmacy\nHello hello James\n[noise] um I had a question of dealt a\nMeditation the treatments that sixty six years old and in the late seventies it told me I knew that I was treated fairly good job or a decade would you plug your\n... your way to reach us but they sort of your story to all your ... um\nAnd I wonder do you make
