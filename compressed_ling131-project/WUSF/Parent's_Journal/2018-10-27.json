W us ask any nine point seven\nIn Ireland they say you'll never forget someone if you write a song about\nIrish remember the events end the piece of shapes their history in many traditional songs written over the poor lyrical look at some of the heroes of Ireland some real in some legendary we're joined now by singer Kathy Reichs cat he's proud Irish American she lives in the northeast corner of the public about him\nHe's with us right now and travel with Rick Steves to introduce us to some of the people that Ireland remember and it's a cat he's so good to have\nYou here it is great to be here whenever I think of you I I just think of just a joy of life in the context of Ireland how music ties in with that\nAnd I also remember you grow up in Detroit yes a Motown music I mean how did a Detroit girl gets so just swept away by traditional Irish folk music to the degree that you moved there and now you're a well known Irish folk singer\nFrom the father was a singer he came from Tipperary and he was a brilliant tenor fabulous\nAnd my mother was a musician as harsh so she always had music on the stereo playing chopping down member vinyl one after the other plummeting down and also we were members of the gay the league and the Irish American club in downtown Detroit ...\nAnd that was our community that was where we socialize so I sang my first son into a lake there when I was seven for my father for Father's Day and I would get up after that session thinking sessions where everybody sits around and they play instruments and they sing song\nAnd people don't know that about Detroit it's got a very very strong Irish population had a\nBit of Ireland in Detroit absolutely\nAnd then all the time I spent in Ireland as a child and my grandmother's kitchen and my grandfather's kitchen no television the news came on the radio otherwise it was off everything was generated by us and it was all song and story it was a magical time I'm so grateful that I got to have that experience of the kids\nOther countries have music but no other country has music quite like Ireland\nI agree a lot of people say it's because Irish music things to the heart I Believe it sings to something larger the spirits\nIt bullied the spirits of the Irish who have left through the centuries of no choice of their own to make a living and other countries to go fight in foreign wars\nIt also kept alive as you said in your introduction all of the her role with people and pride of place every single little nooks and crannies in Ireland has a song written about it it is a way to name things and to keep them sacred if you will\nSo when you drive Rhode Island does a tour guide you must be bursting with an interest in order to a new town that has a song about added to I don't\nWant people to run off the bus throw me off the bus but yes you can sing a song about everything for me it punctuate an historical talk something I'm Talking about I can say\nAnd now I like to sing this song for you but there are songs about you know winning race dogs their songs about greed horse that there are songs about people's families there are songs about death in communities drownings off the coast of ... that are heartbreaking so everything is kept in the music it's a life raft\nAnd heartbreaking is a lot of Ireland's history began to your relationship with England and\nIs a lot of Ireland's history began if your relationship with England and are just tough times and civil war once Ireland wins it's I mean just in a nutshell\nYou were subjugated by the the English for centuries you finally when your independence what a hundred years ago or so and then there's the civil war about how Ireland is going to be managed by its own people\nExactly who's side are you on do you want a completely free Ireland or we take this interim step of twenty six counties until you can get\nMore so than Nineteen sixteen rising yes big deal that was like the American revolution and yes history just a little over a hundred years ago there must be songs that bring you back to that that ... or you're Irish patriotism we're pride\nAnd even better than that right because some of the men and women who were actually on the front lines during the Easter Rising wrote the song and I'd like to sing one for you know if that's okay sure this is a song that was written by pocket peers Patrick Henry here's this one of the signatures of the proclamation of independence\nAnd it's a very powerful song you took an old melody and you wrote new words to it\nAnd he is saying to the people Greece O'Malley who was the pirate clean environment born in Fifteen thirty she wants to chief didn't offer clan and she fought hard against the dominion by Elizabeth the first she thinks she is coming over the waves and she is going to liberate you from the foreigners\nKnock people from France or Spain we are now going to have our own hero so\nShade on the bail Iraq oh they need to you\nKnow it's a you know\nOr not she had no idea well Shannon how are ya oh no she I don't\nKnow\nThat's just one verse so the Irish are going to save themselves yes and they're going to do it became Gaelic\nYes it's going to be the Gail not the French or Spanish and it's going to be green so now the and I love the corps because what he's over ...\nYou are welcome home you are welcome home now that the summer is coming the rising for them in spring with the planting of that the tea says in the last person to sound we may not live a week after that's right and they barely did we may not live a week after that but in summer will be the boom of what we've done\nSo now at this point there's already been the desperado Ireland yes spreading\nOut time gathers tend Irish people in America for every Irish person in Ireland reaction which is actually a a global call for the Irish people to recognize that absolutely is the new morning\nYes because money was being raised in America\nBy ... to bring back to support their efforts in Ireland and also a lot of the musicians there Michael Coleman brilliant fiddle player has changed the way Irish people play the fiddle his label was called republic records and they were raising money from the music to send back to Ireland [noise]\nThis is travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Kathy Reichs she'd been in the vanguard of Irish music now for more than twenty five years [noise] performer and ensembles like church the lady and she's also a solo performer\nKathy was named the Irish female vocalist of the decade to type ... dot com [noise]\nThat was born in Detroit now she goes Ireland county loves her home [noise]\nInformation about Cathy's albums and her performance sketch or on our website That's Cathy Ryan dot com\nAnd when we think about Iowa it's also a proud culture of course it's got its struggle with London to be independent\nAnd I understand that the first the printed book of Irish ballads also served as kind of a cultural document for everyone to\nIrish ballads also served as kind of a cultural document for Ireland to\nIt's a valid history of Ireland I'm not sure if it was the very first book but it was the most lauded book and the most accepted it was Thomas Davis who was one of the young Ireland there's the movement um that was very very strong the precursor actually that they would have inspired peers and condemnation and Plunkett\nWhen Ireland was starving during the great hunger Thomas Davis was writing songs about nationhood he was a pacifist he didn't believe in aggression\nHe was a Protestant as well some people listening might think oh it's between Catholic and Protestant knows the fight for iron sovereignty was Protestants and Catholics fighting together because they wanted Ireland to be so nation\nBut she wrote song and she believed\nThat the best way to serve the history of the country was through its ballot tree\nAnd I think that's true because all of the songs of Ireland struggles are ... and they still exist were still singing them they keep it in the present and also they make it very ... everybody becomes a part of this struggle or this this hope because they're singing it\nAnd you get caught up and that even the tourist whose first day in Ireland if they can find themselves into a a pub or you have a session going on that's that's really filled with locals you get caught up in it You're welcome to be caught up in this way the music invigorated the national spirit\nAbsolutely and I think one of the reasons why is because we all know in Ireland singers and musicians that it's not about off it's not the culture of celebrity that sadly we're going into now it's about the song or the June\nAnd we are serving it now if it was a great song or two and it was there before us and it will be there after so we're just playing our part in continuing the culture\nYou know when I was in Dublin recently of course you're going to hear her street musicians and your music and the\nPubs you actually hear street poets people that are standing on the street corner and don't they'll do perjury for your eye on request but yet there's a word and the thought that you've got poets who would put their poetry to music something artist's don't realize there's an extra dimension was a great Irish poets that might have been caught up in the music\nGates gates ... and I when I'm On the coach at a tour guide I've ... reciting his poetry because he sings is I Will try and\nIt's got all the makings of a tabloid headlines or an action movie to send up one of America's richest families travels to an exotic locale\nDisappears under the circumstances and is rumored to have been eaten by chemicals [noise]\nWas it true or did he grow\nAs the official reports clean [noise]\nJournalist Carl Hoffman was determined to find out what actually happened to Michael the Rockefeller [noise] the Twenty one year old son at New York governor Nelson Rockefeller was never seen again after he went missing in New guinea back in Nineteen sixty one often\nRetraced Rockefeller eastern combed through our times and interviewed I witnesses to come to his own conclusions which he writes about [noise] Savage Harvest a tale of cannibals colonialism and Michael Rockefeller's tragic with Carl good to have you back on the show thanks so much\nSo did I said that Rockefeller story up correctly there\nYes no question I mean Michael graduated he was the son of Nelson who was the governor of New York at the time and he graduated from Harvard and\nWent off to New Guinea to work on a film and his father had opened the museum of primitive art as it was called then a few years earlier and Michael was a trustee and while he was in New guinea he heard about people called the as Matt who lives in the south west coast and were\nIncredible ... and he determined to go to as mad and try to collect some as Matt art\nWhich he did he made a quick sort of a reconnaissance journey of a few weeks and then went back to the film and then when that was done he decided to go back\nFor a couple of months and are on that trip pie banished\nSo Michael Rockefeller was Twenty one years old this was back in Nineteen sixty one and you're studying up this did it seemed like he was just a a buccaneer looking for this indigenous art to bring home to his primitive art museum or did he really become enamored with the culture and just wanted to learn more about it and and connect with\nI think it's a little bit of both I mean I don't think Michael was much of a buccaneer he was a young Ernest man very smart well educated he'd grown up around our you know the way I'm most American Kids have grown up around baseball and um you know some of the greatest started of of the world\nHe was in ... and fascinated by as Matt culture and asthmatic carving it means you know the best of the carving the most spectacular of these things were you know twenty three twenty four foot high a poll kind of like totem poles if you will\nFour foot high a poll kind of like totem poles if you will\nI think he had a an earnest interest in it and I mean you know at the same time he was young he was inexperienced he was wealthy he you know got access and breaks the regular person wouldn't have had and certainly those things contributed to the disaster that he fell into\nAnd it ends in New guinea this huge island down them between Thailand and Indonesia is one of the most remote places on earth really how do you go there and find the artistic treasure and then by it to bring it home what's the mechanics of that\nWell at the time it was known as Netherlands New Guinea was Dutch New Guinea the last Dutch colony of the east indies than that of course made it a little bit easier for him but the region that he went to was as mad it's ten thousand even today it's ten thousand square miles of road ... swamp\nIn the inner villages there are no stores no plumbing no electricity\nOr he bought a boat from a Dutch Colonial patrol officer a sort of a two dugout canoes with a little bit of a sort of Huck Finn like a cabin on top then with the Dutch miner or thirty four year old anthropologist named Renee waltzing and to local boys they just went off from village to village\nYou know and they would arrive in the village and say they're interested in stuff\nAnd people would bring it out but you have to understand in Nineteen sixty one ads Matt was an incredibly remote place really western contacted just been made in the late Nineteen fifties and as Matt were uh\nUh people of great artistic passion and power but they were also a constant warfare with each other and ah\nWe lived in a world of the sacred reciprocal violence\nOf which the art was all a part in a you know and and had hunting was an integral part of their culture and part of that had hunting you know was also some cannibalism and Michael unwittingly stepped into a very complex political world\nAnd he ended up at the wrong place at the wrong time\nAnd you know you could be very wealthy and sophisticated but from a cultural point of view could also be very naive and green venturing into a society where one of the great\nIronies of the story is that you know this is a a man from who represents you know the most powerful family in the most powerful country in the world and in ads mad at the crucial moment he was\nA the least powerful man and all the world and you know cannibalism is all about intimacy and power and it's all about taking somebody's power\nThe head hunting and you know when the ads men men who killed and did so they were taking back their power sort of a desperate bid to take power back that had been usurped by Dutch colonialists and Dutch efforts to pacify them and take away their culture and [noise]\nAnd they consume them and there's no more\nArticulate display of of power than that so\nDid they eat Rockefeller thinking they were just eating a white guy that represented colonialism or did they know they were eating a man from the most powerful family in the most powerful white country\nThey didn't know anything about the Rockefeller's the Rockefeller name meant nothing to them\nI mean it's a complex story that in a nutshell in Nineteen fifty seven as I said the Dutch we're trying to pacify the as mad in Nineteen fifty seven\nThere was a war between two villages and many are men were killed a local men you know they killed each other and a very aggressive or racist Dutch Colonial patrol officer went to the village specifically to teach the village the lesson as he wrote in his report\nSpecifically to teach the village the lesson as he wrote in his report said he was afraid and he brought a lot of armed policemen with them and he arrived in to this village of ... which was a\nLegendary you know traditional place the place that had resisted the incursions of the Dutch and didn't want to change its ways why should it why would want to\nHe ended up opening fire and killing five people and that left the village with a sacred obligation to you know everything was a ... I mean spiritually and it left the village with a sacred obligation to reciprocate the men's death than Michael kind of swim into that as it turned out so he\nGave them the opportunity to reciprocate basically by stumbling into their world he did\nCarl Hoffman's than on assignment to more than Seventy countries has a report today on travel with Rick Steves he's telling us what he discovered about the plight of Michael the Rockefeller has he investigated his disappearance and that deadly clash between cultures in the jungles\nOf New Guinea his book is called Savage Harvest [noise] now I I don't want I guess I'm focusing on capitalism it's fascinating and apparently it's it's a reality but I guess when these tribal people decide to eat a human being is not a matter of nutrition it's not like the Donner Party it's a matter of um [noise]\nPower and symbolism is that right yeah\nIt's not like you know we're hungry let's go get a Big Mac or anything on it was easier to\nGet an animal in that regard but you're just searching yourself by symbolic well immediate ritual is Terry somebody\nYeah it gets very complex but no cannibalism is with in a is a sacred act with in a complex Web of obligation and ceremony and customary laws and that has great meaning and important\nIs there a ritual a stick way to actually cook the person\nYes very much so which I won't go into a here but I Do in the book\nThe Rockefeller family are maintained that their son was was not a victim of chemicals\nWell he was actually on a boat crossing the mouth of a river that engine trouble and then flipped over and drifted and Michael said you know I think he violated the first law ... which is to you know never leave the boat as long as it's still flowed and he said I think I can make it and\nRenee watts thing was older and wiser said you know if you go you're on your own I'm not leaving and Michael did and he swam away from the boat and he was never seen again\nAnd there was a massive search and of course Renee was rescued the following day by Dutch patrol planes there was a massive search for Michael you know Nelson and Michael sister Mary both went to New Guinea immediately end\nUp fairly sophisticated search for I'm In no trace them was ever found so it was natural to assume that he had disappear and of course Renee had seen him swim off that he disappeared it's see but as it turned out very soon afterwards there were\nDutch missionaries who had been living in a among villagers for years and spoke the local language and\nBegan making their rounds and hearing reports that Michael had in fact made it to shore and encountered men from the very specific village and that he had been", "show_name": "Parent's Journal", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "27"}
