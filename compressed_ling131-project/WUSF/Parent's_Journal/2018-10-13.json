but it's it's about a deep underlying um prejudice\nAnd racism and I miss the the er and I'm the sort of to boot subjects that we haven't really explored on a straight in television necessarily before\nIt is interesting that we can look at these hard issues and we've got the same challenges in the United states and\nIt's sort of disarmed goes to go back to the fifties and and look at it and how how it was dealt with in that time and then to sort of be haunted by the fact that we're still struggling with it today talk for a minute mark too about the whole idea of the adjustment for us inside the where women all of a sudden are going to be more respected in and at the same time expect more\nIn the same time I had that sense when I saw you even when you were feeling from Britain back to Australia after the war in in a place to go home the sense was you were going to march right in there and this is the new age and women are going to be respected\nWell that's what I had to avoid

...\nTo them to see where they are today and then and where they need to go\nI think by those things and I think actually what so unique about the show is that three generations sit down to watch it together and that old fashioned thing of sitting around the fire than sitting around the radio than sitting around the television\nHas been returned to families a lot of people talk about that how they all sit down together because everyone can watch it and everyone can relate to it that's that's three generations of women and men playing out their lives that there's something to recognized for everyone what\nA delight for the older generation to sit down with their grandchildren and because this can verbalize or or or help them visualize this reality and it also artfully deals with a lot of

and more to you know we're all thinking about Sidney here are but if you want to take a little break from Sydney or what's your favorite place to travel in Australia and why\nMy favorite place to test mania um it's a tiny little island on the bottom of a strike\nDown the bottom of the right hand side and my husband's from there so I'm I've been going now with the ... saying is\nIt's still good old the old sandstone building from the comic taped it I'm not very far you can drive forty minutes to ... in the most incredible seaside towns of seeking it and Franklin historically they're incredibly rich they've got\nA pool that will explode in your mouth they uh they have ... different types of Apple's it's sort of quote the apple ...\nThe sued the the people that calmness um if you can imagine it calmer than astray there already is it has its own special piece and it's much colder down there so it's very crisp and very alive it has some of the most beautiful national pox I think\nChrist and very alive it had some of the most beautiful national pox I think in the world\nAnd you can walk them uh the credit mountain walk and the April ... along the coast you can do them via companies say stay and hot and the whole way which is pretty nice or you can free will get yourself um that they really a world\nHeritage walks and um it's just it's one of the most beautiful places I think I guess a day in ...\nIn films just and chanting\nNobody me if I'm a big fan of uh an a soldier goldfish and look at Australia from Nineteen fifties because I started getting into a place to go home and it inspires me to go to Australia and try to find a quiet Eddie from the past are there any places in Australia where you might feel like you're back in the Nineteen fifties\nMaybe in small towns along the way um but not really in the major cities on the rocks ... which is where the ... bridge is\nEight maintained and has historical walks we can hear the history of each building and how it was built and again the sandstone and the conveying that to me what it straight it really has to offer is the nature\nAnd often dates community that we've been talking about like for example there's a place called ...\nWhich is that ... on the west coast of the strata right up the top it's a an indigenous run place that you can go and it has five star tents and then to stop hot so it fits everyone brave\nAnd it takes a day to drive there or you can fly there and a small airplane and that really gives you an idea of the remoteness of Australia and how isolated in left alone it really is to the rest of the world\nAnd to me that the Eddie you're looking for when you come to this place you can say\nIt can be applied to complete solitude which when I go to America I Know they also have places like that\nBut I'm In Australia that they seem almost like you're the only person in their ... laying Tasmania this place called ... that you can walk into an arm into the time me and my husband went in there was absolutely nobody that so we went skinny dipping water\nAnd I don't I don't really just extraordinary and\nUm and not far from a major hub where you can have a beautiful meal and some delicious wine so um I think you're less searching for the Nineteen fifties in more than ... at that time last place but I feel like you've got to try to officer\nCompliment your time in Sydney would then that dimension of the great ... and the peacefulness identity of Australia\nSome nights are right he will mark ... have you got me vetted by the thing about Australia thanks so much for uh an
