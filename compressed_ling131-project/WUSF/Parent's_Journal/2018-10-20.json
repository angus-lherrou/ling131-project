Juliet in a wonderful Romeo and Juliet adaptation on against spoiler alert here since anyone who's never thing for me and Juliet or instead of stopping heads off at the end of the play she uses a poisonous snake\n... which kind of tone to ... to ... again sport or sorry\nUh that's how Patrick dollars at the end of ... so it's kind of wonderfully ... reimagining of the plane and one that pact out houses or the U.S.'s\nWith five hundred people every night of the week and these were corrugated on shacks in a fledgling city I'm On bass and you know it really brings alive the cultural vibrancy of East African states even in this uh in this period\nOr guest on travel with Rick Steves Edward Wilson leads a professor of literature in Cambridge and the author of Shakespeare in Swahili left\nIn search of a global poet Edward is it safe to say\nI mean you're focusing on the East Africa but would that be\nYou'd never gives an example of how all over the world Shakespeare is adapted to local cultures and the writing might be tweaked so you're not going to be stabbed you're going to be killed by a poisonous snake if that's what happens in your culture and we're going to be on a ship or it could be on a train wreck but is that happening all over the planet\n... they're extraordinary Shakespeare traditions in India in Russia Japan and China I think this East African story is extraordinary because there are so many different\nPeriods in which Shakespeare is tweaked in different ways to use as this kind of um this ambulance to protect the spores used by that mission raised to create a written culture of Washington the language\nIs now a spoken by a hundred million people\nHe's translated into Swahili he's you know he performed by these Indian parents and then you know in the late twentieth century he becomes a real flashpoint for talking about the extent to which these countries in the aftermath of colonialism want to be open to the culture of the people who had been calling you know over ...\nI'd like to get a little more into that but first of all a Edward defined Swahili land East Africa\nYeah so Swahili land is not a terribly commonly used to and it's one which hopefully capture as a set of countries Kenya Tanzania Uganda parts of the Congo a Malawi\nWhich Swahili is either the main or one of the major languages\nThis also in the region which governs as a kind of a single entity by the British colonies so the reason why they speak Swahili is because the British colonial offices mission range landed on the coast which is west what he spoke and why he\nGot very Arabic influenced by two language and as the colonial governments moved inland or they would damned if they were going to speak and learn more\nGovernments moved inland or they would damned if they were going to speak and learn more than one language so they made everyone else learns while he has they moved inland what just\nHappened to be a convenient language for the colonial overlords to use so they don't have to learn all the different tribal languages and because of the British imperialism widely as much bigger in Africa today than it would have been otherwise\nPrecisely so it it is the legacy of clay list but on the other hand it's also like to see that it's created a shed culture between all of the teams are African culture within one of these countries in East Africa\nNow you talked about uh the missionary using Shakespeare's what Nineteen century missionaries and checked for having common when it comes to sway\nThe main character in the story is a ... cold at would stare who was the mission ... Central Africa sent out from Britain he arrives him down to the ball in Eighteen sixty seven and he isn't machinery and his job to try and convince the locals to Christianity\nBut he sees it as central to lead to create less receive so he actually spends a lot of time\nTrying to understand local cultures translating Swahili ... into English and trying to provide things for local schoolchildren ... people learning to read to read in Swahili so one of the first things Princeton Swahili\nIs a translation of child to marry lambs tales from Shakespeare called ...\nPrinted on this little hand press in the Eighteen sixties and it goes on to be this foundational taxed for schoolchildren in Kenya and Tanzania for almost a century after that\nSo missionaries want to look for people to be able to read the Bible and you know promote their face and in order to do that people had to be literate and missionaries had to understand their culture and their culture need a better understanding of missionary culture and Shakespeare helped pave the way\nYeah so the idea I mean if you're a era missionary uh you believe that won gold has created to old people and that means that old people must have some kind of shed language of beauty that they can commuting in an overseas Shakespeare was held up as this this great genius\nWho in ... because he wasn't terribly well educated had access to a kind of universal notions of beauty the allowed him to speak this very pure language of beauty and so the assumption was that wherever you want if you translate to Shakespeare into those languages they would also be able to appreciate Hany\nIncluding the latest from pianist Benny green then later on the midnight standard we hear another version of Miles Davis is all blues the adventure begins tonight at nine on W.

P. and to your point\nAbsolutely and I and I think that's part of what drives K X. P. and to your point you don't even necessarily need to understand the language to be able to feel the emotional quality or what's being conveyed in the music\nThere is that magic spark sometimes I've been in in traditional music sessions in Scotland and everybody's on the same wavelength and I just I walked out of there just marveling at what a mad it's hard to explain that these are the magic the ways to make travel transformational really\nTransformational it's such a great word to describe a\nWhen you have those kind of experiences and for me personally that happens a lot with music when it when it all comes together and not tell you one of the reasons we went to Iceland or I went to Iceland for the first time was\nI wanted to go somewhere to experience the summer solstice could have done that in a whole bunch of different places but there was a band called secret Rowse and they uh had an album called\nI'll get to severe and that was so magical when I first heard it and [noise]\nI don't even know what it was that it's just so hard to put into words I had never heard any music so beautiful\nThat as soon as I sat and listen to that album I was like I Want to go to the land this music from where that came yeah I Want to try and understand there's something about that if I listen to some music fair for Greek if I Want to go to the fjord and look at the view his cabinet was when he was inspired to write that\nYou have the music and sometimes so unfair and you want to be translated it and you want to go to the to the place from where it blossomed\nYes music and sometimes it seems like travel okay so you're organizing this now in a sense with a passion for Iceland in particular yeah so the first trip I went to was before we started broadcasting and again\nI don't know if you've had this experience but it was two thousand five and it was so remarkable and it's so far exceeded my expectations that I actually did not want to go back [laughter]\nOh you didn't want to go back because you thought you'd be ruining it ruining ... yeah I you know it's so hard to replicate something of reality about it yeah it was I go back with a TV crew and it's come out where the magic out what your last year was incredible do it again and sometimes it doesn't so\nI did not want to go back but I was so into it and and kept talking about the music of ice and on my radio show I ended up hooking up with their trade commissioner and general counsel each year in North America leaner good Johnson\nAnd that to a series of events ended up culminating in us actually going to Iceland and broadcasting live than I had to do a scouting location or your trip before\nAnd I've been fourteen or Fifteen times now and every time has been a deep rich experience for different reasons and we would not keep going back in broadcasting live if there was an incredible music year over year over year which is remarkable for a country of three hundred and twenty five thousand people\nBut it is this music that comes out of Iceland or is this a celebration of many cultures that go to be together and nice like\nWell it's a bit of both now well the music fest we broadcast from its called Iceland airways and it's a showcase for Icelandic end Nordic\nBands new and emerging bands from the Nordic countries\nAlong with a beautifully curated selection of international band sevens and gathering of people from all over the world\nBut the focus is Icelandic and I think what's happening now though musically because of the Internet is were all able to hear music from all over the world so musicians and creative people who are curious become naturally\n... that's a a boon for music culture it internationally and it's probably fair benefit of the Internet a lot of people don't don't appreciate and don't take advantage of like they might [noise]\nSome and the fire and punches way above its weight as a source for innovative contemporary music [noise]\nPunches way above its weight as a source for innovative contemporary music our guest right now in travel with Rick Steves is Kevin ... he's the program director of Seattle's noncommercial ESP radio can music for stuff with the afternoons\nKevin sharing what he traveled to the Iceland Airwaves fest every November in Reykjavik here why did many bands and musicians are up to each year you'll find links to the festival him to Kevin ... radio show at ... dot com slash radio [noise]\nKevin when we're talking about this listeners' experience this this attendees experience this music appreciation experience\nI don't think of Iceland is a place with great intimate Venus I mean I've had magic experiences say in pubs or in in wonderful beer garden and so on but what is the venue like just had contribute to it in Iceland or is it just I'm a concert hall\nSo Iceland Airwaves is a a multiple shows and events happening each night over four nights\nIn various different venues and sometimes not even a because any states that could be a cool place to host a ban becomes one but they've got things like uh the harp a concert hall which is an amazing facility that is where\nAll I've been there that's a matter of pride for Reykjavik really is a concert standing right every Scandinavian capital seems to really prioritize for a suitably creative and rooted in in local values kind of a wonderful concert hall\nYeah I think all the stone as Isabel ... definitely rooted in their in their country\nIceland brags it's one of the most literate nations uh I think they got more books published per capita than anywhere on earth that has a vibrant music scene is as you're tuned into with all sorts of of creative John Rhodes and lots of creative people\nHave you thought about what makes Iceland a punch above its weight or ... that sort of phrase because it's a tiny island and it's in darkness most of the year\n[laughter] what what is it about it that had so much creativity\nMan that's that is a great question and music journalists have been trying to break the code on that one right like why does is a small country have such an incredible music scene and why is it so creative and\nAnd I think it's a whole bunch of different factors in fact I had the the president of ice on the on my show uh all of her grandson and\nWe were talking about Iceland's assets you know you've got a geothermal energy and the the knowledge around that you've got the fishing industry you've got data mining but he said that the most valuable asset advice onto the creativity of the people\nAnd he sort of tied that into again the legacy where the lineage of the the saga is and how storytelling had to be a way that the history was told\nYou know dating back a thousand years and that sort of everyone was a story tower and he said that to art and culture in Iceland was really a democracy of culture in that everyone was encouraged to participate in at some point everybody had to by telling the stories right he related to music and saying that\nYou know everybody can create music and if you have something valuable to contribute it will be embraced him by valuable to contribute he meant something new and different",
