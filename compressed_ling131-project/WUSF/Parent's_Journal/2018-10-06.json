culture all her life and the author of the moon guy called\nLiving abroad Japan Ruthie also host by tours for ... a website is living abroad in Japan dot com [noise] you grow up as a child of a missionary parents and I don't\nI was always curious about that it seems like when you have a spiritual vacuum [noise] people\nEmbrace hop religions that come and go do you have any ever think about that well you're in Japan\nWell I think the Japanese attitude towards religion is very different than in our country that is they're not exclusive to one religion or another they take the best of any religion and adopted as part of their life it's almost just part of the culture so\nFor example babies that are born they take them to a shrine to be dedicated and most weddings are either she do or Christian because they're attracted to the idea of a western style wedding but most funerals are Buddhist because Buddhism has to do with the afterlife\nWhereas she do has to do with sacredness and the president life ... and so they just depending on the time of year the season or the particular festival it might be Buddhist it might be she thought it might be Christian\nIn your book you wrote that and I was just adding up the numbers are you said eighty percent of the people identify as Shinto sixty seven percent identify as Buddhist and I thought he didn't resent plus sixty seven that's more than a hundred or so but it right away because people can can gather their religions I guess\nYes and so one of the difficulties I I guess you'd say for missionary such as my parents were it's very difficult to have somebody except Christianity and exclude the other religions\nOr so and as a missionary you'd have to do that sometimes nor the gods before me or or this sort of a right to yes is\nAnd that would be a tough because I remember I had friends in Japan who who were kinda like sure that sounds good I'll I'll embrace that but it wasn't that the exclusion of anything else so they would that's right they would pick on Christianity but but it wouldn't be\nThe only religion Ruthie what is Shinto and and I mean I'm sure it's a complicated question but I have a good sense of what is Buddhism and whether they tend to his name and what is Islam and Christianity and Judaism but ... what is that yes\nI'm In Christianity and Judaism but ... what is that\nYes literally she don't means the way up the gods\nIt's a type of ... or the belief in the ... sacredness of\nNature a beautiful mountain or a beautiful old tree or a rock in the ocean has a sense of being sacred and so they are God's that help you in your life farmers would dedicate\nOfferings too that God that help God of agriculture for example so there are no images inch into like statues are idols or anything\nAnd it's believed by tradition that even the emperor of God has mystical origins and descended from the sun goddess who created the Japanese island\nThe emperor God do you mean the the upper who's considered the cod\nUsed to be yes but not anymore right now he is a symbol of the state and then the people but again Japanese don't exclusively claim one religion over another so these are just stories and miss that are passed down and children just learn what you're supposed to do when you go to a scene till shrine\nIs kind of like it gives your society some basic parameters some cultural ideals it's sort of like a a classroom for ethics\nYes you could say that and it's the idea of sacredness making things\nClean and purifying getting rid of evil spirits and so there are many holidays that celebrate something a sheep though and there's regional festivals harvest festivals or ... rice planting festivals that are related to ... so it's kind of blended into the daily life\nI was struck by a I'm just confused at holiday time 'cause I was from Japan over Christmas when you're in\nAnd Christmas was like just a big party everybody was the subway was filled with people with cakes and everybody getting drunk and then on New Year's and they don't like a whole each time and I'll never forget stepping out my my door and and they were banging it's gone with a hundred and eight times\nOn New Year's eve you go to the temple to a wash away the hundred eight types of since that you may have committed to the temple bell very slowly hundred and eight\nTimes [noise] and then as soon as midnight\nPassed on New Year's morning people flock to the sheep they'll trying to pray for health and success\nAnd I'm happy new year and by ambulance or\nEven something to put in your car for traffic safety and so on at the ... so they do both Buddhist to get rid of the old year she'd do for the new year [noise]\nIsn't travel with Rick Steves we're talking with Ruth you connect you hear a book is the moon guide book called the living abroad Japan and with the one we're thinking about living in Japan which the respect for women in public in the workplace and so on and and the domestic world these days or just in general\nThat's all I think things are changing quite a bit the marriage rate has gone down and so has the birth rate because a lot of women\nPreferred to develop their career or start their own business or go abroad to study or even go overseas to start a business so it's not quite as traditional as you might imagine and I think people do respect women and um there are many opportunities\nIn terms of employment and a large company they often have two tracks that women can choose from one is to go the managerial route where you're committed to\nWorking long hours for the company going on business trips and working just like the men are expected to\nGoing on business trips and working just like the men are expected to but the other track is for women who value their own free time and don't expect to have a life long career than there are more like secretary or support staff\nAnd sometimes they quit when they get married there used to be pressure to quit when you get married but it's not true any more so than any\nChanging yes so the younger generation is is pretty much said we're going to demand a little more respect\nI don't know if I put it in terms of demand respect but they're going ahead and doing what they want to you on on their own and not not necessarily thinking that you have to go to university and then get a job in a big company why not start your own company or right start some kind of news service or go overseas\nNumber's eight seven seven three three three seven four to five and Scott is calling us from mountain Georgia he's got thanks for your call Ira how are you I'm great to have you had an experience yourself in Japan\nYes I was there for about six years um I Lived in rural Japan and most of the time so it was much different than Louis experience in Tokyo\nOr in what was your experience like why are you doing for your work\nI was working as a teacher for the University of Maryland [laughter]\nUm and I taught at a military base in ... Japan uh and I lived probably about Fifteen clicks from the base and spent most of my time in the local economy\nAnd then I was teaching part-time down in Tokyo and my I was teaching English to a group of farmers so I Would get on the train two nights a week and\nTake this little rickety train local train down to Tokyo and teacher group of about a pharmacist for several years and I developed a really intimate relationship with those people down there and\nIt really opened a lot of doors to have that close friendship with them and they were the ones that taught me all the Japanese are basically I ever learned\nSo you were able to break into the society as a foreigner and make real friendships with the locals\nI did and it was amazing there was two things that I did one of them was\nLearn Japanese which are Ruthie alluded to which opens a lot of doors people are really really friendly once you at least make an effort and the other one was I tackled the transportation problem I didn't really want to buy a car because very expensive to buy a car\nThat episode of the people's pharmacy is coming up next at seven you're on W.

Internet if you go to a particular interest in that particular theories you can often change some of the information on the Internet to find where they're being filmed\nYour tour guide let's say somebody has ten days and they hire you to show you around England and just to see the greatest uh places made famous by you know Downton Abbey or whatever\nTend to not be ... council a which is frequently open to the public schools are starting to nominate soft and book two to three years and the drones so there's loads of these places that\nCould be a disappointment and said you want to go

all dead now [laughter] so this this is true of all of those\nYou can get to these places quite easily shutting induced by flight some ferries going from the mainland and everything else\nBut that's always the only cost me a vote of the country like Britain has such a low mood to right if you watch ... I go to Christie all of these you'd want to do that we don't have the highest murder rates in the world\nSo you just watch it on TV and you don't need to do it in real life Troy maybe we should\nHave a license safety valve but ... going because you might want to go there because of the TV series but at the same as you can see there anyway and we make it would come bone in it\nAnd you make a good point they seem like a long ways away but there's little puddle jumper airplanes that get you there and I I just went to the news in Scotland and it was so easy I Do I just decided to get myself forty eight hours out of my dinner affluent it's had a great time Elizabeth did you have any other comments or or suggestions\nYeah I don't know where it would be a good place to visit from\nWhen the truth [laughter] you'd have to stay on shuttling because I'm although the connections on relatively frequent\nSee the songs of the autumn and you'd really need to base you saw something on them but as as we were both things rules saying\nUm you could fly and have a couple of days there\nSee as many as ... as you want him to the local to his information is going to be very aware of where all the if it's particular episode a scene in particular beside you wouldn't see\nPolitical terrorist information will be on the porch with the locals capitalize I'm there'll be local guides that'll take you to all these fights and things but stay on the island for a day or two I'm sort of been giants on on all the various locations thanks for your call the laundromat all\nEnd up calling in Chicago man to thanks for your call\nHow are you all we're doing great what ... what the British TV do you like to watch and where would you like to visit\nSo I watch a whole slew of saying that there is a specific um spraying when a friend of mine was going through it difficult break up and like on a pair of self respecting women in our thirties we decided to medicate by watching a lot of\nBritish TV including Mr sell for edge and grand gesture and while we were watching south fridge one day where like wouldn't it be great if we did a girl's trap gives London and have tea and drink champagne or show some protests and four months later we did just that", "show_name": "Parent's Journal", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "06"}
