Halloween John Carpenter directed and scored the original back in Nineteen Seventy eight\nAnd he is the composer on the twenty Eighteen sequel which is in theaters now John Carpenter welcome to want to thank you for having me you've been away from the Halloween movie franchise for some time now what made you decide to come back\nWhen his producer Hollywood producer Jason Blum a convinced me to come back\nI knew that one was a a a sequel was going to be made as I Know a Malik the cod he's the the son of the man who put up the money for the original Halloween so I knew there was a sequel coming\nBut Jason's bomb a talk to me and he said you know where it's going to be made with or without us so why don't we meaning he he and I\nUm get aboard and try to help it be good so nobody had put it to me that way before so I thought that's a great great thing\nJason Blum spend doing some pretty interesting things with horror movies lately ... what what do you make of where the genre stance today\nThat's in good shape but it's always in good shape horror has been was semi since the very beginning and I have a feeling\nA it will be with us until doomsday just because everybody's scared of something that were all born afraid we all understand fear and so it's really fun to go to a horror movie with your girlfriend or your significant other and cuddle and scream and so forth\nBut was it like for you not being in the directors chair for the twenty eighth team version of Halloween you were involved in the film but what about watching someone else direct this movie it was a relief\nBecause I don't have to suffer the stress and anxiety that directors suffer and that's a worst profession in the world other than being a coal miner\nThe worst other than a cold I'll come on now well it could it could be worse I guess you could be a slaughterhouse technique that you're right ah it's not the worst now uh when when things were a it's great to be a director when they don't work it's it's really garbage\nWhat do you think movie fans least understand about what it takes to direct a movie especially a horror movie\nWere ever afforded the lease understand let me think that uh directors are responsible for all the central elements of a movie if it's supposed to be funny they're responsible for the humor of it if it's an adventure and so forth and so on\nSo director of a horror movie think of it this way horror and comedy or a lot like 'cause it's turning it's all about timing and it's all about when\nThings happen and how they unfold and it's more complex than than people assume but um people just think that horror as a lot of war and obvious violence and it's not\n[noise] yeah see I I I hear you on that it's an interesting analogy between the horror and comedy I'm not big on Gore I Do not personally do well around blood and Gore at all but a good suspenseful movie like I can I can hang with that 'cause that's that's a satisfying experience what what do you think\nIt takes to make that kind of timing in a horror movie work what\nIs it what does it take to make a horror movie work these are secrets that only the Brotherhood no so I Can't\nOh come on you can tell me something\nLook to make it really simple uh there are no rules for any horror film\nThe horror horror movies come out of the story and horror is every action\nMovies come out of the story and her\nIs every action think of it that way not a genre necessarily such a reaction to things\nAnd that if the story is is unfolding then you use the story tell it to a a a set up your scares and set up things they're frightening for the audience he said the word earlier suspense that's what you if you get the audience in suspense and you could scare them\nSo maybe the key is having a story\nIt's got enough of the right elements to make me feel\nThat suspense so that they're there can be that pay off so that there can be the scare is that it that is correct you got it what about the music you contributed music to this film and and the music to the original in Nineteen Seventy eight what does it take to make that kind of music work for a scary movie\nWhen does it take it takes a certain amount of talent and ability to play musical instruments and a feeling for him\nThat's what it takes\nNow were you always musically inclined when you put the original movie Halloween together Nineteen Nineteen Seventy eight or was it something that kind of came together unexpectedly\nNo I I grew up in a musical household my father was a music professor he was a [noise]\nA virtuoso violin player and he had taught to college level music courses at a university where I grew up I grew up with music in the house all the time classical music listening to it\nHe decided when I was about eight years old and I should learn to play the violin there was only one problem with that and I had no talent other than that it was a great idea\nBut I moved on from the violin to the piano and guitar and other things I picked a lot of stuff up\nWhere there any particular influences that you draw on when you made the music for the original Halloween or that you've drawn on over the years\nYes I'm all classical a\nMovie composers and classical ... ah musicians and rock and roll I'd get influence everywhere\nWhat about the timing I did this seem to the original Halloween is not in a plain old for for your time it's been five four time it's an odd kind of time's signature was what drew you to that\nMy father taught me five four time uh when I was Thirteen he tried it on the had a pair of bongos I got the Christmas I taught me five forum had and I thought it was unusual just straightforwardly unusual time inside\nAdapted that time's signature tune a piano piece and there
