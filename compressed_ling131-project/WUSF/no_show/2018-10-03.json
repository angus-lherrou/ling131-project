and gender studies and Africana studies at Rutgers University she is out with a new book eloquent rage of black feminist discovers her superpower Brittany Cooper great to have you on what they thought\nA women's anger and rage has become the focus of the last several weeks in this country with Christine Blasey Ford's testimony in the Senate and the Judiciary Committee judge Brett Kavanaugh's response\nAnd the way that women and men have reacted to that testimony um let's just take a moment to set it up Rebecca Traister\nYou watch these moments along with the rest of us in America or what have you seen these last couple of weeks\nWell there was partly what we saw in the hearing room itself which was Christine Blasey Ford presenting\nHer story within a narrow very very narrow range of expressive acceptability that women do they have to fall between if they're going to be heard and taken seriously and not written off as hysterical or unhinged so she was ...\nI just want to be ... she made jokes she smiled and her testimony was very compelling in part because she stayed within these sort of broadly understood boundaries for how women's voices are to be heard if we want them to be taken seriously and not written off\nThen Brett Kavanaugh came in and he had an entirely different set of tools and his arsenal he could use anger in a way that would have disqualified Christine Blasey Ford he could use it to emphasize the seriousness of his plight what he was presenting as the way in which he had been injured in this process in which\nDamage unjust damage had been done to him and he yelled\nAnd fume to end was disrespectful to the senators and talk back to them and turn their questions on them he was incredibly aggressive\nAnd it wasn't simply that she wasn't permitted to use anger and he was it was that that anger could work for him um to help his case he could use it on his own behalf whereas had Christine Blasey Ford turned to anger um it it might well have worked against her\n... that's the picture from inside the hearing room we all watched on our television some people were there live what about outside the hearing room what a juicy ripple through the culture or through the Senate through the country after Brett Kavanaugh's testimony after Christine Blasey Ford's pension money\nWell there were several things one was that the stark difference in their behavior resonated I think with women everywhere it was so clear that part of her\nAbility to be believable and to retain whatever credibility she could came with her having to be deferential in the way that Rebecca describes and I think women understand that and so seeing it was a raging actually because the difference was huge\nI think too though that that does that this darkness of it may be surprised certain people um who aren't necessarily thinking about the tight rope that women walk every day they\nThey do this in their own homes they do this and the professional\nWorkplace and um to see it enacted in the way that it was as such a\nVisceral I'm called to power on his part\nWas raging and I think for many people traumatic and you could see that ripple ripples through media you could see it in conversations on the street um it was just very evident in ways that sometimes uh you can describe it in words but don't have the same effect Bernie Cooper what did you say\nUm so what I saw was a white men sort of run into a victory lap at the expense of um a vulnerable woman um and I saw these um expressions of gender that are so interesting to watch as a black person\nWho grew up with a little girl during the Anita Hill hearings are thinking about the ways that Anita Hill\nCould not um who she ended up in a similar position to Christie while before in the ... the senators who listen to her were not did not find her testimony particularly compelling but she was not allowed to be vulnerable not allowed to cry\nNot allowed to show even the range of motion that we talk for the blog before being able to show and so I found myself and my colleagues who are working at the intersection of vote\nOr racial justice and gender justice having to think about what does it mean to be in solidarity with Christine Blasey Ford in this moment accent minutes because I Believe her and I believe women when they say that they had been sexually assaulted um and I and I would think impression that even the men who\nAnd I and and I would think impression that even the men who listen to her whatever their political leanings also believed her but that they had made a negotiation that\nHer didn't matter if it was going to in any way diminish their sort of breathing bid for power and that is in theory aiding because it means that there is no integrity it means that there are no lives anymore it means that there are no standard that hold us\nThat we can hold ourselves to in this political moment that we're in a sort of crafts power grab a and and what I Know as a black person than a black woman in the moment is that white women cannot\nCompel the sort of a humanity of white men in power to do the right thing then that says something about the vulnerability of every population not just white women but in particular people of color and women of color\nAnd my level of fury over that in addition to my levels of fear are really off the charts\nNow this groundswell did not start of course with the Kavanaugh hearings we've seen women's marches bringing out millions of protesting women across the United states from the day after Donald Trump's inauguration I think you could put a put a PIN in that moment but even before in some ways\nOf the fact that a lot of angry women are advocating for change\nThat it's even a news story is something it seems like it's an aberration that women are angry and making their voices heard but it's not an aberration this is one of the themes Rebecca Traister that you write about women's anger is not always highlighted it's not always paid attention to it's not always called that sometimes it's supplemented\nBut at this phenomenon as remarkable and his new is that teams is a new at all\nWell part of the part of the point is it the the people who have the power to tell her story is whether that means that people who write the history books the leaders even within ... certain movements the news media the newspaper's\nThe power dynamics in the moment and the history and the context and the legacy of discrimination within the sport that she has faced\nAnd so I think that one thing that has been unexplored in the bigger conversation about that is the central and pivotal role of title nine in understanding women as\nLeaders or as people who have the right to defend themselves or engage in public conflict\nUm what she was really doing was I'm asserting her right to defend herself and to have dignity in the moment not be accused the way that she was accused\nAnd with sports I think it's important to note that we now have not one but two generations of women so a generation of role models who have benefited from title nine and the lessons of title nine which we tend to think of it it's\nUm athletics but it is really about leadership and the ability to act together um in teams to manage conflict to make the nuance distinctions between being assertive and being aggression and be aggressive and being angry\nI think we're seeing the ... of of that now in our political\nAmerica have a drinking problem my friends and I drank beer like beer beer sometimes

center speech project\nAnd author of the new book rage becomes her\nThe media center speech project and author of the new book rage becomes her now I read an email from Karen at the end of the last segment that said she was hurt disappointed and angry wounded about the treatment\nOf Hillary Clinton in the twenties sixteen campaign and I don't want to go there because Hillary Clinton is one prominent famous\nWoman well known for navigating the shoulders of how women are supposed to express themselves in public now Hillary Clinton has a history of being very careful and very deliberate mindful of appearing angry or emotional she's been at it for thirty five years in America\nAnd in fact it was news in the two thousand and eight campaign I remember this when she shed a tear in New Hampshire one tier and it was at the top of CNN for like a new cycle and a half\nSo now a lot of people are saying that the twenty sixteen presidential campaign I'm Hillary Clinton in fact was was

fashion says I regret how nasty the campaign became a ... to this moment has clearly struck a chord Rebecca Traister who's watching here in the studio with me but how does that strike you [laughter]\nKnow she was off as she she was very very careful in her choice of words there to even as she was commenting on it I mean I think it was um it was ridiculous that this woman was called inauthentic while being held to the standard\nOf care full control in her voice and her facial of parents and her body\nAnd her motive expression I mean the two candidates um that were her primary opponents but Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders could act in unhinged ways they could show up looking unkempt they could pound ...\nYou know they could turn red in the face and as men they could leverage this enormous tide of populist anger and that was a gender card nobody wrote about that as a gender card right there were all these conversations about\nI'm Hillary Clinton as there often are with women because we associate gender with women and pretend men don't have a gender\nUm and and so they could do that and she couldn't leverage that political power and we saw that over and over and over again throughout the campaign record\nIt's right it's so right about this and I'm In fact the thing that the irony of what we were told about Hillary Clinton both Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump or congratulated by the political press for their particular skill and channeling the anger of their supporters this with their gift they were able to give voice to this frustration\nAnd we were repeatedly told that some of the authenticity of Hillary was that she couldn't convey anger and passion and yet\nEvery time she spoke too close to a microphone somebody said you're yelling your shrill um she really got directives at one point Joe Scarborough she was giving an ex ... a speech the night she won a primary and Joe Scarborough sad smile as if it was like some cat cholera on the street smile more\nUm she was told that regularly\nAnd I think that that's again an example of of not having that tool to wield she also has done remarkable writing and talking herself\nIn instances where I've interviewed her and she's written about it in our own memoir of the campaign about the process of not using that anger she writes particularly about that second debate where Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her and how men\nWhere Donald Trump came up behind her and kind of loomed behind her and how men and singing aggressive his body language was and how during\nThe debate a presidential debate she was doing internal calculations thinking can I turn around and confront this guy she said she thought about turning around and saying get away from me but then she was thinking no no no\nThat's gonna redound negatively to me that's gonna make me look bad it's gonna hurt me strategically and the debate and so she didn't and one of the things that that little story told us about\nHow much energy women expend modulating considering strategizing thinking tactically about how to use their voice how to suppress their voice how to channel their anger how to swallow their anger what to do in order to be rhetorically effective\nAnd and I think that that's something that that all three of us are writing about and thinking about is the amount of time and energy women spend doing this kind of maneuvering around the rules around are angry expression snow\nI wanted to I Want to talk a little bit in the last ... section of the show that we have about where some of this anger\nBecause this is a moment in America and let's be realistic moments have a way of fading they just do and and so I'm interested in where this goes when\nMaybe the cameras and all of the writers who aren't Rebecca Traister and Britney Cooper are not as interested anymore you know in a in a couple of years I think that might happen and I want to know where this goes now we've been hearing from so many wanting listeners I Want to play you another measure but some of the women's voices who've been reaching out to us about how they're feeling\nMy name's Aaron I'm calling from Lancaster, Pennsylvania this is Sarah from Cincinnati\nWhen I let my anger bubble over and I get really angry out loud it it really doesn't do much good I find that if I express a strong opinion or even just a bit of discomfort with something I'm perceived as being angry are overreacting women yelling even in this day and age that very acceptable\nMen don't seem to have that same problem and I'm\nStarting to feel like maybe it's not just a personal issue I'm dealing with what's going to be nice and and uh and keep our mouth shut however I Am so angry and sell angry right now maybe women all over the place you're dealing with it I'm turning my anger\nInto action getting help but feel like I'm not alone but still pretty discouraging I think that but when they have to do we have to take that anger hold on to it\nAnd that's how we're going to take back this country\nWe're hearing from listeners women who it feels like there's a scene there are transferring\nSome of their personal rage I'm sure a lot of it's in in personal life not just political life or cultural life but into action taking action in the streets taking action maybe at the ballot box we got this tweet from Tracy in
