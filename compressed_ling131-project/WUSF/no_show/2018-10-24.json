A. M. U. dot org before we bring in our next two guests Steve I didn't want to ask you one thing about the wave the documentary\nWas made I Wonder how you said about\nTelling the students' stories I mean there is a moment in one episode where either you or a cameraman tries to talk about one student about her cutting class I mean all the kids that you follow go through various struggles with\nIts class with grades with life what kinds of boundaries do you have to set when you're telling a story about high schoolers\nWell that's a great question um I've always tried in the films I've done over the years is to a\n... had the subject feel like they have real agency in the making of what we're doing\nA you know the idea we aim for is is that we're really making the film with them not on them\nAnd yes ultimately we have editorial control but we take very seriously that kind of relationship and on this series it was vitally important that they're also be other filmmakers involves we have a diverse team of filmmakers Kevin shower Rebecca parish being Lou\n... you know Charles' story was followed by Kevin ... I mean I felt a little bit with Charles but that's really Kevin who\nI mean being I'm Sorry I think that that followed a Charles a story and they had to establish these kinds of relationships\nThat are important now the moment you're talking about is with tiara that's actually a story I happened to be falling and you know you have to navigate those those times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions but you also\nThose times where you have to be able to ask difficult questions but you also have to be able to step back when when it's clear that that you know they don't really want to go there and that happens frequently with her because she was struggling with a lot of things at that time I felt was relevant to include that in the film\nA few more of your comments before we bring in our next two guests Mitch writes we can't move forward if we fail to address the past and continue to ignore the inequalities of today people of color are treated differently in America period end of sentence\nAgility for fun treated I've watched every episode of America to me I absolutely love it I'm shocked at how clueless the white teachers are especially that physics teacher\nThe school board is a disaster spoken word is amazing by the way by way by the news for full disclosure we should note we did reach out to the superintendent of the district Steve associate for his thoughts\nOn the series we did not get a response but the invitation remains open we also reached out to the principle of Oak Park in the river forest high school next and rouse we were unable to speak with him for the program we're told\nHe is traveling for work from Philadelphia where he attended an event called the national summit for courageous conversations about race so both those invitations remain open worth noting that neither the principal nor the superintendent participated in the documentary either is that right see that's right\nWas that the more voices to the conversation to talk more about racial equity in schools nationwide\nAmen to Louis is the director of the Institute for research on race and public policy\nAt the University of Illinois at Chicago her latest book is called despite the best intentions how racial equity thrives in good schools professor Lewis welcome to want to say thanks for having me also with us here at W. B. easy as David Stovall a professor of African American studies at the University of Illinois at Chicago\nHis focus is on the influence of race in the urban education community development and housing and he is a Chicago native professor Stovall welcome they so much for have professors have you watched the series any part of it some of it all of that yes\nProfessor still what what do you think of it so far what is there any anything in particular that struck you the hardest\nThe thing that struck me the hardest is an episode to win one of the parents\nOf student actually goes on the fourth floor and I think this is the empty conversation that we do not have about schools that have the illusion of integration I said the illusion of integration because it just means that students of color are in the same place with white students\nBut when ... mom talked about what happened to her in the early nineties in on that fourth floor and he still happening today that to me the story of us today professor Lewis what about you\nKnow one of the things that really struck me there are a lot of powerful moments in theory but I think one of the things that often struck me as the silent sending that some of that kill missions and I know a lot of this had to do I'm sure with who was willing to participate and who wasn't\nOne of the things you notice in that district is that the people aren't in the documentary so all the white powerful wealthy families are the key leaders and the district a lot of the people who had the power and the most influence over what that school ends up looking like\nA opt out and I think that's a kind of powerful and symbolic I'm a example of what's actually going on in the district\nBy the way for those of you listening and I forgot to mention we may be discussing some things in the documentary that if you were eager to watch America to me might turn out to be spoilers so deeper that in mind in the conversation if you would like to listen to this lady because I don't want to get them tweets do not\n... main ruin this film for you I don't want to air it was if you want to listen to this later on your own after you've had time to watch the documentary you'll find our conversation in its entirety at the one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a\nThe one a dot org that's the word the the number one the letter a dot org we're talking about racial\nEquity professor so vote what does that mean what does racial equity look like is it making sure that black kids in white kids get the same test scores is it about disciplinary procedures is it about truancy is it about people feel being nice to one another like how would we know racial equity\nIf we had it right I mean I think they should and thank you for that question I think the thing around equity and I think the ... to him and his point what people are unwilling to talk about equity is really talking about we distribution\nSo when you talk about distribution so now the question becomes who has had the least\nAnd now what are the things that they talk about that they need the other thing around equity is getting people what they need when they need it\nAnd I think that's the is the issue of my concerns give me an example of getting people what they need when they need a young person says we have a particular problem with this teacher who is constantly giving us disciplinary referrals\nConstantly grading us in ways that we feel to be dubious\nNow there needs to be so that racial equity team at the schoolhouse wherever that is that person needs to be in the conversation that racial equity team it can't be the conversation around young people most often happens in school houses that young people are blamed for this not equitable condition\nProfessor Lewis ... what do you find that the big barriers to advancing toward racial equity is it is it funding is that the people involved is a different for every school in every district what tends to get in the wet\nWell I'm going to talk about that part of the world and there are a lot of them and I think one of the things that um my colleague John Diamond and I found when we were doing the research for our buck\nWas that when you really try to understand why change it so hard it really is\nEspecially in these kinds of communities about the folks who have a lot of resources that have been served well by those districts for a long time not wanting change to happen and we talk about this or that kind of form of opportunity hoarding\nSupport for NPR comes from

tomorrow\nPoison it appears to be Russians preferred weapon of choice and we'll find out who Moscow was targeting and why\nWe like to know what questions you want answered so leave us a voicemail eight five five to three six one a one a America's relationship with Russia and what was the Soviet Union has had its fair share of ups and downs but\nWhat message do you think Washington should be sending to Moscow now\nEight five five to three six one a one a let's say five five to three six one two one two will dig deeper into the files of ... and get some of your questions tomorrow from Atlanta on one day\nBack now to our conversation with professors amend the Lewis and David Stovall Steve James and Charles Donaldson we asked some of the members of our ... how they believe their race affected their own educations and we got a ton of responses thank you for the mall\nOne person wrote the white adults in the neighborhood hated the fact that we were bussed in school we had to travel to and from school in groups to keep from being jumped by mobs\nAnother text club member wrote being Spanish and a woman I was told I could not be a scientist growing up took me years to wrap myself around the fact that I could be slower process than most but thankfully I made it\nA third texture wrote I watched as my African American friends whose grades weren't nearly as good as mine received scholarship after scholarship I worked hard throughout high school to be the first in my family to go to college yet I suffered because I was white unfair\nProfessor stove all there is a perception as you mentioned with regards to things like\nAdvanced placement courses in international baccalaureate courses and scholarships that the way we engage with race in a larger way can push too far\nThat we can give people of color an additional advantage just because they're black or brown and not because of their academic performance what do you make\nTo me I I mean it's not a thing around pushing\nYou make it to me I I mean it's not a thing around pushing too far I think it's a real issue will not pushing far enough right when we talk about equity we have to talk about who has historically been denied opportunity\nAnd then how are those opportunities denied in real time currently and because one white student did not get one scholarship does not mean\nThat black and Latino students across the country do not are not see who make re denied access so I think one of the conversations around race that becomes critical is to understand the individual and the structural and I think in the United states we are much more hesitant to engage the structural\nSteve what's got to be one of the challenges of a documentary like this particularly some of the reaction I Wonder what kinds of reactions it's gotten so far especially from from audience who are not people of color have even been able to parse out three actions that that finally\nWell I've I've not on Twitter for personal reasons but um [noise] but you know I think I'm so I'm not really equipped to answer that in any kind of thorough way but um you know I think uh my anecdotal experiences is that a lot of white audiences\nAre people watching it it it has been a good experience and more I open experience if for no other reason than there are other reasons is is that we've tried to take you more deeply into the lives of black and biracial kids who are not\nLiving in a poor besieged neighborhood in Chicago and at risk of gang violence and all of the things that we see an awful lot of in documentary filmmaking including some past work\nAnd I think that you know to to be able to give people the experiences of their lives and how they look at race and their experience with the with the community and America has been eye opening for for a lot of of white\nParents Charles how do you see this this difference when you were in high school and I I Want to ask you to speak for anyone high school but yours but in terms of white students students of color achievement these comments about you know students of color getting advantages just because of the color of their skin is just that reflect your experience and all my school or do you see it differently\nUm I think in general ... like they're kind of like how do I say there's this blanket we put over white kids as like your you know they always going to be warm\nRegardless of what happens all of them are always going to be one when it comes to kids of color there's like okay well we got like\nA whole bunch of the sleeping bags but we ain't got one blanket for everybody and only some people get that sleeping bag you know I definitely think for people like me and gay who's also a feature documentary where like\nI wouldn't say like the ... well I I didn't want to like compared to any other students but the school has like\nI guess prominent interest in us because of what we do without extra curricula and so it was just already saying that they're like okay we're going to make sure those kids are good you know but for someone who isn't in any extra curricular is who doesn't have any type of\nUm nine student teacher relationship with any adult in the building they like it's hard I think you know trapped in between the margins they don't get that sleeping bag I was talking about they're not even consider it to get one and that's like I think that's the whole thing right there is a blanket vices sleeping bag whereas like\nAll other white kids like all those kids who come from those types of homes and have states in the schools that parents are big funded their siblings went there whatever whatever any you got the kids too I mean like me luckily I found spoken word but your kid like me who\nI mean a few of my cousins went out the but other than that right\nI mean a few of my cousins went out to you but\nOther than that right there was nothing really to kind of have to fend for yourself exactly and we like it does is not the case you know I think it goes to show and um which episodes that we must have done it was like\nMost of the kid when he was on the news um tutoring sessions are usually white and all why this oh yeah oh I and that's that's part like you know personal accountability but that's also to school like\nYou got to have kids of color in honors classes for them to get on his tutoring but that was just the one right to you know so well\nTo that point I Wonder if we can dig deeper on that professor loose carry tweeted I'm eager to hear the reasons why African American kids don't get picked for tougher classes has anything changed in the past Thirty years\n[noise] you know it's hard to look at the high school level and understand you could take a snapshot of high school level but when we study districts like a park like Evan stand like Brookline mass like Shaker Heights I mean there's dozens and dozens of these kinds of districts\nThat tracking a kitten experience starts in first second and third grade and what we do in these districts we take it that might be you know an inch apart in terms of their skills coming in\nAnd we track them early and what we know over and over again for research is that that tracking means that kids are in a higher tax get more they get better they can better teaching and so we take it that might even be a niche apart in terms of skilled and we and we make that skills gap larger and larger over time\nAnd so when we look at school like a park and they've said earlier\nThe structure that we have in place around around things like cutting his academic tracks um are inevitably\nGoing to uh take racial disparities that exist in all our society and and reproduce them in our schools and the ... the troubling thing is that race becomes not only part of how these trucks get created and if you look at the history of the really deep\nRacist history of tracking and general race also becomes the explanation for why it's okay the fact that you can walk into a school today and twenty Eighteen and see that the most advantage educational faces in a school or Ninety percent white and the least advantaged educational expect you know places in the same exact school apparently black\nShould have us all up in arms about the fact that we think that that's okay it's all about our racial mythology\nI I think we also have to ask questions about what defines being educated and bought a good education is and you know I've heard a PE teachers including ... Williams the black or a teacher in the series\nLament the fact that it's a piece students often just want to be given the information they need to score well on the test that's what they want they're not really that interested in learning but just the it's a game it's an important day\nI mean in terms of a larger kind of a an as an editor for vacation like having a more well read\nLearned yes so some of the some of the most interesting and I think for far reaching in deep teaching what's going on to lower levels which is not to excuse the system that America is talking about but we just read the fine being educated in such narrow ways it's about eighty two scores\nAnd GPA's and that you know and that's what we defined as being an educated person\nBut I hear you on that Steve but at the same time you know I think about I'm not trying to excuse because sooner no I I hear that I hear that though I ...
