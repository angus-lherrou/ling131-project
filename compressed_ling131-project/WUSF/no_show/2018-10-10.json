you might want to listen to this conversation later on line at the one a dot org\nLet's get to a few more of your calls Heather in Indianapolis is on the line hey Heather what's on your mind what'd you think of the movie\nHey well of course I loved it but I loved it for entertainment value but my big piece was that moment when he brought her onstage knowing that was not her comfort down knowing what she'd been told that she wasn't going to be good enough that no one would care that no one there to find her interesting or attractive\nAnd she just went out and she killed it and they loved it and for that has second ac that she realized they were wrong and everything they said to her now those are pretty important moment if you're someone who's been afraid to put yourself out there for the same reasons is kind of a big moment\nYeah I I I hear you on that just does that resonate for you in a way like was there something personal that that made you flash back to er sad about for ...\nAbsolutely yeah I think you know\nI Do a lot of things where I have to go out in front of crowds or in front of people and you often hear you know you need to be dinner or projects lower or beat this or that are younger and at that moment with kind of all of this it was kind of all of us will have that moment it we can personalize it whether it's in an interview or what have you and I think that was an important\nOr with Heather what'd you think about that whole storyline was her nose like for me that kind of set up that moment on stage very well but things with her nose\nYes yes I mean I'm just like a little bit sick as a person and for me her nose is like my weight so she owned it she's like this is my no names needs to take me as I Am and she worked at it\nYou know got tend to accept that this is me and it's not going to change and I thought it it kind of an ill\nYeah yeah how do I really appreciate your calling and thanks very much for talking to us and I love Ann Powers I Love that kind of commentary on the music industry that was kind of baked into the film particularly the thing about her nose when they're standing on the roof top in LA and there's that alley billboard and he says we should have just a bowl billboard your nose\nI think the thing about the comments about her nose is also a guy guys\nHonoring Barbra Streisand [laughter] one of the greatest performers and greatest\nHonoring Barbra Streisand [laughter] one of the greatest performers and greatest noses to ever a exist and and thrive in Hollywood as far as coming on the music industry it absolutely is a powerful comment on the music industry\nAs the music industry existed I don't know maybe ten years ago I think that where this thing has placed in time where this movie its place in time it's interesting to think about that\nBecause almost everything that happens still happens today and the music industry but there's really no acknowledgement of how things are rapidly changing with the advent of streaming and playlists and\nUm the major record by both having less power than they used to so it's almost like we own fashion and its view of the music industry but only that view would would work for this film you couldn't really\nTackle a the collapse of the music industry in this in this movie\nLinda Holmes could you also try to end but by the way which for those who have not seen star is born will not be seeing stars one but just kind of want to be on on the conversation she\nTells Bradley keepers character fairly early on that she's dealt with music industry people who were like yeah your songs are you saying well but your nose you know just isn't quite right\nFor music and that was kind of one of those petty impediments that had prevented her from getting where she wanted to go into homes I Wonder how you view that commentary on the music industry when I was watching the movie\nI felt like I was thinking about Lady Gaga because Lady Gaga herself has this kind of over the top persona that she created to kind of be the vehicle for her art\nI also thought about pink\nWho is very much an invention of pop music but who also have this kind of rye\nStyle style but almost commented on it as she was doing it and that was what made people love her\nYeah I mean I think that um I agree with and that\nThe view of the music industry in this film in order to be aligned with the view of Hollywood and the previous films in some ways\nIs very linear it's a very linear idea of there is the one um road to fame there is one pass you just simply offend or D sand as opposed to there's no suggestion that either one of them that he or she\nMight have success in a a different kind of version of what it means to be famous like that he would score movies or you know that she would develop her own you know following through streaming\nWith out kind of going through that traditional path agree with Anna about that but I think\nThat um I'm not sure that you could do it any other way I think the purpose is to have them passed each other on this fame ladder and I think you kind of have to construct it that way and what you're saying about Lady Gaga you know I'm the caller was talking about kind of seeing\nA alley the character\nTalking about well I have to and I'm really afraid and I don't have confidence in my nose or whatever it is funny to see an artist's like Lady Gaga who had been so able to make such an indelible mark on the industry and on popular culture I mean\nThe funny thing about this movie it's she is way more important to culture than he is um if you're talking about the real people\nSo it's kind of funny to see her big personality taking advice from you know Bradley Cooper who's had a much more traditional Hollywood leading man type of career right um it's odd and that way\nYeah except for the voice in rocketing guardians of the galaxy that's a little bit more of a diversion but you're right I mean she is much more of like typical leading man actor I Wonder also John in terms of the story line you know one of the big parts of the storyline is the love story and Bradley spent a lot of time sitting up that first time meeting\nAnd Bradley send a lot of time sitting up that first time meeting here's a piece of that moment from a star is born when they're falling in love in a grocery store parking lot and Lady Gaga character alley is just improvising a love song and they found [noise]\n... time can [noise]\nTo [noise]\n\n... [noise]\nBradley Cooper Lady Gaga in a star is born Cooper spoke to NPR's MORNING EDITION with the host Rachel Martin about his work and said this about working with Lady Gaga\nAnd then we went to the piano and saying and it was just kind of wonderful thing I couldn't believe it\nSo that was the beginning of the journey and the first time we sang together I mean everything's live we say we sing everything live in the movie wow you know there's nothing we're not just lips thinking\nAnd I turned to Lady Gaga who's seen next to me and she was looking at me like I was Jackson, Maine when any when you're in a scene in the actors fully believing that you're the character you cannot believe it yourself so she really gave me the confidence\nBradley Cooper speaking to Rachel Martin on NPR's MORNING EDITION John horn what did you make of the collaboration between Bradley Cooper Lady Gaga particularly how it came out in the way the love story played out\nThis is my big problem with the film and I think for a lot of people it's not an issue it was for me when her character an alley first meet jak he was a stumbling blackout drunk\nAnd I think it looks as if he's just spend a weekend at a bar do Kevin Cavanaugh KCUR and I don't find that interesting or attractive if she had met him sober and he fell into alcoholism\nAnd stayed with him it would be more interesting he's he's increasingly mean he had petty and I think as his alcoholism ... becomes words he\nSpectrum ... chief meteorologist Mike ... says Wendy tonight a very good\nChance of showers and thunderstorms alone Seventy seven pretty much the same forecast for tomorrow\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere capital one what's in your wallet capital one NA\nFrom El severe a global information analytics business serving scientists and clinicians with a commitment to helping them manage their work more efficiently so they can spend more time making breakthroughs el severe dot com\nAnd from the John D and Catherine's the MacArthur Foundation a Mac found dot org\nBack now to this month's meeting of the one movie club which empowers Linda Holmes and John horn let's get to a few more of your calls now gene is listening in Indianapolis hey gene what did you think of a star is born\nWho their genes can you hear me yes I have a five stars which was five stars\n[noise] um actually I just loved everything about this I've actually seen the other versions and this one seems particularly well updated to today um I was ... Iowa City of\nHer being discovered\nBecause she was a drunk and looking for a drink and their life being torn apart at the end because of drink I mean that was the continually thing and one one thing I don't think other people have mentioned is the part that her agent\nI guess he was your age or the guy who made her over\nThe manager do agent played yeah what what is your main character\nI didn't like him\nAnd I I guess I wasn't supposed to but ah the minute he had that conversation\nWith jacks and um and and basically getting ready to accuse ... are accusing him of being a problem in that whole relationship I just I just knew that that was going to be the start of of something really bad happening\nYeah I'd I hear Eugene a hundred percent of it and I heard your charming and as well\nNo that was a male nominee go yeah I think I think one of the tricks and this goes a little bit back to what you were all talking about about the mental health and recovery portions of this story one of the tricks with the manager and I think\nThey do such a beautiful job of explaining where he is in his recovery process and where he is I'm thinking about mental health and they made her seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she's been wary of them\nCars seem like someone who is aware of what his problems are she'd been wary of them from the beginning um but then they are ultimately headed toward this pre determined tragic ending in which um he died of suicide and so\nI think the manager I think the conversation with the manager unfortunately seems like a forest element\nThat it doesn't feel organic to the story it feels like it comes in to just drive that last you know to drive that ending and it doesn't seem organic necessarily to to the story as they've developed debt\nBecause when he's been through these um recovery process is\nDoes it seem like without speaking to her he would hear that from the manager I mean obviously depression and an addiction can operate in a lot of different ways for sure but you know did the movie really do a good job of explaining why that conversation at that moment would be enough\nTo drive this enormous decision that that he makes and I'm not sure it did I think that's where I found the ending to be not as satisfying as I thought the rest of the film was by agree\nWith you on that and on top of that I think that the movie had a way you know I was always taught you know in in writer school show don't tell and there was this moment in the film where Ali says I Want jak on my tour make it happen or are we are done\nAnd I feel like there could have been a moment where for example she goes on to say to her with her and he can't keep up or he keeps we're getting the lyrics or he falls down draw like something could have happened to someone coming to him and saying you know your bad for her right so that would have like plead that whole narrative in a different way for me it\nExactly someone he doesn't really know someone he hasn't necessarily trust they'd come in and is able to kind of up in his entire sense of his relationship with her I think that part of that the narrative issue with the ending\nLet's go ahead and go as\nWell of course of course the the ways in which a Hollywood and the fame machine or the same monster is like the guy got what's called ... and one of her albums a destroys people is a major theme\nThroughout all of the versions of star is born in there and in fact all the bridges of SARS going to have that manager character in a different embodiment\nUm that character in this film I\nAbsolutely agree was more personally slimy felt like you know a villain whereas in in some of the previous versions he almost with a sympathetic enabler um of of the male lead and who then was like hey you know\nWe're trying to keep them afloat but he's going to mess you up\nEsther Esther was the first name of alley or in the star is born versions so the story of Hollywood destroying people\nUm requires that a a stand in for the machine be part of the part of the cast you know has to be there um I also just want to say before we end got to get this out there that um\nThis is also the story of how a woman's arrives leads to a man's fall [laughter]\nAnd that's an internal\nProblem with the stars bar and you know um it's a melodrama it's it's a melodrama is traditionally aimed at women we feel very sympathetic a ... toward the lead female character but there is this underlying\nSense have to say it that even as Jackson, Maine is\nTemporarily by the energy he he gets almost empirically from his young protege ultimately he is destroyed because she has moved into the center and he has been pushing the periphery feminist reading\nMoved into the center and he has been pushing the periphery feminist raining\nProblematic found well but you're not the only one who's brought that up I mean Julian wrote on our Facebook page I fear the story of a rising female star nursing a failing male ego is the wrong story in this meat to era\nWe get to a few more of your views of the film Harvey in Ann Arbor emailed I saw this film hoping to be moved crying deeply engaged that didn't happen for stars\nI deeply appreciative guys nuanced shyness in her early portrayal which made main characters advising her work well I'd like to have the same Eliot brother character better develops possibly a moment perhaps a moment could have been written into the car rides the bar possibly dropping him off from the performance\nIs scenes seemed a little too detached from Maine overall I Love the big venue concert treatments\nThat kind of gets to a comment from Largo in ... North Carolina who tweeted three stars a star is born was a story the performances especially the musical ones were fantastic and the cinematography was incredible\nI expect a lot of nominations to come for deep ie the director of photography cinematographer Matthew Lee but peak production designer Karen Murphy costumer Aaron been hacked score original song and editing\nJohn horns spoke with the cinematographer Matthew Lee ... about shooting live performances which are not really straightforward spaces to navigate\nHere is a part of that conversation from Cape PC sees the frame\nThis film was very difficult to sort of navigate the stage performances because we had three different modes basically we had the Coachella mode which is I'm borrowing stages or that were already set up with a lady that was already existing\nAnd putting in our own crowds and then there was the I'm running guns sort of we have ten minutes to shoot in between two sets with a real audience apologizing in thanking the audience for I'm sort of I'm shooting a movie in between\nTwo bands and then we had the third which is the Greek theater which in which shallow was performed where we um we actually in more of a movie fashion was able to create the Greek theater as a set\nAnd put a certain amount of crowded and so that was my most controlled um scenario but the lighting of it had to have a consistency might my goal was that um you know in creating a a character from St Louis and with our resemblance\nJackson, Maine might as well be um [noise] well I don't know Jack White and I had to make sure that the ...\nThe audience maybe subconsciously filled the this is his lady business his road show and it's also in the film in the sort of visual moving into a representation of rock and roll\nThat was Matthew ... cinematography or on a star is born speaking to John horn on Cape ... sees the frame\nJohn can you talk a little bit more about the making of this film particularly back to Kathleen ths question who wrote on Facebook how you can tell if a film is well directed this kind of a film the way the mask you described it presents all kinds of additional challenges to make it a well directed film shooting in so many different kinds of locations\nYeah I think the ultimate question about what is it is not a well directed film it's do you believe that do you believe you're watching Bradley Cooper or do you believe you're watching Jackson, Maine if you think you're watching the actor you're not in a well directed movie if you are with the character", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "Tampa", "day": "10"}
