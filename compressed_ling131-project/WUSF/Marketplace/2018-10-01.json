slashed\nTo address the challenges of a changing world more intellectual dot edu splashing dishing can't wait [noise]\nIn Washington DC I'm Lizzie O'Leary in for ... it is Monday the first of October good as always to have you with us\nAnd we start today with NAFTA or rather than deal to replace it last night after about a year of trade negotiations the U.S Mexico and Canada finally reach the United states Mexico Canada agreement or us MCA\nAnd this we will have a result of much more happening right here in the United states it means more than anything else far more American Jobs and these are high quality jobs\nThey're also strong provisions to enforce what's called the rules of origin requirements this will incentivize billions of dollars a new purchasers of us made automobiles\nAll right so you heard the president let's unpack this agreement a little bit new name and all we've got marketplaces Scott Tom Hi Scott ...\nManufacturing powerhouse that's the president's phase that's what he said this new trade deal is going to create in the U.S [noise] so let's talk jobs first um states really going to create new jobs\nAt the very least it it's unclear so it looks like automobiles auto jobs at the center of the rhetoric of everything I envy and and where a lot of the jobs involved are so a few simple let's say you assemble cars of trucks to sell\nHere in North America you might be Toyota or GM or BMW right now sixty two and a half percent of your content has to be from Mexico where the U.S or Canada that's to avoid tariffs under the current deal or a text\nSo this new deal written after two point oh whatever yep it was set up to Seventy five percent of the ideas well let's make North American cars even more North American ... now here's the problem\nThe problem is the sanction ready or else right you have to do these chores or else I take away your phone right we say that in my house while the or else here is the terror of two and a half percent so if you make cars and Mexico where it's cheaper and have a lot of auto makers dug their way out of the great recession\nYou might say well you know instead of messing with my supply chain in finding parts in Indiana where it's expensive and his bureaucratic\nI'm just going to eat the tariff of two and a half percent in since uh non compliant anyway I might source more my parts from low cost places like China I'll just get around it so that makes for more jobs in China and more jobs in Mexico\nOr let's say OK I followed the rules I have more U.S content for more U.S suppliers that's probably going to be more expensive for my costs go up my prices go up I Can't compete I might do fewer cars than sales go down and I lay off people so several ways this could backfire as far as jobs\nWhen he talked about jobs one of the big focus this year has been high wage jobs and they're probably Asian and that you create and protect auto jobs that pay at least sixteen dollars an hour [laughter] what fit\nInto that so there's still said a large percentage of each vehicle has to be made my workers who make sixty bucks an hour or more\nSo what uh companies do when we just got pushed up sometimes yes the hiring more workers who make more money\nSometimes they say you know what it's time for me to want to invest in Warsaw scored and more robots more automation to replace people and the cost of worker goes up and the cost of automation goes down there is no guarantee that employers are going to respond the way we think they might\nWell don't looking a little more broadly and take off all of the terrorists against Canada and Mexico you know not all off the table um it's a little confusing what's here and what's not\nSo right now we do have tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum those are those are now those are in place in the justification is because of national security so\nThose are announced those are in place in the justification is because of national security soaked Canadian steel Mexican still still subject to that and\nIt's more complicated but there could be similar tariffs on automobiles coming as well we're waiting for the Trump Administration on that that's on a separate track but for right now yeah steel tariffs are still in place in North America\nAnd filing and just sitting here in D.C today what are the chances that song get approved by Congress well\nGood luck with your predicting a vote on this would come next year after the midterms when there's a good chance to Democrats convert or take the house right and historically Democrats have been more anti trade deal that this deal is more complex than might have pieces that Democrats could support but whether they're going to give the president a victory that's a different question\nMark ... thank you very much You're welcome NAFTA has had a long history questioned for yet who was the first president to talk about that idea we've got a video with the answer just go to market place dot ORG and click on a little tab that Ted mentioned on air\nNow we're going to stay with trade and the U.S M. C. A.\nThe White House said the agreement is day quote we in for American farmers ranchers and agribusiness well someone in that category is Patrick Smith he runs lost his ranch in ... in Washington they grow apples and also hopped for beer\nWashington state is a big producer on both those crops and Mexico and Canada are big buyers\nWe've had Patrick on before to talk about all that so welcome back\nThings will be glad to be here\nAll right so based on what you know so far um how did this yeah look\nI'm so far I think there's a lot for farmers to be a excited about in this deal farmers of course to deal with a lot of uncertainty already and so taking away some of the uncertainty regarding a couple of our most important trading partners is welcome news for most of us\nDo do you think the people around you um are you know X handling a little bit today\nI Do I Do I think um you know Mexico's is a very important markets for us agriculture in general and in our region especially fresh apples and ah with the back and forth on trade over the last few months Mexico had established the tariffs on us apples\nAnd yeah so now apple in this deal\nHas no tariffs applied to them and I think for us up here in the in the central part of Washington state that's a big relief\nDon't last time you're on the show you talked about apple exports slowing down do do you think that maybe this deal you know speeds up apple exports this year I had that ship friday sale\nI think we're hoping that export levels will return to where they were earlier this year you know we were having a really good movement into Mexico in the first four or five months of the year and then this summer after the terrorists were\nImposed that movement slowed down significantly and so hopefully we do see a return to those levels from the first half of the year and we're hopeful that that will get there in short order\nWhen you look at that are you sitting there thinking this is just nasty again or are there different is that you see I mean how just plan for you on the ground at the same thing with a different name\nIt does kind of looked like that from our end right now I'm I'm sure that there are some differences for maybe some under other industries but for for us and our businesses\nUm both tops and apples that looks a lot like a what we've had last for years and and that's good\nYou know are you still concerned about trade in in the rest of the world trade with Asia for example or has this given you enough breathing room that you get to sleep you didn't I\nThink we're still hopeful that this is one step toward maybe normalizing a trading relationships with Asia with\nMaybe normalizing a trading relationships with Asia with Europe\nMexico and Canada of course are two very very important markets for us but we're moving apples and hops from around the world and would like to be um you know more of these types of deals come a similar to the Trans Pacific partnership\nA that was a pulled out of but more of these types of deals would be very welcome to buy most of us in in our industry\nI ask you the first time you're on the show in twenty sixteen you were worried about having enough workers to do the work you do and harvest your prompts a is that still an issue for you\nYeah absolutely is labor in our part of the country up here a farm labor is still a somewhat scares for us in many other employers in this region a worm extensively using the industry just worker visa program to help me our labor names\nAnd there are some bills that are you know somewhere in Congress right now that would\nMake them positive changes to the program but a lot of those efforts have kind of stalled out over the last few months and so we're hopeful that we will see changes to the program as soon as Congress was ready to act\nOn it Patrick Smith from Loftis ranch is good to have you back on the show great thankfully\nSeven Fridays only\nWith veteran pain is nine says partly cloudy skies and the forecast tonight there is a thirty percent chance of evening showers Jill overnight low will be about Seventy six degrees\n\nIs marketplace I'm Lizzie O'Leary infer ... General Electric told investors today that its CEO John ... out after only about a year on the job\nThe company also said yeah it's going to make that profit forecast this year frankly thing not great at the which means it's a question what is the role of industrial conglomerate in today's economy anyway marketplaces any humor has that one\nGeneral Electric is a far cry from the company Thomas Edison cofounded back in the Eighteen nineties today G. E. makes aircraft engines equipment for oil and gas production and medical imaging among many other things perhaps too many things as John Joseph he teaches management at the University of California Irvine\nIt is a time when the industrial conglomerate is gone\nHe says competition and market conditions change very quickly today so companies have to react on a dime\nTypically big industrial conglomerates one does not think of being double\n... been trying to focus the firm's folded insurance out ... years ago and rained and its lending business after heavy losses during the financial crisis Lawrence wide economics professor at NYU says these focused trends tend to ebb and flow well gee ... trying to get smaller\nAmazon is going in the opposite direction\nHe's right Amazon got grocery stores Web services and is talking about getting into health care all a far cry from its original idea of just mainly new books but John ... UC Irvine argues that Amazon is different because it's leveraging a central platforms even though it appears to be spread out it's more focused than it seems\nAmazon is attempting to bring you know

costs LA's not the only city to the right track a chunk of the Web turned up similar actions this year in San Francisco New York D.C Houston and Portland\nThese are all places that you would expect them to be if you're Michelle Wild Anderson a Stanford professor who studies urban poverty\nThere places that are we could think of a job or ranch and housing poor\nThat is metro areas that have added many more new jobs and residents than housing unit the classic recipe for high rent\nRent level and the housing conditions have gotten so far\nOf whack with each other that people basically start

structural integrity of the buildings were not complaining or we just want to get free rent no we want to pay a rat but we want to live in a safe environment\nIn its statement after no management says that all maintenance requests are handled immediately but rent strikes don't come without risk in the case of the Burlington apartments the landlord moved to evict the striking tenants they dropped most of those suits in September after tend to agree to pay what they could in back rent\nBut at least three tendons work effect in Los Angeles I imagine a marketplace [noise]\n\nThis final note
