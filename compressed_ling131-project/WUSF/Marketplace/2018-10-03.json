with not investing in that is due to the time value of money\nIt's not clear what President Trump was referring to when he tweeted about the time value of money he wasn't specific and the times story

on third avenue ... was drizzling last friday and when we had it over to the headquarters of J. P. Morgan Chase security guy medicine looks up to the forty eighth floor where we called our heels for a little bit waiting for Jamie diamond that's on us we were early\nSo we had a chance to poke around a little bit lots of sports memorabilia on the shelf business and management books to interestingly enough bank history stuff as well diamond showed up pretty much on time we did the usual chitchat as we got settled talked about how we got into banking he's the son and grandson of stockbrokers by the way and then we got down to it\nDo you think um people understand banks in this economy like you understood banks when you were to\nSome people are the same things as a consumer so you know if you've taken a mortgage your checking account\nIf you have a business need alone if you're a large corporation you have to sell equity your debt that you understand don't necessarily see in the inner workings of the bank does it matter what it does to me but I don't I don't think should matter to the customer know what the customer wants to do a good experience and you know a good credit card and a good yeah\nYeah but does it matter whether American consumers understand the way the financial system works\nI think ... I think it matters to understand how business in general works so if you don't have a financial system you don't have an economy so defense is is just part of his great economy America has the widest deepest most transparent financial markets the world's ever seen in total I'm including private equity venture capital\nThe formation of business the transparency of our capital markets and no other country has or it's not even close is kind of it's kind of a part of the engine that makes us the most prosperous economy in the world\nYou come to that we just come to that not without some scars right and we'll get to the crisis a little bit later on but but what do you think um the financial sectors role in this society is what is the banks responsibility in this society\nI mean the most important thing is you help grow a prosperous economy that helps the most people and they create the wealth by which you could take care of your old you are sick you're poor and so I I think people should have said that you need a healthy banking system my daughter asked me and the financial crisis\nYou know what your financial crisis it was a card that happens every seven to ten years I wasn't being facetious I was looking at Nineteen Seventy four Nineteen eighty two Nineteen eighty seven Nineteen Ninety and ... and one of things makes me cautious is knowing all that I always always always wanted to run\nIs knowing all that I always always always wanted to run the bank that we can survive anything show that were there in good times and bad times and ... more important in bad times for clients\nLots in there and we're going to get to the crisis in a jacket as I said I Want to talk for a second about I'm a corporate social responsibility which you are and this banker believer you talked about that a little bit\nI've always I've I've never believed it only seems to maximize shareholder value in fact I don't know any CEOs were that way I think these\nCountries wait so sorry how how come everybody thinks all companies just want to maximize should I say\nIt just becomes a narrative it gets repeated over and over companies have to do a very good job over an extended period of time to get customers back\nOr companies that take care of customers succeed if they rip off customers they don't\nTo me if you don't take care of your employees you don't take care of your customers you will not have financial success okay and so they're they're all related and taking care of your customers and clients\nThey want you to be a good community citizen you were in favor of the president's tax cuts and it was the regulatory months I Am and I was in favor of the president's business tax cuts\nI think it was a fabulous platform for Jake more to grow so I still would have done that one\nAre you satisfied that um we have the protections in place now\nTo avoid something like that happening again for you should never be\nTo avoid something like that happening again\nYeah you should never be satisfied and I are more explained that during\nThe regular should I say they really should be happy and take a victory lap I give you just do leeman redux it wouldn't happen\nThey would have had not twenty below the capital but fifty but because of the regulation yeah sort of play they would have had a lot more liquidity a lot more transparency\nIf it did go bankrupt at the moment of bankruptcy it would have created another hundred billion dollars back what do you ever been most over cap wise for him in the world the government can run it and do whatever they want that but I think it was an orderly unwind yeah but I Believe it was a ... or early unwind assets were thrown people couldn't get their cash markets we're going to collapse because they had to sell assets\nThat was ... so the capital liquidate the banking system is stronger but with the way you look at risk I I don't just guess what the future as I say what is the worst you could possibly be and can we handle it\nAnd to me family means I can still certain my client does not mean to have to run in panic\nBut you can always be quite as their question where's the next problem coming from it will be different from the last problem cyberattacks on other institutions clearing houses and I'm not worried about shadow banking but they're always going to be ... shadow banking so if you're a regulator you should be really cautious about what's happening away from banks\nAre you worried about you know given all that cyber and all of that are you worried about um the fed and its actions are and are you worried about a politician and then stepping up\nAnd I'm not worried about both we planned for both not being exactly the way you expect it so I Need the fed is doing the right thing and raising rates the economy is quite strong\nAnd they just think it was just normalizing it but you know is it possible that down the road something happens it's too much inflation if that's going to move quicker that's possible so I'm not predicting it but my and my company could easily handle it but it is possible just likes them just like\nThe terrorists can cause problems you don't anticipate today just like cyber can cause a problem just like James who can cause problems I mean you always got to be looking to figure out makes you can handle bad outcomes you jumping\nAhead of my list of questions because I Want to get to ... but a lot less money back you up for me on the healthy account and I'm not going to argue that the headlines ... jobs GDP all of that good stuff\nBut as you said on the forty whatever it is Florida this building looking out literally yet at the American economy there's income inequality there's wage stagnation which has just recently started to pick up I mean there are some non small problems yeah\nSo the American public's understand that this is the most prosperous economy world's ever seen that way and I'm not that I mean I I watch it but the good in the bad guy so the good as we have wonderful neighbors in Canada and Mexico\nAre we've got all all of the food water and energy we need\nWe have or what the founding fathers gave a freedom of religion and freedom of speech and freedom enterprise the best universities wisely with capital markets\nAnd yes income inequality the real issue and we studied it and they're fixes to it\nThe economy has been going in ... and ... and it was driving low wage growth less small business formation and all these other things that we need to fix okay but load and there are fix the American poet you know everything we talk about their or fixes for be put her mind to it and kind of dropped a Democrat or Republican view of it all\nI appreciate the positivity not truly I Do if there was some reality are right we have serious problems with many other countries in this global economy we are pulling back from the international arena the president said in the at the un across town a couple of days ago is America First right so\nDo you reconcile that with what you call for in your letter which in intelligence thoughtful analytical and comprehensive policy where virtually have\nSlipping a bit to make all that we have not had more of a cat or Mexico's in Eighteen forty eight\nMexico's actually doing quite well and we treat them very respectfully but you're actually correct this trade\nIt's been quite well and we should treat them very respectfully\nBut you're actually correct this trade issue a medical a skirmish yeah yeah and it will so what people are afraid about is that it will get worse into what we call trade winds so what do you see that it's going to make it not get worse from a skirmish 'cause it sure doesn't look like anybody backing down that look we devised the president that while you were young while you were you\nHere we have and I know lots of us have done it and I'm most which said\nThat we understand the issue to China and he's right non tariff barriers tariff barriers will property all intellectual property enterprises subsidies et cetera I'm hoping the other day to president succeeds him where he wants to do and I say hey you know your method worked I'm just worried that the method can cause more problems stoop\nTo put on your your most objective Jamie diamonds self here for a second an answer this question\nOr is it possible that you have too much power in this economy you're\nI don't think so I mean there are all in a lot of leverage here or twenty eight million companies in America\nI mean you know we we are one actor of many in this economy and there are a lot of other big banks do other than I Am going to be competing window the Chinese banks folks I I don't say that lightly\nThey they are already they have a bigger home market they make more money to were worth more than ...\nThere's so many Chinese banks make more money than we do they have aspirations ... they're going overseas and they showed their find their Chinese companies overseas and they should and they will be competing with us in a lot of things we also practical one day with alley pay and we chat and ten cent and\nSo I I look at the world um is they don't want this was a great I'm say no we're gonna have competitors I Want Jake more chase be the best bank in the world I wanted to be an American bank\nAnd it would be I think it'd be a mistake for America the best banks in the world and the biggest banks in the world were Chinese banks well so here's actually a good phone question do we as an economy\nOr get the benefit of your size that makes it worth the risk of you being so big\nYes because remember scale economy shot is true for banks is true for auto companies are two ... industries the beneficiary of skill of economics is declined\nBut it's not the company because capitalism forces to return to the company lower uh and and also our size and diversity it's why we had no issues to distort [noise]\n\nThere was a whole lot
