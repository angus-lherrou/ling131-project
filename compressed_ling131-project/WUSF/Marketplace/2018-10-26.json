through September much\nBecause you knew there was going to be a bug numbers are nothing without context which is a why we're here but it's also be\nWhen you'll Richardson from ... from the Washington Post art in our studios in New York City everybody Hi tai chi\nChi search out and let me start with you uh and and in the process of asking this question I'm going to point out that we're going to be hearing from a tree in motion in about six minutes or so on some of the details of uh the GDP report as deals with trade but a very quick pass on the GDP report it is a good number\nYeah the headline number is good there are some underlying parts of it that are a little bit troubling including the fact that business investment I had had slowed\nYou know there is this risk that the booth to a capital expenditure as was pretty front loaded this year as a result of the times and we're seeing a slow down and so that is a little bit troubling but generally the headline number was good consumers seem happy\nNew and it occurs me actually just thinking back to how I open the show that I should have said there is that there are three or fours right economic growth the trade war and also the tax cuts because there was a tension there between the trade one of the tax cuts in the stimulus and the and the un stimulus if you will of what's going on\nLet's well it down to two things uh one is higher interest rates which the stimulus feeds into and stronger grass and right now\nFor a short period of time maybe we are at an economics sweet spot for the economy can still grow but inflation is still very moderate in fact below\nThe Fed's target rate of two percent in this latest GDP read and so right now I think they're looking good economically speaking in as good as Catherine's had because the consumer it's good I\nI hear some trepidation do in your voice now\nYou know there's no such thing as a perfect the economy and part of the reason that markets were worried this week and we saw that in the stock market this week is there there were these three per se to stick concerns\nSlower global growth higher interest rates and terrorists in trade tension concerned [laughter] those are going to stay with us until they're resolved and so you'll see the push pull in the market between really strong fundamentals and I'm very worried outlook for ... investors ahead\nOkay Katherine not to point out the president's ah economic inconsistencies but it bears leaving them out well well uh [laughter]\nSo so here's the thing just on the street and tariffs and he he came out this week in a in a tweet at some point Monday Tuesday and said we're going to get billions of dollars in the United states because of all these jobs not mentioning the consumer is going to pay those jobs but then he turns around in an interview with Wall Street journal and says tariffs we don't have any terms on this economy I don't I don't understand I guess is what I'm saying\nWell and in that very same Wall Street journal article he also talked about how useful the terrorists had been you know like basically in the same breath ah you know on the one hand he's saying we have these tariffs on the other hand he's saying the tears don't exist\nIt can make your head spin a little bit and you can understand why it has been so difficult for some of our trading partners potentially to negotiate with the people who have been dispatched to negotiate on behalf of the United states\nIf they don't really know what the president wants to the president is inconsistent about not only what he wants but actually what he'd already been doing then that could be that can make it very difficult to make any sort of progress and you know I when I've talked with a business groups when I talked with business owners they have expressed\nTalked with a business groups when I talked with business owners they have expressed a lot of concern about the the uncertainty that comes from the fact that Trump does not seem to have a particularly sophisticated understanding of international trade or clear goals for that matter about what he's trying to get out of these negotiations\nKnew what other item from the wall Street Journal interview and and uh one has to say if the goal right is to put pressure on the Federal Reserve he once again called the fed uttered by Jay Powell a his biggest ah economic problem\nI'm even as a German pal told me back in June even as the fed doesn't pay any attention what the president says one does wonder if\nNow with some signs perhaps the economy might not be a all that it will be for too much longer [noise] um and the fed might be thinking about rage what does this kind of pressure used both due to the motive Jay Paul well\nYou know it makes a hard job even that much harder right so what that is really concerned about it how to keep the economic bull market renting how to keep economic growth in and stop lung still normalizing policy because women as\nAnd we know that it will be all end eventually the neck and recession hits he wants to make sure that he has to look at it fully ready to to stop a\nThe slowdown is possible and that means raising short term interest rates at the very effective tool the fed has been using it for years and they want to make sure that tools ready for the next recession\nAnd they want to do so in in a context of economic growth and that that's what's happening here I'm very moderate increase in short term interest rates from zero rain so\nAlong that path any political ... political realization of a very moderate increase in rates makes the heart his job all the more tricky and that sweat and has to be negotiated going for port\nBill Richardson a at a Edward Jones Catherine Rampell at the Washington Post on a friday I'm In New York city don't you\nThink you kinda thanks guys\nHave a nice weekend on Wall street today down day to ended up and down weak and let me say one more time I think like the fourth time this week I've said this this is normal this is what's supposed to happen markets go up to go down but it has been a while some things have felt this chopping rent we'll have details when we do the numbers [noise]\n\nIn [noise]\n\nIn part\nBack we're going to go to the GDP report from this morning because you know a list economic indicator and all that is Catherine and you'll and I were saying it's pretty good number credit where credit's due\nTo dig a little deeper as we're want to do around here and you could start to separate what is boosting economic growth consumer spending for instance from what is not helping rose all that much at all one of those drugs last quarter was trade marketplaces Tracey Samuelson explains what's going on there\nSo how much faster would the economy have grown without this drag from trade\nYou would have seen a much larger growth rate probably closer to over five percent at the end of you know is chief us economist at ... global what you saw with experts down pretty sharply imports were up pretty sharply\nTogether that shaped nearly two percentage points off of GDP Growth\nBut he says imports were driven by a strong dollar which is making foreign products a good deal plus she says companies were replenishing their inventories filling up their shelves head of the holidays they may also be trying to get ahead of tariffs on Chinese imports that are set to jump from ten percent to twenty five percent in the new year\nTo expand now and have it ready to travel rather than having to purchase more that cost more\nOr travel rather than having to purchase more that cost more down the road\nThis macro economic data matches what we've been hearing from public companies as they report their quarterly earnings Matt McDonald is a partner with Hamilton place strategies which transcripts from recent corporate earnings calls\nThe trade discussion has edged out tax or farmed for the first time and when they're talking about trade there almost all talking about tariffs\nFor example Ford has estimated the Trump administration's trade policy will cost the company a billion dollars this year in part due to higher fuel prices and tariffs on imports from China\nThat does feel like from both the way companies are talking about it and from what we see in the GDP numbers that the impact of starting to bite\nAt least at that country and company level consumers just aren't feeling it yet a majority responding to a recent marketplace Edison research poll fifty to protect the parents had no impact on them personally I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nWe've gotten some insights into the fortunes of a couple of key technology companies as they've reported earnings this week one key insight in particular\nHow many people use their services snap or Snapchat lost two million daily active users in his most recent quarter Twitter so it's active user base jobs the boots more fake accounts will get Facebook's active user can't win it reports earnings to actually put his portrait as they are to the companies do\nThe storage on on a class\nYou know old school sometimes the better the storage on on a cloud obviously is just basically somebody else's server but you when you need long term archival storage you want something separate it from the Internet and you want something that's going to hold massive amounts of data even more than a server and that's where the tape comes in\nAnd the experts say the tape is the medium of choice because\nIt's cheap it's good it's it's reliable and its stores a heck of a lot of data\nYeah Jim cheapest important with all that data right I mean I don't even know what gets bigger than terabytes but we have a lot of them\nYeah at ... terabytes is equivalent to about a million bucks [noise] um right now a a single LTS seven linear tape can hold about Fifteen terabytes so that's about Fifteen million bucks on one tape on one\nCard okay now there's a corporate store you're right there's it's Tony and food you film or the makers of this tape that everybody now uses and we'll be using for awhile and they're sort of at loggerheads here explain what's going on\nSo there's a basic standardized technology that was developed by IBM H. P. and ... it's called the linear tape open\nThere used to be six manufacturers now there's two and those two have said oh you're using my patent in Latin inventions and the other one says no you're using my patented inventions and each one has filed complaints that the international Trade Commission in here in Washington trying to shut the other one out of the U.S market\nPotential courses but if there's only one supplier of this tape and we're using it tobacco basically everything that's an issue\nAnd that's the concern of the hardware companies um they have filed some papers with the ATC saying please don't shut eyes of the amount uh we want to have multiple suppliers\nUm both of them by the way our in Japan there though there are concerns about what happens if there's another earthquake what happens if there's another Saddam me that shuts down operations\n... give me the upshot of all these ah sturgeon counter suits and decisions and whatnot we're dependent teams on backing up basically the entire Internet on on just two companies trip that that seems like a challenge\nIt it is there are some older versions of the tape but the hardware companies they want the newest version they develop the standard and she put ever more stuff on these tapes so the only ones and they would either have to pay higher prices for one or they would have to use these older tapes that have less direct\nIt's so interesting because you hear people say oh it's up in the cloud all the time right and you think of this ephemeral thing but it's actually really tangible a physical product\nLet's think about it I mean if you have software and there's a bug that introduced into that software that bug will go on and on non\nBut if there's a physical version of it on tape than that bug doesn't touch ape and that's how you can recreate it and and so you know I spoke to a number of people doing the reporting and my story and they were all saying basically this is what keeps the world's running\nWow [noise] she's ... she's the ... a correspondent at a Bloomberg Susan thanks a lot of pressure to Cancun [noise]\n\n\nFrom the American pet products association comes to set up for this next story in two thousand Seventeen we that as Americans spend more than ... sixty nine billion dollars on our pets full disclosure part of that came from me about six billion of uh do give or take\nThe schools are part of that came from me about ... billion of uh do give or take what for services like grooming and training which gets to the point to a series redo called my economy help people's personal economies are doing away from the big economic headlines here Hugo\nMy name's ...
