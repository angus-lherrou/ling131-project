[noise]\n\nFrom the studios at Colorado Public radio in Denver today I'm Amy Scott in for Congress do It's Tuesday October seconds good to have you with us before we get to the Amazon news of the day it's worth going back to last\nMonth and a bill introduced in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders he called it the stop bad employers by zeroing out subsidies act also known as the stop bay those act\nAs an Amazon CEO Jeff ...\nThe bill would tax big companies whose employees rely on federal benefits like food stamps Medicaid or subsidized housing which is reportedly true in some states in the Amazon\nThe idea is to encourage those employers to pay higher wages well Amazon announced today that of November first it's raising its minimum wage for us employees to Fifteen dollars an hour we got Abigail Wozniak on the phone to talk about all this she's a professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame welcome to the program\nThanks for having me trying to understand the impact of this though the minimum wage in Seattle where a lot of Amazon employees live is already more than Fifteen dollars an hour waiting kind of employee do you think this is going to have the biggest impact on\nSo Amazon apparently has argued that a lot of their full time warehouse workers are fulfillment center workers are already making on average over Fifteen dollars an hour or so you're right that they already have quite a large swath of their workforce who would not be affected by that\nThey specifically mentioned part-time temporary workers are they almost certainly will see some changes there those tend to be lower paid position than a full time positions and they should also apply to whole foods cashiers\nAnd average wages for cashiers and general in the whole United States and about ... about ten dollars and sixty cents so for those folks this is likely you a raise but it's very unlikely that this is touching a large set of their core fulfillment center workers Amazon and its\nAnnouncement also said it's going to lobby Congress to raise the federal minimum wage which is just seven twenty five an hour but even without the federal wage increasing that's likely puts pressure on their competitors to do the same right I mean Walmart only recently raised its minimum wage to eleven dollars an hour\nThat's still a quite a bit less than Fifteen does this sort of speed up the the movement in that direction\nReally I think a skilled warehouse worker is already earning more than a cashier I'm so that kind of wanting to keep in mind is that Amazon is not quite in probably exactly the same labor market as\nWalmart is by the same token a lot of other friends are already announcing these types of bigger wage increases so for example targeted side at wanting to get to Fifteen by twenty twenty and Costco right in saying fourteen so I think Amazon is in some ways just keeping pace with that\nThere are lots of places where Amazon has employees that have lower minimum wages for example Texas what kind of impact do you think this will have on communities\nWhere suddenly a lot of people are making more money certainly there are places where this raise we'll have more buying power for the employees who are affected that in general should be a good thing for those local economy and\nIt also does put some more pressure though on firms that might not be at a point where they are ready to pay wages that are quite that high so I think definitely watching for effects on smaller businesses on their ability to recruit interests\nFor effects on smaller businesses on their ability to recruit and retain workers and those kind of local market\nUm would be an important thing to follow up after this announcement we're going to look at how far are Fifteen dollars an hour really go for it at an average worker but what kind of impact do you think that could have on the larger economy Amazon has what two hundred fifty thousand employees plus another\nHundred thousand seasonal workers as you said a lot of them are already making at least Fifteen but if you were of those employees are relying on public assistance they have more money to spend\nI mean do you see a macro effect from not just Amazon but this larger trend\nWhen pay expand for workers we have more in kind of a total wage bill that can cycle back through the economy that's good in general for growth um we also going to want to keep in mind what's happening with inflation\nIf wages go up generally that's great but we have been experiencing some uptick than inflation and want to kind of keep an eye on the real purchasing power of these raises for workers\nAbigail ... teaches economics at Notre Dame thanks so much Thanksgiving\nAt the professor and I were discussing Amazon isn't the only retailer raising wages and more could follow suit\nMeanwhile more cities and states are raising their minimum pay closer to what worker advocates call a living wage so what's it like to live on Fifteen dollars an hour marketplaces Renata Sago talked to some of the people who would know best Alex\n... is twenty two years old and works two part time jobs in Florida he makes sixteen dollars an hour as a community organizer and nine fifty at a fast food chain he he's able to pay its bills and bus fare but Fifteen dollars an hour full time with health benefits would help\nWhat I'll just leave it just for the job which are mouse but actually like fuck you're like forty hours every week or more than it would be a large show much\nSharon within the Peterson is forty two years old and lived in Utah she's made Fifteen dollars in the past working odd jobs and that she was able to manage as a single woman now that she lives with her husband and his raising two kids she relied on renting out rooms in her home and her parents chip and money\nIf we had bought this house when we did we wouldn't be able to survive on five dollars an hour there's no way\nBack in Florida Alexander standards who works at a community center received a raise last month after a few years of making a little over Fifteen dollars an hour the twenty eight year old credits that wage with him being able to pay off its debt\nI actually just paid off last year a car loan\nBut he says he wouldn't have been able to do that if he hadn't been living with three roommate\nSplitting or if I'm if I was on the normal\nWild city like New York Los Angeles and Seattle are mandating Fifteen dollar an hour wages the fight for Fifteen as it's known continues and now Amazon employees across the country will get to see how far the Fifteen dollar wage will take them I'm not if they go for marketplace\nWe have another slice of the Amazon story on line today and explainer on monopoly sunny try saying that five times faster and why the term might relate to Amazon on Wall street retailers paid a price for the promise of higher wages we'll have details when we do the numbers\n\nNAFTA or as

owners of ocean front properties to these tend to be the second homes or vacation homes oftentimes they're very large a pricey mansion right along the beach they're the ones who get most of the benefit from these projects\nWhy is that who decides which beaches to protect in which to leave alone\nThat this is sort of decided on a case by case basis some\nCommunities actually find most of this work themselves to local and county taxes and so in that case the federal government isn't really involved\nBut for many communities it's the Army Corps that decides a which communities get funded and the way the Army Corps Macy's decision they use\nEr an economic formula that ends up favoring more affluent communities and the reason that is is that the corps tries to see which projects can they find where they'll get the most out of every dollar spent so in essence it ends up savoring more affluent communities and\nNot just affluent but predominantly white right yes um so the analysis we did in North Carolina we looked at about sixteen communities that have received funding for these projects and the average uh demographics and other communities but something like Ninety four percent
