all this from the president last night in Erie, Pennsylvania apologies by the way for the background noise [noise]\n... this this morning from a call he made to Fox in front\nOf the Federal Reserve is getting a little bit to a cute that's all that's ridiculous what they're doing\nAnd then finally later this morning\nThis is ridiculous what they're doing\nAnd then finally later this morning from a

in my opinion and I think I Know about is better than they do lately\nSo if your business and economics journalist what do you do with that because the president\nIs just wrong the fed is not crazy or judo or stringent the central bank under both its current and the media in past years has been deliberate and transparent and measured as it sets about getting interest rates back to something near normal after a decade of keeping them at zero\nAlso by the way when I ask you about back in July if it bugs him when the White House poke them in the eye on monetary policy or whether it's going to change what he does he said if you listen between the lines here that\nI had a great a colleague in mentor back in the day who used to bring meetings into focus by saying let's controller control so

mentioned here that this whole thing we've been talking about the past what five six and a half minutes whatever markets tumbling rates rising the fed doing what it's doing the president doing what he is doing it's all anchored all of it in the knock on effects of one economic reality whose name\nIs inflation the fed as we told you would like to see prices rising by about two percent a year we got

it was up a tenth of a percent landing at two point three percent year over year\nInflation is at a moderate level and very close to where actually the Federal Reserve would like to see it\nAnd ... teaches economics at Hamilton College\nI think that it's an endorsement of their current plan to continue to raise interest rates very gradually\nBut numbers are funny you could use those same CPI numbers to make a different argument economist or need to death he at every court ISI sums up the counterpoint\nThe fed has a two percent inflation target these numbers are close to two percent why on earth would be be raising rates\nDid ask you said the fed isn't jak looking at where inflation is now it's looking at where it's headed plus the isn't all that attached to CPI\nThe main piece of data
