that probably three to six months worth of the salary would feel safe\nYeah I I think I personally have the six months of savings so I'm not much worried about that\nDepends on how severe the recession might be [noise]\nI feel like I'm both of our jobs or\nJobs that won't disappear\nThink that we do okay um I Would I Would hope so\nDisappear I think that we do okay um I Would I Would hope so you plan for the worst and hope for the best we have always um built a cushion and always tried to pay down debt\nI feel somewhat prepared because I recognized that my security in my own hands so

majority of Americans\nSay we are in a trade war they're not especially worried about it just ... percent they treated their topic and on a concern but on the theory that nobody knows which way the current us Chinese trade relationship shall we say is going to go what might get more people more worried\nAbout one way things could get nastier is if China started showing off some of the American debt that at all so ... what's the likelihood that might have\nThe U.S government spends more each year than it brings in in revenue and to cover that shortfall it borrows money selling treasury bonds China owns more of these treasuries than any other country\nAbout one point two trillion with a T dollars and this has been a source of anxiety long before the current trade war here's Hillary Clinton
