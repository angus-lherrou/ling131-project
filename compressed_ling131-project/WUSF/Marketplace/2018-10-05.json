thousand Eighteen good is always to have you along everybody yes\nLots of news today we get it but we are going to keep our eye on the economic ball and the ball on this Friday was the September unemployment report it was a good not and thirty four thousand new jobs and you're only fifty year low on the unemployment rate down to three point seven percent\nSo we will start there than merger further whereabouts farther afield I never get them right Jeff and rebel right for the Washington Post Neal Richardson is with Edward Jones everybody\n...\nJobs ... you're on that means we're going to talk about wages uh I I Want to point out that ah the jobs report was actually a little bit of a missile and the number of jobs but but the people should be happy with the wages however are another thing entirely still and again\nYou know what it really didn't matter what the job's number was going to be a market for that right at rages wages were the focal point\nAnd what we saw is that there was some sustained growth in wages as a little bit lower than than last month that but some growth that two point eight percent it was enough grounds to spark some concern in the market\nThat this spillover to consumer and prices and and and prompt inflation and cause the fed to tightened more aggressively than previously anticipated so even that small pickup and grow up with enough\nUh too concerned the markets about inflation and rising rate and we saw that play out in the stock market\nDoesn't let me let me pivot a little bit uh to uh well I guess a lot to trade and ah the president and where we stand it is somehow amazing to me that it was only five days ago\nThat we reached agreement or on the new NAFTA or China is still out there uh we have a still a president who's not enamored with a multilateral institutions yet we have a dynamic and strong and a growing economy in the United states where do we stand on on on how things might play off\nI think it's pretty striking that we've basically spent the last year and a half alienating our friend punishing farmers they manufacturers with tariffs and counter terrorists and breaking apart the hard won alliance that we had built um [laughter]\nTo try to isolate China and we ended up in more or less the same position that we were in before which is NAFTA is still more or less in place\nA plus elements of of the Trans Pacific partnership which Trump had broken up or had had pulled us out um last year\nSo you know I I think the best thing you can say about this deal is that it could have been a lot worse and markets clearly a breathed a sigh of relief\nThat the existing structure I is kind of skill there that that Trump did not break globalization despite his rhetoric [laughter] the jets thing that he had hoped to do so\nThat that's a good one the debris globalization Neal put on your your actual certified economists that which I should point out you are a ... and a poet back for me to a you know thirty five thousand foot level and talk about what Catherine was talking about this idea that\nWe are now distinctly trying to go it alone in this global economy uh with um a politics you're being um tenuous at best in terms of being able to get things done\nAnd where things play out now for the remaining two years of the president's term and perhaps for\nIt's a bumpy road ahead um what the negotiation process taught us that even something that should have been a sure thing which is to continue on with NAFTA which is essentially what happened took a long way longer with much more drama than probably that's\nAnd took a long way longer with much more drama than probably necessary and that's with the north American trade agreement right now let's look at something much more complicated that really speaks to the future of China and the development of the emerging world\nUm where we are in a negotiation in which we do have some solid um reasons for pushing forward\nBut a China also has some solid reasons for pushing back and so as much as markets shared the continuation of nasty or some kind of knew named as roads that smells a sweet [laughter] um\nIt's hard to translate a a throw when\nIn North America with a long process with the rest of the world where China is an emerging leader and has a growing power and trends of their economic strength and the supply chains in which they are they set right in the middle of\nYou to have some great launched a slow when that's a great line I'm okay look let me let me turn to the news today 'cause we have to acknowledge it Susan Collins declaring that she is in fact senator from Maine to choose in fact you to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh\nUh Joe Manchin doing the same thing he will likely be on the Supreme Court ah come you know Monday or Tuesday I Want to talk for a second Catherine about uh how broken the politics are on Washington in Washington and what that will mean for anybody economic agenda because there are things that have to get done right there are budget to have to get on there are\nSocial programs and and a four and bills and all that stuff still has to be done thirty seconds to you and then to Mueller where does things where the sense that\nI I think the status quo is very troubling it's not only the regular the regularly scheduled types of tasks that you mentioned like getting budget through for example that Congress has to manage our and and the presidency is well the executive branch as well\nUh at some point there will be a crisis and the fact that we had so much political dysfunction suggests that we're in store for a lot of policy dysfunction in when I have talked with people who are around\nFor the last crisis at ten years ago that that's the number one thing that they said that they that keeps them up at night that basically what's going to happen when we actually need everyone to work together and come to policy conclusion that may not be a popular one knew what you quickly was sure\nAnd I just want to add on to like cats and I think just said which was you know this is occurring the ... the political dysfunction if you want to call it that it's occurring at a time when we have really strong economic health\nAre a lot of wealth being created in the economy and investors are are benefiting where things can wage growth\nUh what happens when the economy naturally turns as part of a natural business cycle well that's when the government played the wrong and what we need at that point as a government that functions together for the betterment of the economy and hopefully by then we'll get it\nNeal Richardson at the we're Jones dressing room filled the Washington Post thanks you too\nThank you I have a nice weekend one more quick thing about the state of
