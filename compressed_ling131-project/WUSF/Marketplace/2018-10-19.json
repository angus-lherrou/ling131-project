Hi I'm Jennifer pack for\n\nFor the complicated couple of years for Facebook in this economy also for mainstream media both are being criticized by politicians some politicians anyway and by the public to some degree as well\nBut journalism and Facebook have a weird symbiotic relationship to publishers need Facebook to get their content out food for me to the content to users and according falling Newsweek should some new light on a key part of that relationship the part of that has come to be called the pivot to video Microsoft wrote about it for Vanity Fair walk in the program\nThanks for having me so back a couple of years ago April two thousand sixty ... says we are pivoting video at Facebook\nAnd journalism to does what journalism is what that basically and they say listen we have to be in this space we're going to hire a bunch of video producers and and yet now we learned through this law suits but maybe it didn't work out so well\nSo I mean I think for publishers of some kind of a second costs policy they've already invested a lot of resources and Facebook are these events but kind of eating Internet traffic\nSo Facebook does represent a video\nIt's kind of like a thing where faith ... jumping publisher I say OK how high man today invest all these resources into doing video and then in twenty six year twenty Seventeen you kind of saw these layoffs where entire editorial teams were being restructured to eliminate writer even higher video producer is so that happened to places like ah\nMTV News and having to block it airs Mike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nIt airs Mike dot com mashable you name it probably happened there\nOr so we'll get to the to the layoffs thing in a minute but a ... the regional germane is that very quickly after this started Facebook said we were ... video fingers aren't as impressive as we thought and now we've learned from his lawsuit this week not only were they from President then thought they were just flat wrong by a lot\nYeah you you have a small group of advertisers with this last e basically saying that Facebook inflated the number is by in some cases allegedly up nine hundred percent so entirely different story than what we thought we were seeing with many of your town [noise]\nPart of the problem here it seems to me is that nobody's chicken Facebook's a mess as it were they keep their own numbers they tell us what was going on and and the media and journalism react as opposed to having some objective measure of whether or not these things are working these videos\nSure I mean I think that everybody there's a lot of blame to go around here right obviously Facebook is to blame but also um advertisers and publishers maybe arguing their own homework and art keeping tabs on the number is that's going to be if they should have been a seems like publishers were a little bit casual as they were definitely desperate for new revenue stream\nAnd ah yeah they're they're definitely wasn't any checking going on here in terms of numbers\nShow even besides the numbers though one has to point out that that publishers as you sort of mentioned they jumped right in here and they made those transitions in the news room people were laid off organizations were changed and or I'm Sorry to use this word of pivoted um because of what Facebook job to do\nYeah I mean again it was kind of a case where obviously media in dire straits and publishers are looking for new revenue sources and they see this video thing Facebook is doing and they think that that could be at\nAnd and they kind of just jumped into both eat what does Facebook have to say first of all I Know a lot it is obviously refuting the fried claims in the lawsuit right now\nIt did um I mean obviously it took some accountability and twenty six to ... when these discrepancies kind of first ah emerge publicly but I mean Facebook it it's kind of maintaining that and it didn't do anything wrong\nAnd we should say this matters opening in court and then everybody's going to have the absolutely Microsoft jak writer at the miners are thinking of [noise]\n\n\nFollowed on the way out today and which I Am sorry to be
