an update from the state emergency operations center on hurricane Michael\nJust in terms of business news and numbers stocks plunged to their worst loss and eight months tech stocks were the big losers today looks like we are now connected to the emergency network or let's go over\n[noise]\nAll right we're waiting down there\n\nAll right we're waiting that they are clearly we are connected we can hear them I get setting the stage of the Florida public radio emergency network um in the meantime I Will continue to tell you about the business news of numbers there was a worse loss for stocks in eight months\nA tech companies continue to drop the Dow lost over eight hundred points in fact a dropped eight hundred and thirty one points about three percent\nA isn't pay five hundred sank about Ninety four point says about three point three percent in terms of percentages the NASDAQ was the biggest loser or losing four point one percent tumbling about three hundred sixteen points\nAnd we will or rejoined marketplace in progress whenever Governor Scott is finished a addressing off a on the emergency\nReasons why this was happening chief probably among them to quickly rising yield that his interest rates in the bond market that we have been telling you about the last ten days or so and concurrent Marines about inflation all of the above I have to say again\nOur normal but admittedly off putting when interest rates have been so low for so long and markets have mostly gone up\nWhat is it interesting though is that what's been going on in this economy is financial markets is affecting the rest of the world case in point treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin and the Chinese currency today and an interview this morning\nWe're more in Beijing against what he called competitive devaluation of the UN that's Chinese currency that is trying to trying to get a global trade edge by making its currency and therefore goods cheaper for others to buy\nThink trade war and terrorists here and we should point out that the UN is about ten percent cheaper today than it was last spring but his marketplaces Tracey Samuelson reports that might have more to do with what's going on here than what the Chinese are doing\nThe wind has been losing value against the dollar but you know what it's had lots of friends on that during\nThe dollar as strong as the euro and the then the Canadian dollar in Norway Sweden and\nAlmost all the courage to the world\nAre Chandler it's a chief market strategist at Banneker on global for X.\nI don't think I Need to separate like explanatory framework to claim China\nYes China's economy isn't growing as fast as it once was and\nThere is concern about to have you got started they have to take it out by local government could bank lots of bad loans\nSo that is definitely a part of the bonds depreciation but mostly\nEveryone wants at all or\nSteve hanky at Johns Hopkins university says if anything the Chinese have tried to keep the value of the one from falling further they're not working to make it cheaper\nThey haven't done anything any differently than they've been doing for on on\nThe dollar is like this glowing orbit drawing people in thanks to a strong US Economy and rising interest rates that are attempting investors with higher returns but as far as it does have this effect that the Trump Administration doesn't love you swap presided as a trade policy professor at Cornell\nFell off the tightest mission is that the Trump Administration has flipped on imports from China now are much less Fulton in other words I been persons that if on Chinese imports doesn't amount to much if the Chinese currency dishes by almost an identical alone\nOr sat thinks mission was trying to warn China not to get any ideas about using its currency as a weapon and the country's ongoing trade war Chinese officials said yesterday they have no intention of devaluing their currency I'm Tracey Samuelson for marketplace\nThe treasury structure and the foreign exchange markets and terrorists and the trade war get all the headlines there is another way the United states interact with the global economy that's at least as significant it and it fits\nUnder the general heading of regulatory review the White House it this morning and this has bipartisan backing in Congress that should be said but the White House announced that the committee on foreign investment in the United states if it's as it's called\nAnnounced that the committee on foreign investment in the United states if it's as it's called is going to start taking it much closer look Michael made landfall near Mexico beach in Bay counting as a monsters category for storm with winds of one hundred and fifty five miles per hour [noise]\nFun to landfall her question that President Donald Trump issued a major disaster declaration to allow federal resources to flow quickly and should the impact of communities\nI spoke with the president earlier today and he has committed to make every federal resources available to help the recovery hurricane Michael is the worst storm that the Florida Panhandle has ever seen and one of the worst power storms\nTo ever make landfall in the United states we heard of significant impacts that tend to air force base in many communities along the coast\nAs hurricane Michael contingents destructive path through the panhandle and leaves are states\nWhere it's hurting one hundred percent are focused on search and rescue and recovery\nBut we need every family to help with this listen to local officials we could still have flash flooding and tornados\nWe heard of too devastating tornadoes in Gadsden county the weather is still extremely dangerous to not take a risk be safe we also need people to be very safe with generators\nDo not put a running generator in your home is not safe to knock it out on the roads until you're told the safe [noise] we need the roads to be open for first responders and search and rescue to do their jobs and save lives is not safe to leave your house don't leave it\nIf you and your family made it through the storm safely the worst thing you can do now is the act foolishly and put yourself in your family in danger or keep law enforcement and rescue workers from saving lives\nOur law enforcement and first responders or heroes and leaving their families to help others we cannot thank them enough\nAs I said earlier today and we are deploying a massive wave a response will\nBe sending help from air land and the the includes thousands have responders for power restoration medical search and rescue law enforcement food and water distribution and every other critical resource\nI was briefed by the U.S coast guard today and they are pre positions and tap and

and watch the storm closely through the night\nThe entire nation and world have watched it this monster storm as devastated our Gulf Coast and pan handle\nThe love and support we received from so many has been overwhelming and we're greatly appreciate appreciative of all the resources and prayers that had been offered on behalf of the Gulf Coast and the great state of Florida I Want to thank the

digital and physical album sales as well as streaming numbers hip hop and R and be replaced rock as this country's most popular music genres\nBut as often happens there is a twist because what Nielsen didn't consider how much money people spend on concerts and when it comes to live shows rock and roll is still the king rock concerts accounted for more than half of the five billion dollars generated by last year's highest grossing live tours you'll show wrote about rock and revenue for\nWall Street journal walk with a program thanks for having me when was the last time you were in Iraq I was\nA properly pretty recently I went to a show at the Warsaw to see a band called all ways\nAlong with snail mail and hatching okay so it was surprise nobody was made his program that I don't know any of those bands but but but it gets to the point of um uh that's where the money is really right hip hop and R B have been dominant culturally for many years now\nCommercially speaking rap is really taking over the industry over the last couple of years so there tends to be this huge focus rightly so on rap and it's important to right now but the thing is\nA huge part of the music industry it's the other side of the industry not just the recorded music side but to live side and something that's kind of been\nKind of obscured lately is how significant rock still is for live music is just because rock and roll has been around so much longer than than rap and hip hop and all the rest there are several reasons rock also crosses generations in a way that rap southern at a rock concert you could have\nAcross the generations in a way that rap doesn't at a rock concert you could have a younger a millennial agenda the music fan who's curious about a particular act and then of course you're gonna get twenty somethings thirty something's forty somethings fifty something\nBut it's it's more complicated than that guns and roses and older act on the eighth and ninth us guns ... roses is playing stadiums and it's playing arenas public enemy and W. way also from the eighties there\nAre not so one one significant things some of the classic legacy pioneering rap acts aren't playing big venues\nAre a lot of questions actually come out of that the first ... I'm going to a live show is is a disposable income kind of thing right do rock and roll show fans tend to have more disposable income than the folks who would go to sue you say and the way\nIt is the case that the younger fans of hip hop have less dispose brash so what happens is the economics for an act like juice world who's on top of their charts with this song lucid dreams right now are different ... if you had this lengthy sprawling George eating\nA second tier dirtier a cities across the U.S it's not going to work because there aren't enough people to come to that show where am I may be a rock jak who has older fans with more cash in their pocket\nCan make the economics work um [noise] so let's go back even partner that eventually Mick Jagger is going to die for a ... and eventually rock and roll fans now were fifty and sixty and remembering in front of us are going to stop going is that going to change the dynamic\nMany people I've talked to be like this is an elephant in the room for the live music industry and\nUm once the Rolling Stones Nepal McCarthy's go it is a question ... acts replace the older act and can newer acts in their old age\nGender ... the kind of money that they don't you remember the Rolling Stones back in the seventies they didn't make that much money from albums and even lived they make more money now\nThan than they ever did back in the day too with the question is is that a historical anomaly chai tighter rock in the twentieth century\nOr not and one way that the industry is shifting its place in a little bit more focused on festivals and on smaller\nRadios right and and then you roll all of that in with streaming and subscription downloads and other ways that people can get it besides a live event right and it all changes right\nNear shot the wall Street Journal ... excellent excellent\n[noise]\n\nWas\nFollowed on the way out today in which the future of health care is revealed or\nWell okay that's not entirely true but it's a hint anyway this morning the department of justice gave a preliminary go ahead to CBS arm of the Jane by me insurance giant Aetna for a tidy sixty nine billion dollars American money to turn out to be a big deal and help people get their health care actually imagine a pharmacy for a second not just at a place you go to get to page\nBut with an in health clinic perhaps some kinds of routine treatments as well it's a pharmacy benefit company owning an insurance company\n[noise]\nMarketplace it's supported by hacker one helping organizations reduced risk of a cyber security incident high partnering with trusted hackers to find them take software mom abilities before criminals can exploit them\nTo find him fixed software bomber abilities before criminals can exploit them more and hacker one dot com and\nBy foreign X. dot com for X. dot com is committed to empowering and helping traders seize opportunities in the foreign exchange market learn more and foreign X. dot com for X. dot com it's your World Trade it for X training involves significant risk of law [noise]\nAnti intercom a business messaging platform who's chat box automate manual sales and marketing Taft high qualifying leads and scheduling demos learned more in an intercom dot com\nOr we are on our way to do do throws up eight hundred and thirty one for the three and a jumps in bed that down three Fifteen that is for presented as five hundred dollar Ninety four points three entered transfer said there remember\nCPR consumer price index tomorrow inflation inflation at the consumer ...
