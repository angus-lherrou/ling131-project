China and other countries\nNow those thanks to the Trump administration's focus on Beijing is taxing fully half of everything we buy from China all of that has led to retaliate George hours from China and other countries on our exports agriculture mostly\nThe whole thing happened so fast might reasonably conclude we could get out of it just as fast\nBut as marketplaces go wrong report game theory suggests otherwise\nGame theory is the way scientists and mathematicians think about human behavior in interaction which would I Do based on what you do should I trust you and what do I do if you break that trust before this trade war the U.S and China had some trust both were members of a free trade club known as the world Trade Organization\nSome trust both were members of a free trade club

meanwhile broke trust by taxing Chinese imports this year\nUnder the WTO will the United states is not allowed to unilaterally just ratchet up the tariffs on China\nGame theory suggests a couple of things one is it's hard to establish trust when it's broken into a trade war is actually a rational thing for countries to do it in their self interest here's how\nNYU business process I ruined sooner

theory does allow for things to get shaken up but it takes something dramatic to disrupt things stay political change\nCould be the election of a new president in the United states now that unfortunately have to be coupled with the aid that Milo willingness to negotiate on China the buck\nOr outside parties say other countries of the WTO could bring the U.S and China together and create space for trust his Jennifer Hillman at Georgetown Law they could say listen here's a new trade agreement that takes away tariffs provides new customers for your exports and outside third parties will
