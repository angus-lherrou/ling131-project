tax estimates that if voters overturned it by approving ... the state will have four to five billion dollars less to spend on road repairs every year and that gap is likely to grow because of the rise

the new gas tax is already on his way to making life better for California drivers\nSo we'd rooms with the training rooms right of course are over there the beautiful weight rooms and drove so this is the big boom you're supposed to start asking\nDrove so the big boom you're supposed to start asking questions but I'm going to cause it's like this is the heart of the players right where the rubber meets the road um [noise] so what keeps you up and I just want your worst [laughter]\nMy ... my the thing that keeps me up right now is that the the greatest player in the NBA LeBron James decided to come join us and and be part of what we're building and we've missed the class every year for five years\nSo this is not what the brand was meant to be and that's what what\nAre fan deserve to be back to what they're used to in in terms of Lakers basketball having the best player has brought us back it's it's it's elevated the brand now we just need\nTo do that I don't necessarily expect you to answer this question but it kind of have to ask her view a little brown and will quote near Trojan an Magic Johnson drugs for basketball and you know ... and the other best for grudge if you guys have the conversation on yourself about work this season what kind of be rebuilding\nUm yeah you know yes I mean magic has definitely has a plan as to what we're doing you know when when magic came in and took over basketball operation\nWhat I felt was and why I had to make the change from our existing general manager and my brother Jim who oversaw basketball was that there was no identity of Laker basketball\nThey're really interesting 'cause liquor basketball like a brand name\nExactly and and you can't establish anything when you're changing coaches every eight months we've had three coaches and three years\nYou know and each one a great coach in themselves but you can't change your roster overnight and so the ... everything with not matched up right and we were struggling with no identity\nSo this goes to something which are more complex all the time you were in uncertainty and and not only does regular business suit on through to sort through those sports business in sports teams and the woman running loose sports team right on through he was going\nIt was killing the brand and it was you know when my father passed away than commissioner David Stern called me and he said\nJeannie don't let the team fail like don't let go don't rush into the ground losing the oh yeah when we looked like\nIt it would you break your dad's heart and so you know and it was difficult because I wasn't in charge of basketball my brother ... and I ask him how long is it going to take you to get the team on track and he gave himself a timeline which\nAs time went on I realized that wasn't going to happen and that's why I had to make the change that I did but I you know I took that to heart and I wouldn't I wouldn't let that you know my dad had six kids and I think the Lakers were his favorite chair [laughter] people ask me\nAbout your family right I mean Dr closer to your brother who worked with and then and then had to replace\nYou talk a lot of talked about it in your book you've talked about it interviews about others as a family business show those first couple of years when the commercial read culture and says don't blow it with the family business and then you have to file your brother what's that was\nWas very very difficult um you know my dad kind of set it up for us but ultimately he gave me the authority and the power\nTo make any changes that I saw a necessary one of the key components of that decision making process was a conversation I had with Kobe Bryant\nDecision making process with the conversation I had with Kobe Bryant he said what a player\nAn all star player who's you know a free agent is going to look at an organization and how it operates and making sure that there's somebody in charge who has authority to accomplish what the goals are\nMeaning you've got you've got to get the organization in the right position before anybody will consider investing his career in what you're doing right now nobody knows what you guys stand for sort of becomes a\nPoke in your question about about making the change from prior management and your brother you started ... number of years to ...\nThat was my first comment publicly was I Apologize to Laker fans because of perhaps I did wait too long um as you can hear them you'd rather Darlene ... it's it's funny because\nWe actually have a DJ now on staff you know because yeah it's like these young players they they're more high tacking there used to having music while they're doing whatever let me show\nYou into and then we get older [noise] the good you know your way around or
