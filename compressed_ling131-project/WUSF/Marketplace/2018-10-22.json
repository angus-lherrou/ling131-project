foreign goods even more appealing Matthew Goodman is with the center for Strategic and International Studies\nThere is a close relationship between currency and trade policies\nThing is that China isn't currently devaluing its currency for competitive advantage\nThey don't you know clearly meet the test of manipulation at the moment\nAnd anyway the label just doesn't pack that much punch ... at the University of Maryland\nIs kind of a strange tool because if we deemed China to be a currency manipulator the result of that is and we have to have talks with China about it but of course we're talking with them already\nThen there's the politics ... with the American Enterprise Institute\nRhyme or the president said he would call trying to crunch him and I put on day one we've now gone

figures five billion dollars from all sources\nIs going to wind up being spent on the two thousand Eighteen congressional elections a lot of it coming from um shall we say the upper end of the income distribution marketplace adjusting how has that one\nOne of the reasons there's so much money flowing into these midterm elections is because billionaires alleging more of their cash on politicians\nThey put something that's sort of a rose out over in Norman sports is being made\nOr the last few decades\nThat standard political scientist Adam Monica\nHe found that the total wealth and the four ... four hundred jumped eleven to fold since Nineteen eighty two and the amount will be people spend on politics has gone up in proportion historically he says it's\nPretty clear that

after giving Donald Trump twenty five million for his election he doesn't watch from the front row as the president celebrated the opening of an embassy in Jerusalem\nThis year old son and his wife and pony up eighty seven million dollars to conservative groups and candidates but lately but like I said many billionaires are leaning another way\nIn over time it's been trending pretty clearly towards more money going to the Democrat\nConservative candidates have earned more billionaire donations the data from the center for Responsive Politics show Democrats are catching up\nBy says that's because a lot of newer billionaires come from more liberal places like Silicon Valley Dustin Moskowitz the billionaire cofounder of Facebook gave over five million to groups like move on dot org and a group dedicated to winning Senate races others say the polarized political climate over the last two years his let more people in general to contribute\nTo feel this is an emotional need for people to

his controversial ad campaign to impeach the president which hasn't been uniformly popular with Democrats\nAnd Republican Congress ones competing with reporters at today's tires\nPolitical groups are

hundred million to help like Democrats that could prove useful as Bloomberg eyes a democratic presidential bed and twenty twenty contributions like Bloomberg is a pretty easy to track but then there's what's known as dark money\nEver seen the spending side that we don't necessarily know who would actually behind it and a lot of the cases\n... research is dark money at the center for Responsive Politics a huge chunk of the spending goes to advertising and depending on what the ads say she says their funders don't always have to be disclosed\nThat makes it hard to tell whether it's a billionaire spending or a corporation or anyone else\nShe said Democrats are collecting more dark money from donors in recent years perhaps to avoid the stigma associated with big money in politics but she says high profile billionaires tend to operate in the open\nAs they get more name I can understand that at least get more disclosure whether that be I think that a puddle or their reaction to that being that they do start to play the thing is that why\nAfter all it doesn't hurt if the politicians you helped elect know that you back during the campaign in New York I'm Joe how\nSmart
