that we've got congressional reporter Kelsey Snell White House reporter Ayesha Rascoe and political reporter Tim Mak\nEverybody hey there right so it's pretty clear by the limits of margins Brett Kavanaugh is headed to the Supreme Court Kelsey walk us through when that became crystal clear on friday\nIt became crystal clear within a matter of minutes when Susan Collins the Republican senator from Maine announced on the Senate floor after more than forty minutes of talking\nThat she was going to be supporting Canada and then just a few minutes later Joe mentioned the Democrat from West Virginia announced that he would also be supporting cabinet and that brought it to very clearly locked in ...\nAnd we're going to circle back to ... in a moment but fifty one forty nine is how that key cloture vote had played out earlier friday or at the time we thought there was still a chance that people could change their mind but but ... was that really a clear moment where it was like okay this looks like it's probably going to happen\nIt did look that way there was a ... a few moments where we were chasing around senators or Tim and I were standing in different hallways different parts of the capital trying to find people like Senator Jeff Flake a Republican of Arizona and counting we mentioned in mansion\nTo see if they were going to stick with their votes um flake with a little bit cryptic we didn't really know what was going to happen and then ... and had lunch with Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell and he came out saying that he felt pretty good about things\nAnd from there it seems like we're heading in a direction where the fifty one vote for going to quickly come into place\nTim friday was a really tense day on Capitol Hill\nIt's been a really tense week on Capitol Hill scenes Jeff Flake negotiated this the way this one we the way in which the FBI would we open investigation into Brett Kavanaugh's background\nThere's been a lot of questions about who could eventually get to a yes on ... we found the answer on friday but the fact is that there's been a lot of uncertainty and a lot of\n[noise]\nEvery week we focused on one race in the country that speaks to a larger theme playing out in races all across the country and this week we're looking at the Florida Senate ran off my ... with us as well as Dominican mount ... and Dominican so\nWalk us through what race we're talking about so we're looking at the Florida Senate race here where Democrat Bill Nelson who's a three term democratic senator and former representative you've been there a long time and he's trying to hang onto his seat he's running against Rick Scott who's term limited as governor and serve two terms in Florida\n... what have you been seeing in terms of both poles and and what you saw reporting there this week\nInto the race is really tight I think it's largely because of the opponent that Bill Nelson the singing and Rick Scott\nAnd I had multiple Democrats tell me\nYou know look I don't like Rick Scott I'm not going to vote for him but this is the guy is running a masterful campaign in terms of just being visible and specifically being very attentive early on in the Latino community I met a woman carried yes wise I actually had met her before during the twenty sixteen campaign she adamantly doesn't like Trump\nHe told me hell no she's not voting for the Republican candidate for governor\nBut you know she she sort of has had this little bit of an evolution on Rick Scott here's what she told me about him initially\nLet me be very honest with you at any rate cuts in the beginning and his government for the election\nSo she did not like him she says that she just didn't think that he was necessarily going to be good for the state based and everything that she had heard she refers to herself as a Democrat but she's had a change in major part she said because she's Puerto Rican and she's seen how many times he has gone down to visit Puerto Rico after the hurricane\n... he shows me he's working from ... to his show me what he'd do\nAn awesome what can you step back and remind us how critical the Puerto Rican vote is in Florida\nYet still an active it's will tell me there are over a million Puerto Rican voters in Florida now\nAnd the population has really grown and in part it's actually grill and wild bill Nelson has been a member of Congress and to some folks within the Democratic party who have been a little bit critical of Bill Nelson visibility within this community have said hey look maybe he doesn't fully understand the magnitude\nOf this community power within the electorate\nYou know when you talk about the Puerto Rican community Rick Scott\nYou know she broke very quickly a right away with President Trump after Hurricane Maria and after President Trump said that the numbers that came out about how many people died in Puerto Rico we're wrong and he said that he stood with the people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times so this is a close\nThe people of Puerto Rico and like you noted has been there a number of times so this is a close race Nelson and Scott held their first head to head debate this week off me you were there what did you see\nYeah and and the debate I should point out was being hosted by the local Telemundo station in the broadcast in Spanish which you know to what we've been things sort of speaks to the significance of the Latino electorate there there were a couple of major issues that came up\nHealth care came up time and time again and we've seen this you know in in states across the country Bill Nelson really hit ... Scott specifically on the fact that while being governor he did not expand Medicaid and that that has actually affected a number of celebrity and\nThe other issue that came up a lot was immigration and bill now saying basically a cue did ... his hard line on immigration you know on the other side Rick Scott is saying that the bill nothing really just wants to have open borders\n... one of the big themes of of race of the week is that these races aren't happening in a vacuum the similar trend they're similar voters throughout the country that is really the case here in Florida as well because this was not the only statewide race and and we've seen that that other races are having an impact\nOn the Senate race absolutely in fact I had one Republican operative tell me that one of the big reasons why you're seeing Nelson suddenly very narrowly lead in the polls\nOr you'd lead in the last four polls for example very very narrowly and within the margin of Arab but that's a shift\nThe reason for that they said of the energy in the governor's race being on the side of Democrat Andrew Gillum he said that if this is an election about energy that's where the energy is and it was killing at the top of the ticket they said that's something that could carry Nelson over the finish line\nAll right and and since it's Florida I think we can be pretty confident her probably stay a narrow race between now and election day this is one of the most fifty fifty a fifty fifty states across the country or a Dominican mountain are Oh thanks so much You're welcome and alcohol thank you thank you this is the politics show from NPR we'll be right back\nThis is your NPR station W.

much forced to do that even if one of the ... we're just\nWe're here with a special broadcast and through the mid term election so\nFar this year there's been a lot of talk about it being the year of the woman mud in the wake of the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight a lot of Republicans and suddenly talking about a backlash to all of them the blood drenched jihad\nOr George Bush innocent man there's good and decent man we're finding now that the the the viewer a white male it's okay to be a good word got out your ... garbage and paid for them in the polls show male voters are suddenly\nEnergize because I think it could easily as well turn out to me the ear of the man who feel like a targeted on their back all the time and it's not fair\nAnd it may have a lot to do with calls from President Trump saying the real victim of the me too movement is innocent men\nA person was never met [noise] should that are just things that\nWill horrible and they're firing me from my job mom I don't know what to do [noise] mom what do I do what do I do mom\nIs this backlash real and what does it mean for the four hundred and thirty five house seats and thirty five Senate seats up for grabs in the next few weeks we've got White House correspondent Tamara Keith political correspondent Asma Khalid\nAnd political editor Domenico Montanaro here to sort this all out hey everybody hey hey there how's it going to ... we saw a shift in all of this over the last few weeks especially when it came to how President Trump talked about this you saw President Trump act very timid lead toward\nChristine Blasey Ford in part because the White House wasn't sure how this was going to play politically\nOr certainly she was a very credible witness well\nGuess what that change in fact our NPR NewsHour Marist Poll that came out this week found a twelve point uptick enthusiasm\nAmong Republicans those Republicans who are saying that the that this election it was very important when we pulled them back in July it was sixty eight percent now that eighty percent and it's largely driven by Republican men yeah what stood out to me in in that poll was\nIn what's called the generic ballot so who are you more what party are you more likely to vote for in the mid term\nYeah there was a six point jump among men\nNow there were more likely to vote for Republican than for a Democrat just in the past week yes they are ... in the past week and that is absolutely had everything to do with the Kavanaugh hearings yeah there's a certain amount of backlash that has taken place you know they're\nSo much focus so much of our focus and everyone's focus following the hearing with on how women reacted um especially women on the left and there were women coming forward telling their stories that were women volunteering for campaigns and they there was a big surge in campaign donations\nBut there was something else happening two men were ain't\nTan we just heard all of those uh clips of President Trump over the last few days you just did a story on this this isn't a new thing from President Trump\nNo ... not only is it not a new thing from President Trump is not a new thing in American culture and politics so President Trump really ran on some of this grievance and and some of this\nFear among people are particularly among white Republican men that the culture has shifted beneath them that you know that\nThey're being left behind that they're being left behind so President Trump and his campaign talked about the forgotten man he talked a lot about political correctness run amok and I I was talking to Frank Luntz who's a Republican pollster um and he was saying that President Trump tapped into something\n\nThis is politics shell from NPR I'm Scott Detrow it feels like every week there's always one major story that dominates the news so each week we take a few minutes to talk about some of the stories you\nMight've missed him to do that we always have Ron Elving Iran to be with you it's got to some of the things we're gonna talk about what had been big deals and other weeks but this week just no room for anything but Brett Kavanaugh so let's start with this in the middle of all of this partisanship and toxicity in the capital they actually got a lot done that right the Congress passed an authorization\nBill for the Federal Aviation administration for the first time since twenty twelve it's got a lot of money in it to run that agency and all the functions but we'll concerned consumers most is the focus on passenger complaints for example cramped seats the width of the seats and the leg room\nFAA now has a Tour de to set a minimum coverage is giving you a bigger seats in Congress has not yet given you a bigger seat neither has the FAA but they now have the authority and the direction the policy direction from Congress\nTo do that also uh to ban cell phone talking in flight on all flights you might have thought it was but there are some airlines that allow it and ditto for each cigarette you might not have thought they were allowed but they hadn't been covered previously in terms of the ban on smoking\nAll right and another big thing that happened this week one one of the topics that have just dominated the Congress has bipartisan concern about the opioid epidemic and how to deal with it that that got done to this week\nPerhaps the main thrust of the bill Scott has renewed effort to stop the shipping of synthetic opioids things like ... there were twenty thousand deaths\nThe shipping of synthetic opioids things like ... there were twenty thousand deaths from a ... a related overdoses I'd just a couple of years ago and to prevent the introduction offend would really be a big big difference of the post office has new authority the government's going to really make this a priority\nThey're also going to lengthen the support period for Medicaid patients Hoge ability for treatment and they'll broaden eligibility for all substance abuse for those treatment programs\nAnd also there's going to be more money more emphasis on research to find a non addictive painkiller okay\nShifting gears this week the state department announced a new policy starting this month diplomats who wants to bring their same sex partners to the U.S\nWill have to be married that's right they'll have to be legally married to qualify for that second base that that's a change in policy that had been in place since two thousand nine because you see a same sex marriage is legal in less than ten percent of the countries that send them ... and diplomats to the United nations\nSo those people the people who work for the United nations are going to account for roughly half a couple of the state department estimates will be affected\nSo the state department says this is about treating everybody the same if you're a heterosexual couple right now you can't get a visa for the second person without being married so this is intended to level the playing field of course the differences\nYou can get a heterosexual marriage and just about any country in the world but in fewer than ten percent of the United nations countries is that possible so is there a plan\nFor for people who live in a country without same sex marriage or can you just not bring your partner they're going to be exemptions for certain kinds of diplomatic personnel but that would not appear to apply to most of the United nations personnel so that's where it's really going to be felt that\nNPR's Ron Elving catching up on some of the news we

air every weekend with a special broadcast through the mid term elections and every week we dig deep into an issue that galvanizing voter babies ripped out of their mother literally ran out of there are [noise]\nIt's weak immigration bringing drugs [noise]\nThey're bringing crime there right\nThis President Trump launched his campaign with a controversial hard line stance on immigration and voters latched on to\nRemember I made that speech was badly criticize oh what's so terrible what he said turned out I was a hundred percent right that's why I got elected [noise]\nCarry that immigration\nTalk into his presidency and turned it into policy President Trump\nMoments ago side of executive order this will affect the separation of parents from their children at the major backlash tonight against President Trump's travel ban the president's message just fear got Republicans out to vote but it's his policies as president that may turn Democrats how I\nBeating heart of this election is border security we have to\nTo dig into all of this my co host ... sat down with NPR's John Burnett and Mara Liasson John covers immigration debate in Texas ... one of our national political correspondent\nHello to you both either high [noise]\nPresident Trump began his administration with somebody just kind of get pretty mean spirited policy of the travel ban it was one of the first things he did in office and even more recently the summer there with his and he should have a family separation this was a huge low point for the Trump Administration\nIn part because they had to roll back a policy that they said was not a policy and many people were incredibly upset even people within his own party he\nHas a summary of where the policy itself stand at this point\nYes there are still several hundred kids that are in us custody and new shelters around the country and health and Human Services which is responsible for ...\nFor finding a foster homes for them and sponsors has said it's taking us a long time we have to do all these criminal background checks we'd have to fingerprint everybody in the household not just the family member who wants to take the child back but the larger question of what you did this achieve its\nGoals the goal was to act as a deterrent\nI'm really to shock potential image but it's not coming to the U.S and I had an interview with the chief of staff John Kelly\nA last may and he said that explicitly to me\nA big name of the game is deterrence if if their family separation stands as a pretty tough deterrent would be a tough deterrent a would be a tough deterrent um a a much faster turnaround on asylum even though\nPeople say that's cruel and heartless to take a mother away from our children\nI think a cruel and heartless or I wouldn't put it quite that way the children will be taking care of\nAnd so obviously the numbers that are referred to earlier about the jump in the family unit and unaccompanied kids crossing the border over the summer of shows that it didn't have a deterrent effect\nStill my sense of how this me at all affect the mid term you know the makeup of Congress because this issue again it's one that I Would argue and an out talking to voters and his somewhat again faded from the consciousness\nIf the debate is about border security Republicans win in other words if you're talking about abolishing ice which sounds like dismantling our border security system than Republicans when if you're focusing on separating kids from their parents Democrats win\nBut family separation is over now over net right and so the of the president's under the executive order 'em and so I hear it down in Texas all the way from the attorney general's race too\nI hear it down in Texas all the way from the attorney general's race to congressional races to the the big Senate race um they use family separation as shorthand\nFor you know look at the atrocities committed by this administration I just don't know how much traction they're getting with that um but it's a it's been wide circulation\nBut these things are like like different ingredients in a big stew I mean they all add up to a feeling that among Democrats and many independents that the Trump Administration has somehow abandoned\nBasic American principles and um you know I think that as a specific issue driving voters in the midterms no not that but it definitely went into the soup and helped Democrats make this argument that Donald Trump and the Republicans are way out of the mainstream and need a check and balance", "year": "2018",
