the rule of law not the rule love the\nMob vote Republican exclamation exclamation point yeah and\nAnd I have to say that line in his speech it was not improvised that was written down\nThis is very intentional right this is coming from them and it's it's kind of a strategy I was talking to Frank Luntz\nWho is a a well known Republican pollster and he said that he has advised Republicans to use this language he said because he feels like it's an accurate description of the protesters at the Kavanaugh hearings and all the way that they were behaving\nAnd Kelsey Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is also using this language and particularly upset about those protests um and you know people following senators in the hallway to to try to make their point in the lead up to the the cabinet vote\nYeah that's absolutely right and well he's been talking about a lot the past couple of days\nThey all consuming them off of it toward the smaller\nIndependent of all the far at all the

the Republican Pete Stauber has been campaigning since the summer of two thousand Seventeen he's doing with it with Donald Trump's blessing the president was here in June campaigning for him\nDemocrats on the other hand were taken by surprise when Rick Nolan said he wouldn't seek reelection earlier this year they fought a primary battle resented which came out on top but that was just mid August so stoppers had a significant jump on Democrats at least when it comes to campaigning\nMark what are the issues at play\nMining is a big issue up in the eighth district the third party

[noise]\nWelcome back to the politics show meant to be our cameras\nOn the air with a special broadcast every week through the mid term election breaking down the major theme for seeing that\nI Need you to get your friends your family get you get your current work they did vote Republican\nThere are less than four weeks until election day and polls show voter enthusiasm in hot but have history of the guide most Americans won't vote in the mid term even when they're eligible one of the main reasons why I haven't bought a new station is actually that I'm always too busy\nBeing away from home I don't feel connected to the political system I don't believe that it actually affect us\nToday we're going to look at who isn't voting why they are and what would happen if they did to talk about all of this and joined by NPR to medical ... and ... holiday hey guys\nThere hey it is likely a lot of people but it is very likely a majority well about the right and that's the whole thing is between presidential elections and mid term elections you have about a thirty percent drop off\nA between those two elections and that's why you hear the parties talking so much about kind of base politics things that really rough up their bases because they need to get the most active it's people\nOut to the polls because this whole other group of folks just don't go out to vote but I smell why aren't they voting no one is complicated right like some of it because they're apathetic they're too busy they don't feel like their vote matters like the system is rigged I mean I could go on and on it's like there's so many\nIf you like the system is rigged I mean I could go on and on it's like there's so many reasons but does that kind of some of the big ones I mean a big part of it also as there are some people who actually just obstructed from voting like they want to open they have registration problems or their name is kicked off the voting rolls\nBut I Would say for a lot of people it does come down to both a combination of not feeling like their vote matters but also not really\nCaring too much about the fact that they feel like they have the power to change anything\nEvery mid term we see the same pattern emerged and also I'm Wondering I think we have a pretty good sense of who these people are wonder if you can lay it out for\nThe auto sure sure I mean to the one big group I feel like we constantly hear pundits talk about our our young people and um you know this has sort of historically been a problem it even an issue when you look at presidential election years and I spent some time in a congressional district a rider on the Las Vegas strip\nWhy it went there in particular we had one of the worst estimated voter turnout rate for young people in the entire country and twenty fourteen\nAnd is it Eighteen to twenty five or twenty nine year old is how they oh wow that's not even that young and and there was a young guy I met his name as Shelby made is he is attending a local community college there in Las Vegas\nAnd and you know he basically was very confused with the system initially didn't know if you needed to register every year he thinks he registered but overall he just seemed confused with how you vote\nOr never voted before more from what I Do about voting and studies show to the whole place is over I don't know what I Need to bring on an even know what happens during her\nBring yourself some states bring ID yes I mean there there is the argument that you know some of this you can figure out now increasingly through like Google but I Do think him like\nHe wasn't the only person who expressed this confusion with how you vote which I think it's interesting like people don't know if they're registered they don't know if they should register and maybe to us political junkie this is\nSort of things to be assumed people knew but I was really amazed by the amount of people who just did not seem to have that kind of like literacy Eighteen to twenty\nNine year olds are the lowest age group for voter participation every year consistently like these voters keep getting older and they wind up voting later on but as young voters Eighteen to twenty nine they have the lowest participation rates\nAnd they have among the deepest drop off between presidential elections in mid term elections in twenty twelve for example about one in five voters were Eighteen to twenty nine year old Nineteen percent\nThat dropped off to Thirteen percent twenty fourteen to back up to Nineteen percent\nDuring the presidential election in twenty sixteen\nWhy is that I feel like I've heard a couple of big theories one being that a lot of young people are very transient so they don't feel attached to their particular place that they live in and she'll be Mavis actually mentioned this to me he's originally from Missouri he thinks he registered they originally so he doesn't really feel attached\nTo Nevada and he felt like you didn't know much about Nevada politics and this is something that I Would say we hear a lot about the other big thing I've heard a lot from young people about it transportation and just sort of logistics of trying to get to the polls and they may not be stakeholders either younger voters\nAnd that they don't have kids in the schools like ... there are things that happen later in your life they get you more engaged in politics even at just at the local law but there's also this belief that they don't think that they know enough which I Wonder if this is a factor of just being young when you look at surveys you'll see a large percentage of young people say that they don't think they know enough\nTo be able to vote and so therefore they don't want to cast a ballot for someone if they don't actually know who this person is and I've heard that by just knocking on doors and talking to young folks as well\nAnd uh so they said why just three months or let's let him go for a year and the Senate had a chance to roll back that change\nAnd that opportunity failed this week when the Senate tied fifty to fifty so the regulations remain in place Ron tell us about the potential downsides to these plans these plants don't have to comply with all the usual rules under the Affordable CARE Act so\nInsurers don't necessarily have to cover all those basic things that people think cut above my care guarantees they will get\nPerhaps including maternity care perhaps including emergency care perhaps including an ambulance that takes you to the hospital after a car accident\nAnd of course at the bottom line they also divert dollars in patients from a larger insurance pool that makes Obamacare worked so in that way it's one more way that the White House has managed to undermine the law that they could review\nThat it NPR's Ron Elving each week he catches of that on some of the headlines that we might have meant because of all the other news is happening thank you Ron again\nThis is

cut they've had we'd be their best selling point headed into the mid term\nThink voters are on their side on this issue it's an all out looting of America the wholesale robbery of the middle class [noise]\nWe're going to dig into the policy of a big tax law and how that affecting the politics to do that we've got to NPR reporters who covered that's more than anyone else on our team Kelsey Snell and Scott Horsley hey guys hey how are ya good with you\nThough Kelsey you cover Congress um they passed this thing let's talk about what within it can you give us a quick recap of what was in the big tax bill\nYeah the big things that I think people will remember the most is that Republicans cut the top corporate tax rate from thirty five percent a Twenty one percent they also made things a little bit simpler for individual they made the standard deduction almost double\nThey cut rates for most people who pay taxes and they doubled the child tax credit\nBut they also lowered the cap on the mortgage interest deduction is that thing that people use after they you know buy a house and they are paying interest on the mortgage payments they conduct that well they Republicans decided to cap that to help kind of keep the overall cost of this bill and check\nAnd they put a cap on the state and local tax deduction which is um when you live in a state that has a particularly high a state tax you could write some of that off\nThat is also limited now those things are primarily benefits that go to people who itemize their deductions on their tax forms so it the impact really was spread on evenly across people with different income brackets\nImpact really was spread evenly across people with different income brackets\nJust got this has been a lot of the land for almost a year at this point do we have any sense of the economic impact\nI hate to say it but it's really still too soon to tell but we do have kind of competing stories we have seen fairly robust economic growth a second quarter growth was over four percent we're in the ballpark a three and a half to four percent for the third quarter when that number comes out later this month [noise]\nThose are pretty healthy growth numbers private economists and the c._e._o. forecasters they think this was a short lived sugar high that people are are getting more money in their paychecks spending it and that's all going to wear off pretty quickly\nScott I'm going to stop you right there you said CBS show that is the congressional budget office that the independent agency that I'm sort of calculate the economic effect of congressional\nYeah there than non partisan officials score keepers for all ... all the bills that go through Congress to deal with taxes and budget\nMore optimistic forecasters notably at the White House thing no this is a lasting change that companies are going to take their tax savings put that into new plants new equipment\nNew machinery that's going to make workers more productive and that we're going to see sustained higher growth for years and years to come and it's really just too soon to know which of those competing narratives is the right one\nTo basically we're going to go into the midterm elections we're people are going to vote not really knowing the answer what\nWe do know however is that government revenues have taken a hit from these tax cuts and as a result the federal deficit has ballooned\nThis is not a hot matter of of conversation on the campaign trail\nAs far as I can tell no the deficit has has certainly receded from the public consciousness you might remember back in the\nEarly days the recession it was kinda high on the public agenda that Republicans in particular were complaining about trillion dollar deficits we are marching in that direction again the deficit is expected to be up around a trillion dollars in the current fiscal year but you certainly don't hear Republicans talking a lot about this and you don't hear a lot of Democrats talking about either\nWhen you do hear Democrats talking about it they seem to be setting it up as a binary saying you know Republicans wanted to cut taxes for the wealthy while also doing away with government benefits that people want to use and so it's not usually message from Democrats as as just the tax cut is bad but the tax cut his dad which means\nThe government can't spend money on programs that are popular\nYeah I guess the challenge for the Democrats as they have to be careful in how they criticize a tax cut let they be accused of wanting to re people's taxes which they often are is that the the great thing that Republicans thought they were going to be able to campaign on or not\nWell Republicans have really backed off of campaigning on it and that's in part because you know the polls have been bad for this tax bill for months and months and the polling average that day you would've aren't real clear politics shows that thirty nine percent of people approve of this and forty two point five percent disapproved\nAnd you know the tax cut it had kind of a a momentary high watermark back early in the year when there were a lot of stories in the newspaper and on TV about companies that were paying one time bonuses to their workers\nAre and and for a nanosecond the tax cut was enjoying fifty percent approval\nBut that's been sinking now for the better part of the year and it's now trading right around where President Trump is forty percent or lower and that's that's a tough sell for Republicans I think if if you'd asked Republicans a year ago when they were crafting this tax cut is that where it's going to be a as we approach the midterm elections they would be disappointed I Know that's where it wound up\nIn the tax bill becoming sort of a non issue\nSo that's where it wound up in the tax bill becoming sort of a non issue\nWell again Democrats are going to continue messing ... messaging tax cuts as the binary to win the no Republicans wanting to cut other things that Democrats like like health care like Social Security like Medicare\nThey will continue to message it that way and you know Republicans may be hoping that this starts to bear fruit for them not in twenty Eighteen but maybe twenty twenty\nI think you're going to continue to hear competing narratives Republicans will talk about this as an investment in the health of the U.S economy that will pay for that will be dividends in the long term\nDemocrats will talk about it as a deficit ballooning give away to the rich that's going to put the squeeze on entitlement programs are the folks to
