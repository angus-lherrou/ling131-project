lot of important factors have remained constant pi democratic enthusiasm vote low approval ratings resident and a lot of political history indicating Democrats should be poised for big wins in the house just a week and a half ago before election day we're going to step back\nAnd take a closer look at the race for control of the house of representatives\nShould that we have NPR's Dominican to narrow to Mac and Danielle Kurtzleben in the studio everybody hey so let's start with the fact that historically and and given some of the big picture trends Democrats really do have to wind up their back let's walk through why exactly that is\nWhen presidents are in their first midterms they lose a heck of a lot of seats on average is just as a matter of and we've heard President Trump actually posit publicly why that is\nHow they get compliance [noise]\nIn some of it has to do with frankly with the fact that people got their guy over the line they got their president and then they sort of a back off and the ... perhaps the content and settled in and the people who are most motivated or the people who are most upset with the policies of the new president is putting in\nPlace fun fact on that so Gallup crunched the numbers a little bit earlier this year and they found that\nWhen the president's approval rating going into the midterms into below fifty percent and Trump's according to our latest holds thirty nine percent the president's party average is a loss of thirty seven seats in the house which by the way Democrats need fewer than that in order to take the house so when the president has approval of over fifty percent\nHis party tends to lose only fourteen ... still alive but not nearly as huge\nForeign Democrats have been incredibly enthusiastic all year ever since President Trump took office but in recent weeks we've seen Republican finally getting engaged getting enthusiastic\nAs well yeah and as you get closer to the election that tends to happen and Republicans the advantage that they wind up having is there a couple of engine that Republicans have\nYou know the elections are mostly taking place on Republican turf\nIn the house you know most of these places are at least Republican leaning because Republicans have run up to score when it comes to state legislative chambers and governors' seats which are the ones that control redistricting so a lot of they won so many there and control correct\nSo the interesting point here is that so much of that redistricting was only possible because so many state legislatures went to Republican majorities greater Republican majorities because of the Republican wave in Obama's first term in twenty ten\nIf it has drawn a federal lawsuit a Kemp said it's all blown out of proportion that just to move to excite the Democratic base and he actually points the finger at Stacey Abrams\nEnd of the group that she founded called the New Georgia project which has done a lot of voter registration he says that her group is responsible for these messed up applications\nThere are on the list definitely some fakes or some errors like people named Jesus Christ that live on having street as complex to point out but the issue has really persisted for a long time it continues to be a source of debate in the race\nLet's talk about the issues for a little bit what are the voters that you're talking to focusing on\nHealth care and education are really big in the race and and jobs although George and economy has been doing pretty well and the current Republican governor Nathan Deal is pretty popular\nRace has been an issue in this race or maybe not totally at the forefront but very close ah there was a report pretty recently\nThat looked back in the archives and found that Abrams participated in a a flag burning of the Georgia flag back in the nineties at the time that the Georgia fly had the Confederate flag on it as well\nTwenty six years ago as a college freshman I along with many other Georgian including the governor of Georgia for deeply disturbed by the racial divisions and that's that was embedded in the state flag without Confederate symbol\nAnd eventually that Confederate symbol was removed and she pointed out that the governor at the time was actually pushing for the Confederate symbols to be removed as well\nDominican this is one of the top tier national races this year a lot of people paying attention to it a lot of a likely democratic candidate for president two years have made a point of going to Georgia to campaign for Stacey Abrams what is it about this governor's race that's getting so much attention given all the other races going on all across the country\nWell you know Georgia is one of those states that has been traditionally Republican but there have been fine that it could be moving away from that certainly the demographic suggest that it could be a more of a center right state\nJohnny you've been covering this race since the beginning less than two weeks left what are you thinking about are looking for the final days of this race\nMy big question right now is how well is Abrams reaching and communicating to voters who may not be as engaged and don't usually vote in the mid term elections Abrams has gotten a lot of attention in the national media\nThe fact that she would be the first African American female governor is a big deal\nBut campaign done a really good job of labeling her and simple way that she just too extreme for George eight\nEighty eight rooms would chop spending rating liberal she's an extreme even campaigned with them\nShe's in extreme heat them campaigned with summer\nIt's clear and concise of people can understand what he's getting out there eight rooms I'm not sure had done the same with camp and so my big question is you know Abrams talks a lot about her policy proposal she's very smart\nBut how well did that reach people in Georgia and maybe even more rural parts of the state that don't have access to as much education or resources are they going to be motivated in the same way that maybe they were for President Obama back in two thousand eight\nAnd people compare this election to like the Obama wave that that ah Abrams needs to inspire voters and the same way that Obama did in two thousand eight Obama did not win Georgia in two thousand that he lost by about two hundred thousand votes so that's a huge hill that Abrams has to climb if she's going to win this race\nOr we will have answers to all those questions in less than two weeks That's NPR's

NPR advance a journalistic excellence in the digital age [noise]\nWalking back to the politics show from NPR I'm Scott Detrow rare with a special broadcast every weekend through the mid term elections to guide you through everything\nYou need to know what the elections disclose people are focusing on the fall to try to get a sense of what might happen on election day just about a week from everything they fall showing Gillum at one point lead well within the margin of error every player politics however has\nIt at that have and the fact that his poll numbers are going out running neck and that is that the race to watch on election night for the new NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll confirms enthusiasm is high for both Republicans and Democrats in the works are already confirmed that\nThis election it's all about president Donald Trump\nAnd you know I like to look at it falls only one where when I got a like a month or\nSo to me now to talk through this with NPR's Dominican to narrow and Danielle Kurtzleben hey there hey All right so about a month ago we had to pull out and it got a lot of national attention because it showed a lot of good news for Republicans this new poll this time around looks like Democrats are going to be happier people reading it\nWell it looks like essentially that the Kevin a confirmation fight and all that it did to fire up Republicans had kind of faded to be perfectly\nFight and all that it did to fire up Republicans have kind of faded to be perfectly honest or it looks like we've returned to the fundamentals and that's something I've been hearing from Republican quite a bit when you look at the landscape for the house races for example\nThe vast majority of those races are being run in places that Republicans hold seats and that has not changed\nLet's get to the pole and the numbers are Dominican what are the biggest takeaways for you looking at this point\nThe big thing is that President Trump is seen as the biggest factor in A People's vote and really the numbers are kind of remarkable even when you put them in historical context two thirds of people say that Trump is either a major or minor factor in deciding their vote in less than two weeks on November six\nCompare that to twenty fourteen when Republicans took back then it\nJust forty seven percent of Americans said that Iraq Obama was a factor in their vote\nAnd a twenty point jump that's a big deal and more people this time around say that they are motivated to go vote for a Democrat because of their impressions of President Trump than in twenty four teen when people said that their impressions of President Obama made them want to go vote for a Republican\nSo I mean President Trump is campaigning saying of voters if I'm On the ballot you know this was about me and get trying to get his supporters to the polls but this result shows that this was a negative\nIt depends on who you're talking to you though right I mean people in either party Democrats and Republicans once again already in their corners Trump may be affecting their vote off and he is\nAnd you know for Democrats makes them less likely to vote for Republican more likely to vote for a Democrat or Republican vice versa interestingly in this poll the independence or where you see the interesting gender gaps on this for example when you ask independent voters\nHow important is Trump to your vote your fifty percent of independent women saying he is very important compared to twenty eight percent of independent men that's a bigger divided and you see among Republicans or Democrats likewise when they say okay so how's Trump going to affect your vote\nFifty percent of independent women say more likely to make the vote for Democrats thirty three percent of independent men say that\nSo when we talk about gender divide and this is important this year\nYes women are a driving factor we do have the potential to hear across the board for there to be a bigger gender gap in this year's midterm are as big of a gender gap as we've seen in a very long time but that said it's not just about gender it's all too about party democratic ... democratic women alike disliked Trump and are going to vote Democrats\nYeah I mean when Daniel talks but independent they really are an important factor here and that's because President Trump has really done very little to reach beyond the base with a lot of what he's talked about and\nThe gamble here among Republicans than a lot of Republicans I talked to that they said look independents young voters Latinos\nYou know they don't turn out to vote as much in mid term here so you know if the goal is to drive up the base and this is going to be a base election which is the gamble than they need to fire up the Republican base with a lot of these cultural issues\nAs we read the Democratic party is openly encourage caravan after caravan of illegal aliens to violate laws break or\nI had a quick question though I mean when you say this is a base election I mean compared to presidential elections mid term elections are always kind of the reactions right I mean is this year that\nMuch difference so the thing is with us really fascinating I think raises a lot of alarm bells for Republicans\nPut into all of these programs that it's really just a drop in the bucket against the size of the problem as we've seen but here again the consensus in the end was let's pass what we can let's put as many dollars in as we can\nIf we can only agree on that stitched together patchwork programs let's that leads to that that

all the votes substance rally in each week we focus on one issue on voters' minds health insurance reform becomes law in the United states\nIs [noise] this week health care for my first day I'm going to ask God to send me a bill to immediately repeal and replace the gestures Obamacare [noise]\nThe Affordable CARE Act Republicans found one of their best talking points they used it again and again\nWe're going to unify because we all every Republican ran on repealing\nAnd replacing it we're going to keep our promises battle scene within reach when Republicans gained control of the White House in addition to the house and Senate but\nThe Republican effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act had without harsher repeal of Obamacare failed by a single vote early today\nAfter seven years of promises to repeal and replace Obamacare\nIt came down to just one vote the final vote forty nine to fifty one now is a Democrat to feel like health care is an advantage for them Democrats have talked about healthcare all election and the polls indicate that voters want to hear about it\nThat has Republicans on defense and we're gonna talk about all of this with NPR's Scott Horsley and Danielle Kurtzleben you guys have high so let's take a few minutes here to talk about health care because all year we've been talking about how Democrats the health care\nAs their best issue with voters which is so striking because from twenty ten on after Obamacare passed Democrats were really on defence when it came to health care and they lost a lot of seats because of it so let's start with this how are people feeling about the state of health care right now\nI Would say concerned bare minimum but if you're a Democrat and you're much more worried I mean one thing we do know I can tell you from both being on the trail and from polling data is that\nBoth Republicans and Democrats are worried about the health care system worried about access worried about costs but Democrats are much more worried and this is reflected in what voters tell you and it's reflected in ads Democrats have just been running more health care ads throughout the entire midterm cycle than Republicans have\nDetermined to fight for Fordham excessively health care not take it away in\nLike three hundred thousand North Dakota nice to have the preexisting condition that used to mean no health insurance now the ... mid march with Morsi's laws you take away health here from people with preexisting conditions\nAnd what Democrats are targeting is the U.S all the Republicans have waged a over the last two years on the Affordable CARE Act Republicans of course campaign saying they wanted to repeal and replace the Affordable CARE Act they weren't able to do that thanks to John McCain's thumbs down in the Senate\nBut the Trump Administration has been steadily wheeling away at the Affordable CARE Act to the last going on two years\nAnd it's worth pausing for a moment in walking through all the different ways the Trump Administration and Republicans of Congress have tried to undermine the Affordable CARE Act or try to replace the Affordable CARE Act because a lot of the ad come down to you voted to do this and Republicans were responding no I didn't so let's\nAdd come down to you voted to do this and Republicans are responding no I didn't so let's start with actions taken by the Trump Administration Scott what are some of the biggest things that President Trump has done on his own to affect\nThe Affordable CARE Act they have offered up a variety of alternative insurance plans mostly sort of skimpy your plans that would be cheaper and might appeal to younger healthier people uh but could also have the effect of raising prices for older sicker people\nThey have done away with the marketing budget to try to encourage enrollment in the Affordable care act's a health care marketplaces\nThey have ended subsidies for insurance companies which has had the effect of driving up premiums on the a C a market places\nAnd then Congress as part of their tax overhaul did away with the tax penalty for people who don't have insurance so all this was sort of been an attack on the AC a insurance marketplace\nWhich despite all that has proven to be pretty resilient a sign up so stay pretty level since before the Trump Administration came in\nAnd the most recent census data says we still have a about Ninety One percent of the American public covered by health insurance\nDanielle of course most of twenty Seventeen was focused on Republican attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare they ultimately failed but what should we know about what was in those bills how the house bill that path and how the Senate bill that didn't happen because of John McCain would have changed Obamacare\nOne of the biggest things that's most salient in this election cycle is what that built those bills would have done to pre existing conditions this is what Democrats are attacking Republicans on and so many of these ads saying that\nRepresentative selling cells voted for the Obamacare repeal and replace spelled that bill would have done away with your protection for pre existing conditions and Scott Republicans running for\nReelection are defending themselves from these attacks in an interesting way basically saying how dare you insinuate I don't care about people with preexisting conditions\nAnd that's right but it's interesting that Republicans are on the defensive here this is really the mirror image of what we've seen in the past few election cycles when Republicans were on the attack going after the Affordable CARE Act promising to repeal Obamacare and Democrats were largely\nStaying quiet they knew that the Ford will correct wasn't terribly popular at that point\nNow we have voters saying well they might not love Obamacare writ large they do like various provisions of it and you've got Democrats running about half their ads defending those provisions including the GOP on the defensive\nWhen you look at television ads when you compare pro Democrat to pro Republican that were put out that year\nOh democratic ad yes like Scott said more than half of them have been about health care and this is according to the Wesleyan Media project which tracks the thing\nHere in Holland building Democrats feel this year that compared to from twenty ten twenty twelve twenty fourteen twenty sixteen in those years roughly seven to ten percent of democratic ads are about healthcare Democrats did not want to touch healthcare during that time now this year they are all about it\nIn the same time we have a group of Republican attorneys general who have gone to court in Texas to try to strike down the Affordable CARE Act two of those state attorneys general happened to be running for Senate\nOne in Missouri and one in West Virginia Josh Hawley the Republican Senate candidate in Missouri has been running ads saying oh I definitely would protect people with preexisting medical conditions even though he's gone to court to unwind exactly that protection in the Affordable CARE Act\nEarlier this year we learned our oldest has a rare chronic disease preexisting conditions we know what that's like and I'm just calling I support forcing insurance companies to cover all preexisting\nJosh Hawley I support for insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions\nWell that is a statement that you could argue is very much at odds with the lawsuit that he is a part of to unwind the Affordable CARE Act if you're just joining us You're listening to the politics shell from NPR's Scott Detrow here in the studio with NPR's Scott Horsley and Danielle Kurtzleben talking about health care\nSo what is that the basis of all of this a focus on health care I mean do people care more about healthcare now than they did two years ago or four years ago\nOne is that Obamacare is somewhat more popular now than it was back during a lot of the Obama administration um if you look at polling data from say twenty fourteen and twenty Fifteen Obamacare was generally seen net unfavorably more people seeing it on favorably than favorably",
