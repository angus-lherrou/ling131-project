be performing live\nAt the University of South Florida as part of their Monday Night jazz serious Terrell thank you so much for your time how are you doing\nJak that I'm doing great thank you for your time\nWonderful thank you for your time and it's a real pleasure to have you in here I'm a big fan of your playing in a big fan of your music so you know I've watched a a couple of other interviews you've done where with bone to pick and I listen to\nThe interview the last time you were here and you were in the studio and has been taken the lead fascinated by a kind of your musical journey\nSort of the beginning of when you picked up the trumpet and even before that and everything you've experienced in that time can't talk to us a little bit about that\n[noise] sure I Would probably say since I've been nine or ten I've had the desire to play the trumpet because my grandparents had a trumpet in their closet and you know grandparents always say don't\nTouch that Trump it right the worst thing they could ever say to a little kid so any time they would leave the house or I think they were far enough away that I could slip in the closet and see the Trump that I Would and I've always been just fascinated by the sound of the shop at how it works and\nUm fact industry vowels and he's three ... can make so much music just been fascinated by it [noise] and then we move my family moved from Florida to Chicago\nAnd we got to Chicago and come to find out your first year playing music it had to be a string instrument and not a brash so my ... and ... and I was absolutely at ... at Yale and the teacher reminded me\nEach lesson and how does that feel with his boat because whatever finger that Iran melted cheese\nThat I was at field with his boat because whatever finger that Iran now that he would hit it with his about and it got to be the point that every single finger that I was used and had been hit before pretty sore so\nThere was a one lesson I came in and I was about to play by by a black sheep have you on the wall and I made a mistake and I saw his bow coming from older shoulder to pop me in the finger and I just only meant to block his bowl\nOr in blocking his bowl I hit his boat back in his bow hit him in the face practice glasses and put a giant norm is well down the middle of his face and I called my parents and they suspended me for the week from school and he told my parents\nYour son has no musical talent whatsoever keep him as far away from music as humanly possible oh my goodness [laughter] so\nYeah that was my that was my first experience which\nTurned out to be um an incredible blessing 'cause they suspended from school for the week but he insisted that I'd be suspended from any musical activities for a year so the following year was the year that I was supposed to play trumpet but they wouldn't allow me to play trumpet so what I did is I play guitar and my\nMath teacher everyday at lunch he would just pick up his guitar and start to practice so that was his his by the much every day so I asked them if I could listen to them that much and he allowed me to listen and they taught me how to play guitar\nAnd so consequently a his favorite artists that John Denver and that became mine and [noise] and a severe went by I did some talent shows John Denver I was dressed up like a little cowboy which I think my parents got a good laugh out of\nAnd then find it a year later when I was finally sixth grade\nWe went and er we played the village vanguard in New York for a week and we played for that week and we played the set and then um when the Monday after the backyard\nI'm John quake producer John go hey you guys what do we just do this why don't we record the CD like it's just that you've been playing a week so we the first hour
