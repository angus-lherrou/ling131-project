[noise]\n\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\n\n[noise] Mm\n[noise]\nI Would just listen to to choose from Miles Davis titled tractor that released which was produced by our guest on the telephone that San Marcus Miller so if you have to some of your experience with Miles Davis in in a single sentence what would you say\nI Would say um\nYou say [laughter] [noise]\nI Would say um he was a a master\nAt being himself he was about as honest a musician as I've ever met probably on the person as I've ever met you know he he um he got bored easily he was interested in being\nI'm On the cutting edge and ah he liked music that was hit that's what drew him to be about\n'em and that's the same thing that you or to you know contemporary music of the eighties and hip hop in the in the early nineties so\nHe knows he just went with his instincts he wasn't afraid to go without he felt he wasn't worried about the criticism you just to distance so he was just a master at being true to and stuff and I'll cook if I could sum it up that's what I got from\nNow you're you're also related to piano brave Wynton Kelly who also worked with smiles she passed away at a very young age that but but do you did you know him well when you were growing up to do you have any life learning experience that he passed on to you they worked with you and maybe later with Miles Davis\nWhich was uh my dad's cousin okay and um he passed in Nineteen Seventy one I was eleven or twelve at the time and the jets decided that I Want it to get into music but I knew him\nUp until that point a you know our family my dad's father was a minister on so our family met at\nA our grandfathers church every Sunday we had the service and then we'd all go down to the basement and\nYou know at least once a month the family would perform for each other it was a very musical family my thoughts with Shane my dad would play the piano when can when he was in town and he'd come into play too so\nUm I remember always chiton to the right of went in at the piano adding a couple of notes a couple of randomness whatever he was playing the was gracious enough to not smacked me off the piano\n[laughter]\n[noise] and my mom tells me that up once winter came and picked me up I could have been more than five or six and he disappeared and you know I hung out with a winter all night I don't know I don't remember it at all my mom was pretty worried but he returned\nYou know some late hour with me safe and or so since I don't remember I just made up my own story you know I decided I was hanging out with\nWith the miles and Wes Montgomery when John Coltrane\n[laughter] at some club at the half note in New York\nThere you go and you pass that story long and people believed it right I'm sticking with it there you go my story [laughter] that's a great story [laughter]\nNow as well as working with Miles Davis you you can also done a whole lot of stuff on the pop side I mean you worked with Luther Vandross when was Thirteen platinum records and you produce seven of those what was it like working with looser and hung up ...\nYou know it's funny man or you talk about about looser and the music was pretty different you know but\nBoth had the same quality Luther knew who he was he wasn't swayed by other people at different styles you wasn't swayed by criticism you know we did lose his demo\nIn Nineteen eighty to ... and I were both I regret to flex that he was singing background I was playing bass and we took the time to make a demo for Luther and he shot that Dumbo around for a year\nGot turned down by every major record label in New York at the time um they didn't think he had a strong enough gimmick you know what I mean or ... you know at that time and be was about big bands like bridge when to fire\nA cameo groups like that loop that wasn't that it was just an ass\nI'm a cameo groups like that loop that wasn't that was just an I stood at the Mike in St very well but the record execs didn't think that was marketable\nBut it didn't get turned loose and you know he just stuck to his guns you know some some guys suggested maybe he get another producer and put together a group he said no he just stuck to his guns he finally after a year\nOut a record record deal or put out the first recognize things just weren't Bernanke\nWhy remember that that was huge it was a huge rock yeah\nSo even though the record execs weren't sure about it the public was absolutely a hundred percent sure about but I got to witness that I got to see somebody\nWho really believed in their talent somebody who was actually talented also 'cause a lot of people um\nYou know they have um maybe an exaggerated ideas about the talent elusive was talented and he believes he was also a he stuck to it then became I got to see my friends become a huge stop\nYou also had a chance to work with a recent Franklin was that way\nWell look I had that first record uh it's called never too much and it was like you say was a big hit salute they got a call from Clive Davis and a classic read in an interview that moved to was a big fan of uh meet the Franklin he said you know we're trying to\nCreate a comeback for Lisa Franklin Luther would you be interested in producing here\nSo he set of course he called me and say hey man I got a chance to produce a week the Franklin met right mia up tempo are ... you know that I can write the lyrics and that works to deliver the lyrics in the military too so\nI was like hey man I'm I don't write that much aren't being more of a jazz guy you could just shut up and write the\nFact
