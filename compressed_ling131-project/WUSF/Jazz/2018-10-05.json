events actually been going on for about twenty four years and uh with uh a year and a half high it is how did it start [noise]\nWell uh it's a great question and a one of the reasons that I'm involved with the event today I'm the founder of the event as a guy named George ... row so used to own the the iconic five o'clock club in Sarasota which was I'm the oldest live music venue in Sarasota\nAnd while he saw other organizations raising money for various charities\nHe found the need to do something in his mom's name um who you know in the Italian culture I'm Italian moms loves to feed people and he decided that what he wanted to do is get back to the community by raising money to donate to local food bank\nAnd ah he dedicated a Sunday or once a year at his club and he invited a lot of local musicians which actually translates to some national some regional and national\nCaliber musicians or who would all donate their time and he would spend a Saturday or Sunday afternoon um and banjo player all day long and all the proceeds would go to the local food bank and and\nAnd all the proceeds would go to the local food bank\nAnd and at that point in time I mean the bans were donating their time for this festival right absolutely absolutely and um and and they did so generously and have done so generously ever since so I've had a lot of artists telling me that this is the one event every year that they will donate their time and their artistry\nBecause they understand how important it is that the kids in our community are fed [noise]\nSo uh started as an indoor festival I'm George decided he wanted to grow the event turned it into a street festival um that went on through Nineteen I'm Sorry through two thousand and Thirteen um and even close in two thousand Thirteen ah we parted ways with the charity that we had been working with\nAnd uh took a little breather I re launched the event in two thousand Fifteen first on hill street again were had been\n[noise] and then I'm kind of um\nYou know a a divine intervention um did not allow me to produce the event on he'll be street the second year so that would have been two thousand sixteen she
