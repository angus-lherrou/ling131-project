... has written a lot for TV and movies and she's published three novels but she is best known as a playwright thirty ... plays and counting and her latest one bird heart hamlet just opened in New York Her fourth place to be judged on Broadway\nThree should read back welcome to studio three sixty\nThinking so this play is about the\nGreat actress of the second half of the nineteenth century in the early twentieth century uh serve Bernhardt played by the remarkable incandescent Jennings here\nAnd the central stories about her insistence at the height of her career and Eighteen Ninety seven\nYes that she wanted to play hamlet yes as a middle aged woman on the stage and everybody is skeptical of that idea\nA end she wants to play rewritten to strip out the poetry was the I Am certainly yeah la la la but bottom I Am and make it more like talk yeah and uh and focus more on I guess the action\nOr yes she was somebody who is really known to be and sort of electrifying active presence on stage\nAnd she wanted to play hamlet that way and she felt like the classical dancer the poetry stood in a way of the action which in fact it does make it so I just spent a year working on

view I Love writing wow and I can\nHaving written which is correct and you know I view I Love writing wow and I kind of are afraid I Am a freak I the other thing that happens to me\nIs you know I think that a lot of writers are have this neurosis around finishing things I don't know what that is because I don't have it for you know and I like to crochet I spent an hour in her talking to him about that very subject that terror of finishing can't\nOkay I have the opposite thing I have the chair of the unfinished and so once I get to a certain place in a script my anxiety goes really high until I write the end and one of the things that I Do teach my students want to teach I don't do a lot\nBut is that you know you really don't have anything until you've got a full draft and then you can start talking and that's not to say you should rush through your first draft but I Do feel like you know what are you talking about what are you doing and you can't actually even begin to answer
