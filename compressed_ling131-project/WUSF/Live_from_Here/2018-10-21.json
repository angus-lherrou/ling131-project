across the country sharing the good stories of our fellow Americans this week I traveled to Buffalo New York along Lake Erie were the sky was cloaked in a constant gray missed\nAllowing for just occasional peaks of the colorful leaves\nThe forecasts was calling for the first snow fall of the year but for the good people of buffalo that's not even caused where a long sleeve shirt when you live in Buffalo complaining about the weather is complaining about life itself\nI was picked up at the airport by a woman named Charlie she's been driving for twenty two years and there have was filled with stuffed animals they lined the dashboard hung from the rear view mirror and the monkey was attached to the steering wheel\nThese are my co pilot she said some people have Jesus I have these guys she goes by Charlie because her father was hoping she'd be a boy I really think the name made me a bit of a tomboy when I was younger\nThey don't say tomboy anymore now everybody is filled with gender fluids\nI guess I was ahead of my time but anyway I'm all girl now and everyone still calls me Charlie\nAfter growing up in Buffalo she went to college down in Arizona because I wanted to go to the hottest place I could find\nBut it turns out I'm not built for the desert\nSeems more like a place for lizards people who stay there too long start to look like a sponge that was left out in the sun\nShe came home after school and it's been in Buffalo ever since we have a lot of moisture here and I love it I'm like a plant water me and I grow when it's not raining it's snowing and when it's not doing either we can count on them is from Niagara Falls are you here to see the falls\nHave you ever lied your cab driver about seeing Niagara Falls because you didn't want her to know you planned your entire trip around eating buffalo wings\n[noise] I have\nTo drop me off downtown and I went out looking for a bar if you're looking for a bar or tavern buffalo is a good place to look save a lot of them and last call his four AM they say they're staying up to open later gives the snowplows trying to clear your way home [noise]\nEntered what looked like one of the older bars in the city covered in lights and years of science coasters stuck to the walls to kind of place where it's always midnight the kind of place but so tired that even the ceiling seems to be hunched over at the end of the bar\nThe bartender where the big bear a man named Chris he had a giant beard and big pause and then grab while he worked he says he's been in this bar for Thirty years and then he's been there so long he doesn't even smell they're famous buffalo wings any more people come in all the time and they say this\nThey're famous buffalo wings any more people come in all the time and they say they smelled them all the way down the street but I don't smell thing who knows maybe it's me they smell [noise]\nAre eagerly place my order there's something great about eating food that makes a city famous\nIn addition to whatever natural elements are involved the water the air the ingredients there's also a pride and love and as corny as it might sound the love the people add makes all the difference\nHave you ever been away from home for so long that you started professing your love for a plate of deep fried chicken wings\nI have\nChris had a big hartfield laugh his kids are grown in just him and his wife down the kids all moved away which means that his grandchildren are too far out of reach for his liking I don't understand what everybody's after\nMean sure moving to another city might get you a little more money but when you lose from being away from your family is too big of a cost\nEveryone complains about their parents in Chile shell out twenty dollars an hour for a babysitter and then suddenly we're not so bad [noise] he keeps busy with his bowling league he said people like to knock bowling but it's a damn good game especially when you have your own shoes\nHe pointed their wall of bowling trophies behind them that his team and one throughout the years their name is great balls of fire\nBut this year we're a little nervous we lost one of our guys to a heart attack and there's a young team called the kings that's been gunning for us but we refuse to lose to a team whose name isn't even a little funny it might be a different story if it was the Likud he splits [noise]\nAmong the trophies was a faded newspaper article featuring a high school football team\nThere was a picture of Chris he was the captain in the last year they won the state championship this was a different life\nIt's all just a memory now he said just like this will be one day have you ever started to tear up about a bartenders glory years only to realize it was just your eyes watering from a plate of piping hot buffalo wings [noise]\nAnd boy were they hot my lips were on fire tears were rolling down my cheeks I wasn't thinking clearly have you ever tried tax cool in front of a bunch of locals until one of them pointed out that you were sweating from your bald spot [noise]\nI stumbled outside to get some air and the first snowflakes were starting to fall the first snow falls like a visit from your family who you're happy to see before they hang around too long and becomes difficult [noise]\nI looked up to the sky as a snowflake landed on my cheek and I brushed it off have you ever forgot that you would wings sauce on your fingers touch dry and had to run into a bar to beg a giant bartender to throw beer in your face\n[noise] I have [noise]\nAnd that's why I'm
