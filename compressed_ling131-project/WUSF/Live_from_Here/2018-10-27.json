here I'm resuming my journey across the country sharing the good stories of our fellow Americans\nThis week I was lucky enough to experience the iconic\nNew York on them and they rolled into New York city\nThere's something magical about fall in Manhattan It's that sweet spot between the summer humidity and the icy winter when you can actually walk around town feel good and things don't smell so bad it was late afternoon when I checked into my hotel and dropped off my bags\nNew York is a great walking city and nothing encourages that more than a hotel room the size of a behind home\nThe streets were colorful as always Halloween has hit the city have you ever complimented someone costume and realized he was just a New Yorker wears a milk carton\nMeans I have [laughter] I have [noise]\nAnd I walked into Washington Square park who sat on a bench near a dog run there is nothing crazier than a New York dog park\nThese are not dogs that are used to the freedom of backyards and rolling hills these are patents that have been locked indoors for hours drinking coffee trying not to the on the New York post\nWhen they finally get to the dog park they lose their minds\nI sat next to one of the dog owner as a musician named Dave even though he was in sweat pants has long hair and cool Jean jacket said he was a rocker in dog look cool to he was a mutt named Rocco with a spike the collar and an upper lip and the permanence norm\nDamons lived in the village with Rocco his whole adult life and makes a living now in the studio musician he was all men thing about how the city's changed\nThere's no team for the young bands anymore than New York used to be a city of artists weirdo who were too strange to live in their hometown but now there's nothing left at the weirdos can afford and\nHe said the one thing that will never change is the amazing diversity in the city\nThere are people from all around the world he said just look at this dog park Rocco just a crazy mud and here he is hanging with three pose a purebred German Shepherd and a French poodle who's getting a little too friendly with her nose\nLived in New York\nAfter meeting some friends for dinner I headed back toward the hotel through the west village on a normal night's areas hopping but as Halloween comes near it's truly outrageous the bars were in full force and people were dressed up in costumes roaming the streets\nTo me it's the adults in costume or the scariest part of Halloween [noise]\nAt least one child dresses up like a ninja turtle chances are he won't be drunk and hitting on your girlfriend\n[noise]\nThen handed down McDougal street I was approached by what can only be described as a large dirty humor\nIs good face paint my had had a muddy footprint on it he was sweating and confused he grabbed my arm and asked if I knew where his friends where I felt bad for the summer but I had to laugh what kinds of friends will be looking for [noise]\nHad to laugh what kinds of friends will be looking for where they ... do do they live in a magical land should I Try and return them was hollowed out tree I felt bad for him so I took his big white hand in mind and walking down the street\nHave you ever gotten looks to strangers on the street and you knew without a doubt they thought you in the ... were lovers [laughter]\n\nWe tried to reach racist steps and we saw a lot of people but no ... that's when he got desperate and decided to climb onto a mailbox for better view\nThe postal department might be slow they may not run their post offices that well but one thing they did right was designing their mailboxes\nThey created a square bottom that makes it seem as if climbing it would be easy but when you get to that rounded top you quickly find out it's impossible to stand on especially if you're drunk desperate and dress like a blue cartoon character [noise]\nIn effort was valiant he wasn't falling off but he wasn't going up either he was clinging to the side frozen like a very koala they're never heard a live ... couldn't tell you what kind of noise they make\nThis one let out little half Yeltsin runs the broke my heart [laughter]\nJust as I was about to help three other smart came running up and grab this long lost rather have them and knocked him to the ground in a pile of blue and white for\nI felt as if I was responsible for this story book ending and I wandered away [noise] have you ever tried to cross the street and found yourself tackled by a gaggle of giant beer so stuffed animals [noise]\nThey insisted that come with them and get some pizza before they caught the train and the bank you know we went to Joe's on ... street in sixth avenue it's a tiny shop with one table a couple stools at the window\nMost people just by through the crowd and take their lights outside I was worried about causing a scene by walking in with these smart\nBut as soon as we entered I realized it was not going to be a problem it turns out that at midnight on friday before Halloween in the west village there are a lot of people in costume thinking the same thing\nThere was a sexy dabble a hotdog Michael Jackson to clowns from it and one guy who looked like a sea captain who turned out not to be in costume at all [noise] Dave\nThe rocker was right the diversity of this town is something else and it's still attracts a large amount of weirdos
