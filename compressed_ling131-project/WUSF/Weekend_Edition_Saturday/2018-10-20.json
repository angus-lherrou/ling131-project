the shouting statement what does it tell you about how the kingdom mishandling crush\nWhat we see is that for the first time officially the Saudis say that Jamal ... is that\nThe account places blame on senior advisors none of them royals ... for a policy that's gone terribly wrong the Saudis now admit that there's a standing order to bring dissidents back to the kingdom by force if necessary\nBut the account lays the blame on these senior security officials who went beyond the order they killed this dissident journalist they covered up the murder why did the Saudi leadership failed to confirm is that earlier\nBad news travels slowly to the top is that one Saudi defender put it on Twitter these latest accounts distance the top leadership and especially the powerful crown prince but there are so many questions left to be answered\nOne of the biggest right in front of us whereas Mitt stricter shrunk jeeze faulty\nIndeed so the Saudi account says that his body was handed over to a local

empty thrown America's abdication of global leadership ... thanks so much for being with us glad to be here based on all of your experience just the Saudi explanation of how Mr ... died ring true to you\nKnow I think uh this sounds like a damage limitation exercise rather than they kind of complete thorough and transparent investigation uh that was promised to secretary of state or a ... tale when he visited Riyadh earlier this week and I think one of the questions to be asked is\nThe quick acceptance of the Saudi\nOr explanation by the president or how much of this damage will imitating exercise was directed in Riyadh and how much in Washington because it seems to me like both\nWashington and we were trying to figure out a way to get out of the situation ah as quickly as possible and resume business as usual but we can't have business as usual with a country that murders its own citizens in uh in foreign countries\nHow should the U.S response there may not let let me Ventura possibility cancel that a hundred and ten billion dollar weapons contract\nWhile at the very least I think it will be a writer for the United states to work with its allies are first of all to get a condemnation of the Saudi behavior\nIn the U.N Security council second lead to work with our allies particularly the Brits and the French do supply weapons as well or to the to the Saudis to suspend arms deliveries or at least for the moment until we have a a a\nBetter sense of what's going on I think it's time high time that the United states work together with our allies\nOr to put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen\nTo put pressure on the Saudis to end the indiscriminate bombing in Yemen which by the way is being conducted with weapons that we continue to sell to them or so there is a lot of leverage that we have if we work with our friends and allies around the world to pressure to set the Saudis to change behavior main\nArgument of your book is that the U.S has stepped away from the role of moral leadership or in the world but as President Trump just being realistic because a lot of people on the left as well as the right to say that America has created a lot of problems by trying to put our moral grid on foreign society's\nWell yes the export of democracy to foreign countries on to\nA point of value and that is not the most effective way to do it but there's many other ways in which you can exercise moral leadership first of all by standing up against countries that are treating their citizens in in ... manners and yet\nThis administration and particularly this president seems to be more inclined to accept to Saudi explanation of how a a journalist is killed in in Turkey Mr Putin's denial of it now election interference\nIn our own elections are and then then the intelligence community is a judgment on those kinds of issues\nAnd one would hope that a\nPresident the leader of the three world\nWill be willing to go out publicly and make clear that how countries behave towards their citizens is one of the most important factors in how we decide we deal with them it does not the only factor we have other interests and we want to maintain those interests but at the very least in the\nIn the rhetoric that we are a um a using in our the Foreign Relations we need to hold up the moral value of human rights of democracy and freedom\nSo thirty seconds we have left a it's not just to expressing outrage they're very practical steps that can be taken\nYeah I think there are out but it used to be that the United states would lead to an international coalition to work\nTogether to put sanctions on on the country or in this case I think suspending arms shipments a that would have\nReal leverage over the Saudis the president keeps them talking about the leverage that the Saudis seem to have over us read twenty trillion dollar economy surely we can find ways to put pressure on the south East that do not hurt our economy and that make clear that the kind of behavior we've seemed\nTop two weeks it's unacceptable ... thank you thank you\nSo during for profit is a new you probably remember hatred mercenaries from grade school lessons on America's Revolutionary War that American mercenaries\nWorking for foreign powers that something that they were ... been looking into his investigative reporter for buzzfeed news and joined us in our studios thanks so much for being with us thank you wire us retired special forces which is what you're talking about ... such demand\nFor the last Seventeen years\nSeals special forces\nAnd other parts of the U.S government have excelled at this modern style of warfare at a that sort of counterterrorism specialty they kick indoors they go in and they kill or capture and they've been doing it at a pace that's unprecedented yeah\nYou're right in the article that the number of us special forces has doubled to nearly Seventy thousand now that reflects show of changing the way a lot of wars conducted around the world doesn't it\nThat's right a military targets are used to be thought of as you know air fields um bridges barracks those have been replaced by just the targets are people and we don't often like to use the word assassination button that is what it is\nMhm but your investigation uncovered people we would have to call mercenaries\nI see no there's not many other names for them the N. word definitely works in this case\nNames for them at the N. word it definitely works in this case they were former soldiers hired to do military operations combat targeted killings for the military of a foreign power\nYou open your story for buzzfeed or by talking about the war in Yemen the proxy war being fought there what happened in Aden and twenty Fifteen\n[noise] these special forces a unsealed veterans Navy SEAL veterans'\nDay deployed on a mission to kill the leader of the eight and branch of al Islam\nAnd all this law is that right is a very important political party in Yemen as soon as long as the party but it's not viewed in the wider world as a terrorist group nonetheless the UAE e as we writes hired this company to kill this local political leader the theology\nAnd Saudi Arabia are leading the war in in Yemen against rebels in Yemen and they have us support now you you should get in the story that somebody in this group was a member of the active military\nReservists he was reservists and he was a seal reservist\nHe he was at that level of of command of one of the nation's best most highly trained and he was still you know technically he had his top secret clearance sources told us\nEven when he was doing this very strange unique unprecedented mission as far as we know [noise] I guess I Am among those Americans who who just assumed that that had to be illegal Jewish citizens couldn't do that there are laws that govern whether the U.S whether you as\nIndividuals can service officers can enlist in foreign militaries but it's unclear if there ever enforced and what the penalties really are because of various Supreme Court decisions\nOr you've seen how Americans have served in the French or why I mentioned French foreign legion in the article the Israeli defense forces\nAnd these are numbers on lots of a lot of Americans enlisted in the British Army during world ... short right yeah and these are not you wouldn't call them mercenaries\nBut I I don't know that there's a distinction if you if you can join a foreign military just for the money now and by the way this doesn't apply to people who join ISIS or the Taliban or somebody who fights against the u._s. or or a U.S ally that really is against the law that is ... ... this is a buzzfeed\nStory not an NPR story hasn't been reflected in our reporting we can't vouch for it um it was just an anecdote or a trend right\nIt's an anomaly it's the real key I Believe this is a potentially a trend or oh they're the only ones who've done this are there other countries who try it I'm either either Americans\n... and our other Americans believe you've uncovered yeah right is this happening in in theaters around the world I'm going to keep on looking at it and I've had the honor of interviewing several X. special forces over the years who are working\nAs Secret Service agents or running for office why would they want to continue to risk their lives and do this kind of work\nWell there's several reasons one is a there's a lot of money involved but\nThey also argue they believe this is part of the war on terror but their argument is look the way he is close to the United states the UAE he is doing U.S policy of us has not spoken out against the war in Yemen we fuel airplanes we sell them bombs we saw them guns we train them we can do to train them\nTheir argument is they're doing what the you know basically the U.S U.S foreign policy anyway\nSo they've they suggest you which patriotism is is Aaron ...

addiction can be just about any race\nAnd the rich or is it appeared in the Vermont weekly seven days touched many readers this week it included a photo of a smiling face of metal to blend in with her toddler son Hayden was grinning from Mitch perch on her back that photo shoot a good day from it\nBut she suffered from addictions when she was sixteen years old and production ... party a drug for cold of her life\nShe was in and out of rehab and lost custody of her son metal and limbs and Mir died on October seventh she was Thirty years of age her sister Kato Neal wrote that obituary in joined just know from Vermont Public radio in Berlin to thanks so much for being with us\nThanks for having me\nFirst we're we're sorry thank you what can you tell us about your sister\nMy sister was beautiful and bright she loved to saying how she wanted to be an actress and starring Broadway musical and she really had\nThe voice and I'm later on when she became addicted to drugs and it was this real seesaw where we would see and be with the Matty we knew in loved and then there was the uh Matty who suffer from the disease and who went to really dark places but\nWhen she was clean she was just such a pleasure to be with so spirited great sense of humor she left her son so much\nI don't expect the real answer to this but what happened\nWe've had a long time to run it through our minds you know I I I think when she was a teenager she was experimenting with drugs is a I think a lot of teenagers do is I did\nShe tried an oxycontin which is a highly addictive opiate painkiller I don't think she knew that when she took it she really love the way it made her feel and she continued to take opiates I'm into farm and within a couple of years she started using injecting heroine\nShe tried so many times to get sober and when she was clean I think she was full of hope we were always full of hope for Matty this past summer just a month before she died she was home and we think mostly clean for twelve days and that was just an incredible high we all\nWe're hopeful she was going to go into a program and get some help and you know and then is often the case with addicts it didn't work out and she sort of um\nDisappeared again drug ... more than one program I gathered yeah she tried many [noise]\nWhat made you sure all of this in your aerobics were\nYou know it never really occurred to me not to share Matisse addiction and that part of her life it was so central to who she was as an adult her addiction didn't define her but it did define\nThe way she lift and sit in not include that would not have been an accurate honoring of who she was and we also wanted to\nExtend the hope that we had from ... to people who continue to suffer who are addicted and now I'm we carry that hope for them and our hope also now lives with\nPolicymakers and politicians and the people who can make the change necessary so that these deaths stop happening the president's daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money\n... daughter treated her obituary so let's put our money where our tweets are you know\nWhat do you think or what do you hope would make a difference\nThere are solutions you know medication assisted treatment things like methadone or be pronouncing\nThere's evidence that they work very hard for addicts to get right any doctor in this country can write a prescription for highly addictive opiate painkiller but to prescribe some of the medications to help addicts recover they need to go through an eight hour training they need to get a special waiver\nThere aren't very many of them so it's hard for people suffering from addiction to get those medications that have been proven to help and that's just one thing\nI also think that stigma and shame are huge barrier to recovery for people and that's part of the reason that\nWe wrote about it we didn't expect anyone beyond our community to read it but we wrote about it because we think it needs to be talked about fifty thousand people died last year from opioid related overdoses\nI Want people to know that not even one face of that but so many people with addiction don't resemble the photo that you talked about is Matty with her son and her back in a backpack on her back Matty didn't resemble that photo\nWhen she was in the throes of her youth and so I just want us all to have empathy for people who are suffering from what is a disease\nI understand there's going to be a service traumatic on Sunday there is yeah or were you and your family celebrate her life\nWhile through song of course they'll be performances and we actually have a\nA video of Matty singing a bonding rate songs he's just sitting at the kitchen table is will they share that with people and then you know one of the things that's been so wonderful about that obituary that people have shared story about Matty that we didn't know they also shared stories about their own\nAddiction and recovery and family members and that's been a huge source of support and solidarity for our family right now and I think we'll have more of that kind of sharing on Sunday\nWhat

Trump's referring to the Eighteen arrested related to uh to the fight to the Saudis say resulted in your mouth ... what else did you say on the topic\nWell he he took questions from reporters at a roundtable with defense industry officials at that base he called the show ... unacceptable\nBut also right away scot he pivoted to the contracts the Saudis have with U.S companies like Boeing and General Dynamics and and as Trump's fault seated around the table with him were CEO's from some of those companies the president says there are Saudi contracts for arms and equipment\nWhereas a hundred and ten billion dollars he said he'd be working with Congress to see what the US should do in response bought\nBut I Would prefer that we don't use as retribution cancelling a hundred and ten billion dollars worth of work which means six hundred thousand just\nIt's got just briefly the president uses those numbers often the dollar amount is exaggerated according to ... as the number of jobs analysts say the real number would be just a small fraction of that\nDid the president doesn't say anything ah really about the Saudi explanation that Jamal ... died in some kind of fight\nHe was asked if he found that explanation credible he said he did he called Saudi Arabia a great ally all of this is interesting are given out quickly in the past he has leveled very blunt criticism of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like\nSome of other us allies are closer allies Canada Germany over trade and the like that's not so with the Saudis now\nAll of this comes up its president is campaigning for Republicans in a number of Senate races that are considered too close to call in Montana Arizona he'll be in Nevada later today what does the president talked about how does he present his argument at his rallies\nHe is really trying to get the a C as hard as core supporters to make sure they turn out so he's talking about still the battle to confirm justice Brett Kavanaugh calls Democrats who protested cabinet Kavanaugh in on hinged angry mob and I can tell you the rally crowds love that language\nOr any talks about that that that caravan that large group of refugees mostly from Honduras at currently heading north toward the U.S border in lots of TV coverage of it and the president clearly sees it as a political gift just before the election this is from his rally in Arizona last night\nDemocratic victory in November would be a bright flashing invitation to every trafficker smuggler drug dealer and the illegal alien on the planet come on him come on and\nSo that's the vibe at these rallies in in Trump's orbit even on a day when the news is about the confirmation of the death of a ...\nAnd very John ... thanks very much for being with us thank you Scott [noise]\nWhile President Trump says he wants more information before deciding how to respond to the Saudi explanation of ... death\nSome members of the U.S Congress has called for sanctions on Saudi Arabia the Trump Administration has appeared reluctant to do anything that could jeopardize its close ties with the kingdom NPR's Scott Horsley reports\nIt took the Saudis two and a half weeks to craft their account of ... death and throughout that period the Trump Administration bent over backwards to give the Saudis space this week secretary of state Mike Pompeo paid what was on his face at least a friendly visit to rearm for talks with both the king and crown prince\n... reporters on his return to the U. S. the Saudis are too important a partner to dismiss the relationship overnight\nWherever they long strategic relationship with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia ... is right\nAbout that for decades us

committed to purchase four hundred and fifty million dollars worth of things and a hundred and ten million dollars worth of military [noise] those are the biggest orders of the history of this country\nTrump exaggerates those dollar figures but the Saudis are big spenders especially in the United states the kingdom as pledged forty five billion dollars to help bankroll tech companies like uber than lucid motors Saudi money also flows to American universities such as Harvard in Georgetown and the foreign policy think tanks here in Washington\nEven before the Saudis acknowledged ... death some recipients were trying to distance themselves from the kingdom's money but it's not easy as Rachel Bronson author of the book sicker than oil America's uneasy partnership with Saudi Arabia\nInvest in long term goals they invest in real estate they've been lately investing in a lot of our high tech companies they're investing and institution in me\nOur high tech companies they're investing and institution in art museum they have a lot of money to spread around\nFor decades Bronson says both us and the Saudis encourage those commercials ties as a kind of mutual insurance policy to keep both oil and defense dollars flowing\nDuring the Cold War the two countries teamed up against the Soviet Union and more recently they've partner to fight terrorism although the Saudi record on

ruined his version of Dodgers that for the groove beat the sun's out of LA Dodgers last night's evidence do we turned out of Howard Bryant or ESPN do\nAny of the magazine our thanks so much for me\nYou're not a Howard Bryant or ESPN\nESPN the magazine our thanks so much for being with us in the morning Scott\nHow are you doing I'm fine thanks blue man group brew crew spy on nickname for um how do you like I like that I kind of do they keep coming back all season don't they\nWell they do and this is nice revenge for last year last year because of your your cubs took them out in a fantastic battle but I can tell you that this is what you're supposed to do when you come close and then you have a chance this year you've got a game seven you haven't been to the world series in Nineteen eighty two\nAnd of course the Dodgers have a chance to go to the world series back to back so this is what is better than winner take all game seven National League championship series\nUm and we want to know this week course of the world series is set to open on Tuesday the NBA begins their season\nIn Boston in Boston that's right and if they are they wait exactly yes and a Christian teller they did it as an assistant coach for the Washington Wizards she's also she'll playing in the NBA for their mistakes Mickey Hammon of course has already and assistant coach for the San Antonio spurs\nIs the NBA getting closer to hiring a head coach who happens to be a woman\nYeah I think it's coming and I think it's overdue when they make I Can't wait till it does happen so you can take another\nUnnecessary barrier and and and put it away because I think that the NBA NBA has been the progressive lead the NBA's been the one that has been better on on protests the NBA's been better in terms of having female referees the NBA's been better with my colleague Doris Burke on the broadcast\nAnd so the next step is to have a female head coach and it's really not\nThat big a deal for the rest of us because if you actually live in society we've all had female bosses at some point but in that we do here I Want to note yes [laughter] I Know and in in that sport it's a big deal and in professional sports in the the male dominated game and also let's not forget that that ESPN actually put\nThe you know we have two women on the broadcast now for football you've got Hannah and Hannah Storm in Andrea Kramer\nBoth doing a broadcast as well and so it's it's important in these things have to happen and I'm Glad that that the NBA seems to be the one when it does happen it's um it's it's gonna be good\nWomen's tennis association championship start tomorrow in Singapore But there's going to be a rule change at Wimbledon 'cause they don't want any more of those six hour final ... what do you think of the rule change to go to the er about what what are they going to do it it's the ah highbrow break yeah\nAfter after twelve after twelve twelve then they're going to go to a tie break the way that the way that they do after the U.S open after after the ...\nI don't like it I hate it I think it's terrible I disagree I understand the reason why people do it why they didn't get to a big deal and I I get it I don't like it because I think that imbalance in the game to the land to the giants we know that these players are now seven feet tall is fix eleven or whatever we know they can serve a hundred and forty five miles an hour\nAnd that they it just becomes a serving contest but you have to play defense and if you can't play defense than the game gets shifted toward the tall guys and so we never had this conversation was with when players were were six feet under so my advice to those guys just break\n[laughter] of our think here in San Francisco got their commemorate and fiftieth anniversary of the Mexico City Olympics and of course that's where John Carlos and Tommie Smith raised their fists on the medal podium a thanks very much for being with us Howard oh it was terrific thank you\nAnd the baby of an HIV positive mother in South Africa was suffering from liver failure doctors were confronted with a heroin choice transplant part of the mothers live or to the infant and risk transferring HIV or a child grows\nAnd for at risk ... be or what the child grows sugar and most likely die child received part of her mother's liver and so far there

we are very yeah after the transplant surgery happen now and to see the child the diving driving under the circumstances with this world that case is obviously enormously gratifying and it really makes us feel good about the decision we made\nWell help us understand that decision because you had to wear a lot of different factors didn't [noise]\n[noise] yeah so we knew that there was a really high possibility that three ... we would give this child HIV\nBut the other thing we had to wait is that the child to being on a waiting list for a living donor\nFor three times the average and the child with getting really sick had been admitted to ICU had needed to be ventilated and we were at the point where the question was literally would you rather die or live with HIV\nWhat if the parents children\n[noise] so the parents saying to us\nWhy ... nights where well controlled well HIV positive people we take a medication every day\nWhy wouldn't you consider us so they would say to me that wish from the parents and the mom particularly who was the ... are now that she could be a diner and we had to consider that very casually 'cause we have to make sure that we promotion and Hans the autonomy of our patients as far as possible\nSo it was interesting that in this case it was very much motivated by a request from the very brave sets of parents who wanted to save the lives of their child\n[noise] ... threw juice in this uh this case the more people know about it will love contribute something to lifting the stigma they try to be in so many countries around the world\nI Would like to hype so you know HIV stigma is an extremely complicated thing and it's it's a multifaceted\nSays I from South Africa although we have this very well integrated national aids treatment program HIV is still very stigmatized\nAnd one of the things we would really hope to show through what we've done here is that if you're an HIV positive person and you're on your medication you living in normal life then that should preclude you from being an organ donor\nIt shouldn't stop you for having those options that HIV negative people would have and we hope that by showing that HIV positive people\nCan do this that that would help to reduce the stigma to some extent but this is just one case and it's going to take a lot more than one case to make a serious danger HIV stigma\nThat carried
