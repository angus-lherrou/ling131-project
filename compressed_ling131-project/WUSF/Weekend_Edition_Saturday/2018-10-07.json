Molly bumped she's a political analyst and time magazine's national political correspondent he Molly Hi\nUh so the Republicans and the president are trying to portray the Democrats and sort of a weapon I think the me too movement for political gain and on the left many see the Republican Party now as the party of sexual assault supporters with Roy Moore in Alabama President Trump on tape saying he has sexually\nSold supporters with Roy Moore in Alabama President Trump on tape saying he has sexually assaulted women and now ... sitting that Supreme Court justice where does this leave the country\nLike a week ago when a Senator Jeff flake made his extraordinary stand a stalling the nomination for a week in order to let the FBI investigate what he said was this is raping our country apart\nAnd that is really how it has felt that ... the whole episode has been sort of an ice pick into our nations rise wounds if that's not to grow to use an analogy\nI thought you know I think people were already angry\nBut the outpouring of anger that you saw over this nomination triggered by the nomination I think signifies just how unsettled\nA lot of these questions are and how emotionally are for so many people as you said on on on both sides uh uh uh left that was already I quite exercised particularly ... particularly women\nAnd I on the on the right you know you had Republicans who might have been feeling discouraged at the relative inaction of the Congress or the Republicans were on the ballot this year their inability to give the president some of the things that he has wanted to accomplish\nAnd this is sort of a shot in the arm to them or as you said a big win for the rest of\nThe midterm elections are less than a month away and President Trump has this a victory to brag about along with the lowest unemployment numbers and fifty years of for weeks we've been hearing a predictions of a blue wave but our polling shows that the gap is closing is the wind up the president's back now and the Republicans do\n[noise] I think I have no idea frankly [laughter] just close to an election it's it's hard to tell what signal and what his noise whether you're talking about polling are just sort of the national\nSentiment all the signs have been pointing in the direction of a very strong year for the Democrats you do have Republican seeing this as a potential\nA last minute surge for them uh but it is still a month away and that is frankly still a lot of time for things to move around\nI ... and the trajectory is still rather remarkably as you said at the statistics are very good for the party in power\nUsually a president with this kind of economic strength is pulling quite high and yet the president is quite unpopular and that has rubbed

boost to McConnell told the Washington Post\nThe whole thing was a great political gift thinking what he called the mob going after Kavanaugh\nFor energizing Republicans for the first time this cycle for about a month left to election day the big question now is which party voters will still be angry about the confirmation when they're casting ballots Scott Detrow NPR News the Capitol\nAnd we're joined now by NPR legal affairs correspondent Nina Totenberg to talk about what she expects to see from justice Kavanaugh and the Supreme Court in the months ahead Hi Nina\nHi Lulu this has been such a bitter fight and the Supreme Court takes pains to portray itself as a non partisan body um how do you think he will be received by his new colleagues\nWell I think they'll all suck it up hill suck it up they'll suck it up and they'll all try to get along and put on a good show for the public and for each other after all they are going to live with each other for all practical purposes for the rest of their lives I like to refer to this is a marriage of nine with no divorce court [noise]\nAnd if you want to get anything done if you want to do what the constitution says you're supposed to do and\nGet along with each other while you do it then you have to figure out a way to make it work let me let me ask you have any of the justices said anything publicly about this not per se but Justice Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan we're at Princeton on friday\nAnd asked about the whole notion of partisanship and the court here's what Justice Kagan said\nIt's been a credibly important thing for the court to guard is this reputation of being fair and impartial of being neutral and of not being simply an extension of that terribly polarized political process and environment than we left that\nUm this is not only divided Congress it's divided the country and it it is now all centered all eyes are on the Supreme Court\nWell I guess it's somewhat fortunate that the only thing you see at the Supreme Court is the oral argument and the announcement of opinions\nAnd I suspect that the court will try to keep a relatively low profile for the short term for the future this term maybe even next term\nFrom for example future this term maybe even next term sometimes you can't have a avoid getting sucked into very big controversies there is for example right now a case pending before the court testing the question of whether\nThe employment section of the federal civil rights laws barring discrimination based on sex covers\nGay and lesbian employees\nJust as Kevin over places Justice Anthony Kennedy who had been the court swing vote a when Kennedy announced his retirement June you called at the end of the world as we know it uh so what does the court's new worlds look like I'm closely\nContested cases you will see a court that is more conservative than we've seen in this country probably four Seventy years or so\nAnd that has consequences way beyond abortion and gay rights and even gun rights it has consequences for employment rights for the environment\nFor the ability of the federal government to regulate for the way the power is allocated in the federal government

immigrant family\nAnd then adopted by a white couple when she was an infant her parents always described her adoption as a kind of divine Providence\nHow it was attributed to God or to state you know if it were meant to be made it harder for me to question um the mythology of our family and how it came to be because the story was all I knew and it was so important to all of us\nAs an adult ... did start to ask questions and a new memoir all you can ever know she writes about her search for her birth family and her Korean identity growing up in a mostly white town Oregon she says her parents didn't really talk about race\nI think it was something that my family didn't know how to incorporate into like our our family life our discussions they had really been told\nAt the time that they adopted me by the judge to finalize the adoption and by the social worker and by the adoption attorney that\nThe my race with a relevant the word that the judge used was assimilate she chose was one of them and and not really acknowledge the fact that you are you're of a different race right I mean I think that was sort of the prevailing thought in trans racial adoption at the time and so I think they were given this advice by people they viewed as experts\nAre so to then it made perfect sense that it's kind of ignore it and I think they really thought because it didn't matter to them you know it shouldn't matter to anybody else\nHow's that different what what is it challenges you faced because of that because you couldn't share your experience of of being basically bullied and you know having racism levied at you with your parents\nFirst of all I wouldn't have occurred to me just say this is racism even um despite those things that were happening were definitely racism like there were slurs and there were pulled back eyes and there were like sing song chance\nAnd beyond that you know there was this additional layer of separation between my experience as a Korean American and my parents experience as white Americans I really remember feeling as though I Can't tell them like it will hurt them I have to protect them from this knowledge\nAnd from Adam and health Florida

ratcheted up regional tensions the Saudis have strongly denied the allegations NPR's Peter Kenyon joins us from Istanbul now to sort through the story I'm good morning Hi Lulu\nIt's a very confusing tale um talk us through what do we know\nWell we know Jamal to show the walked into the Saudi constantly Tuesday around one in the afternoon he needed some paperwork relating to offending marriage to his Turkish fiance a she waited for him outside holding his phone until well after the consulate closed as says he never came out\nTurkish police opened an investigation and then came the surprising reports first by unnamed Turkish officials now on the record but an advisor to president wretch of type ... on that investigators believe the show he was killed in the consulate are aired on says he said that the journalist disappearance but not much more than that so far\nAnd we haven't seen any evidence to back up this claim that the show he is dead just a persistent question if he's still alive where Izzie\n... what is the Saudis and saying well the Saudis are\nStill alive where Izzie ... what is the Saudis and saying well\nThe Saudis are basically denying everything except the fact that they show you did come into the constantly Tuesday Afternoon or the Saudi press agency quotes officials saying he left the consulate\nSaudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman told Bloomberg News they're very keen to know what happened to him or there's no evidence on the Saudis side whoever to show that show you actually did leave the consulate\nThe consul general invited Reuters reporters in showed them around there was no sign of showed me he said the constitution has multiple exits but why would they show the lead by another exit if he knew his fiance was waiting out front\nSo lots of questions do this advisory to president air to one that seems convinced to plane loads of Saudis who arrived in this stumble on Tuesday the same day could show you went into the consulate were somehow involved he also says he doesn't believe the Saudi claims that there is no camera footage of the show again\nInside or leaving the cops\nAlright two questions and the first one is um why is this important what does this mean for Saudi relations with turkey and with other world powers\nWell it could be very important but a lot will depend on what we learn from here on about the show veep disappearance what happened to him that seems likely to be further blow to Saudi turkey ties are relations were already strained Turkey's been siding with another Persian Gulf states Qatar and a bitter dispute with the Saudis\nAre some are wondering what the American response was going to be a ... an important ally to the U.S does turkey has so far officials have said only they're aware and following the situation closely so if there is any pressure from the Trump Administration it it's not happening in public\nEye and why would show the likely have been on someone's list them and why is he someone that is of interest\nWell that is a very good question to show his writings have sometimes been critical of ground prince Mohammed bin Salman but not in any particularly radical way ah he
