life if all I'd really known as far as religion goes I I Believe and most of what I was taught growing up um it always resonated with me the messages that they present to the congregation I think that having a faith has made me a better person\nAnd I think it has not effect on a lot of people\nHow did you feel when you found out there's some are about the abuse of children that was going on in Pennsylvania ... not far from places you knew\nIt hurt reading the report [noise] because I was reading about these ... that I went to growing up I was born in Ninety six so growing up you would hear kids joke about oh you know priest molesting kids and what not but I never knew that there was actually a anything behind that I just sort of thought it was people making fun of her religion\nAnd then

were occurring under their care [noise] do you still believe in God are you a faithful person I Am\nAnd that's what I've been struggling with\nBecause of the Catholic Church is is all I ever\nWas

it's not a simple question is it\nOh not at all not at I look forward to it that my mother is incredible model and like most Americans she just had\nA rough patch and she was not comfortable talking about a lot of those rough patches she had me when she was a sophomore at Jackson State university\nAnd she got a job teaching at Jackson State maybe four or five years later after she started graduate school so we moved to Jackson probably in Nineteen Seventy nine Nineteen eighty\nAnd Jackson was home and books were really home for me she just made me read and write 'em before I could do anything I Want it to my entire life I think her from a rider we practice that I still have now\nBut that right only practice also enabled me to write into a lot of the gaps and a lot of the terror that I think she probably did not want me to write into [noise]\nAnd we do have to get to that don't we\nAnswer to the outside world your mother or a progression of voice but what was going on inside the family\nUm my mother was dealing with a lot of what black when we're dealing with in Jackson, Mississippi so from the outside it looked like she was doing really well she was on television local television during a political prognostications um she was in an abusive relationship she did not make much money she was dealing with\nWhat I Would call like shards of abuse and you know and I was around on a chain\nShe started to 'em with me when I didn't do right and she would always say she was looking at me because when I was faced with police are white people would be even a harsher and those beatings just I think started to give progressive Lee worse\nAnd I think that the beating my mother was taken from life from our town and her partner also started to get progressive way worse and I think the scariest part about it looking back is that we just didn't know how to talk about any of we didn't know how to talk about what we were doing one another and we didn't really know how to talk about what the world and our state was doing a ...\nAs the very title suggests that the cost of trauma including for example the baby in June ... from your mother the ... that she endured\nAll of that takes a toll on our bodies what happened to you\nOf the things that I was going to say I'm not trying to make a causal relationship saying that because of this traumatic thing cause just dramatic thing but I Will say\nLayers of particular kinds of abuse really personal and structural I thing led to me eating way more than I should have I was a very very big it luckily I was a big athletic kid so I didn't have\nTo deal with a lot of the bully and then a lot of other big kids had to deal with and I definitely didn't have to deal with the bully and a lot of really big women's had to deal with and I just eight eight eight as a way of hiding\n'em ending eventually I started to start as a way of attempt in ...\nUm [noise] and individually I started to start as a way of attempt in the hot and symptom to disappear\nYeah in the book you kind of there between a which sounds to me like obesity and anorexia I mean you were running like six hours a day or something\nRight now the running was terrible I run two hours in a more than two hours a night and I play a lot of basketball in the day and I think that could have been sustainable but the problem was that was only eating a meal once every three days\nAnd there's a sort of strange euphoria that comes with a lot of times that starvation and I just kept thinking like if I can just push my body and pushing my body and pushing my body I could disappear and at that point you know I had lots of running as police it kicked out of college so I I wanted to disappear and I thought if I could just make my body smaller\nLike I Would be okay with people when they see me as such a threat and I kept that up for like Thirteen Years so my body broke\nYeah then we got to get the gambling how did that Andrew your life\nOh man I'm by the time my body broke my body literally wrote from overused ... wrote from not sleep and it broke from not eating the only thing I turn to that brought me I'm sort of feeling was gambling and so every since then I may from a particular date\nUntil another date probably for like six years went to a casino and\nIt was hard to write about that harder to write about that and it was to write about different forms of abuse that I talked about in the book\nBecause you are implicated in this in a way you're the victim in one and you're there in a sense the perpetrator and the gambling\nWell I'm definitely in a perpetrator but in my family you know I think because I Am from Mississippi so much of Mississippi black labor has been taken from us I think there's a shame when we show people and tell people that the money that we are able to make\nWe are unable to cheap right and especially if it's if it's tied to a kind of like mental illness so I started to understand halfway through\nMy gambling addiction and I wasn't going to the casino to win the lotto myself that's exactly what I was going to do I will go into creatively lose as much as possible I wanted to drive back home next to ours feeling absolutely\nLike trash and I just think that's something that I never really understood\nMy mother or anybody else in my family experienced in but I Know they were and that's actually do the hardest thing to talk about with my family we can talk about the physical addiction we can talk about if we can talk about the physical abuse the addiction the gambling on both sides of my family is something that we still can't really honestly talk about\nI don't want to give away how your story seems to resolve itself toward the end but I I think a lot of people would ask you why do you even talk to your mother now why do you care what she thinks\nOh I Love my mother to death and I'm a writer and I'm a I'm a I'm a black American writer and I would not be a writer or read or a teacher and my mother and not love me enough to instill\nA practice at an early age and this book in some way is like her investment on coming full circle she really believe\nThat reading and writing can say and I don't know if that's true but I Know I'm a writer a norm in American reader and I wanted to use my words to try to talk to her and tried to tell her that we can be better we can be better if we give ourselves a chance to walk honestly together and that's that's what I tried to do with this boat\nHere say lamb and his book heavy an American memoir thanks so much for being

registration applications to other government databases to basically works like this right you have\nThere's just like one letter off on your application maybe is missing a hyphen or there's like a misspelling maybe a a poll or a an election worker inputs the information wrong if something like that happens\nThen the application it's frozen and people are not put on the voter registration list but I Want to make something really clear and all of this if the application is flagged if it goes on the pending list you can still vote I you can clear up the problem by going to the polling place with your photo ID\nAnd then you can still load I mean that's the ... that's the bottom line civil rights groups though are saying well that's not enough you know this is going to create longer lines confusion and it could discourage people from voting yeah\nAnd of course will underscore this at a time when there's when there's concern about uh not just conventional ... vote fraud as we've noted

ended up ending the policy but then earlier this year Republicans in the ... the Republican controlled state legislature passed a law\nThat was basically the policy so now it's not just a policy

behalf of those who cannot boosting turnout for people of color is really key to her campaign strategy\nI'm On the other side Kemp campaign says this is just a manufactured crisis but for both
