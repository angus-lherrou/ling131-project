Navarro Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman has been under fire\nSince the Washington Post columnist was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul that's my mommy is an expert on Middle East affairs and she joins us now to talk about how the Saudi crisis is playing out across the region thanks for being with us\nMy printer or the development of this story playing out in the middle east or is it proving to be a loyalty tested the kingdom or is there any opposition in the region\nAnd governments are certainly a crowded into a display their loyalty at many of them it shrinks statement supporting a both Saudi Arabia and ah and king self and\nCourse that the public as a whole different story I think there there's a lot of\nA lot of fear a lot of worry that the people who are activists journalists dissidents um and those who may be speaking their opinion and they in fact to be threatened now are there is a real great chill I think in the air amongst those members of civil society\nAnd you're trying to figure out Turkey's role here we wouldn't know what happened to um the Washington Post columnist or without their intelligence services leaking the information it's also a major player in the middle east and American ally though far from a robust democracy how is this affecting Turkey's role in the region\nWell they've been very interesting I think and they've been very Calcutta the terms of how they released information\nReally to extract as much I think ... possible particularly with the Saudis and I would say that they played it very smart or they are looked like the hero and the story a ironically they have\nYou know forty thousand people in prison and many of them are are journalists as well and activists that I'd rather that so there clearly not a good beacon of liberal democracy and the region but they've been able to play this role of of basically defending or you know uh there's one ... and of course uh\nAh you know uh there's one ... and of course uh it really struck thing I think an important important important price or from the studies which has yet to be determined I Believe\nI I mean that's the bigger question I mean what what is in it for turkey ah what what what game are they playing I mean why expose Jamal ... a murder in this way\nQuite simply they they want some sort of economic relief they're facing an impending economic crisis they have an enormous amount of a dollar denominated that\nUh they need they need hard currency they'd foreign exchange the native investment they need investment opportunities and that's all something that Saudi Arabia and much of the Gulf countries can provide it can't be provided by Europe it can't be provided by\nOther allies or what we're allies and so it doesn't want to go to the IMF article I was very clear about that and so it really depends on now countries with with with liquidity\nUh and and just briefly are we only have about thirty seconds left we can't talk about Saudi Arabia without mentioning Iran or how do you see this balance of power playing out\nWell in many ways it's kind of strengthening Iran but more importantly I think it's going to make it very difficult [noise]\nUh I Believe for uh the u._s. government who wants to sanctions next week and continue to ratchet up the pressure on Iran when in fact Saudi Arabia looks like a much more menacing actor in the region\nThat was that's not my money political scientist at the University of Waterloo in Ontario thank you so much\nThank you\nOn September twenty six twenty four teams students from a teacher training school in rural southern Mexico commandeer some buses their ultimate destination was Mexico City for a demonstration but those buses never arrived and forty three of the students went missing along the way and we are presumed killed in and around the town of water\nAlthough there remains have never been found their deaths were very deeply blamed on corrupt local political and police officials as well as higher ups in the Mexican military and the government and of course the drug gangs\nThe aftermath sent Mexico into a political crisis summit shifting explanations and inconclusive investigations\nNow Mexican journalist and I've been hadn't and this was published and exhaustive look into the events of that night her book is called a massacre in Mexico the true story behind the missing forty three students she told us the official version of the events was a fabrication\nIn these official version they Mexican Government said that the army and they put that up all these maybe didn't know anything about what was happening\nAnd they just get not these two or three hours after everything ends species that we just start eat what I had been known these years four years\nOf the investigation is that all the official they're showing you sound like it's not it's a lie\nSo tell us what you uncovered I mean the big question is of course who attacked these students and why they were attacked\nWhat I discovered was that the army and the ... not just where not about why do I stop eating that night every minute so they knew the federal government and the police not just nice even more\nI had reports OSU shirt reports that proves that the army and if it up well he's way chasing the students scenes they laughed at school I mean the I was before that that so the federal police and the army were chasing the students how would the students killed\n[noise] well that students arrive near while they're the army the police they state police were waiting for\nThe army the police they state police were waiting for them then that students decide to move to Boston where they were transferred dating insight to the CD\n[noise] to be able to take the more buses mhm they'll get the west take more buses to go to the protest to Mexico City\nSo they went to the station\nThey do do that you both us and when the students were trying to escape ... bosses from the ... when the army the police\nThen when you see by police and the staple east they start to shoot I gained the buses to stop them mhm they they're all at the end of that back to bust us\nFrom these two buses disappeared or they're forty three students so\nThe federal police opened fire people were wounded injured and and two of the buses I'm to the people that were on those buses the students are on the buses disappeared [noise] why were they targeting this group of students why would the federal police and the army get involved in this\nThese wise I think the most difficult part of my investigation um if the students were traveling inside boss is that that it did was just too\nI'm not so these two versus\nWhat exactly that two votes is that the army and they said that police it starts to monitor it\nSeems to have a worse before I mean these two bosses would that do both states where the students were traveling from their school to why why so when I was able to have found\nIs that in these two buses where a inside the nest secret parts of the of the boss secret compartment as harrowing to millions of harrowing ... million dollars worth of heroin they didn't know the students the ...\nFor the army and if the police they knew it\nSo these students were almost victims of circumstance they had they had taken income and dear to buses that were being used by drug dealers to transport drugs and they didn't know what these guys that are really tragic accident they didn't know\nHow you know that heroin was hitting on that bus [noise]\nI was able to connect with one drug lord important drug lord I was able to contact with one person that works for him and glass these ah informant and inside the cartels that and explain me death ... [noise]\nDo we know who ordered the crime I mean that's been over a hundred arrests in this case do we know who actually said you know targeted these students in order to this to happen\nAccording with my investigation that there's a responsible of these crime wise that twenty seven battalion anyone\nIn particular the corner and then died received a phone call from that there'll be are\nOrdinary him you have to rescue my drugs I pay you for deep space you have I don't know I Know what you have to do I want my drugs back\nThe spectrum ... nine for cash for Denise it won't be quite as hot today hides in the mid eighties just a slight chance of shower\nOn trial smarter with these headlines President Trump says she will be talking to was Saudi crown\nPrince Mohammed bin Salman speaking last night after a campaign rally in Nevada\nTrump said he needs to learn more about the killing of Saudi journalist ...

I Try and keep that in other countries\nWould have to agree to during that said it said if a big asking this amount of time reading\nThat's the b._b._c. Charlotte Gallagher and London thank you so much\n\nIn a little more than two weeks voters will decide thirty three Senate races all four hundred and thirty five U.S House seats and some six thousand state legislative contests there's more at stake in the state house races and purely local concerns\nAnd that saying something coming from someone who has such strong opinions about my local trash schedule I'm joined now by read Wilson national correspondent for the hill welcome thanks for having me\nAll right let's talk general trends we've heard the president and his predictions of a red wave or what are you seeing state to state\nWell it is almost certain the Democrats are going to pick up quite a large number of state legislative seats\nAnd that's because Republicans own so many seats to begin with but if there was some kind of blue wave that develops if President Trump for turns out to be a drag on the Republican ticket it's going to impact the state legislative seats even more because the average person doesn't know a lot about who their state representative or their state senator may be and those candidates\nDon't have the millions of dollars to run that say somebody running for US Senate seat or U.S House seat might have\nSaid they're just going to maybe vote just on the party line as opposed to the individual candidates\nState legislative seats tend to be more susceptible to national waves then ... seats at any other level\nLet's talk about two states where Democrats are hoping to take control that's Michigan in Wisconsin a two states are really important and twenty sixteen on the presidential level what's driving those races\nIn a lot of cases it's purely local concerns Democrats are talking about things like roads of the roads are very bad in parts of Wisconsin parts of Michigan and they are there we go and and Democrats say that it's effectively an extra road tax because you've got to spend the money to fix her car when it bumps into a particularly bad bottle\nAnd if the situation will reverse would Republicans be hammering the same issue\nYeah I think all of these candidates try to make the races as local as possible to insulate themselves from the national wave and the two states that you mentioned Michigan in Wisconsin have been under complete Republican control for the last eight years so Democrats in both of those states saying that the Republican governors and the Republican state legislatures just having spent the money to fix the roads\nSo let's look at Connecticut Democrats there have majorities in both chambers but there are slim margins and they're Republicans are hoping to score a flip and one or both what's his story\nIn Connecticut they're talking about the budget Connecticut has huge pension liabilities and it's something that they have attacked the incumbent outgoing governor about and the Democratic majorities in both the state Senate which is tied actually the the democratic lieutenant governor breaks that tie and the state house\nBut if this becomes a national election it's hard to see how Republicans pick up any seats even in the state that didn't as much trouble as Connecticut because again those national times just can overwhelm everything yet\nBut taxes are a big issue there to taxes are a huge issue and Republicans are talking about how the Democratic tax increases have traced a lot of uh Connecticut residents wave that's a common theme that I think we hear in a lot of democratic run states the taxes are simply too high\nThere's something pivotal at stake here though um other than these local concerns which is a redistricting because of course these state legislatures draw congressional district lines and the census it's coming up and twenty twenty\nSo a lot of the ... the state legislators were elected this year are going to be around for the redistricting process that begins with the twenty twenty sensors that will happen before the twenty twenty two elections Democrats were caught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans\nCaught on the short side or after the ... election a big way for Republicans when they found themselves on the outs in a lot of the states where state legislatures draw the line now if they can win back some of these chambers some of these governorships there'll be able to draw lines that are more favorable to them I mean the long story short here is that elections that happened in two weeks\nAre going to have ramifications on the control of the U.S house of representatives for the next ten years\nWe'd Wilson national correspondent for the health thank you so much thank you\nForty five years ago this Sunday Morning America was waking up to the news of Richard Nixon Saturday Night

station\n\nThis weekend edition from NPR News I'm due to Garcia Navarro head of the mid term elections we are taking a look at what is often called identity politics and how the groups we come from affect our point of view\nThe way politicians expressed or suppressed their identities has come up this campaign season just look at Texas and a campaign jingle Texas Senator Ted Cruz went after Hispanic nickname his rival Beto O'Rourke\nName his rival down over our heads on you for\n\nHaving scape scrutiny here from preschool now on CNN\nYour name is Raphael you know you go by Ted that's an angle sized version of it he went the other way\nAnd just this week Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren who President Trump has derided for cleaning native heritage managed to upset detractors and supporters\nSay the leaders of the Cherokee Nation are speaking out against Senator Elizabeth Warren campaign video touting her Native American ancestry courtesy of a newly revealed DNA test\nThe tribe Kwame Anthony Appiah is a professor of philosophy at NYU he's written a book about how identity informs our politics but also polarizing shit we reached him earlier this week and asked him to explain\nWe use identity sometimes in a in a very good way to use our justice for example use our American\nIdentity to emerge about us to do things together but I think that we can only started to entertain recon bring identity getting them and they don't do much good\nAnd also I think when we do bring them and were inclined to suppose that they do more work and they actually do because you know women are very different from each other black people are very different from each other white people have different from each other\nSo that the idea that you fix a lot by saying that somebody is one of those identities is misleading best\nStill matters in the world whether you're a man or woman or black or white and so on but I think we can take 'em too seriously and then many political context I'm\nThe most important thing in that that is to say it may be that the most important thing for them but it's not very should be able to get kids health care even if they have pre existing conditions and it may be that the candidate who is best for that necessarily the cameras and his best few went underground so you have to balance it out\n[noise] what is the role of identity in politics I mean how should politicians approach in and talk about it without either alienating or collapsing\nI think they need I I Would say I mean I should answer the question directly gingerly castle I I think you you can easily go wrong here I mean one of the things that the president is currently during\nIs mobilizing identities in a very divisive way and that brings down the terrible road because once you've created as a racial divisions\nIt takes an awful lot of effort to build wins and um it's a temptation for politicians all around the world and and you know we'll through the ... century they're drawing people together or through making them feel ashamed of hostilities or some other and in our country right now\nI'm afraid that's true about one of the most important kinds of identity which is political identities right now\nThe labels conservative and liberal are associated with sort of tribal ceilings and a very intense kind it makes the country increasingly difficult to govern that means that every time\nSomebody of one identity wins everybody or the other identity thinks of themselves as having lost something profound and that means you lose the sense that they're not election reserved and then whoever wins or we sort of gather behind in order that they should run the country\nCan send to you I mean I'm hearing a real concern and identity and and the politics rented it has been weaponized and it certainly\nKnow I think I think it is learning I mean look the fact is\nIn our country today is that we're more defined these around identities and we are around policies so that if we just stopped using our identity divides we could probably come to reasonable consensus on a whole bunch of things or immigration abortion there's a whole bunch of things to do so to sensible middle ground\nBut it's not available to us because the people who are most in ...\nBut it's not available to us because the people who are immersed in goes in a bunker think every concession coming together but losing\nLosing the other side\nBut in order to get voters politicians have to appeal to a certain identity because it's it's about making sure that your base to satisfy making sure that your base will turn out to the polls making sure that they are excited about the issues that are there and and that you feel like you're a part of a common caught\nBy the question is whether you're going to do that we're both in your cold running for tonight and I think your term I think you can talk for example more about the actual policy\nDemocracy needs are
