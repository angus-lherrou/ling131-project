and the scene of yesterday's attack without quote on quote the morning\nThe morning and what are you seeing there\nAre a squirrel hill is Jewish suburb of uh Pittsburgh it's a really nice sort of big houses and tree lined street predominantly Jewish but there are a lot of different synagogues\nOr the tree of life where this massacre happened had three different congregations that met there and and people say even if it wasn't their synagogue wrote you know you've been there for someone's baby naming were about ... fun everyone assumes that they're going to be knowing someone who was directly affected by this\nRight what are they saying about what happened\nI mean there are a lot of use and everyone I think it's still pretty numb and shocked but somehow in a way not surprised that I'd Jews

Pittsburgh said when the named her released its gonna tear everyone's heart out and and so in in less ah people were inside and have sort of direct first hand knowledge of this\nOr they're waiting on just like we are to find out who was inside now uh we understand that there were no children killed inside or some of the wounded include included a a police officers and a and to a seniors\nBut when these names come out and people are going to find out and and even if there were no children everyone there with someone's child and there were someone's mother or father siblings and friends in the

take a look at this moment when things are feeling frankly scary the shooting in Pittsburgh the suspicious packages center critics of President Trump\nSo let's take a breath for a moment and take stock are we getting getting it as an understanding or we all as Americans aware of how this moment in history is affecting us and the effect we're having on the events happening around us\nHow are we talking to each other and what are we listening to and what is it doing to assault\nOne big factor in that is language and rhetoric thing also about the way the caravan of migrants being discussed\nOr we'll Schachter teaches sociology at Washington University in St Louis and she's been looking at how language impacts our perceptions of immigrants and calendar conspire is the executive director of the national Institute for civil discourse and we begin with her\nShe says she sees a direct line between a politician's words and bombs in the mail\nWant to look back actually to the twenty sixteen presidential campaign that were in that campaign we saw the rhetoric green used to attack certain populations in the country Muslims African Americans women disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks fall\nAnd swim and disabled reporters we actually saw physical attacks following the kind of ... rhetoric that we're now seeing again going into the elections now we came back from the precipice turning the presidential campaign [noise] but now here we're at the precipice again and it's a\nSimilar line between rhetoric and the attack on the congressional baseball practice because that men with targeting Republicans and was enraged about\nThe geo peas position on health care [noise]\nDefinitely and the Institute that I lead was created at the University of Arizona after the same kind of attack on Gabby Giffords there was a clear assassination attack after the very tough twenty ten election where the hot issue is the Affordable CARE Act\nSo we've now seen three instances in which elected officials are targeted physically after a period of ... political rhetoric [noise]\nThere is a long history of political invective as you rightly point to um harsh sometimes hateful speech I'm stretching back even to the founders uh we've had moments of turmoil and thinking of you know white supremacists in the Nineteen sixties the weather underground in the seventies [noise] what sets this moment apart in your view\n[noise] the phenomena are we seeing post twenty sixteen hasn't been seen in modern political history\nWhich is once the election was over\nPeople ordinary people Americans who voted for Trump continued to demonize them hate Hillary voters and vice versa and that's still going on today two years later the national Institute of actually had calls from major U.S corporations we're product innovation teams\nThat have not come back to the same level of productivity since the ... this is a very different phenomena it's like a virus in our society that is different and new\nI ... I Want to turn to you now I'm the Kevin Central Americans many of them seeking asylum has been in the news is you know um you have actually researched how language informed social discussions and perceptions\nAre in the context of immigration so you are looking at how the way we discuss certain groups the way this political language gets processed by people actually has a real effect\nOn how we as individuals view an entire group of people absolutely\nYeah so in in one recent study with Renee floors do the does the object at the University of Chicago we found that white American overwhelmingly since the undocumented immigrants with criminality\nAnd of course this is actually unfounded all the research points to the exact opposite but when the president of the United states is constantly tweeting about the many criminals and terrorists and rape is coming from Mexico and Central America\nIt's not hard to guess what is driving the stereotype\nI think one of the most interesting things that your study shows is that people who are anti Trump in general also absorbed this language and associated undocumented immigrants with criminality\nYeah we were really surprised by that finding um and we actually we ... we hypothesized that we would find something different that you know we have we are living in these um echo chamber of whoever can remain very different news and media and we thought that that would be reflected in the tension ideas and stereotypes that that a liberal versus conservative it's held and yet\n\nI'm we're wrong with these headlines a forty six year old man is in custody facing twenty nine charges after a mass shooting at a synagogue yesterday [noise] eleven people were killed and six others were wounded including for police officers\n... reportedly had no criminal record but had posted anti Semitic posts on line President Trump has ordered flags that federal buildings throughout the country flown at half staff to show respect for the dead he also condemned what he called an evil anti Semitic act\nAnd in baseball the red Sox beat the Dodgers nine to sex and the fourth game of the world series last night Boston now leads the best of seven series three games to one game five is tonight in Los Angeles I'm nor rom NPR News in Washington\n[noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from battle European made language learning program Bible teaches practical conversation in Spanish French German and other languages available in the app store or\nOnline at B.

opioid addiction are the most urgent health problems facing their communities that's according to a new poll by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health\nNow one county in western Washington is taking a unique approach to tackle the problem and a boy clue why rocket why rock of finding fixes podcast reports how that works\nBack when ... was the police chief of stand would Washington population seven thousand people he thought rural communities like his were immune from the opioid crisis until one day a mother walked through his door\nAnd basically said gee if you have a heroin problem in your community and I I remember thinking well it's not possible to stand would than heroin is in big cities you know was homeless population does not in rural America\nFor decades heroin was a big city problem\nBut no longer in the recent NPR poll about half of rural Americans said the opioid problem in their communities has worsened in the last five years now ... agrees a few years ago he was elected sheriff of ... county he toward the jails and saw that is\nVery very sick very very sick people because you're talking from heroin is like having the worst possible stomach virus you can help people were burned out there you know they're just they're just suffering\nThe county jail had become a de facto detox center at any given time around half the inmates were withdrawing from heroin it was a dangerous and expensive situation\nIt took becoming the sheriffs to see the impacts inside the jail with heroin abuse to see the impacts on the community across the entire county for me to realize that we had we had to change a lot about what we're doing\nSo they did last year ... county where I stand with is located declared the opioid epidemic a life threatening emergency now they're responding to the opioid epidemic as if it were a natural disaster\nThe same way they'd mobilized to respond to a landslide or flu pandemic now how much county is the first county in the country to treat it this way [noise] the idea\nGrew out of their experience with another tremendous disaster in\nThe county [noise]\nTwenty fourteen the town

other all the same objective which is life safety\nCoordination life safety what they used that system of everyone working together across government agencies to tackle the opioid epidemic county leader took the idea and ran with it is\nNow\nAnd ran with it is now the response to the opioid epidemic is run out of a special emergency operations center\nA lot like during the Oso landslide every two weeks representatives from across local government meet people in charge of everything from fire trucks to the dump\nThe technical name for this group is the multi agency coordination group or Mac group it come straight out of the ms emergency response playful six ten is completed they talk to your PowerPoint slides think sounds like fire is kind of the numbers\nWere sort of items on there to do list there are seven big goals like reduced opioid misuse and reduce damage to the community\nEach goal is broken down into smaller pieces\nLike distributing needle cleanup cats and a project to train schoolteachers to recognize trauma in addiction\nThis to do list is over one hundred items long some of these goals are really long term I mean they're going to take years decades I or ten is also the spokesperson for this group she says the key is to be realistic\nSo she's southern objective for yourself to just end the opioid epidemic you're probably never going to be successful in in either in any of our lifetimes 'em by breaking it down like eating an elephant you can eat one piece at a time breaking it down into a piece that you can actually digest\nThey make transportation easier for people in drug treatment they train family members and others in the community an steps to reduce overdoses with medicine and they actually send teams of police officers and social workers

McCammon\nWe'll be joining the press conference live when it begins but first NPR's Sarah McCammon is here to discuss the case with us she is in ... in Pittsburgh good morning highly the [noise] uh we're waiting to hear from officials oh what do we know so far about the victims well what we know is that a\nLead and people were killed at the tree of life synagogue here in Pittsburgh yesterday morning we've been told and none of them were children um and also that six people were injured including several police officers the names of the dead are expected to be released very soon and we should know more about the people who were killed as the day goes by\nOf course the next step is funerals and memorial services I Will be hearing more about those in the days to come as well\nYeah this alleged shooter has been arrested and charged or what do we know about the motive for this crime well\nIt is being investigated as a hate crime it took place of course had a synagogue or the alleged shooter is forty six years old had expressed anti Semitic an anti immigrant views on social media\nAnd he was taken into custody at the scene yesterday is facing twenty nine federal charges and the deaths of those eleven people and authorities are continuing to look into the motives how it happened why it happened\nAnd what else do we know about how the attack happened\nWell authorities say the shooter was at the synagogue for about twenty minutes yesterday morning this was a an as a religious service was expected to begin um he was armed with an assault style rifles were told as well as three hand guns\nAre engaged with an officer at the scene and again several officers were said to have been shot 'em and and he was taken into custody at the scene\n[noise] put this into context for us there have been so many mass shootings and and here we are again how how does this fit into this awful pattern rate\nI mean this is the third mass shooting I myself have covered in just over a year and um while it's not the deadliest on American soil it appears to be the dead one of the deadliest if not the deadliest attack on a Jewish community on us soil on eleven people killed\nA rabbinical group that represents conservative Jewish congregations including this one here in Pittsburgh released a statement saying one of the most important lessons that the Jewish people can teach the world is that an act of hate against one community is an act of hate against us all\nThis mass murder as a reminder that anti Semitism is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in\nDecades yeah and we heard that from someone from the Anti Defamation league um earlier a ... it seems like everyone is really um grappling with this ... and and trying to process what happened so I Am wondering what it's like in Pittsburgh this morning right um\nI went to the scene this morning it was very quiet and still I'm for cold drizzly kind of miserable morning in Pittsburgh um I walked up to the the edge of the synagogue of to the police tape um as far as I could could go and and it you know of course there are police officers everywhere emergency vehicles\nAre lots of journalists and um people as they always do in these situations have begun you know laying flowers memorials\nI'm just at the edge of the they're sort of a shrub a section of shrubs around the front of the synagogue around the corner and and this was you know just a beautiful quiet neighborhood full of large stately older homes you know I'm a really I think the point of pride in the community this neighborhood and the synagogue and\nUh people are grappling as they as they do and what to say I mean we've covered so many of these there were vigils last night there always are there will be another interfaith service tonight I'm ... and the grieving is really just beginning here\n[noise] I think we're expecting there's confidence momentarily um but just before we go to that um how's the community responding [noise] yeah well\nYou mentioned there will be a about five o'clock\nResponding [noise] yeah well you mentioned there will be a about five o'clock eastern time tonight an interfaith prayer service um\nThis is a this of course happened at a house of worship and uh people after these events always gathered to pray and they will tonight\nLocal children's museum opened its doors for free and said you know bring your kids if you want a safe and comforting place it's so hard to talk to children after something like this happened so hard to make sense of it uh as we know his mother's\nUm and ... and so that's just one small thing the communities doing to try to help Stanley's\nI'm Jewish and otherwise ah throughout this community in Pittsburgh a pope with what's happened here\nThis tragedy that's happened again and again around the country um has happened here and and people are trying to make sense of it\nYeah I I think we have some tape of of the vigil and we're going to play that now [noise]\n[laughter]\nYeah\n... incredibly moving and somber um what has been the response from elected officials so far\n[noise] well it depends on what an elected official you're talking about um the governor of Pennsylvania Tom Wolfe said in the aftermath of this tragedy we we must all come together we must take action to prevent these tragedies in the future we simply cannot accept this violence at a normal part of American Life\nAnd it's something that has become more and more common place in American Life and\nUnless the president a President Trump yesterday afternoon address the shooting a remarking that if there'd been an armed guard inside but then a God the shooter might have been stopped and it's important to note of course that there were police on the scene very quickly and and they did engage with the shooter\nHi this is Ari Shapiro there's something about the intimacy of human voice that keeps me listening to a public radio want to hear from somebody speaking directly to me through the radio it cuts through all of my preconceived notions my stereotypes my judgments\nAnd no matter how different the person might be from me on the surface\nIt helps me relate to them and come back to them and that's why I keep listening thank you for listening to the sun PR station\nShip with the Jewish faith or his daughter Ivanka and his son in law and his grandchildren are Jewish and and he spoke last night um and and called it out and said that these were anti Semitic attacks and that this was a hate crime rate\nAnd and he you know he and the vice president have both said that this this cannot be tolerated a ... and said that this is he said essentially that this was a sick thing to do 'em so he's he's certainly called it out I'm\nA ... of course that you know the thoughts about how to deal with it how to reduce the kind of crime how to respond to it there's there's a great deal of controversy about that when you walk\nAround Pittsburgh and and you see people I'm sort of grappling with this and and trying to make sense of it or what are they saying about um why this might have happened [noise] well\nI think it needs to to Asian than it and I I've not been on the ground here if it's for too terribly long myself but um I think what you see again and again in these situations as I said I've covered several mass shootings now I'm three this is my third and just the past year or so [noise]\nUm people are on the one hand uh just be well they're trying to make sense of why someone would do something like this and\nIn each case it seems like a there's a there's a search for why after the Las Vegas shooting I did a piece about why we need to know why and and there are a number of reasons for that sometimes it's law enforcement wants to understand what went into the motor for a crime so they can prosecute and investigate and said that they can make\nWent into the motive for a crime that they can prosecute investigate and said that they can maybe try to reduce that there's also a psychological need to know why you know people um grapple with why why here why me why my community\nAnd in this case there are as we said indications that suggest that um the shooter had anti Semitic an anti immigrant a motive\nThat tells us something about why this might have happened again that still under investigation but it is being investigated as a as a hate crime and that may be something we know more about a as a ... conference get started pretty thin here in Pittsburgh\nWe are waiting and we're watching screens here waiting for a authorities in Pittsburgh to to address the public address the media um and there are a lot of questions about about why this happened and I'll say well we'd like to know more about about the victims soon\nAnd we're going to bring in a um our lives and now to talk about a little bit more about the political landscape around this of course we are coming up to the terms um and a lot of people are looking at this and feeling very on edge wondering if this is really um you know connected to the elections and Mara a good morning\nIt's MORNING [noise] so I set the scene for us the president's response and and basically how we are actually starting this press conference now I'm going to go there live here we can\nOffer our most heartfelt condolences and prayers to the

week also saw\nFourteen package bombs sent a prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump and that has been arrested in that case she just say Iraq is being held at the federal detention center in Miami for the latest on this story we turn now to NPR's national security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida\nNational security correspondent Greg Myre who is in neighboring Fort Lauderdale Florida could mourning mourning or the [noise] All right um so he's been arrested what should be ... what should we be looking for on the legal front\nWhere we expect say opt to go before a federal magistrate a Monday here in Miami it's probably going to be very brief appearance though he may enter a plea for these five federal charges he faces\nAnd then we expect a that he will be sent to New York perhaps severely fairly soon New York will ah it seems will be taking the lead in the in the prosecution here\nAre there any new details on the investigation well are there had been no new explosives in the mail since Friday when he was arrested a so that's a the perhaps the most important point still the question how did one person living out of his van with no resources make\nAll these explosives and that puts a nation on edge um CNN has reported citing a source that a parent Lee was making them in his man and there's no sign yet that any other help are we getting a picture of how he became this extreme [noise]\nYeah there was this dramatic shift in twenty six team you had a very troubled life lots of arrests but he wasn't political he uh on social media where he was very prolific it was about things like a soccer and bodybuilding night life\nAnd then two years ago all this anger a political anger starts coming out in in social media one thing really struck me um he is we know lived in a van hung out on the southern edge of a Fort Lauderdale in Parkland community that had that horrific school shooting the sheer\nThat's only about Fifteen miles away sort of the northwest edge of a uh Fort Lauderdale\nAnd say I begin making all these attacks\nAgainst David hog one of the students who survived and became a a prominent gun control advocate he was constantly going after hog on Twitter saying he was a fraud you didn't go to the school and then in fact he was an actor being paid by George Soros\nUh the financier who's been in the news so much lately and in ... in fact was the first to receive an explosive package in the mail\nI understand you've spoken with coworkers including one who was in that town\n[noise] yet Deborah gr Reagan was a manager at the new river pizza I Will say I was a delivery driver and she says they got along he was reliable um he gave her a ride home one night when it was raining and and she noticed all these dirty clothes and food rappers\nBut she said that he also openly talked about a saying that gays and Jews and blacks should be eliminated um here's what he said about here's what she said about his political thinking\nWould start talking about ... he last Hitler Hitler\nWe should go back to that site with Hitler\nAnd That's NPR national security correspondent Greg Myre thank you so much thank you living\nIn these last few weeks before the midterm elections we've been having a series of conversations about how the groups we come from affect our point of view what's often called identity politics\nAnd when we talk about identity politics wheat and yes clues NPR can be specific about some identities and vague about others to explain and discuss we're joined now by a nickel Hannah Jones she covers rates for the New York times magazine welcome to the program thank you for having me\nSo we often talk about African American voters are Latino voters but we use different language for white voters right\nYeah I mean typically when we talk about black floater or the teen of voters are any racial minority\nThey're presented as a model with black voters think this black voters are here on this issue or they're courting black voters but when we talk about white voters we rarely mention their race at all last\nBut when we talk about white voters we rarely mentioned their race at all unless it's a story about race we talk about them in terms of fair varied interests and their of their identity so you know we talk about suburban moms or we talk about working class\nVoters or are we talking about educated voters or evangelicals a we have a thousand euphemisms that we use for\nWhite voters what happens is we then tend to think that the things that concern white voters are not the things that concern voters of color and the voters of color are somehow the only ones who engage in identity politics and we know that that that's also not true yeah\nAnd somehow the white as neutral in some sense\nRight white is a default\nSo I have treated frequently that when we have seen something like you know Democrats need to win suburban voters I Need to go after suburban voters that there's a silent white in front of that statement\nAnd that silent white to me is very detrimental because we are centering whiteness in a way that it should not be but we're also does that accurately reporting the story Democrats\nDon't need to win suburban voters they need to win white suburban voters because they are getting black and Latino suburban voters and in fact more than half of the black population lives in the suburbs now\nWhat are the political implications of not being specific when we talk about like people [noise]\nI think one we really downplay I mean we we solve this meeting up to the election of Donald Trump and then in all of the coverage until really rather recently since the election what we saw was that we did not see white he was voting a in a racialized away because\nBy ignoring their race for say oh they're voting on their economic anxiety oh they're voting on this issue where that issue and in fact what the research showed was that they were voting on demographic anxiety that they were feeling that culturally um they were under attack and that their their whiteness was under attack\nAnd so by and instead focusing almost exclusively on all of these other issues and ignoring the role of race we actually ignored the biggest story in our country that racial anxiety really propelled Donald Trump into the White House\nAnd the other way politicians may not explicitly say white but aren't voting it is when they talk about the past the good old days the Nineteen fifties kind of world to something that Donald Trump did did very well I mean he was employing the words of of sort of white identity politics\nOh absolutely and so this also I think speaks to\nVery unsophisticated way that we talk about race in this country many journalists are unable to actually call out the dog whistles\nSo when Donald Trump says that people of color clearly understand what that means America was never that great if you're a person of color we had legal apartheid in this country until forty years ago\nBut why voters also hear the racial implications of that and so our inability as journalists to call out the racial implications even when it is not explicitly racist means we are not\nActually reporting what everyone is hearing and what everyone knows when\nWe were discussing this and the media's responsibility about using language precisely I'm One of the things obviously it's most newsrooms are overwhelmingly white but there's also just on the news organizations specifically the fact based media want to be fair so how did those two things then sent when you're trying to\nDiscuss some of these racial divisions in this country\n[noise] one I Would clearly argue we're all biased I think the way that we covered the election showed that by to be very Larry clear because we were ignoring literally what voters on the ground were saying ... ... voters on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job or I don't know anyone who's also\nVoters on the ground where say no I haven't lost my job I don't know anyone who's author adapt to Hispanic but I Want them to build that wall anyway because they're coming here and they're changing our country like they were saying exactly how they felt and we're like no no they don't know what they're talking about it it's it's economic anxiety so that by it but also when we
