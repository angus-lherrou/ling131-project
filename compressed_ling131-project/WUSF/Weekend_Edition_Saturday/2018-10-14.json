morning everyone a massive relief effort is under way in the Florida Panhandle to help communities that were hit hard by hurricane Michael Parker elementary school just outside Panama City National

particularly hard hit when the eye of hurricane Michael pass through joining with the latest on the relief effort is NPR's Joel Rose in Myanmar Beach Florida the morning time we live ah you've been in Panama City and the surrounding towns I mean tell me what you're seeing [noise]\nWell I feel like the relief effort really is getting underway now at least in and around Panama City it took a few long days after the storm for the official response to sort of get off the ground\nBut I really thought difference on Saturday there were multiple locations in Panama City and other towns where emergency officials are handing out food and water like we just heard of the top\nBut that said there is a huge need for basic supplies and not just on the coast started up a lot of damage in small dirt road towns forty and fifty miles inland and there are very long lines were supplies all over the region lots of people need help\nYeah and the pictures of devastation are are incredible how much does it still without electricity right any any sense when it's coming back\nYeah there are still tens of thousands of people without power the local utility Gulf Power estimates it's going to restore electricity to most of the region by the end of the week\nBut that estimate does not include some of the hardest hit areas right around Panama City which might be without power for weeks I Would say maybe months just driving around in Panama City I mean it's unbelievable the number of electrical poles that are down you see power lines in the street everywhere you can't really drive without driving over them\nAnd at the same time there's no water nominee gas stations are open the ones that do have cats have really long lines so I think things are gonna be pretty rough year for the foreseeable future\nJoel what are people telling you they're going to do it they're going to stick it out or are they going to leave\nI think a lot of people may not have any choice I mean both in and around Panama City and out in the countryside it's one of the poorest regions of Florida are places where people a lot of people are living paycheck to paycheck\nAnd just you know right now a lot of the people I've talked to her are focused on just getting through today and tomorrow you know tried to get water an ice trying to get a tarp to cover up the hole in the roof maybe before it rains um although luckily there's no rain in the immediate forecasts but you know sort of people's minds are\nYeah we've heard there were really big problems also with communications is that getting any better\nOr not that I've seen most of cell carriers are still down in around Panama City I mean many him even emergency officials don't have phones that work um so if you know it's a big problem people can call their relatives to say they're okay um and and it's I think has to be one of the things that's really slowing down the rescue and relief effort\nOn trial Snyder NPR News Culver City

gains on the state level they now control two thirds of the governor's mansions across the country but this year the geo Pete is on the defense defending twenty six states NPR political reporter Jessica Taylor has been following all of these races and she joins me now to break 'em down\nHe Jessica Hi Lulu so can Democrats cut into the ... edge among governors\nThey haven't really good chance they could pick up as many as a half dozen or more seats and then the incredibly important for them this year because we're heading into twenty twenty when there will be\nA sense that that will effect redistricting this is how Republican sort of gotten the really good position that they were and they want a ton of governors races in twenty ten they controlled redistricting and very important states where they were able to draw congressional maps to their liking you know we've already seen\nA good sign for Democrats when it comes to this they've they've flipped a ton of state legislative seats\nAnd so it it's a good sign for Democrats this map is really for them what state are you watching heading into this last month the campaign I mean where they're really tight races there's a couple of pickup opportunities for Democrats it looked like really sure things Illinois and New Mexico Michigan\nI say some of the really tight races or Florida in Georgia Florida is always you know the perpetual swing state Andrew Gillum was sort of a surprise nominee there he's a progressive African American man from Tallahassee yes so this is sort of a test of whether real progressive candidate can win and the ... states\nAnd so that's going to be a really of a Trump ally there and Rhonda Santas it's going to be I think a really close race still\nNext door in Georgia another woman trying to make history Stacey Abrams will be the first African American woman ever elected governor and that the state there is changing and that changed enough that's a really big question and then\n... has it changed enough that's a really big question\nAnd then they sort of a handful of surprising opportunities for Democrats in the Midwest and the sun belt\nUm Nevada in Ohio there's always sort of toss ups but the Democrats have real chance to flip them places when really ruby red territory like Kansas South Dakota and maybe even Oklahoma why is that I mean what is driving that sort of a mixture of things you've really unpopular outgoing administrations in Kansas and Oklahoma\nBoth of those states have been rocked by fights over education and teacher funding\nAnd you know even if you're a Republican voter you might be willing to vote for a more moderate Democrat on the state level but not on a federal level and Republican or some polarizing nominees France is Kansas secretary of state Kris Kobach a Trump ally he only narrowly won his primary\nHealth care is driving a lot of these races were talking about Medicaid expansion and tears playing an important role in places like Iowa too so where are the bright spots if any for Republicans\nMeant that they expect to lose seats and you know a good night maybe two or three or four but\nWhat's surprising and notable for Republicans and how many of their incumbent and really blue states are in really strong positions Maryland's Larry Hogan Massachusetts Charlie Baker Vermont's Phil Scott her favorites to win reelection\nThey could flip a seat in Connecticut where there's an outgoing I'm really unpopular democratic governor and so that sort of could give them another sort of chance to add another New

immigration policies including separating migrant children from their parents at the border and deporting immigrants who are in the country illegally but you don't have a criminal record\nBut abolish ice doesn't have any real support among key players certainly not in the administration and democratic leaders are wary ducking the issue in debates and declining to take it up in Congress\nAnd yet

for one county in one over one better but if we can get get down here in a county we can do what we really are in North Jersey\nAfter nearly five ten five hours Hudson County voted to end the ice

the Florida Panhandle to Virginia in the aftermath of hurricane Michael officials are warning it could take weeks in some areas\nAs we see more and more powerful storms hitting us it has many thinking about how to make the nation's power grid more resilient NPR's Jeff Brady reports\nIn Panama City Florida right now this is a common than\nWe were lucky to have them or using gas powered generator utility crews to fix all of a downfall and wires and restored their electricity Lake County emergency services chief mark\nBowe and says that will be a long slog\nThere's electrical system was taken down to nothing I mean Ninety nine percent of its in the air and everything that was in the air is on the ground now\nAcross the entire region the damage from wind and flooding is extensive says Scott parents and that the Edison electric Institute which represents investor owned utilities\nWe are seeing not just where we're going to be do respiration that is pick up the wires reset the pole and restore power but actually a full rebuild in some cases\nAfter big storms the question always comes up why not put the wires underground where there'll be protected from the elements\nThat seems to be everybody's solution ... and if it was that simple we would have done it a long time ago but the underground being is not a silver bullet\nIt's expensive ... organization asked utility customers back in twenty twelve after Superstorm Sandy how much they pay to put the grid underground most that they'd pay up to ten percent more on their utility bills\nAbout one in ten that data accepted twenty percent increase but fewer than that we're willing to pay double which the Institute says it's a more realistic scenario\nIn some cases putting infrastructure underground can make financial sense say in a new housing development where wires are installed during construction but there are other considerations underground wires are at risk when there's a flood and repairing that damage is difficult\nJulie ... an energy analyst at union of Concerned Scientists\nOnce alliance and you're right it can actually be much more cost me take like ... and ... and an overhead wire\nTo marriage has

power plants and address climate change that a longer term view of how to make the grid more resilient but that report was before President Trump was elected promising to boost fossil fuel industries\nJeff Brady NPR News\nMichael hit the panhandle just as the voter registration deadline for next month's election closed in Florida we know Florida has a big presidential prize it's also hosted a bunch of closely watched political races this mid term season market pseudo covers Florida politics for political and he joins us now on the line thanks for being with us\nThanks for having me I so first off you grow up in Key West you're a native Floridian and a Key West injured or not just over a year ago he's seen a lot of storms comes through what are you thinking about Michael and the level of destruction that's caused\nI think Michael reminds me most of Hurricane Katrina when I was in New Orleans and then the Gulf Coast I remember the city of wave wind in Mississippi looked a lot like Mexico beach looks now there were just\nHomes wiped clean from their slabs and then all of the associated destructive miss that kind of turns a once can flush area into a desert just\nStripped clean wiped clean of any sign of or many signs of human habitation construction no trees just a really powerful storm surge that was kind of a an unstoppable force\nSo let's talk about the political fallout Florida has a a two term governor Republican Rick Scott running for the U.S Senate he's up against Bill Nelson\nAnd a charismatic ... of the state capital Tallahassee Democrat and ... is running for governor against Monsanto is a former congressman who also has a lot of support and pockets of Florida\nYou know what has hurricane Michael meant for these political campaigns\nWhere we can't really say with certainty what it has meant but what it could mean and what is the likely scenario is that this has probably been a a benefit to Governor Scott\nHurricane Irma which struck in twenty Seventeen here\nAfter Scott led the state he saw his net favorability rating rise about eight percentage points and then it put him pretty much and good footing to run for Senate this year and in fact just before the hurricane hit coincidentally rich got was running ads\nTouting his leadership during hurricanes so he has been kind of all over ah both physically and these different pockets of the state\nIn different media markets and he's been in Tallahassee broadcast on the weather channel and the like a scene leading and we've seen in the past not just with Rick Scott but with Governor Jeb Bush and Jeb Bush's brother President Bush in two thousand four\nThere is a benefit to the executive if you handle these storms right and in this case it would appear so far that Governor Scott has to a lesser degree Andrew Gillum has kind of done the same thing he too is the executive albeit\nOf the city of Tallahassee mare fed it was pretty hard it was hit yeah uh\nBut it was hit pretty hard\nIt was hit yeah a Tallahassee wasn't hit us hard say as of Mexico beach right in the or the county Leon county which is where ... had about Ninety eight percent of its power loss\nAnd coincidentally just before the hurricane hit he was being attacked Andrew Gillum buys poet run the Sanchez for his leadership during a storm hurricane her me\nThis time Gillum has made sure that he's been out he's been seeing a visibly in in one case actually changed selling trees away\n[laughter] and moving debris really so he's changed trades well he's making\nSure Gillum is that he is not perceived as someone who is just kind of doing nothing right and so\nEveryone's trying to capitalize on the on the media moment in and trying to be seen doing the best for Floridians in it and I guess it remains to be seen or what the what the effect will be I mean we have about ten seconds left I mean are they going to be polls that are going to be looking at this\nOh sure we just have to wait until they go back in the field again understand that like the entire pan handle it can be almost impossible pull right now because you can't get a hold of half you know eating or sense of the people\nThat political mark ... joining us from Florida this morning thanks so much thank you\nTomorrow on MORNING edition after big win on the Supreme Court Republicans and conservatives seemed to be
