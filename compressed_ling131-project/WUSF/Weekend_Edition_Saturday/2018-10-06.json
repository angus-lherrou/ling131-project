Mart or we need to know about the federalist society especially as they are going to be um more prominent than ever and us life\nOr the group got started at a couple of law schools in the early Nineteen eighties it was a pushback by students in Google's legal scholars\nAre people who are convinced that the court had become too liberal to inclined to read the constitution to accommodate the outlook and philosophy above few justices with big ideas about social and political justice\nMembers of the society of indicated a desire to revisit some of the landmark decisions of the past two generations asking the question of whether or not the basis for those decisions was in the constitution or whether it was being supplied by somebody's interpretation of the constitution\nAnd let's underscored there's nothing remotely secret about this right\nNot us a secret society at all and they've been quite public about their campaign and about their influence within the Republican Party\nAnd about their desire to revisit things like the privacy concept in roe versus Wade that legalized abortion or even the one person one vote concept that required state legislative districts to have equal population\nI'm Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation is the the the combination of of decades of organizing um are Republicans energized to get out to the polls about a month from now or do many feel mission accomplished\nThere could be both a feeling of accomplishment and a feeling of opportunity to press further and some resentment over the confirmation process and some of the accusations that were raised in the way they were raised against bread cabin up\nBut midterms are more often driven by anger than satisfaction and right now polls show a lot of women and younger voters are unhappy with Kavanaugh and even many Republican women are unhappy with their party and that could also be a big factor in the midterms\n\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from universal

that he sexually assaulted Christine Blasey Ford in high school Megan McCarthy columnist for the Washington Post has expressed\nA diversity of views which we welcome and she joined just making thanks so much for being with us thanks for having me you wrote at one point that you supported Brett Kavanaugh\nFor the court but you also supported uh the pause in the Senate vote to investigate allegations of sexual assault by Christian policy forward now with the advantage of a few hours of hindsight [laughter] uh\nWars that investigation just a fig leaf to gain a few more votes\nDon't think so I think well I mean yes and now right I think that's why they did it I think it was also the right thing to do and sometimes funnily enough in Washington they actually do the right thing because that's a good way to get more votes\nOr perhaps not as often as we'd like um I didn't actually support him I said that under certain circumstances that if for example she didn't cooperate with the as it doesn't look to possible\nThat they should confirm me 'cause I think that the Senate cannot vote you know I went to a reporter and told my story but I won't tell it to the Senate if you you can't sort of take that into evidence I think because it's not the same standards that investigation has but I thought it needed to be investigated these were serious allegations [noise]\nUm and also for you know even if you think he didn't do it\nWell you want to do is get the maximum all\nInformation out there you want to first of all make sure that there is not something you're messing that there is not something there because Democrats are going to investigate afterwards but also\nYou need to present to the country look we did our job and we can't corroborate the city did the investigation do its job I Am surprised that they did not talk to Ford or to Kavanaugh\nUm some people say that's actually pretty normal some people say it wasn't\nA I Wish they had again\nNormal some people say it wasn't a I Wish they had again because I think that democratic legitimacy requires saying we did everything we could to make sure these things weren't true and they had both of them had testified at length and you know forward I think hurt herself a little bit by being uncooperative\nBy not providing she had basically choose the crowd I wasn't aware of that because she was well so she had basically two pieces of cooperation for her story she had people she had told him sort of two thousand Seventeen two dozen Eighteen ... should\nPeople basically shootings of cooperation were her therapist notes which would seem to say look she talked about this all they're not we have it on his name and two thousand twelve\nAnd the polygraph that she took she wouldn't provide the detailed information about the polygraph and she would not provide the therapists notes\nTo the committee 'em and you know it's not clear what her attorneys were doing whether they were trying to force the FBI to talk to her or whether they were helping Democrats it's really not clear but the upshot was that the committee decided without those things and I think that without those things where you have is literally just her testimony she had had other witnesses\nWho contacted the committee for her and provided letters but all they said was she told me about this in two thousand Eighteen foot but\nLet me ask you about the logic of Susan Collins of Maine because she said she found Christian bushy Ford a sincere a book that she couldn't let a charge that didn't have corroborating witnesses where her support for at a judge\nNow the world heard from thousands of victims of sexual assault over these past few weeks you pointed out that's the thing about this crime it's often committed without witnesses and they feel insulted and outrage and defended not to be believed you know I think\nThis is a real problem that we have been grappling with for a very long time it is an inherently difficult crime because you know ... some rapes involved just someone who is too intoxicated to consent you then end up with someone who was too intoxicated also to have\nNecessarily fully coherent memories of what happened and they make bad witnesses which is terrible on and you know I I've been trying to make clear in my cupboards the whole time there really is there were two talking points in that neither of which I think we're right\nDemocrats saying this is just a job interview I mean this guy being called a rapist twenty four seven on the media for three weeks is not just a job interview that doesn't happen in job interviews Republicans kept saying presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt\nAnd you know inherently with these crimes first of all that's a really hard standard you're going to end up quitting a lot of guys and making punishment kind of essentially to random to be good deterrence [noise]\nUm but also you know a Supreme Court seat is very different from being put in a cage and while I have great sympathy for Kavanaugh has gone through in the past three weeks and for by the way with Ford has gone through which has been terrible and shameless totally undeserved from people you know pushing her into hiding with death threats and so forth [noise]\nUm it's not the same as being put in a jail cell I've I've I've spent a couple of minutes locked in a jail cell for a story and it it's way worse than what ...\nMaking the colonel thanks so much thank you [noise] ... [noise] to\nPresident Trump and his fortune made fresh news this week as the New York times published a major investigation drawn from thousands of pages of financial documents\nThe president called the article quote a hit piece with us now to talk about some of the allegations is Tim O'Brien he's author of Trump nation the art of being the Donald and of course he's the jacket of bitter Bloomberg opinion Jim thanks so much for being with us wonderful to be with you Scott is the head or is this the president's not as rich as they want you to believe\nEasily the head of this one I don't think that\nWant you to believe that easily their head or of this one I I don't think that's a news though I think the nuts and bolts of that story or some other things which is the extent to which President Trump and his father Fred Trump\nUsed a variety of tax shelters are a number of which were perfectly legal others which were dubious positively fraudulent\nTo protect the family's vast wealth about a billion dollars or so in in wealth\nTo keep it in the family to keep it in the family and so when when Fred Trump\nTasked on several hundred million dollars to his children or he could do so in a way that allowed him to avoid inherited gift taxes or in other words\nThe trumps probably should have paid around five hundred and fifty million dollars in taxes on about a billion dollars that was transferred\nAnd instead they they paid around fifty million or so\nWhen when Donald Trump ish over the years I built with I built myself how how does that stack up\nWell that's that's another important theme of the story I'm\nPresident Trump really rode into Manhattan on his father's shoulders his father was a very successful queens and Brooklyn developer he built middle income housing\nFor low to middle income people and uh his son Donald wanted to be a big time real estate developer in Manhattan but he wouldn't have been able to do that is Fred Trump hadn't co sign of loans and loan money to get started and to help them through rough patches\nI think that relationship was pretty well known I had reported extensively on some of that the times really flashed that out with a lot of new numbers and the scale of his dependence on his father was really laid pretty barren that story so that's another\nImportant theme of the story which is the president is that on the campaign trail and elsewhere that he only got a million dollars from his dad that's all we ever took from his father when in fact it's hundreds of millions of dollars\n[noise] is there anything that you did you can recognize that maybe people going over the story now can recognize this distinctly illegal\nYeah there's a couple of interesting pieces one is when ... and his wife Mary transferred a large portfolio of buildings to Donald Trump and his siblings they used an appraiser who essentially low ball the value of the building so they would be taxed at a lower rate\nAnd everything in the times reporting suggests that\nThat was improper in addition they found an example of a company called an odd little company was essentially a shell company called all county that the Trump family used to inflate how much they were spending on equipment and supplies for their\nArmada of buildings so they could then pockets of differential themselves rather than pay income tax on it all of that stuff is possibly highly fraudulent the trick is the statute of limitations has passed on much of it\nSo it most they may may end up with civil penalties on this but I I suspect that's not what bothers the president the most about what I think really will get under his skin about this is that it it knocks down this idea that he pulled themselves up by his own bootstraps\nAnd he he earned his living on his own rather than being someone who was born on third base and said he hit a triple which is essentially the story he's been putting out there for a long time\nAlumni video is vital part of any marketing mix in a partnership with until this medium can help you meet your video production eats called ...

[noise] can the argument being made the senator mantra news just reflect in the Democratic we'll express for other people of West Virginia\nI I Do think that he is the poll showed that cabinet people mostly most people at the party Kavanaugh here however um I think he did it entirely politically because he's up for reelection and thirty days and he he has under fifty percent of the polls right now so I think I think he did it to play the Republican base\nYeah well but when you use a politician to being a politician or the that's not much of a surprise visit I mean he's running for reelection\nYeah of course and I did get out to him yesterday on\nThursday will tell it tell us about those meetings because you were you you met with him I guess for two hours on Thursday right\nYeah we did so we had a group of women who sat in his office I day and they were actually arrested a hit about nine women arrested they sat there for like ten hours listening to him they had a conference call with him on Monday\nThat didn't really go out on Thursday we had a group of about fifty go up to D.C and we met with him on a two separate occasions the first one we had\nProbably about twenty twenty women there and twenty women men and teenagers and we told stories of sexual assault and ask\nThem how they plan to vote and he their way he he was very engaging the conversation you had to step out of the room but I got back from like ... you you feel like you were hurt and received with respect\nAbsolutely yeah he was extremely engaged she has got a question um I Do believe that John mentioned cares for West Virginia I just don't think that's reflected in this decision [noise]\nDoes your fight continue is so good\nAnd you if a judge Kavanaugh is confirmed brothers\nAre fight that continues so I as far as the Senate goes he ... he kind of knew that he had us he kind of had it because at the other options Patrick Morrisey has done a terrible thing for West Virginia he's a big proponent of the opioid crisis and so he\nKind of nearly a dozen believe an opioid addiction\nHe doesn't but he was a lobbyist for big pharmaceutical in West Virginia I he's our current attorney general and he's just terrible he's got Trump's endorsement and that he's just a bad guy and I think he knows exactly\n... so this is old your opinion with me underscore\nThis is my ... of course this is my opinion yes of course um so yeah I think he believes that that he's still going to have the Democrat though and that he wants to get the Republicans as well\nWell it does continue yeah so we're working on I'm working at a statewide to change things just got a constitutional amendment on the ballot to ban abortion and Joe Manchin that we all have to get out and vote against that which we are doing\nWell if if your tones is if you have accepted janitor mansions votes for what it is and I'm Still support among a great many issues and I got to tell you this this um very civilized and democratic me\nI'm trying to play the long game I reluctantly at the port has it has I think the I think Morsi's worst choice mansion does still support us on the AC a and tax reform so sadly we still have to go with him and hopefully get somebody else a twenty twenty four\nTaylor Wilson of West Virginia thanks so much\nThank you the protests on Capitol Hill coming years since the advent of the me

too it's been an opportunity to talk about serious and relevant issues like consent and sexual harassment\nThat's important to teach our students when they're younger so that they don't grow up in a culture where they think it's okay to like give these girls and boys the voice to stay like this was not okay I'm not going to tolerate a\nWomen aren't tolerating it either and the results are measurable this year sexual harassment reports to the emergency or equal Employment Opportunity commission have gone up to twelve percent that's after years of her meeting steady\nThe EOC is the

harassment with big donors like Shonda Rhimes and Meryl Streep to fund reached Twenty one million dollars in just two months\nAt the same time to Johnny says there's only so much lawyers can do of the thousands of sexual harassment reports that come in only a fraction get funded for legal help\nSome people are coming to us you know two years after this has happened to them for five years after this has happened to ten years after this has happened to them\nBecause they never felt comfortable coming forward before and the way the law is\nYou have to report or bring a case within a certain amount of time to some of those women are out of time some of those women who are coming forward are independent contractors and unless you live in certain states you're not covered by discrimination law and so it's a matter of people coming forward and we connect into lawyers and the lawyers helped them when they can but sometimes there is something that can be done\nYou got a plows the ground and plant the seeds before you can read to harvest\nJoe Freeman has written books on women's liberation and other social movements to put me to in contacts she says look at the fight against racism\nA hundred

the high profile surges like speeches and marches but they also need the behind the scenes work like the time's up a legal Defense Fund\nThat underneath the rate or behind the scenes organizing is extremely important\nWhat you see are the search for what's catching our attention now is the vast turnout of people in the cabinet\nAnd here today not because I see and terrified\nChristine Blasey

your home field\nHaving another ... to ... consecutive team celebrate on your home field and yet you sound great\nOh thank you so much going on trial or the other great rivalries in sports a Yankees Red Sox the Sox won last night five four but Boston at the battle didn't\nYeah they sure did and this is exactly what the series is going to be having seen them since two thousand four when the red Sox did the miraculous comeback coming back from three games down\nAnd obviously the red Sox and the Yankees for the first time in their history both when a hundred games in the same season and last night was a battle that I was there and it was it was one of those types of games where it looked like a blow out the red Sox are up five nothing and then all of a sudden here come the Yankees simply because\nThis is exactly what these teams aren't the red Sox have the better starting pitching the Yankees have the better relief pitching the red Sox relief pitching really almost gave it up there at the Yankees had chances in the sixth inning bases loaded bases lives in the seventh thing\nAnd if this is what it's going to be for the next four games I think we're in for a classic\nI'm used to that first put the crunch on Cleveland's seven to two court Gruber a great pitcher got clue or club at you like this grows a lot\nYeah I think the Astros a but my my motto Scott and all of this is that okay the red Sox won a hundred and eight games the Yankees won a hundred games but\nThe Astros still won a hundred but they went under two hundred and three games and they're still the defending champions and to me you're the champs until somebody beat you and I think they're the best team top to bottom of the best team in the line of the best team with the best combination of relief pitching and starting pitching and they're scary and all of a sudden they're starting to look like\nChampions again even though for a lot of ... that a lot of a lot of the season they weren't quite into it but they're that good that they can sort of flip the switch and they seem to have done that\nBut what about the Dodgers they too straight shut outs against the Atlanta Braves\nAnd this is interesting because nobody seemed to be any good in the national league this year nobody seemed to really take control let's not forget your cubs who I picked to go to the world series\nHad the best record in the national league on Sunday and they were out of the playoffs by Tuesday night and let me forget that but go ahead now I'm just saying that it's it's a crazy ear and and we're talking about the brewers as well suddenly the brewers got shut out last night so all of a sudden\nYou're starting to see all these teams begin to really play their best baseball\nAnd let's not forget we talk about the champs being champs until you knock them out while the Dodgers have the national league chance they went to\nThe seventh game of the world series last year losing to the Astros so maybe the Dodgers are the team that's going to start getting warm at the right time as well but I can tell you one thing Scott you may not want to hear this although maybe not I don't think you have a problem with that I kinda like what the Milwaukee Brewers are doing and they've got\nThe rocks already on the ropes merit to that and maybe you go to Colorado and things change but\nI really like Milwaukee and the Dodgers I think this is just going to be great all of it's really good\nFind that we need to mention a twenty games suspension or in hockey Tom Wilson other cap shit Oscar son Christ or the blues on his Blind Side ... yeah NHL seems to be reacting to to head concussion\nMore no they're not reacting a they don't seem to be reacting they're reacting in there essentially sending the message that Tom Wilson to dirty player it's not just the fact that he had some 'cause in in drilled them in the head it's also that businesses\nFifth just his fourth suspension in the last hundred and five games so they have concluded that this guy when he gets on the ice is out there to hurt people and the one of the things we always talk about with football is the danger but the thing we don't talk about is that hockey is just as dangerous and the guys are coming at a pretty high rate of speed\nAnd when you look at that the suspension now they're they're not playing around in their concluding this guy does not belong on the ice\nToward Brian thanks so much banking he's part ... machine oh cop\nYour free Nineteen Ninety seven's robocop there's a cult movie classic setting a dystopian Detroit\nBefore

back to her dear friends Ali McGraw most people in those big votes during the seventies sixties and seventies and she first and it took me by the hand when the grand echo was going back to Spain 'cause because I wanted to go back to Spain and she walked me through Picasso from his early days of realism all the way through his life jubilant what have you\nSo when you read about the costs though you can walk yourself back in time through western art when you get to the renaissance it's politics and economics and its poetry and it's a change of\nThe look at the way the world looked at

Detroit is really a city that's was hitting the scared than it is really turning around its downtown area dramatically\nAnd the crisis of beauty or addressed by the color of Detroit is what who and how do we define is beautiful and\nIf it's putting the power of the wrong hands beautiful things I eat art will be destroyed or curse or ... blackened by somebody's opinion I mean someone can make some of those categories pronouncement or judgment on what he or she thinks is beautiful that's a crisis to me\nWhat will it be likely to be back in Detroit it'll be fun man for someone to Detroit and I have to say you know I went to New York in Nineteen Seventy one and it was dangerous and it was bad it was lethal race that and it was gorgeous and it was exciting\nFor someone with the Detroit I saw it and I think Nineteen eighty two three something like that and it was the same way you couldn't go out in a hotel at night and I said I'm going to get me outta here man and then it went back and I saw the progression an improvement of it and I can't believe the transformation of what the downtown is because\nWhat I see is what I get right away and when I see a beautiful city I see the restructuring of\nThe life downtown the people walking the street that can happen in Chicago and New York it's happening Detroit I feel I don't know joined it to hit the Detroit simply because of
