{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WUSF", "content": "Information and tickets that Michael idiom dot org it's W. us in eighty nine point seven Tampa saint Petersburg Sarasota broadcasting from the University of South Florida\nAt the school trying to do the right thing school trying something new trying to keep it student's safe so they bought handguns seven of them got nine millimeters to use the shooter comes into the building\nAnd a week and a half before school started after a bunch of training the running to first drill and the school building with a gun French and the boxes [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThe buildings mostly empty no kids around the district in rural Ohio the greatest record on the condition that we not see their name on the air\nThe day people on this team only to teachers all do it for the rest of the guidance counselor to custodians the three administrators who run school one of them is the only woman on the team was pollock rushed them doing this we used to so I'm explaining how this works exactly\nOkay so the seven guns are locked in these small safe that have been installed in locations over the school I saw the run a bunch of drills and then all of them the goal was to run to the nearest safe get the gun out of the safe and then get to where the shooter is as soon as possible and they time each drill\nOkay we're going to put tape of this was one of one listeners they're allowed to gunshots from blanks so did fire during these drills [noise]\nSo the first little glitch they came to was that some of the team members actually had trouble getting into the safe so you have to put your finger on the sensor or do something\nAnd it's a little tricky\nThere's a sheriff's deputy he's playing the shit [noise]\nI'm following a guy named John principal for grade six twelve [noise] he's running from his office starts by the cafeteria [noise] she's got a gun he's rambling ... bass he's holding a walkie talkie very focused very aware the clock is ticking she told me that every ... seconds one\nOf these shootings and other to kill not enough of this way [noise]\nElementary awareness and elementary when [noise]\nI'm enjoying the building also has middle school and high school right\nSo the principles running down the hallway and it's just about to get to the area where the elementary kids are but there's a door there and it's like this happens automatically wonderful doesn't to lock down the heat and the two guys with him are stuck ... for his keys and trying to find the right one\n... he's trying to unlock the door here we go [noise]\nReal\nTime here we go to [noise]\nDoor opens there on the elementary school side and they find the shooter right there\nSo that's the goal the exercise they got there\nAnd they don't pretend to shoot him or anything just timing the response\nWasn't great that\nWasn't attorneys are the first yeah oh yeah it was it was on the doors\nWere wondering\nWe said so controversial to put guns into a school like why did they choose to do it here like why did that seemed like the best option to them\nI I talked to John the principal about that yeah I'm for a long time he agreed with people who think guns in schools is a bad idea and even now he doesn't think it's something that is right for every school he says he's not a gun guy did grow up with guns\nFor every school he said he's not a gang guy did grow up with guns had never used one they came to this school and the school's pretty remote in an area that doesn't even habits on police force so if a sheet or gotten a building they could be waiting a long time for helped\nI don't know that I was necessarily sold that this was the right thing to do but you know what are we going to do or Fifteen minutes away from an ambulance being here were Fifteen minutes away from the sheriff's department being here were Fifteen minutes away you worry you're worried because you realize that you're on your own and and so\nI wanted to learn [noise] so I went out and started learning how to shoot a gun and now the handle down\nAnd which is different you know the first time he should have done that's pretty scary it was scary to me\n[noise] after that he went through a lot of training including one class where he was really forced to think through what it would mean in a very literal way to have to shoot someone in school\nAnd went exercise the instructor said\nYou need to walk up to the target tells close as you can he says in your mind you have to envision this is a shooter in your cafeteria and their students all around how close to you have to get before you're confident you're going to hit that target\nYou've got to shoot that target she became mess [noise]\nI Can't miss [noise] because they're finding is there's a possibility if somebody else getting hurt [noise] All right and I can't let that happen [noise] I Can't let it be me who hurts a student at my school\nOf course she might have to she wanted a student and a lot of these shootings that to the shooter is\nYou know if you told me years ago that this is what I'd be advocating or or thinking [noise]\nI I wouldn't ... but the\nThing don't stop happening they just continue to happen\nIn\nThese shootings do just continue to happen today and I personally have all kinds of people trying to figure out what to do to prepare like the staff at the school [noise]\nIn general it seems to plan for disaster school administrators and others look at previous shooting it looks at past to debate the future [noise] knowing full well the whole time there's a limit to what any planning can accomplish if she gets into a school the sad fact is you cannot stop every tragic possibility you can't stop everything [noise]\nLike one of our show today where people who are trying to learn from the past or trying to put it measures they're trying to be as thoughtful and Thoreau as they possibly\nCan and it's still not enough to have people who have invented something that actually seems to work and help\nWB easy Chicago this American Life America last [noise] stay with us [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nOh\nHeck one ... will never be\nPretty sure that's trying to figure out the best way to prepare for gunmen there's an example out there that might be really helpful\nAnd that's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school in Parkland, Florida just a month before the shooting that killed Seventeen people in that school the teachers trained their students or new procedures they should follow in that exact situation came after a total overhauled the school's emergency response planning\nAnd the day of the shooting in a TV interview one of the teachers reflected on the effectiveness of that training\nBut I don't think they could have been more fair carried work than in a new way to get even sell even with that we still had\nPatch looking for the I'm going to return to their families\nDid the training they received to save lives that day or didn't it such an open question what our producers Robin semi and went to park on to talk to the teachers about what was actually in the training and how well did or did not prepare them for what they went through\nThe training they did at Stoneman Douglas High school with an attempt to be as prepared as possible for a wide range of emergencies bomb threat hurricane warnings a bank robber nearby an active shooter\nDoug lifted the school with eleven building in over three thousand students so upgrading all their emergency procedures took months to plan and coordinate with faculty and district officers police and fire departments\nMultiple cocky teaches journalism at the high school she's a teacher not news clip you just heard and the training was on her mind that night because she was on the committee that set it up and then I'm through the ethics teacher a planner she believes in a good hard think and being proactive\nOnce she and other teachers had been trained they ran their students are all the new drills school did this over two days in January teachers we're told\nWe want you to go back to every single class we know what's going to be annoying when the kids are going to get tired of hearing it by the time you get to the eighth grade class to get there going to have heard it from every teacher but they wanted us to go stand in front of the kids and goes through all the emergency procedures\nThis is what we do for ... for every period for everything that is what a code black it this is what we do for two days for two days we went over the procedures with the kids might have to do with each and every class because they wanted to make sure that the kids\nKnew the procedures that it was like ingrained in our mind and that they knew so the rap non silver day they would get it on a burgundy day\nSchool colors silver burgundy their on an alternating schedule [noise] was it that their kids to the drill seriously\nOn a scale of one to ten I Would say we were totally prepared like a tank the school told every teacher to cover the tall rectangular windows in our classroom doors with paper\nAnd leave the paper up all year just in case if there were on it would make it harder for an active\nShooter to see in that the lesson from previous shooting get out of sight\nBefore Columbine very few schools did active shooter drills now nearly Twenty years later most of them do\nActually curse teaches calling area Douglas she's level headed pragmatic like a person who spent years working in the restaurant kitchens not living are cool what she did actually remembers being trained with the other teachers on the new procedures last year it started with them to nine one one audio from Sandy Hook\nFor like the next Ninety second that kids are running by me I'm just screaming at them keep running don't stop\nShe tried to back to her kid they put in get down she's still in our doorway when she realized there's another group a smaller group of\nKids that are running towards the freshman building oh man I was yes I was grabbing them and just pulling them into my room\nThey're following instructions remember if you're not in a classroom run keep running away from the town how is it the kids are running towards kids running the other way\nBecause the way that the gunshots sounds where Rick ashamed off the media center area the quad\nIt sounded like they were shooting coming from that direction as well which is why kids were running in the opposite direction wow to give you an idea I had twenty nine students that were pregnant that day with myself and by the time we were finished there were sixty five total bodies in my room\nHe let them to drill to shut the door and not let people and\nYes it was [laughter]\nYes it was laughing there were terrified people reading and I just I could not\nIn all conscious sort of leave them leave and be like that\nActually wasn't the only teacher to stand in the doorway and said how with what you've been taught you can choose to follow the protocol and follow your instinct for some teachers that wasn't a choice at all [laughter]\n\nIn her classroom look better attendance sheet out of her emergency folder and she kind of Seventeen over twenty five\nStudents and to from a different class she pulled in from the hallway the group it small enough to fit in the ... the month of told them to leave their backpacks out of sight and she'd been taught and move there in the closet it was hot and dark except didn't faith has led by their cell phone [noise] unless I had her phone out too\nThere's a group tax between me and three other teachers in the in the English department 'cause we're friends outside of school and um my friend Stacy who is on the third floor the freshman building she ... she's an attack so I said that there is a shooter there's a shooter in my floor\nUm and so my my friend Ferris says drill or actual and she said actual my windows blown out and then she told us she had been great by a bullet she was great in her arm by a bullet\nAnd I didn't hear from her for a while\nIn our went by\nHeard noises in the hallway and we got really quiet um I had had a flashlight part of my phone on so that we could kind of like eliminate the closet without having a light on when I heard the door open and put it sounded like you would open with the key\nUm and so then I could hear movement in the room and then somebody not comforting or not I mean not 'cause you\nCare movement in the room and then somebody not comforting or not I mean not 'cause you don't know what the hell's happening um and and the police shot and then the police officers had dozens of police than you went in here and then there was like kind of like a pause and then they're like the police to anyone in here and I was like ... I'm going to open the door because\nSomeone says this is a police has anyone in here and your first thought is it really is the police are still you're not sure I'm not sure the first time they set it on my couch or what I should do am I supposed to open the door\nThey didn't cover that and training\nVery slowly at the handle and I opened it really gets even if it is a police they have weapons too and they're looking for the shooter so I Know they have their weapons drawn\nShe really just had to get about whether to trust us with a cop and not a group of shit are saying they were cops and so I just\nVery slowly ... than you pulled on the handle push it up and said we're in here in the closet and then and then they started giving an instruction come out with your hands up\nOr\nWhat they're told me that actually with one of five people she knew who had broken protocol that day by holding their doors open longer than they were supposed to\nEnd even did that on the third floor when they knew something was wrong and my friend Stacy held her door open until she was like locked eyes with you know the shooter and and yelled to you know not be able to close the door and grabbed the handle to hand him pulled that close\nUm [noise] for her door was open up to the to the moment he started like shooting bullets down the hallway [noise]\nBasically the teacher who are most grade [noise] she survived [noise] got Beagle in the room next to this day the is that the same thing they seated\nWaited a little with the door open he's one of the Seventeen who died that day standing in the doorway do\nThere's very little evidence about whether school shooting thrills of any kind actually work the data doesn't exist school shootings for how much we can talk about them are still that historically rare but nominates and actually has been in that rare situation the one that's hard to study and they both told me that having a\nPlaybook for what to do helped now I lock my door now I count the kids in my class now I'm moving to a closet [noise] but they also both had ideas coming out of the way they could have been better prepared Melissa for instance\nOne of trauma kits with God's in every classroom and training on how to treat bullet wounds with it\nDoes actually how they lived and mass shootings I really wanted to find some experts weigh in on Douglas to tell me did the teachers' training help did more kids survive because of it\nWhat might have worked better Cheryl Johnson researches what effective and these drills at ... university and has a training instructor for Alice one of two big companies in the U. S. that train schools how to respond to active shooters Alice has its own way of doing things just like the other big outfit safe havens international\nHas its own way of doing things there's no one single way no agreement on what's best Cheryl Johnston didn't want to get into this civics of what happened at Douglas partly because it's still too soon the investigation isn't done\nBut she did talk to me more generally about some of those things I knew that done at Douglas like paper over windows\nCheryl doesn't think it helps much it's two o'clock on a Tuesday the shooter knows your in your classrooms also code ran all the codes their colors and meanings can tell them but I talked to said no to that too\nI'm a big advocate for not using codes\nAt all if I say could read your takes a split second for your brain to go have a code red meat fad means active shooter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I said there's a gunman in the fall\nPeter means I have to do that [noise] versus if I said there's a gunman in the fall [noise]\nKeeping classroom doors locked rebounding yet\nBut the idea that they're just all you do that you lock the door and put every kid under a desk all the consultants I talked to said that's outdated [noise]\nShows that people need many more option anymore waves response was shooting [noise] sometimes you Daniel room\nSometimes you evacuate [noise] like if you're far enough away from the shooter or in an open faced with more acted like a cafeteria gym [noise] for the last resort you cite basically trust your ability to make a decision [noise]\nI told her to actually carry how she's the doorway grabbing I've done the scared didn't remember it was a break from her school's protocol Cheryl such an advocate for thinking on your feet I wondered if she may be believed actually did the right thing pulling in ... the problem with\nThat and unless you're there you don't know [noise] you know what exactly happened now does she probably saved lives probably in in that situation at work with the gun me being in a different building yes\nOne thing that was part of the training at Douglas was barricaded in your door basically pushing lock the furniture up against her classroom door but most of them actually didn't do it seems like very few teachers did it was actually had done it\nAnd she followed the protocol lock him barricaded her door right away it would've been way harder to ... kicked into her room in the hallway shutdown barricade herself first fewer kids would emitted in [noise]\nReporting on this for several months I knew what I was looking for something concrete to tell my daughter's school my daughter's nine\nFourth grade last year she did a traditional locked down at her school when I when I asked her what the drill it's four she said I don't know exactly and say it's not great\nI keep thinking about that one shooting the red like Indian reservation shooting and how that one a classroom and you get a traditional lockdown squatting high because they practice that\nAnd how and investigator on that case told me that Israel did not help them at all they'd have been better off without it and the researcher who told me we should not do drills at school period to traumatizing for kids we don't pretend to crash on an airplane we just\nDeal with the possibility of crashing by hearing some instruction\nWrite them down on and I don't agree with no drilled it all I Want my daughter to know everything I wanted to know about barricaded\nAnd I want to know about renting and fighting back I Want her to know about active shooters because the thing to recognize\nI wanted to know there's nothing that can keep her completely\nSafe [noise] because it's the truth [noise] one more thing I'd say to my daughter's school ... point about don't take coat [noise] ... like it is [noise]\nI don't want someone to come over an intercom and tell my daughter code red I Want someone to say listen I there's a person with a gun in our school of course I never want someone to say that at all\nOr\nYou're at Douglas their new gate new fences new cameras him back there just key card entry for staff Godzilla trauma kits and every ram Fifteen campus monitors compared to five last year three school resource officers that have one and they already did a code red trail\nAfter a few minutes he's called for us enough to talk\nHe tell Sandy he wants to shoot him to stop he wants to take action somehow\nAnd then had suddenly switches gears and start going out of the feelings about guns and gun control\nYou know is is the evidence is going on in this world [noise] it can go to ... district where he joined us drone doors are still able to get\nA new he plans to get a concealed handgun license when he turned Twenty one later this year so they're actually gun owners to have a twelve gauge shotgun they believe in a Second Amendment but they're also advocates for universal background checks and tight regulations on the types of gun ammunition and factory like bump stocks person by\nHowever and he said they don't push their political beliefs on survivor when they're doing outreach their primary goal is to support but it's impossible for grieving parents to avoid the politics around guns there's a whole movement of conspiracy theorists believe that the U.S government staged mass shootings to make conflict that\nWe were told by Alex Jones that our daughter never existed\nAlex Jones of course famous for saying that mass shootings are fake he's now a defendant several defamation lawsuit when the Phillip does ran into him face to face and a gun control a bad he accused them of inventing their entire story\nAnd then two minutes later he saying your daughter's still alive and she's living in the Bahamas and she's living the high life and your crisis actors and you're paid by the Obama administration and other than I'm listening to him just going you are so absolutely crazy\nMoney got into it with Joan stood right in front of him it looked like a shouting match with about to start until Sandy stopped dead broke it up I reached out to jump through what\nStart until Sandy stopped dead broke it up I reached out to Joan through one of his lawyers who declined to comment the conspiracy theorists\nNotice truth ... or ... trolls family good victims on social media immediately after any mass shooting it can get dangerous after that Philips that's on gave\nInterviews in Aurora he got death threats and had to get the FBI involved demanded with writing him ended up in jail and hope through or one of the things the Philips informed parents about they tell families to brace themselves\n[noise] [noise] um [noise] uh\nAfter watching Loni in any in Santa Fe I wondered why in the world they were throwing them solved back into the setting reliving their worst moment over and over again the answer of course starts with her daughter shooting\nThey got the news in the middle of the night when they were asleep at their home and tax us this was back in two thousand twelve and their daughter Jessie was in college at the time she got to see the new Batman movie the dark Knight Rises with one of her friends at a multiplex in Aurora, Colorado about a half hour after the movie started Jesse ... called Sandy from the theater\nThe minute I picked up the phone there was\nScreaming\n[noise] horrible screaming in the background panic and he said um there's been a shooting like what is he talking about 'cause Jesse had been\nAt a mall in Toronto almost seven weeks before where there was a mass shooting\nThis was a coincidence Jesse left a food court in a mall just three minutes before a man walked in an open fire\nSo my first thought was this isn't funny you know but she's not a prankster\nAnd I said are you OK and he said I think I've been ... twice and it was when he said that that I went why isn't Jesse calling and I knew something was really wrong he said I trust\nAnd that's what I woke up because the screen was so low it was so horrific and took to no never heard before\nMoney from Sandy in the living room sliding down a wall he picked her up and took her to their couch re held her\nJesse with one of twelve people killed that night another Seventy people\nWere injured and then five months later there was another mass shooting\nOr twenty first graders at six educators died\nDays later the Brady Campaign to prevent gun violence contacted the fault of\nTheir reaching out to families from other mass shooting at that they'd be willing to travel to Newtown to talk to parents there\nAnd he said they didn't even have to think about it they need at least said yeah\nBecause they wish they'd had someone to talk to you right after ... died [noise]\nBut when they arrive at a community center in Newtown and he\nSaid they felt nervous uncomfortable maybe they were intruding they weren't sure if the parents would feel angry are grateful about their problems\nYou know it's like walking into a funeral or people that you don't know\nAnd I remember saying to my husband and we walked in the room and I saw their face and\nHe said that's what we look like five months ago\nWith that look like\nThey're hanging on to each other um they've been trying so their eyes are red they're walking\nAlmost robot like\nTheir bodies are moving that they're not really there\nI realized that when I look like just five months ago but it also made me realize this is exactly what I Want to be doing\nTo help these parents acclimate to their new reality looking back and he said that was probably too\nAcclimate to their new reality looking back candy sad that was probably too soon for them to be out there trying to comfort other parents when they were still so raw but the filter said there was also a strong and in some sense of kinship that they couldn't turn away from\nWell they were there they ran into parents and other mass shootings to parents from Virginia Tech tooth on your parents about kids suddenly and violently and places where they thought that they were safe\nTo fill up to now had parents that they could lead onto\nThe moments that launched the filter into what's become their life work they could see the need their new experts in what to do when your child died in a mass shooting\nThe only experts are the people it's happened to help them find each other money Sandy had set up an organization called survivor empowered to help families navigate their grief plus a bunch of other practical things everything from medical bills and charities scams that huge kids go to to raise money to get your child body home if you live out of state\nHowever this new mission was hard for their family and friends to comprehend\nThey want you to move on what you really want you to get back to normal light mold others should should Seamus you were shouldn't you know let me explain something you're right I'm not to say personally I never will be the shooters were obsessed with it well you know we are in a sense we are obsessed with it\nThe Philips has been a few other parents told me because it's so hard for people to understand that the grief never fades old relationship start to fall away and we believe are closest to\nDisappear which makes its informal support groups even more crucial [noise] without support looks like over time and what it means to the parents to get it [noise] I got to see all that when Sandy ... got to know a couple from Florida\nWho lost their son in the shooting at Parkland on a cutting edge door at I met them at their house or something with Nick he was the captain of Parkland swim team was about to go to the University of Indianapolis on a twin scholarship he was a six foot tall blond kid\nWho collected different flavors of Oreos and waited for a Supreme drops Mitt said they just reached a point where they were becoming real friends they talked about relationships shared play left and watch Scarface together the day of the shooting Mitch an article about so\nCalled tax all day from people who said they'd heard Nick was okay one person said they heard he'd been moved to a staging area for all the students who witnessed the shooting and other set a police officer with giving him a ride home\nAnd then a nurse at a local hospital said she thought patient to match next description [noise] by that evening the door at still hadn't are directly from Nick they went to uh marry out that law enforcement designated at the meeting area\nIt's out in the ballroom with other parents and waited\nEvery kind of phone rang he jumped in and get Nick calling from somebody else's phone um [noise] the media was telling you you have any comment can we have to find your son and I should say [noise]\nAnd um at two o'clock in the morning you the FBI car and then they start pulling one family and children at a time and the years like strange from nature and then their names were called out\nEven walking into that room you have this tiny little hope that they're going to say like\nThe we couldn't even find yourself and you know and I hope all that she was arrested and I'm if I'm thinking maybe you walked home and and then you do the math in your head like to take that long to our house and then they told us the news that he was gone in the shop and he was never brought to the hospital\nTo second nightmare second ...\nBody was still at the school because he died instantly and the building was still a crime scene it'd be two days before they could see him on it or want it to look at it injuries which did not on August says this is just how her brain works\nMitch did not on August says this is just how her brain works she's an e earner she needs details the director at the funeral home wanting to protect her called the medical examiner's office to ask about neck\nAnd the person that answer the phone at all um let me let me take a look what's the name again as nickel try to to swim or swimmers perfect [noise] I think it's meant that there was nothing on his face or its head I'd like him he was perfect\nHe'd been shot three times a bullet in his chops destroyed his heart and lungs through to see him yes he left off\nTickets your picture in your head when you hear when you hear that somebody has been shocked with an air of Fifteen just so
