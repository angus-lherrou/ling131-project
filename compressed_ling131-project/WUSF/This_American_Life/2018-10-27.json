remember about Susan Jordan me and her three in the back room telling about the day camp I went to that summer I Can't get myself to shut up and they had alligators instincts I can hear myself telling her and this one time this one alligator got out and the counselor had to catch it and on and on like that\nMeans students slipping through one of the time like ... rock and roll through the decades

is packed all twenty five registers or going people are lined up halfway through the back of the store I look up and their shoes and Jordan she smiles we talk\nShe doesn't have many items so I checked them through as well as I possibly can I Can't recall one thing we say to each other although I remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married chance\nRemember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she's married she has been some kind of business card her husband's probably something having to do with the building of red wood ducks she seems happy\nMeanwhile there's a line of last minute Christmas shoppers mounting behind her\nI tell her to hold on I'm trying to get my break we can catch up just a great time\nI keep signaling to my manager but there's no one to relieve me\nFive ten Fifteen minutes pass I keep Clinton behind Tucson making project gestures I can still remember standing there holding on one bag of groceries smiling back at me\nFinally stops me on the shoulder I have to go she says but I come in here all the time I'm sure I'll see around I worked at two or three for two more years I never saw Susan Jordan again\n\n\nIt drives me crazy that I never saw it again if I hadn't run into the store I don't think I'd care but somehow having her play what to me seems like a huge role in my life when I was a kid and then getting just a taste of what it would be like to talk with her as a peer\nI've never forgotten that\nI Know it's ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she's up to wondering if she ever things about me I just had to find her\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nI start with my only lead to one former employer of hers that I Know\nI'm I'm I like uh do you want to know I'm calling I Do I Do\nYou remember she was in Jordan Wright\nIs George George\nYes it's bringing out but I Can't place a she was our babysitter oh OK chicken like can my pet one\nOf the many ideas that Susan introduced to our household with the concept of the nickname I think that's all I Want to say about chicken legs in my pet a gun to my mother to fill in gaps in my memory of Susan but she didn't remember much more than I did\nA babysitter that really add more of a relationship with you to that she did with us\nIt was it was tough to come home and\nI I guess I must have been suffering a little bit I missed it I really missed my little brothers and my little sister and they were gone\nAnd I was I guess maybe trying to substitute\nI think maybe that's one of the reasons that I remember that we remember Utah found that that was because I think it works both ways I think that we felt if that didn't make you feel closer to us I think that we we responded and well\nI was desperately I guess I was looking for a family regularly but I mean it it's only you knew you probably wouldn't make but I mean that people are complicated now what I really wanted to do would spend more time with your mom and dad but I was terrified\n[noise] I mean I I just couldn't I couldn't do it I was too shy you know a lot of times they it it was I thought they were asking me to stay longer and talk\nAnd I would just run out and I'm sure they were [laughter] and they probably know what's wrong with her but I just couldn't do it\nSo he sort of talk to us instead so yeah I was comfortable around kids because you know I had kids in my family [noise]\n[noise] Mm mountain\nOr three times it's subjective are hard times came up I hear settle hesitancy towards ...\nPercent thought it was embarrassment but that was it exactly no it wasn't until we been talking for hours that I realized what it was [noise]\nShe was waiting for the other shoe to drop\nShe hadn't forgotten that are passed it happened she just forgotten that I witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that have been going under our entire conversation was that I was calling to say she damage me by exposing me do it\nI don't think I was to kind of accent because there was a lot of turmoil in my life and in my family and that's what my fear is that I might have had some kind of negative impact on people\nAnd I know probably I did on a couple of people but they were my age but\nYou know you just want to remember yeah I was a baby that are the kids love me blah blah blah [laughter] but um [noise]\nI Would be devastated if I heard anything different\nThere are parts of the past you don't want to go back to the parts of yourself you don't want to go back to\nProceed and Jordan the upper left that I remember\nAs he or she just due to forget\nAnd it turns out I'd also done my best to forget what I was like\nI didn't think of myself was where it all but you can join reminded me in the gentle terms possible\nWhen I was nine of anxious and bookish\nNine of anxious and bookish\nNot the missing and all that I just kept thinking these kids don't know how to play when I went to your room I didn't it didn't seem like he had a whole lot of\nToys I Hope I've got to try but it just seems like there were mostly folks and more educational things\nI mean I remember you had planned it in your room a chemistry set and I didn't remember that Kate had hardly any dolls you didn't seem\nQuite as playful as other kids that I had ... ... more serious in general so mainly I think that's what I did was try to play\n\nPerhaps the most amazing thing about this whole story how little I remember as a defeat us about each other even if they had received us about ourselves as Susan said at one point each of us remembered what we needed to about the other I needed to remember the part of Susan but she doesn't think about much her toughness in the face departure\nShe said she must have remembered the side of my family that I just take for granted that it was common our house but there are books there wasn't much fighting\nIt was the first time in my life where I had ever seen that keep people lived differently than the way I laughed and that's what I decided I wanted for my now\n\nYou can try to return to childhood by looking at photos are visiting the old neighborhood or listening to recording or you can find someone who knew you back then when you haven't seen since [noise] they don't carry within themselves with the picture of view just on clouded by the years between\nThe remember you better than you

imagine the Beverly Hills they handle rather large mortgages\nDresses beautiful clothes clean cut back in the Nineteen seventies in England where he grew up he was in a punk band called the automatic who never really big commercial success but they were respected known in the history of punk by people who care about that kind of thing\nThat a few years back there not series of connections he ended up revisiting his teenage years for the first time but going back on tour in a version of his band in Japan here is that something that happens I mentioned it to a client\nAnd I said well you know I'd

watched his what can I watched the the sort of price shoot through the roof you know and then I began to realize wait a minute [laughter] time collectible [noise]\nA minute [laughter] time collectible\n[noise] sit down to brass tacks or how much we ... I think that one actually went to forty eight dollars [noise] I particularly like looking at you know all that sort of a [noise]\nOther groups that were going and twenty five cents [noise] um [noise]\nYou know music the business or offerings along punk lines\nOr that you know I don't want to live out not to set the time and it was good to see that uh [noise]\nYou know that they're they're ... values years later I mean it was it was part of that history came out on the rights of it [noise]\nYes but ah there is a sort of Darwinism a fading in uh in record collection [noise]\nWhatever that I went to county Vicki the drama\nAnd and Ricky collected everything you know ... and he very kindly lent me uh these two scrapbooks so I took pictures and and things out of that I just put it up

five forty five years old or a little bit of gray hair coming in little plastic Rihanna coming in and uh\nAnd and what really wasn't sure whether I'm you know I'd still be able to do it because I haven't played those songs in twenty two years\nYou know not in my shower no to any one uh I mean\nPrior to being married I mean I remember dating women for you know uh yeah you never knew that I played as I'd ever played\n... you know it wouldn't even come up\nWouldn't come out really I mean not have a good time around but you know lots of other guys did to would you ever pick up the guitar and play it for yourself yes I read lots of songs my dog during this period [laughter] some of the titles would be we going to the park was a big favorite\n[laughter] to be followed by that here too is a good boy what a good boy is actually a it is quite a while to go boy [laughter]\n[noise]\nSo ah we whenever they want the type of sex I took my wife [noise] which\nPossibly with a ... was a miscalculation but [laughter] I Know is a good thing to take my wife gets a are you you're approached by dozens of teenage girls\nI was getting stumped on the street so what happened the first time you went onstage well there was just you know the announcement\nI remember when I was writing it I remember very clearly although I don't say this and the diary [noise]\nThat it was very clear to me that this was the diary of the future prime minister of Israel and [laughter] I mean [laughter] um that that I Would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know\nThe the thought of a young Zionists as he prepared its way to lead nation [noise]\n\n\nNow our our regular listeners during this American Life might remember that that you've been on our program describing your experience in Israeli Army summer camp that was right before I started writing this diary\n... made me another sure let's see um\nThere's so much wrong with Jews in Israel that I'm going to have a job ahead of me one thing it's a lack of any strong Jewish identity among most Jews that attitude sickened me huge ... of the world to stop worrying about money and well being\nI Do not know what exactly I'll do but if the situation continues when I'm a bit older than watch out world jewelry here comes Adam and wash out will generate here comes out of the day on Capitol [laughter]\n[noise] wow [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\n\nInteresting that you actually are addressing a readership [laughter] oh that's good that's the kind of thing and that readership is is world\nBut that's the kind of thing and that readership is is world jewelry [laughter] [noise] yeah [noise] the Jews of the world will one day read this book and we'll say if he knew this at sixteen how could I be living so badly [noise]\n\n\nCan I ask you to just read one of the passengers were you talk about Israel sure let's see I mean I have this thing from January fourth Nineteen eighty seven I memorized the hope ... which is the Israeli national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in Israel\n[laughter] make some day thing that you're in the prime minister of Israel and and what are the things I Need all that I Need to know the national anthem will probably try to find like that it's going to be a ball game or something they end up uh thing at the right exactly [noise]\n\nJanuary fourteenth Nineteen eighty seven Wednesday I'm getting more and more angered by the effect of Arab propaganda they blame the Jews for everything and the world including Jews go along with it entirely ridiculous I mean I really thought this was this was a testament for the ages I really thought that this writing\nWas powerful and persuasive anyone who would read it would immediately become and sinus [noise]\n\nAt sixteen I have such an inflated sense of myself there is so much\nGoing on in my life than that I can remember and I wasn't recording it instead I was creating this ridiculous fantasy of you know\nI'm not just at sixteen year old kid who's you know having crushes and you know a hopeless geek who can't get a girl a testament being scared and confused about growing old I'm I'm the future prime minister of Israel and everything you know goes through that but I don't know\nI mean maybe the maybe keeping a diary one tells the truth maybe that's a luxury of being a certain you know kind of person in a certain kind of situation\nMay may maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually make up a little fantasy yeah I think um I didn't have much anxious about\nBeing the future prime minister of Israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and I had so much anger about every other aspect of my life [laughter] I Know it just kind of a maybe it was a good solution you know\nIt was a good way to deal with this with with what I was going through to have the space where I could just be you know one of the great Mm\n[noise] I Wonder what are the sixteen year old Adam Davidson would feel\nIt knowing that finally you know an audience for a million people with with getting some of the\nReading from this diary\nI think this would feel so small to that sixteen year old that's would feel so\nNothing\nI mean I remember I was very disappointed in very sad about my parents I mean I was reading biographies of course of all the prime minister of Israel and and I would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions won't affect\nMillions of people like how is that enough motivation\nYou know just to have your petty little craft and your petty little family and your small little apartment like [noise]\nI mean they have the kind of light that you know I mean basically you know I Want it for myself\nWhat you're saying though is is that the sixteen year old you would be cringing at\nYour thirty year old just as you're thirty year old version is cringing at\nSixteen yeah that's very true yeah very very disgusted\nTo her that this radio to eat\nIt would seem like I'd settled in the ... that are way Mm\nMaybe to\nThe gate staff writer for the new\nBoy when we were angels\nHistory originally came to us from a graduate student and we frankly sitting drying at the New York academy apart and she mailed a radio show a story that you wanted to get him to the program in which he had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little micro cassette answering machine\nAnd then to edit the quote that you had gotten what you would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boom box\nIt was crude yes but the story kind of remarkably like stories from this American Life\nNow for one reason or another time considerations that unsolicited story never made it on the radio for this week's show however we had to put together another story using that same style which we added music to your radio station to make a bully sound like story on our show\nIs history about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate [noise]\nUniversity is a pretty straight place\nEntertainment for most people means fraternity kangaroos\nIt's not that sort of place you'd expect people to watch a guy sitting on another guy shoulders pretending to be a giant\nIt happened by accident in Nineteen Ninety four my friend's got with the top half\n[noise] there was the beginning of the school year and we were [noise] um [noise]\nAboard one night and we decided to go up to the quad and [noise] I guess basically got up on a on going back and he started yelling and screaming about how giant he was and how magnificent he was [noise] and I'm\nActually right after that I might have gotten that far back as the eye to eye so dry up [laughter]\nAnd uh [noise] I guess that really struck a chord had heard that was pretty amazing\n\nBecause I bought a lot about it um [noise] it actually good or the end of may think along [laughter] killer pat [noise] [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nGot talked about the idea one night in the dining hall the next day on the weight of class he saw signs all over campus and that that in both pretty high in nine feet tall and the giant man eight pm on the quad [noise]\nThat had no idea who put the nuts\nHe learned later that the times were posted by a guy who had overheard him talking at dinner\nScott decided he would go to the cloud is intensified time and undertake the challenge\nHe would need to create a character in a costume for the giant\nGiant man a booming voice\nYou know exactly it was something that you know I Am you know just the you know loud but just kind of weird [noise] sort of [noise] thing and that's [laughter] way way they do I don't know [noise]\n\nI don't know [noise]\nIt's kind of asked his college friend hold on to access giant man's leg\nThey grab some ... before heading up to the plot\nA blanket wrapped around their middle high Toyota\nAnd a black really wigs like the guys and can\nWe picked up a point in the bushes photo died at I um [noise] because I really couldn't see what was going on out of the crowd and for the game and I got on the shoulder effects way up there like around my waist we walked out\nThat I remember just being maybe you know maybe ten people for people try to remember them being way on the other side and sort of
