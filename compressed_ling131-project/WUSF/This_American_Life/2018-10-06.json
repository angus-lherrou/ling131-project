has the obligation\nOr to recognize\nThe necessity of\nPreserving the neutrality and the independence and integrity of our court\n[noise]\nIs whether the judge has the temperament commitment\nThe character\n... the commitment and\nThe character and the learning I think the judge should be broadly read\nMyself was of fascinated with political theory at you know if if you ask what makes a good

[noise]\n\nKennedy was speaking to an audience getting high school students people ask them by the state cases they'd always wanted to be on the Supreme Court no by the way he's funny he's a big talker and explained his job how it works\nWe will meet um just the nine of it and um and discuss the case\nUh we are beginning or seniority for the most senior judge or to the\nLeast senior and if the case is the one in which there is a great issues of public policy involved um we know that were required to make a decision or the courts have been divided on it\nAnd let's assume that it's a five four cases and it's not just reverse of our from it's a question that the rationale the principle of\nThe reasons that you'll get\nAnd let's say it's five to four\nThe five in the majority don't have

opinion that explains\nTeach\nThe principle of law or the principle of the constitution that controls the result\nAnd when we issue that opinion and say an unpopular case [noise] ah we draw down on that capital of trust\nWe make a withdrawal on the trust in the public has it in our institution\nAnd it is our job always to replenish [noise] that trust\n'em by hearing to our judicial oath by hearing that the principles neutrality\nAnd independence and fairness\nAnd quiet discussion\nAnd decency\nAnd courtesy [noise] scholarship [noise]\nThat's the way our ... works [noise]\n\nOkay well my story I don't know if this tells us anything profound about Anthony Kennedy or the Supreme Court but it's just kind of fun to hear how he talks about this\nI was meeting one time with our\nJudges and attorneys in Alabama\nAnd I think it was a Saturday morning\nAnd for my schedule or there's are both was nine o'clock in the morning and they were dressed casually ready to play golf or tennis when they were gracious enough to\nHear me for a few minutes and so I said well do you have any questions\nAnd a one attorney rages Hanna says\nNow you have all that tremendous amount of reading to do all of\nThose briefs ah how do you possibly do that I said well\nI'm I have four clerks and I divide them up among the course of course I have to read them all and or if they're very difficult cases I Will take them home and read the breach the second time over the weekend just before arguments and I like music I have opera playing in the background and I sometimes have cases that\nAre one application sometimes\nAnd I sometimes have cases that\nAre one opera cases sometimes to opera case [noise]\nWell the minute I that that I I kinda knew I lost the ... they were too polite to roll their eyes but\nIt sounded kind of what intellectually pretentious or here's some eastern guy talking about the opera and\nBut uh so I thought I lost the audience but I Would say because the attorney in the room raised his hand is all I have a rule like that when I write those breeze I said oh it is it are the ones that fact raping the to the fact [noise]\nI said I think I remember your last one

years\nCelebrations begin at ABC after W. S. dot com it's just doubled USF\nJust American Life America last today's program the unhappy to siders stories of people who are saddled with difficult momentous decisions to make decisions that will determine someone's face for the rest of their life decision that way on them like one of our program today was about a judge to is about a jury and we'll just get right to it\nThe story comes to us from the pet cat heavyweight if you haven't heard heavyweight it's hosted by one of our regular contributors here and a former producer of this American Life Jonathan gold's teen and the premise of the show is that each episode\nPeople come to Jonathan was something in their life that they want to fix they want to deal with they want to make right with another person usually I mean they've been living with for a long time and they're uncomfortable with\nAnd Jonathan way to kind of the bumbling detective Colombo figure but one who actually is kind of bubbling an awkward but he gets the people to sit down and talk and has things out many of the episodes are really funny or the one that we have today is a more serious one\nAnyway here's Johnny book staying\nIn two thousand and eight men received a letter for jury duty\nYou know lots of people would say oh this is such a boring thing on the way I Hope it don't get jury duty but I was more curious than interested in like the the process and you know I like to watch himself like law and order and other things like that\nAnd that would that would have been nice to know [noise]\nI could have changed\nCouldn't let them live [noise]\n\nAfter the article was published something else happened I think spend never expected or wanted\nPaul stories mother Marilyn got in touch\nShe reached out with an email filled with sentiments of forgiveness should forgiven may and if I wanted to I could you know reach out and talk with her and knowing knowing that there's that forgiveness felt so weird like it\nIt wasn't something I can completely understand\nFor spent it didn't make sense why would Maryland want to speak with him how could she of all people forgive him for something he couldn't forgive themselves for\nI didn't know how to deal with I still kind of don't know how to deal with that and like I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't match her message ... how do you mean well I I wasn't sure how to reply with something as powerful as that are\nLike ... ... it just floored me I I didn't know what to say\nSan was never able to write Maryland back\nI did begin to apply but I didn't\nIt didn't have the courage to [noise] finishers under certain you know there's so much pain in there and\n[noise]\nFor much pain in there and [noise]\nI feel like a really read things are\n\nA few months after the men receive Maryland's email and execution date was that the state would put pause story to death on April twelve of two thousand Seventeen\nBut then something unexpected happened Glen and you'd have to carry the parents or the victim came forward it seems that at the trial the prosecution had lied\nTo cherries in spite of their son's murder are and always have been against capital punishment in a video they released publically Judith cherry presents a statement which reads in part\nWe do not want Paul stories family especially his mother to witness the purposeful execution of their son they are innocent of is deet\nBased on this testimony was only five days to spare Paul stories execution was postponed\nWhen news of the stay of execution reached fan it felt like a second chance an opening to finally respond to Marilyn's email but he didn't it's now been over two years he's remarried doesn't drink anymore but he still hasn't contacted Marilyn and so at at this point like what do you want\n[noise] I I Need to apologize for not [noise]\nNot doing what it should have done to begin with for not following my gun for not trying [noise]\nChain leads to a nurse or even the most casual reader of the fundamental physics will tell you\n... object will remain unnerved until it has acted upon by an external force in other words it takes a little nudge and who better to supply a little nudge than a little knowledge and so I write Marilyn a letter I Know this was a really sensitive and deeply personal issue would read\nAnd I hope I'm not being too forward I ask Marilyn she remembers a juror by the name of spanberger about a week later I received no back via email thank you so much for your letter Maryland right [noise]\nI have no ill will toward Mr burger I have offered in my email address as well as my phone number with no reply shows or forward or originally emails and then once you send two years ago the one he can't stop thinking about when I read it\nExpecting a grand gesture of forgiveness the Maryland never mentions forgiveness never even uses the word instead it's just six short sentences which Marilyn thanks for the article and says she shared it with her son\nOr tones breezy she ends with have a great day exclamation mark I understand that\nSpan consumed by guilt would read so much into so little but what I don't understand is why Maryland sent in the mail in the first place [noise]\n\n... you know I have like I have a couple of little things if you're if you get packages at all or some\n... some of the stuff I don't know some cookies [laughter] yeah OK\nMarilyn lives in Fort Worth Texas the two of us meeting the hotel suite downtown where I can stop offering the food that she can stop using you want to have a coffee or tea\nMaryland has fallen stately with smiling eyes she's in ... boots and a crop blazer all in black she sits on the end of the couch next to an empty armchair and tries to give me a sense of butter life was like before the trial\nI Would always ... me out with the jokes are all makes you have Marilyn jak 'cause she's going to keep the policy going [noise] I was always kind of wanted everybody went\nBecause she's going to keep the policy going I\nWas always kind of wanted everybody went to people knew you can call me in the middle of the night you know if you need somebody to come pick you up you know Paul Marilyn should get up she'll go do it\nSo since the trial Maryland doesn't feel like the same person everyday she's reckoning with the horror of her son's crime and worrying endlessly about safety in prison for friends have fallen away the thing that's hardest though it's out of the people who remain\nThe people closest to her you know look upon her son she says that everyone's pass judgment on Paul written him off is worthless and under the mobile and they blame him for her pain\nAnd I even had a family member were out at the top of that and that was a very hard so\nIt's like they wanted everything to be okay\nBut that's my chow\nAnd I love him and I'm not going to ever stop fighting for him\nFighting for him men working with her son's lawyers to change your sentence to life in prison\nPow appealed more exhausting\nIt took up all over time and energy update which affected the hospitality job she worked at for over Thirty years\nIt became\nExtremely hard for me to concentrate at work and I felt like it cost me my job\nAfter losing her job barely then lost her how she was forced to move in with her younger son\nUntil it kind of like you know at my age laptop that I'd be getting ready to retire I'm starting over\nThat I'm a white thing\nAnd um [noise] in\nTen years after the trial and everyone or friends or family of all moved on to win Maryland red fans article she signed him someone like her ... someone who never gotten past that final day of the trial\nWhen they actually gay that's been\nThe death penalty\nI had that I hadn't really died it didn't even register because I'm like what just happened what have they done\nYou know my whole time that I was just look at the jurors to try to read an okay what are they thinking what are they doing [noise]\nUm I wanted them to know if I can only tell them what kind of person he had and I want people to know you know everybody has their own that if you involved in a heinous crime like that the two monster but he wasn't a monster\n[noise]\nOffensive you know okay so he's going to come up in Maryland and I have been talking for about an hour and a half when the front desk so\nI think probably in the same event as the and being a fan\n[laughter]\nI Hope I get there before we get to [laughter]\nBut before we get a chance to practice arts fans fans at the door [noise]\nAnd I then I Jonathan it's very nice to meet in Maryland is here now how do you\nStand up for a decade\nA lot of trouble when lingers in the door the hotel room it down or have a seat over there uh he's with spectacle neatly dressed in a collared shirt and sweater he looks around and clears the throat um [noise] a little nervous and so\nThere there were the last time Maryland in ... and living in the same room was ten years ago at the trial\nMaryland was seated behind the bar fence and the jury box but today he sits down in the empty armchair beside her out of the world you can't quite bring himself to look at her as he tells Marilyn what it was like to receive or email\nQuite bring himself to look at our as he tells Marilyn what it was like to receive or email he gauges down to the lab\n[noise] it was very surprised her and um [noise] I read and re read it and I even\nReagan's for her letters never went anywhere I ... I don't know what to say what did you say about that\nI don't want to write a letter that's trying to make me feel better you know what I mean\nFrom the moment the votes were cast I regret I saw I'm doing wrong\nAnd although it was great hearings are generally forgave man couldn't forgive myself exactly and I can't even imagine how you most bill", "year": "2018", "show_name": "This American Life", "city": "Tampa", "day": "06"}
