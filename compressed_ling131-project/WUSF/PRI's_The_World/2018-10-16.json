I'm tending to Vegas and we're glad you're with us today it's\nBeen less than a week since hurricane Michael made landfall as a category for storm more than two hundred thousand homes remain without power and in many communities few homes even remain standing\nFor Americans living in the path of these hurricanes the past few years have been devastating there have been for category for hurricanes in the past two storm seasons from Harvey Irma and Maria and now Michael and that means some are still responding to one disaster when another one hits\nMy name is Jody I live in Charlotte North Carolina\nI'm a nurse and I volunteer with the red cross I was only home for two weeks\nFrom like the climate to eastern North Carolina for Hurricane Florence when hurricane Michael hit on still participating in the relief efforts locally coordinating nursing for shelters in my area of people who have lost power after this one down\nI have been asked to return to Durham wore on Hurricane Florence again and then I may try to go to Florida and then ... and a couple of months\nAs the disasters keep coming so do the challenges of rebuilding and climate experts say the storms are not going to let up in fact it's just the opposite today will take a look at what hurricanes like Michael tell us about our own weaknesses from building codes to community effort\nCraig few gate with FEMA administrator from two thousand nine to two thousand and Seventeen he's seen the country through Hurricane Sandy and a host of other disasters but before that he was head of emergency management for the state of Florida Greg welcome to the takeaway thanks for having me\nOne of the things that's become clear after Michael is we really need to assess building codes can you tell us\nWhy and how that is\n[noise] or probably the one stormed it really showed Florida than you used for a better building codes and better enforcement was Hurricane Andrew\nA tremendous damage but in the aftermath we saw that a lot of the construction wasn't even being built to the uh the coach in the community and so we we learned it both to coach or important but also the force Minton inspection of those codes were critical\nAnd when you talk about storm surge is one of the biggest concerns that indicated in your experience that folks should not be thinking about building along the coast at this point [noise] well\nI think we have to be very careful about how we build along the coast I think in many areas particularly if you look at this part of Florida's coast a storm surge\nParticularly if you look at this part of Florida's coast a storm church is measured in ten feet higher and many areas and it goes well inland so probably building right on the water's edge maybe not be the best place but if we build appropriately we elevate structures um\nIt doesn't mean we cannot develop but it means we just not going to be able to build like we've done in the past\nThe other challenge we have with all this this is not going to be inexpensive and this part of the state this is a lot of um older Florida ah folks who've lived here for generations\nAnd as we talk about resiliency I I Do have one concern that is as much as it's going to cost us to rebuild this coast are we going to create a society of resilience based on wealth and funding a displaced people who can't afford that\n\nGlad

coming\nUp at six o'clock but after all things considered here on your NPR station\n[noise] we're back with you on the take away today I'm tending to have that in a video released this week Massachusetts democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren backed up her long contested claimed that she had Native American ancestry\nWith results from a DNA test and the ... of her family story\nMy mother was born in eastern Oklahoma\nIndian Territory and he'll just a few years earlier when did you become\nMy daddy always said he fell head over heels involved with my mother or\nMy daddy's parents hearings were bitterly today are marrying my mother's family read was part Native American\nPresident Trump has long punted warns claims of native ancestry and even ... her Pocahontas\nThe accusations surrounding warns ancestry date back to two thousand and twelve foot her Republican challenger for the Senate Scott Brown accused warn of using her Native American heritage to advance her career\nGrand Lee brewer it's contributing editor for tribal affairs that high country news and a member of the Cherokee Nation Hi Graham Hi what was your reaction to Elizabeth Warren's decision to take this test and put out this video\nI thought it was very interesting I Want to be very clear I'm not here to discredit her story or the common knowledge of her family that that she's been passed down I was more concerned about the way it was talked about and and I think the method this conversation with Elizabeth Warren\nAnd also President Trump has been very problematic from the beginning\nAnd I think using a DNA test to\nValidate that history ... was probably the wrong approach\n[noise] it's interesting there because you don't want to criticize gets her intentions for doing this but then it was actually what she did write the message the way that it was done with the issue a DNA test itself was it that it was covered up by the media inappropriately\nIt's all of the above when we're covering Indian country one covering tribal communities we have to take not just look at the language we use but the way we talk about them the problem I had with senator Warren's approach was that it kind of fosters a narrative that as damaging to native people\nTo give you a little bit of context I I have a very similar story to Senator Warren I Am not much darker than she is a outwardly the place for that video shot is probably just a couple of miles from my home I live in Norman, Oklahoma that's where I'm Talking to you from now\nAnd so I don't fault her for wanting to know more about her history or in fact I Would encourage her to do so but I I think when you invite people to talk about the degree of of your blood quantum which is the degree of your Indian blood which is something that is documented by the government\nAnd in my case certainly you're opening up two conversations that feed into stereotypes and myths about native people blood quantum is a very uh ... subject it's an institution of colonialism it was something that was put in place to essentially weed out our levels of of\nIt was something that was put in place to essentially weed out our levels of of of native blood so\nBy putting a stop on me a degree to which you're allowed to join your tribe which is a choice that tribes are able to make as they are sovereign nations\nThen it makes it less likely that your children will be able to be tribal members if they don't have the same amount of Indian blood is you do my tribe for instance the Cherokee Nation we don't have a blood quantum so as long as you can prove lineage you are a member\nUm to say that someone who is one eighth as more of a say or is more native than someone who is one thirty second for instance\nI I think is wrong I'm we're not just talking about a racial distinction here we're talking about a political distinction it's there's a citizenship question I Am a citizen of a sovereign nation as well as being a descendent of an indigenous person\nCan you help us understand a little bit more when you talk about blood quantum what does that mean a Native American community\nSo when the government put many of us on the trail of tears my great great great grandfather for instance they wrote his name down where he was from and where he was headed to\nThat record still stands and it makes it easy to easier to trace my lineage back to my Cherokee roots\nThat way I can show the nation that I Am a descendent of this person I Am a member of this nation and I can be enrolled as such now some tribes have blood quantum in place uh my my son for instance has also part of Iowa\n... the ... nation of Oklahoma you have to be one fourth pilot to join the Navajo Nation is similar\nBut when it comes to DNA tests I think we need to keep in mind that a DNA test doesn't prove that you're a Native American there is no DNA test to shed say definitively you are an indigenous person\nWhen it comes to tribal issues DNA tests or use to show who your parents are to show that lineage just showed that you are a descendent of this person it's not a test that you can take to say yes I Am tired or I Am Cherokee or I Am Navajo\nI'm Wondering in terms of the media coverage of this did you feel like native perspective we're being included in the reaction to senator warrants decision um to release this video\nFelt like there was a lot of attention given to Senator Warren how she feels about Trump's rhetoric towards her which I Will agree is is not okay it's not acceptable the way President Trump speaks to her about race\nBut I felt there was more emphasis on how Senator Warren was affected by it rather than how her response affects indigenous people I think\nHer response helps foster this narrative that like I said her blood quantum is important or that a DNA test can prove that your indigenous neither one of those things are true in reactions I have seen from indigenous scholars writers and just regular tribal members off the street\nIs is mostly one of anger they're not happy with the way that this has shaped the public discussion\nThey don't feel like Senator Warren has made efforts to understand them or their perspective\nAnd they feel again like\nTheir own narrative is being perverted and the public eye I think we need to keep in mind that when we're talking about indigenous communities we're talking about some of the most isolated communities in the country and I don't just mean physically yes some of those communities are isolated physically\nBut there is an invisibility problem with Indian country non native people by and large don't understand Indian country they don't understand sovereignty they don't understand a tribal membership and they don't understand like I was saying that this is a citizenship question as well as a racial distinction\nI think all of those things together just compound the problem of misperceptions and stereotyped\nThings get together just compound the problem of misperceptions and stereotypes that permeates popular culture when it comes to Native American people\nScrambling brewer is a reporter with the high country news and a member

o'clock here on W. us out\nI'm dancing Vega welcome back to the takeaway we've been talking about the proud\nBoys and the rise of far right hate groups with tiny Hernandez professor of law at Fordham University and the author of the forthcoming book multi racial and civil rights also with us is David ... author of all to America the rise of the radical right in the age of Trump and a correspondent for the Southern Poverty Law Center\nAnd Tanya I Want to pick up with you what is the driving force behind men in particular some men of color to have joined this group is that racism is it ...\nIt is both I mean talk about a parody medic intersection all example that is the conflation together of both of jet anti gender bias\nAnd race bias the ways in which that is a I guess you know you would think very toxic white masculinity and men of color are no exception to that of\nBeing seduced by the superficial power that that ah offers up is it\nBecome an easier to sell in this current climate\nIt in most definitely easy to sell because it combined both a quotes of Martin Luther king about not being racist at the same time that he talks about whiteness as being a culture that is worth uplifting as if you could take away from this ah racism\nI'm just curious how it is that people of color who are not by definition white ... gauge with that type of thinking\nUp because what they do is they disassociate to fight the of waiting is has culture from racism and any anti black and it says also reduce the idea of all the time about lack that it's about bad\nBlack culture David what's your sense of that I mean are you seeing is this a new form of hate group ideology that we're seeing across the United states [noise]\nWell in some ways it's actually very old I mean I started during this when I was covering the area and nations in Idaho in late seventies early eighties and lead to claim that they were only for white [laughter]\nAnd it's one of the realities of Ford's premises groups is that\nYou know the claim to just be pro white and defending white interests but you know who to believe they're pro white advocacy becomes a tax on other races but that's not how they sell themselves and of course what really is the underlying dynamic here\nIs less white supremacist them than authoritarianism and that's what they're selling\nAnd authoritarianism crosses all kinds of racial and ethnic and religious boundaries I'm you know we've got one of our main sort of a ... groups out here on the west coast is called patriot prayer\nAnd they're headed by a guy who's Japanese American and his right hand man is big Simone drive so ah yeah we get to see all kinds of non white yours joining their rights but when I talk to them every one of them has what we call it right wing authoritarian personality sunnier you wanted to\nIn here that I just wanted to throw in the idea that um it's not new but yes it is in some respects in in this much has that now these white supremacist groups are claiming to be welcoming to people of color I'm not just that there\nClaim to be welcoming to people of color I'm not just that they're pro white and this is just about culture and that they're not actually racist but they were OK with having non white members be part of their bandwagon\nAnd while they may be very much about authoritarianism and I agree with you there they're also spouting lots of pro white rhetoric and I don't think we should you know be dismissing that as I say in his budget has about authoritarianism it doesn't mean it's not about race\nYeah no that's absolutely right um it it is this very interesting mix and it's also it's an interesting mix of old and move because\nAh they're marketing it in ways that I mean the always the radical right was very backward looking and the shape of the ... radical right as very savvy very media savvy and very forward looking which is a problematic\nWell I also want to talk about the initial response to this here at least in New York City um the NYPD the New York police department said on Monday that it did have plans to arrest a nine members of the Proud Boys and three more anti fascist opponents but\nFootage from the fight that night shows the police arriving they just for the crowds but none of the Proud Boys actually were arrested and there were some accusations that the police the NYPD didn't do enough\nTo stop the attackers there was also an assumption that there was support here from the implicit support for the the the Proud Boys from the NYPD David do you think there's a level of support within law enforcement for right far far right groups like the Proud Boys\nYes I Do um I Believe that actually our law enforcement system throughout the country right now as as being very heavily politicized\nBy organizations like the earth keepers of which specifically or you know the ... century of patriot very far right organization that is recruiting law enforcement\nUh and they're succeeding so yeah I've been out covering a lot of these and I would say Portland police in particular are very prone\nTo uh acting in defense of the the right wing side and I'm very much uh acting against the they very much see\nThe uh anti fascist says the bigger problem and I think that's a problem\nTanya your your thoughts when I find fascinating about that David is that I think another aspect of this is that even for the police officers who don't actually view themselves as being invested in the white supremacist authoritarianism\nI think are very much swayed by the idea that what they are observing are it's just about free speech right that these folks are checked out in their ideas\nAnd I think that part of the underlying problem here is\nThe stereotype of the United states has being so absolute it's about free speech that you can say any kind of hateful thing on the street and it doesn't matter and it doesn't seem to me that it results in violent although history shows how intimately ... intertwined free speech is with racist violence\nI Do want to point out that we did reach out to the NYPD to take away did for comment about their response specifically to this incident and also\nThe claim that Gavin McGinnis said that he actually was supported by the NYPD so I'm going to read you a brief um a response from the NYPD and they'd say that they called me and it's an individual who to provoke a tour who does not speak for the NYPD\nThey say the NYPD is a diverse institution dedicated to keeping safe all eight point five million New Yorkers violence and disorder like what occurred on October twelve is unacceptable and will not be tolerated and the the statement does go on so they did respond to this request\nAt the national level what do you see uh do you see this it's a trend that going to continue to catch on is this something that'll go back underground what's your experience tell you\nYeah my experiences doesn't really help this because this is all new\nMy experience is doesn't really help this because this is all new I'm I'm obviously I think we all hope it goes back underground but I'm not very helpful in that regard because I think this was very much a creature of the Internet\nDavid night where does the author of all to America the rise of the radical right at the age of Trump and a correspondent for the Southern Poverty Law
