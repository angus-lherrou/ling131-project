certain went but I Do not believe that he was the is\nEmily a column does not up for re election in November but from what you've seen what's the reaction been so far to her vote I mean\nShe pretty popular in Maine and it seems to have at least for the time being harmed her obviously she's not up for election 'til twenty twenty eight so there's a lot of time between now and then that people are disappointed 'em\nAnd you will see sort of what happens in the next several months and years but I think that a lot of her constituents are disappointed and more broadly I think women around the United states who are looking to her to defend them are also disappointed and her\nWell and then not just disappointed there actually putting money towards funding her opponent what have we seen about that so far there's been a crowdfunding campaign to support whoever that the opponent would be whoever the Democratic opponent would be\nRight so there is a crowdfunding campaign run by be a hero

collaboration with W GBH radio in Boston [noise]\n[noise]\nOver the summer the White House made a declaration of the nation war on poverty would hold largely over and the success this is part of the administration's argument for an acting stricter work requirements for public assistance at the same time unemployment is at three point seven percent and the stock market is booming\nSo it's a war on poverty really one well this week we're working with the center for Public Integrity to check in on parts of the country that are still struggling with poverty our first stop today ... Texas the small poor border town depends on its relationship with Mexico just steps away across the Rio Grande\nThe town would also be directly impacted by the president proposed border wall [noise]\nYou know there's a lot of ... I'm sure there are some\nPlaces that have that that I mean it's quieted Wally\n... here to tell us all about this is a federal politics editor for the center for Public Integrity and he's the editor of its news six part series Dave welcome to the takeaway good to be with you tend to be so what is ... like\n... percent of your Texas is sort of this idiosyncratic little city in Texas uh I used to report from Texas I've been there several times\nIn a reporter Saddam Hussein who spent some time in the summer down there found a place that really cut against the stereotype of what a border town is in the United states and what I mean by that is that\n... is incredibly dependent on a cross border sister town in Mexico ... Mexico and as a result quite literally people depend on ... for\nThe basics of life groceries water a transportation family there's such a cultural connection almost a symbiosis there that were a border wall to be built um most of the people there feel as if the community would be\nNot only cut off but even killed by its own country and they feel that\nThe debate in Washington is a world away from the reality that they're living down there I ... which is very bleak and uh in high poverty a not a whole lot of crime but certainly a lot of needs that they feel go well beyond a a border wall they don't want the law at all\nWell let's talk a little bit about that I mean you said it's a high poverty area I'm going a quite an in contrast with what the administration announced this summer that the war on poverty is largely over what is the main concern for folks and ... if it's not immigration if it's not the wall is poverty or is it something else [noise] poverty\nBut it's also jobs which I suppose the two are inextricably linked it's health a very odd twist it in the story of bad if you have a a an injury if you're very sick and you need to get medical care\nThere is only the most rudimentary basic medical care available and not in ... and you have to rely on the hospitals and knock out to to get a critical medical care otherwise you're going to be\nA matter of fact to Texas a city that are in minimum will be an hour away and if you really need serious care it could be four hours away by car so as a result of people\nNeed serious care it could be four hours away by car so as a result of people feel very isolated or they feel that a Washington and the federal government in a way is not eating their concerns\nThis was a place for up until a couple of years ago the many of the streets were unpaved or in the city literally a dirt road town so something that you would expect to not necessarily in Texas but much more in Mexico but\nThe narrative is sort of flipped one eighty\nWhy is this now and it's interesting that you mentioned the narrative in effect for health care um Americans having to go across the border into Mexico to get health care I just want to make sure I understood that correctly\nThat's that's true and even for a non critical care your your dentist might be there is certainly a other\n... and daily necessities might be there too so health both in an acute situation but also to and and just keeping yourself a fender keeping your family fed and making sure that\nThat you have the basics of daily life this was really the reality there and if it becomes more difficult for the cross border flow to\nTo flow as it were then that would be something that would be potentially disastrous and many of the minds of the people are ... you were that to come to bear\nIt also seems to again also fly in the ... in the face of the narrative that we need to quote unquote build the wall\nUm when there's this type of symbiotic relationship going back and forth between these two communities\nYou know Dave you guys are looking at a number of different places around the country um and we'll be focusing on those throughout throughout the week but tell us why\nYou chose the place that you chose what is it about these individual places that um tells a story that's different about the nation's war on poverty\nYou alluded to it earlier but yeah Donald Trump or as president has taken a sort of victory lap this summer and into the fall\nSaying that hey the war on poverty has largely been one of the economy is incredible that the stock market is at its highest heights and for many parts of the country that is absolutely true and people are doing extremely well much underscore that but\nThere are places that feel incredibly forgotten and that even though things might be great on one coast or another in this big city or that\nThey are struggling and might be an issue of education and we go to Yahoo city Mississippi to tell her incredibly heart wrenching story there St Louis Missouri where housing is such an issue on everyone's mind or no should I say the lack there of\nUh we go to a place like Standing Rock reservation in North Dakota where people feel incredibly disenfranchised so all these places that\nWe may have only gone to sex but a representative of many other places throughout the country whether\nIt's the uh the mountains of West Virginia maybe the the rural parts of Florida Gary Indiana Flint, Michigan these are all places that that are struggling that that have a reality that goes against what the what some leaders in Washington would like to have you believe\nWell we've got about a minute left and obviously we've just got a couple of weeks left before the midterm elections what could those elections mean for communities like ...\nAll this was happening with the backdrop of the midterm election and people have a choice to make their making it now in early voting in some states\nThey will certainly had the opportunity to to make that choice in November ... election days so for places like this are struggling they they face a big question to which is whether they want to participate or even if they can participate the reality for a lot of people\nSimply when you're working three jobs and just trying to make ends meet and keep your head above the poverty line it's very difficult to participate in it and it's such a critical voted to one that we're facing right now\nThey ... the federal politics editor for the center for Public Integrity and editor of this new ... part series it

right Dominique Marie so\nShe was one of twenty five people elected by the MacArthur Foundation to receive what's been formally known at the MacArthur genius fellowship a grant of six hundred and twenty five thousand dollars that recipients can use however they'd like over the course of five\nYears it allows us to be able to practice hour hour and to have space and time to create new work\nWithout having to have the burden of figuring out where our income is wise to be derived from you know\nWe don't have to find a supplemental jobs to be able to do the work that we do we can actually just be the writer that we were sort of been pushing to be all of our career and\nMore read though has already carved out an impressive career for herself writing the Broadway bound musical into proud about the temptations and serving in the writers' room for the Showtime series shameless and she's also author of the theories of plays that in Detroit a city that's central to her identity home\nMom from Detroit I Would want to raise their my husband's from Detroit in my family lives there and so for me Detroit is personal it's about family I always say that\nDetroit is also a metaphor for black America in this country and then therefore America large I think so when people are looking at the city where sort of looking at\nThe social narrative a a narrative around race and economics and our nation and so for me it's important to be writing about that and\nWriting from a place of within a\nHave so much love for the city because I have so much family there and and I had such a really particular upbringing there and so\nI don't feel like Detroit has had very human picture painted about it in terms of media exposure and so for me I Want to be a narrator on the city that's held more humane picture of our city\nIn one of your most recent plays you take on the issue that we're calling the school to prison pipeline where children are essentially criminalized and I'm at very young ages and um something that's become a huge problem in in the United states how do you take a topic like that\nAnd bring it to the stage and keep audiences involved in such a heavy topic\nFirst of all I was an educator for many years and I was raised by an educator my mother was a teacher for forty years in highland park Michigan which is a\nA I call it a subsidy inside of Detroit um and so because of that I I just have a vast knowledge about teaching I spent so much time and so many schools across New York city and all of you know the many public high school an elementary schools\nAnd I have a very close and personal relationships or to teaching because of the public school teacher and private or teaching I've been in both\nUm and so it looking at that topic it's pandemic really and you have to look at it from really many angles or some might play pipeline is about\nLooking at it through a mother who's trying to write her son but also a mother who's a teacher and a public school so we get to see\nHer relationships with the public school system her son who goes to a private school and had relationships that private school system and we're looking at basically within the two forms of education how institutions can fail children an educator both in the public school\nInstitutions can fail children an educator both in the public school maybe infrastructure ally but in private schools culturally and both of those things are harmful to young people and can lead them to not having enough space for the total humanity and very emotional ... young especially young black and brown boys and our nation\nSo that was important for me to try to explore\nOur producer who was putting the segment together found a an interview that you've done with NPR and here's where you say\nI always say that we can't allow ourselves to be cherry picked you know or to be the flavor of the month flavors come and go and I think that it feels like we're being flavored right now as opposed to being institutionalized and grown up from the bottom up and I think\nYou were referring there to the opportunities the women of color specifically have within a the creative fields tell us a little bit about that what do you see going forward as now a newly minted MacArthur grant awarded the but also as a woman of color play right\nWell I think that change doesn't just looked like putting people on the cover of things or in the on the brochure of things and looks like if a structural change you know you have to change in leadership\nAnd we're seeing that evidence than large and small wave and our nation right now right and leadership it comes from the top down and so on because that in theater in particular it it means\nProgramming is decided by leaders you know how a theater as Ron How they're marketing department as Ron what kind of audience they're bringing in that's all decided by the institution and so it takes people within that institution and leaders within that institution to\nHave a very diverse backgrounds and for women of color\nTo being more positions of power and where they're making those decisions and so I think we need to see a shift and that so the work that I Do as an artist\nMy work is on stage but it's not just wanted to stay off of off the stage because it it it's a time in the world but I feel that\nIt doesn't make sense for me as a woman of color to have work about people of color and then they're not to be people of color on the audience there has to be a an entire collective shift\nThat invites audiences of diverse backgrounds inside the house to have an experience together that's what makes theater special and that's what my work has to be the catalyst for\nAn Dominique I Do I agree with you a hundred percent and they don't know how we make that change it starts first\nAnd foremost with community development I think that there's an assumption about what people of color will not spend their money on and that is ... but by and large because people are not following the buying patterns of people of color to suggest that we don't have the money or wall spend it on things out of the significant is false\nI think it is also it's about cultivating a relationship that makes people want to spend their money on something that's what the other hadn't figured out but I Do also think\nAffordability of tickets is a big deal and that needs to be that needs to be addressed in theater there there's too much of a disparity between ticket prices especially when you're talking about Broadway but the biggest thing I think it's community development which means you cannot expect people to come to you\nLeave their communities to come over to see something at your house if you are not ever willing to go to them\nYou have to be willing to take work out and said their community offered them something for free I always use it in terms of like food I say you know why would I leave my house where I Know\nI can cook [laughter] I have my food so it comes to your house and eat junk food and I don't even know that you can cook and you brought me they're all samples\nLike why would I spend money for comes out to eat the food and I don't even know that I like your food that doesn't make sense you have to you have to give me give me some samples to bring me out and show me that I'm not just a flavor but somebody that you're really trying to cultivate ... ...\nI'm not just a flavor but somebody that you're really trying to cultivate a meaningful relationship was that if that kind of thing that I think is missing and that we have to start doing and being way more active about\nDominique Marie so the playwright whose work includes skeleton crew and pipelines thank you
