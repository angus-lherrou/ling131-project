USF eighty nine point seven\nAcross six states thousands of teachers participated in strikes or walkouts this year demanding higher pay and calling attention to years of state budget cuts to education funding the strikes have become one of the most defining protest movements of the year\nThe schools have not seen the same kind of ... that the economies have 'em and I think teachers saw that and we're getting really really frustrated\nThat's Mariah billing get national education reporter for the Washington Post I spoke with her about why teachers' strikes began and how they were affecting the midterms\nWell I think there's a few things at play I Do think that conditions in the schools um in some places that leads to get worse\nBecause now we're not only talking about teacher pay but states are facing huge revenue problems um as a result of tumbling oil prices and also because of tax cuts and some states have not even recovered\nSince the recession even though their economies that I think also sort of the general energy in the country inside of activism and there's also a lot of frustration about education secretary Betsy the boss and the fact that she was appointed\nEven Republican teachers even teachers who support Trump are very frustrated with her appointment\n[noise] in looking at places like Arizona and Oklahoma in West Virginia did the teacher activism what impact did that have on ways in which teachers were funded themselves and the schools were funded\nSo in West Virginia they did succeed in getting a raise as they did in Oklahoma\nI'm In Oklahoma what was really extraordinary and the teachers successfully press the legislatures into a raising taxes on the oil and gas industry which is incredible in Arizona I'm the governor there Doug juicy had pledged twenty percent raised by twenty twenty\nBut there's a lot of skepticism that he can actually make that happen because he's relying on some pretty rosy revenue production and he's holding to applied should never raise taxes\nSo it's your expectation then that these fights are just beginning rather than that these marches marked an end to something or they actually a beginning\nI think we're seeing actually a transformation of the energy we've seen teachers run for office teachers got politically involved in other ways teachers throw their weight behind long shot candidates like Richard ... Gita in West Virginia\nWho was one of the fruits lawmakers to stand up on behalf of teachers in the state I've talked to teachers who are deeply familiar with state policy now and they never were politically active before\nCertainly people I've spoken to said that they've seen a huge increase in the number of teachers who have run and not only that but lawmakers that stood against teachers or cross teacher unions seem to be getting punished in Oklahoma for example\nSomething like a half dozen state lawmakers who were incumbents were ousted in the primaries that same happened in West Virginia out there you're seeing a lot of states teachers are are really flexing their muscles and a lot of different ways\nAre you noticing that voters have different perception of teachers and their expectations for what teachers should get paid and how they should be treated\nHaitians for what teachers should get paid and how they should be treated than voters have been seeing teachers in previous times\nYeah I think two things I'm I've talked to grassroots organization in Arizona and and Oklahoma\nWho are sort of creating these pro education slate and so\nIt's not really about whether the candidate of the Republican or Democrat it's about uh where do they stand on raising funding for schools in Arizona something like forty percent of voters said that education with one of their top if not the top issue for them\nThe same thing in Colorado it's a huge issue\nI'm In Kansas to sort of indirectly the election has become sort of a referendum on whether Governor Brown backs tax cuts were a successor disaster\nSo I think there is I don't know if it's a changing perception of teachers but everybody has a visceral connection to education and I think the plight of educators it's getting a lot more attention now I'm rightfully so because in a lot of places and they're facing some pretty severe challenges\n[noise] so do you think we're in a new phase then of activism around the issue of education and teachers that were going to see beyond the ... election\nI Believe so even before the teachers' strikes or even as they were starting Republican governors started to recognize that that they needed to burnish their credentials on education and they started\nCampaigning on how well the refunding education it's no longer necessarily about tax cuts and responsible spending governor Doug do the has campaigned on being the education governor\nScott Walker Scott Walker who famously gutted the power of a public sector unions and also cut school funding has been advertising the fact that he put a lot more money into school during his tenure and Scott Walker of course running against\nThe state superintendent of schools and I assume then that education is playing it very significant role in\nThe Wisconsin governor's race\nYes it's playing a huge draw 'em and I believe it's it may be one thing that is making that democratic candidate competitive\nIs the fact that he is the superintendent of education so I think this was going to happen anyhow but I think there is there's a recognition that schools are really important to people and that they don't want to see them in destitute condition Mariah thank you for joining us yes thank you\nMariah billing get is a national education reporter for the Washington Post [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nMy name is more dangerous in the

international collaboration with W GBH radio in Boston [noise]\nIt feels a little bit like an hot there or not the whole\nBody so when you go to\nThe political version of parrot heads or Grateful Dead heads Haiti Rogers of the White House correspondent for the New York times\nJust made she's been to about Fifteen to twenty Trump rallies in the past year I spoke with her about how they become a political statement from any Trump supporters it's important to note that\nPeople you know like any other group they're not really a monolith so I can only speak anecdotally from the reporting I've done I've talked to a lot of people but you know one of the prevailing seems I find is that people come because they feel like they can come and talk\nAnd be in the open about their political beliefs or um I guess one example I was I was in Springfield, Missouri rally last month and I'm In the midst of Brett Kavanaugh and I talked to many women because I was just curious to get their take and take their temperature on it many when it felt like they couldn't really talk about\nThe reasons why they wanted Kavanaugh confirmed the reasons why they thought Republicans we're actually moving too slowly because they are in their mind there used to being jumped on an attack for voicing opinions so in in ironically enough it's sort of like a safe space for a lot of these people\nYou can think that's wrong or I think that's right based on your own political beliefs but they have gathered there because they have somebody on stage who is reflecting the frustration they feel\nA back to them and crowd and host sort of leave these events with another fix like to go forward with the energy to keep feeling like political outsiders\nThat's what I was gonna ask you is do you think that people who show up to the Israelis see themselves as political activists I think increasingly so I think um one one important\nComponent of these rallies which it's not talked about a lot because it's not really a sexy topic but the campaign looks at these events at data mining expedition so they go in they have a pretty um you know they have a digital sign up process so to get a ticket which they're free but you give over your\nYour cell phone information on that campaign can learn a lot about you just just based on your sign up to attend the rally they want to build 'em you know sophisticated sort of kiosk checking systems in the future when you buy merchandise you turn over your driver's license which is common and a lot of sort of\nA political settings to turn over you know information like that\nBut I'm the campaign is using that to sort of spur future activism to keep in touch with these people to get them face to face with other people in their neighborhoods so they can leave these rallies and go home and ... knock or make phone calls or get involved at their local GOP headquarters um there's this whole other\nBackbone to these rallies beyond the political theater where the ...\nThe other backbone to these rallies beyond the political theater where the campaign is working really hard to harness voter information spur activism and also raise a lot of money you see that the campaign has just raised another huge amount of funds I think it's a hundred million or something like that so\nThese events are are not just um an opportunity for the president to air as grievances um it's an opportunity for people to to go back home and get involved [noise] yeah because\nYou know we're we're looking at the activism on the other side right do you see the women's marches and the other protest to Donald Trump and I\nWas wondering if the people who attend these Trump rallies see themselves doing that same sort of political activism right if people are taking the streets against the president I'm going to show up to a rally as a way to show my political a viewpoint\nYeah people definitely voice that as a as a reason for why they support Donald Trump at all a lot of his supporters are older white people who have voted in elections before and they have told me you know dozens of them I guess a after attending a lot of these rallies\nThat they had not really been involved\nOr you know they they were quiet during the Obama years and then in Trump they found a candidate that where they felt like they could get out and get behind and I think that people very much see themselves as a part of his you know I don't want to use this word but the campaign uses the word as part of his army of\nOf supporters and the campaign is very clear about wanting to build what they have called sort of an army of volunteers um\nThere's a lot of that are wrapped up and and the Puerto identity I think\nAnd is your sense too that these voters are going to be active in the midterm campaigns I Know the president the other day I'm In an ape you interviewed said well I don't know I hear from some of my supporters because I'm not on the ballot they may not show up\nWhat's your sense well I mean about a month and a half ago I mean I think right before Kavanaugh sort of exploded you know people in the White House we're looking at data from a Republican pollsters that said exactly that that the president was going to have\nA turnout problem because he wasn't on the ... the ballot but what I Do think has happened is I think prospective voters had been mobilized by\nThe the Kavanaugh confirmation um there's like a there's a thought that the performance on behalf of the Democrats has almost been looked at it as a political gift by\nRepublicans in the White House Republican close to the president Republican pollsters\nWho said you know the president has not performed as well to mobilize moderate voters but the Democrats have sort of given us this political gift of being able to call them a mob and that's really changed the tenor head of the midterms is really given the president and his advisors a sense that it's still there game\nHave you noticed as we get closer to the election that his his scripted sounds a little bit different than it did earlier in the year\nYeah you've done something that's kind of new in the past month or so which is\nPersonified the midterms by saying you're voting for me I'm I'm On the ballot you know think of me is on the ballot you're voting for me and don't let me down and if you pay attention to the local Republican candidates in these areas um they go on you know before\nThe president does or you know briefly during the president's appearance saying you know basically the same thing to that effect you know if we you know the president will suffer the president full will suffer if you don't come out and vote\nBut the campaign is banking on is that these people are going to come home and talk to their neighbors knock on doors start little volunteer groups and and burn in sort of animate activity right before the midterm kitty\nBurn in sort of animate activity right before the midterm
