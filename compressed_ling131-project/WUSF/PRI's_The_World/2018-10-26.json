hearing that we had a possible match\nOr just validated my unbelievable faith and confidence in the mental and with law enforcement and in particular of the FBI lab there's a reason why the FBI's lab is known as one of the very best in the world and the folks who work there\nAre extraordinary and once I knew that they had a print I was pretty confident that we'd be able to find the right person as far as the the devices themselves\nA it's important to say as as is in the complaints\nAre that even if the devices and we're still trying to determine whether or not uh they were functional as they say so we're doing all kinds of analysis on that to make a definitive determination but they did contain\nInterject material or which if subjected to the right combination of heat for shock of friction or could be dangerous to the public and the public should treat any device like that according\nTo how could you tell us plainly why was targeting\n[noise] I don't\nKnow and then uh what you might uh normally expect a ah may have been apart it appears to be a partisan but that would be determined by the facts as the case goes forward I'm not able to comment on that you see cooperating [noise]\nWe're not going to be just as in what it investigates stance at this um [noise] um [noise] what\nGiven more ... more focus\nNot on the talk but on the work the work of the men and women of

people committing acts of violence under any motivation\n[noise] your belief that the only one boss\nYou continue to make reference to other\nYou have any sense of how many\nSo ah as I said at the ... and I think the attorney general's side as well uh this is very much an active and ongoing investigation or we do believe that we've got the right guy a but we also know that this is an ongoing investigation and there's a lot of work still to be done which means there's still plenty of unanswered questions\nBecause of the breaking news today we're changing our normal weekday programming and bringing you the live NPR program here and now thank you so much for joining us\nIt's three twenty funding for here and now comes from the listeners of WB or Boston and from staples with print and

Hawaii is practically vanished the small bit of space\nIsland in Hawaii is practically vanished\nThe small spit of sand known as east island was critical habitat for endangered green sea turtles in monk seals today it is mostly underwater hurricane lock a tour through the central Pacific earlier this month and literally white east island off the map\nSatellite photos show only sliver of land where the eleven acre island once stood out from the ocean and climate scientists say a warming ocean could be to blame chip Fletcher is a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii joins us now in in ... you were on Easter Island in July\nWhen you heard that it had just been washed away what what was your reaction\nWell it was quite stunning um I had not followed hurricane our last guy I knew it as headed north from us but it never occurred to me that I liked a head into\nFrench crickets roles and do damage to these very important small islands [noise] um so I was quite stunned\nMost people have probably never heard of this island we're going to post before and after pictures of hearing now dot org but tell us about it and why it was important to you\nWell it's a beautiful place um my research team which consists of a undergraduate and graduate students and some postdoctoral researchers headed up there in July ... with the national fish and wildlife association\nThat is loose sand and gravel it's made of uh the skeletal debris of the surrounding reef system as small as it is it is absolutely critical to the Hawaiian green sea turtle into monk seals there is just not much land up there\nThis is low so it's easy for them to haul out of there is a sort of upper region to the island where the turtles could um they are and that's and lay their eggs safely\nAnd they're only about a half dozen of these that were left but in the last month we've lost two of them one of them being deceased island which was the largest one around that remained\nWhat are the implications for those animals nearly half of the world's remaining green sea turtles nests there and one seventh of all the Hawaiian monk seals alive today were born on this little islands I mean this this is very important for the animals will they survive without it\nYeah yeah um [noise] the implications for these animals are they will have to find new habitat and if you look at the photo that was taken this past weekend by government scientists who flew over the island\nYou can see a small little bit of fans still sticking up above the waves and there must be a dozen monk seals already hauled out on that so it points to the fact that this is really important land they'll have to find a new place for raising their young lay their eggs [noise]\nUm and there are fewer and fewer of these places left will they turn to the south and come to the main Hawaiian Islands\nThat can be problematic because much of the during area in the main islands has been developed with roads and houses can they turn to the north but some of the other ... are there are some additional Sandy islands to the north but not very many huh\nYou knew this island was low line it was Sandy loose and did you expect it to vanish one day or were you surprised at the hurricane to this much damage\nWell answer is yes to both of those I figured I'm\nThat this island under the threat is female arise maybe had another decade or two or three but certainly by mid century um it it would I Would be surprised if it were still in existence\nI didn't expect with a location this far north that it's a very strong chance of being intercepted by a hurricane but of course with climate change these weather systems are finding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and they're\nOur funding new pathways they're migrating away from the equator and their new areas new habitats and new human communities that are being threatened by hurricanes to that hadn't happened before\nThe twenty Eighteen hurricane season we're seeing actually is one of the most intense on record in the Pacific um or the other islands around there that are there are also in danger or their other problems that you foresee happening because of that\nYes it was and still is a very intense hurricane season and I think a earlier this week we saw a hurricane strikes in northern Mary Ellis island uh at one point the wind gusts approach two hundred miles per hour the average wind speed was up around a hundred and sixty five miles an hour\nAnd um you know there's just an example of what a category ... hurricane would look like even though we have no such category and such last year hurricane season and twenty Seventeen scientists are now thinking ah with the growth in hurricanes are getting larger the wind speed stronger maybe it's time for a new category\nIs there a chance that Easter Island could come back someday\nThere is a chance for sort of crossing our fingers it looks as if the sand um was a moved by that hurricane to the north and north east the\nTrade when waves may push them back\nTowards a word originally was and what you might see some accretion or building of the island but our understanding of these islands is that they formed on a falling\nSea level around two thousand years ago we are currently in a stage of rising sea level and so the fundamental background conditions for reforming the ... or don't exist\nThat ship Fletcher a climate scientist at the University of Hawaii thanks for speaking with us yeah thank you\nAnd on the conversation now with connections to climate this one pertaining to the economy the U.S economy grew at three and a half percent in the third quarter of this year according to government figures out today one of the few things that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree on is that economic growth is good for everybody\nBut our next guest argues the uprising economic growth has quoted driven us into a ditch from an environmental standpoint\nAnd chasing chowder easy executive director of the Brooklyn Institute for social research he says if we want to deal with climate change small incremental change won't work he says we need to rethink our system of capitalism starting with our obsession with economic growth because of focus on growth causes us to prioritize\nThe wrong things\nThere are lots of things in the short term could mean certain kinds of economic growth there's a lot more money right there's a lot more than ... GDP to be made an extra activism than there is in ... and sort of sustainability\nUm so actually what we need to rethink the searching the conversation from and this is a huge shift it's not just a shift about policy to shift about the way we imagine politics the lady imagine economic\nIt's not so much do we want growth do we want less wrote it what do we actually want from ... usually when people say oh I Want high growth rate\nWhat they mean something like oh high growth rates are going to lead to more prosperity um but I actually know I can do nice pair comparison right I'm a very high growth rates in China we have very high growth eighth in India and yet somehow China seems to be able to turn those into slightly better social outcomes than India is a lot of what we associate with growth\nUm can be achieved through other means distribution on means other ways of thinking about economic outcomes than what we ...\nIs this an academic exercise or do you really happen\nIt is possible do I think it's like a hundred percent uh like it's a certainty now in fact there is like so much arrayed against it I think so often this conversation about climate change gets ... and he's like hilarious things like oh are you\nConversation about climate change gets ... and he's like hilarious things like oh are you like how much plastic surgery recycling how much are you can posting have you eaten more beans and meet right like as opposed to like\nHow have you worked to make an actual democratic politics more possible to have you become part of a movement how are you doing those things those things are actually much more important believe it or not that our individual consumption choice\nWhat kind of movement I mean like when you give give me one thing okay so I could not I'm not going to eat red meat any more but you're not stead of that you become part of a movement that would do what\nAnyone who would emphasizing any movement that it's trying to move the needle\nTo give more power to popular sovereignty and lashed to Capitol less to the sovereignty of of concentrated wealth and money I'm going to not necessarily cause all the changes that I Am saying but it is necessary but what kind of movement give us an example\nYou can think of to sort of a tendencies wanted to sort of rise above sort of reinvigorated left or whether you associate that with\nA democratic socialist America or other movement um that is a very important part of the conversation\nAnother would be very local organization but with a sort of very grand division of this will be groups like cooperation Jackson, Mississippi who are really trying to build a sort of ego um sustainable society from the ground up meaning what oh meaning that they are working you know both to set up a sort of\nA system of greater democratic government they're trying to and they are succeeding in some ways to build a sort of ego sustainable city from the ground up including agriculture including manufacturing on but that doesn't ignore these political and economic parts of the story right that are trying to put really a democratic control as\nFrom NPR News in the wild things\nConsidered starts at four o'clock here on W.

what's changed the story so they weren't attacking them\nWould what's changed the whole story so they weren't attacking them threatening him all the time so they would do the same with me but not the same level so I said once you know we wanted a girl by us the the the\nTimber son Jimmy Carter was one of them was like I Do have an idea of creating an army to compare that being the instruments Jim I really liked the idea\nI said but he has a problem you know I have no gosh we have to get the uh through the activists phone numbers to activate their Twitter come on we cannot do that to somebody for numbers because then they're going to be on danger\nA sort of on that I'm going to give you five thousand American Dollar get some some Kearns I'm given the activist the numbers that thing\nSo you would buy the sim cards with Canadian and American phone numbers give them to people in Saudi Arabia so that they would be harder to trace yes and then they could combat the pro Saudi trolls as you call them online or with their own information campaign\nYes but we ask them you know we we had over ... you know you've got to you is very bad language you cannot Britain and someone who cannot be a
