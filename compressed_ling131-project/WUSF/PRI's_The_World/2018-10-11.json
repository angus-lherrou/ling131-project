USF feeding on for seven ... thank you so much for joining us\nA couple of events to watch you know about you like is the monthly music and movies in the park party under the stars in St Pete's strobe park the music is from Nicholas in hopper and movie is clueless\nSpeaking of movies the Tampa international gay and lesbian film festival continues with screenings this afternoon and evening at the Tampa theater matters and taught me how to make ... news\nAt the tip of theater masses and taught me how to make bothered the news on YouTube I mean that's enough of a promo right maybe has lived a life working in tough kitchen fighting addiction and finding themselves Canada's most popular celebrity chefs that we have a new book about food but also about family\nThat's coming up on cue for fear I public radio international\nWe hope you'll checkout cue from the CBC ... like at eight o'clock right after the rebroadcast of fresh air [noise] this is Wu as I said you know with seven your NPR station\n[noise] this has to take away the tansy Nevada all this week we've been talking with reporters at the center\nFor Public Integrity about their series abandoned in America which explores cities and towns across the country where poverty it's inescapable\nIn St Louis Missouri a major component of the crisis it's affordable housing there just isn't enough of it and for many of the rest of them to do manage to get subsidized place to live conditions only adds to the indignity of living and working in poverty there was a mall\nAnd so it was getting rid of the mole they just go after them over the road you know the ceilings you know it might have a lot of rules my gosh I'm not [noise]\nThat's January Harris a mother and receptionist in St Louis January went from living in an apartment run by the St Louis housing authority to a townhouse run by a private landlord one that she paid for with help from a federal section ... voucher program but even though she works full time January says the assistance she's getting is not enough\nAnybody that has won ... or or other town or some type of housing assistance they need it nobody is usually that if they are low income families you know again sables they were people were three part time job is not an oil spill is not\nThere is a big discrepancy in St Louis and economy that President Trump likes to both the stronger than ever and the stagnant under class of people trapped in poverty and challenged every month to keep a roof over their heads that will if he should beach I'm a political reporter at the center for Public Integrity found in her reporting\nIn St Louis especially in the city about twenty six point seven per cent of the people there are living below the federal poverty level it very difficult and you are very low or extremely low income to find affordable housing and especially if you need a sense\nThe last time the city opened its housing choice voucher commonly known as section eight within twenty fourteen so when you have people waiting years hoping that they'll be able to receive a voucher\nA for housing that will accommodate them and their children I'm there also are waiting list for a public housing in the city in the county as well\nNow what are your options if you are waiting for a section ... voucher where what do you do in the meantime\nIt's not really a pretty picture people are either an unstable conditions there living with family members that might even be facing homelessness where they're living in South park a housing conditions as they wait for years to find housing\nI'm curious if you can help us understand how the section eight voucher program works and um I Know what the complicated program there are many different kinds but what what is it generally do yes\nWith the U.S actually need health insurance voucher system it allows for a person to seek housing through a privately owned property um and the federal government will pay a subsidy to the section eight accepting landlord and the tenant will pay the difference uh based on their income\nThat thing landlord and the tenant will pay the difference uh based on their income\nStill about January Harris January here is um lived out in Ferguson, Missouri she lives in the county of St Louis\nWithin a week of her moving into her town home for her and her youngest daughter\nMichael Brown was killed by police officer in that housing complex is just a two minute drive away and she has worked for most of her time as an adult down at least I went back to her work history back to two thousand\nAnd so she is technically checking off the personal responsibility boxes that\nPresident Trump and Carson and I have said are we to get out of this system but at the end of the day it's just not enough she does make money she does technically an above the state minimum wage jobs seven eighty five\nBut even with that it's it's hard for her to make ends meet because as soon as she got her job at um a local nonprofit in St Louis before she got her first paycheck her rent had increase\nSo if it wasn't like completely for the rest I guess I can see\nI'm not receiving any child or [noise] I work every day there trees\nI mean they they made it to be said for families to transition to where they do not me say this and there's no way to get off I was probably just\nShe's essentially not able even with her current employment able to even get off of section ... housing right now because money is just too tight\nIs the housing situation that you're describing a where there's limited housing available and long wait times for section ... vouchers is that being exacerbated by gentrification at all\nI think when it comes to public housing and section eight how thing I'm not quite positive if it's being exacerbated by gentrification my sent a through my reporting is that\nThe housing authorities are wander highly underfunded um and that is not a partisan or something unique to this administration\nInto it can be difficult to find landlords you want to accept\nA section eight housing choice voucher holders because of all the stigma that come with that really that's racism or whether that's your fear that they may not care for the property\nAnd also for the landlord a there is a long process of paperwork and inspections I go to whether or not you choose to be a section eight landlords so\nI think it's a lot of bureaucracy at play the reason why it's so hard to find affordable housing well\nLet's also talk about um what the current administration's stance is when it comes to public housing I'm thinking specifically about Ben Carson a HUD secretary who essentially ... did a twenty Fifteen rule\nThat require communities that receive HUD funding make an effort to integrate their neighborhoods where does that stabbed\nIn the Nineteen fifties in the Nineteen sixties there was the wave of white flight to the suburbs\nAnd what you have now is a county that is mostly white and in the city it's pretty much predominantly black\nSo there is concerned that there will be more division because of the undoing of this rule because it's no longer mandated that you make an effort to try to integrate your community\nHer mandated that you make an effort to try to integrate your community the president has said that the war on poverty is largely over or does that reconcile with what you saw in St Louis\nYeah I'm not at all actually I'm when I'm visiting very community especially along north side\nPeople are just pointing around saying hey look at this look at all these empty houses look at all these abandoned homes nobody coming here and people are concerned about how they're going to make ends meet and that economic prowess and\nGrowth that Trump feed for America doesn't really reconcile with what I saw in much of the city\nAnd the teacher beach him as a political reporter at the center for Public Integrity ... thanks for your reporting Oh thank you

Morris the only black woman in Vermont legislature dropped out of her reelection rate because of racist on line threats and harassment\nBlack women also face extra hurdles when campaigning like gathering funding and national endorsement\nKimberly peeler Allen is here to talk about these issues and she's the co founder of higher heights for America\nAnd organization working to elect black women for public office\nKimberly thanks for joining us and it's a pleasure to be here what an interesting topic this is um let's talk a little bit about motivation right what I mean we were hearing was in the year if the woman and everybody wants to run for office but there's one is particularly driving women of color more specifically black women to run for office\nWell I think it is um\nYou know this confluence of events that we are that we find ourselves in a black woman had been running and doing the work behind the scenes for generation they are thinking back to like Fannie Lou Hamer and Barbara Jordan you know women have been a black woman had been in the trenches\nAnd now there is this new sense of urgency we're seeing the attempt and in many cases the actual reality of the roll back to the last fifty years of progress\nAnd we're seeing that black women are saying I Can't let this happen to my community so I'm going to step up and run and it is um that combined with\nUh the electorate realizing that you know over eighty percent of our elected officials across the country are white and male\nAnd that is you know by no means represent the diversity in this nation and the electorate a thing you know we need to have some different voices around the table\nAnd these black women are speaking to my issues\nAre regardless of you know the fact that they're black or they can appeal to everybody and it has really been a great um catalyst for all of these women to run such strong primaries and you know we really looking forward to some great pickups on November sex\nSo let's talk a little bit about that because there are some challenges specifically in and we know politics is is like any other industry right there are challenges as we mentioned to funding and and getting support here\nUm yesterday in the show we talked about how important black women are to the Democratic party they've been called the backbone of the Democratic party Ninety percent of black women voted for Hillary Clinton and twenty sixteen and yet they still lack of representation in the party's leadership one of the guests that we had raised this notion of viability of black women candidates\nThe guest that we had raised this notion of viability of black women candidates\nAnd I'm Wondering if you think black women candidates are thought of by the Democratic party as less viable because of who they are because they can't raise the money because they won't give them to support what is that about\nUm I think that's exactly at a higher heights was born out of the notion that\nWe needed a space for a black woman a political home for black women and go into a car and I we knew from our experience that the factors that make a black woman a viable candidate or not necessarily the same as our white counterparts\nAnd we know that by mobilizing our networks because that is what we do just you know to make life happen for so many of us\nAnd the volunteer effort and the word of mouth and then also be bringing our authentic selves uh to the campaign trail has really been\nA a great factor in the successes so we've always looked at Kennedy to a walk in the spirit of Shirley Chisholm on bought and unbiased and we look at what kind of a volunteer structure they have we look at\nA you know do they have enough money to reach their constituents we don't need you know the hundreds of millions of dollars that so many of these races caught but do you have the baseline of what it's going to take for you to\nReach your targeting voters and do you have a solid campaign plan\nAnd you know are you in line with issues that we believe will make sure that black women in their communities and their families thrive\nWe should also note that Nineteen of the black women who are running for the house are challenging incumbents here now that could work to their favor or not depending on what we talked about which is funding\nYou know how often it's the ability to raise money part of the viability of a candidate right because you mentioned you don't need hundreds and millions and millions of dollars but are there specific barriers to fund raising that black women candidates face in particular\nYou well I think there is you know unfortunately the um institutional wealth\nOr we haven't been here that long we've had a challenges to our communities that have not allowed us to a math uh the the type of wealth that some of our counterparts have uh the fact that black women are making sixty three cents on the dollar just you know from the jump you know we we need our whole dollar if we're going to be competitive\nBut I think it is also thinking through it's not just that the large checks but\nAh being able to mobilize our networks for those you know monthly five dollar contribution that add up over time\nAnd see those ah you know contributions as a strength because they're not just dollars but they're also voters then most likely volunteers and it's also a question of actually getting people to the polls I mean you can spend all the money you want and I think we saw that here in New York will out of what I like the end you across the aisle Cortez\nWho nobody thought you know this person was going to win and then she wins re handy will showed up at the polls how important is that\nFor black women candidates absolutely it is a ... that is the deciding factor we have to show up and show out at the polls to make sure that our voices are heard make sure that we have voices around the decision making table that reflect our priorities and there's a lot of racist this interest in the midterms will be watching Stacey Abrams a bunch of other folks\nKimberly peeler Allen is the cofounder of higher heights for America Kimberly thanks for
