seven news jazz NPR\n[noise] the takeaway with Amy Walter from WNYC NPR I public radio international collaboration with doubling GBH radio and bought\nThem [noise]\nWe continue our look at Trump's promises from twenty sixteen campaign and pick up now on trade [noise] then candidate Trump rent out a message and blow it up a bad deal\nI'm going to do are not the Martin and then I and then so immediately renegotiating the germs would not agree die I'm going to withdraw the night it strikes from the trans\nPacific Partnership and I'm going to direct the secretary of commerce to identify every violation of a foreign country his current way here's a harm due to the American worker\nSo how has he done you've had the very tough and very consistent in some ways anti free trade anti globalization and statistically anti China views that Trump's a candidate and try to president to put [noise]\nThat Susan Glasser again he pulled out of the TPP the Trans Pacific\nPartnership which with the major regional trade deal negotiated in the course of the Obama administration that was meant to be the major American and its allies respond to Chinese economic and increasingly security\nA muscle flexing in the region there's been no clear strategy to replace that except to engage in that ... on the economic front\nAnd here's Alex lots and lots of three sixty senior reporter on international trade\nIt's definitely true to say that he has carefully gone about restructuring America's trade deals and like they carefully only in that sense that\nWhile he would tell you that you are historical groundbreaking rewrite of past American trade deals most people will tell you that it's a little more reading a little more nuanced than that\nSo let's get into that nuance\nMost recently of course they has rewritten be North American free trade agreement and while it stopped short of I think sharing all the ills of the old NAFTA that\nTrump's ran on doing on that thing um it is definitely an improvement in the sense of just people conduct business differently than they did in Nineteen Ninety four when it came into effect\nBut here's the thing to understand a lot of what they agreed to in the new NAFTA deal was already part of the Trans Pacific partnership agreement negotiated under President Obama that President Trump withdrew from\nIn Canada and Mexico were in that agreement that was considered Obama NAFTA rewrite he also promised to rewrite NAFTA on the campaign trail two thousand eight um and that was waiting for Trump when he got there but instead of picking it up and asking Congress to pass it immediately with through the United states in the trade agreement but it was terrible you never really gave Pacific them what he didn't like\nSo it's a little disingenuous stinks for him to say none of this happened without me and the way I impose these tariffs to apply pressure on them but just not the case\nThe one thing that are two issues that the Trump Administration points to specifically the auto sector and on dairy and parrots or the brand new topics that the president was able to negotiate\nTopics that the president was able to negotiate into this new NAFTA deal\nYou have touched on the to at least that are the most different now there was a lot of work done on improving dairy market access to Canada in TTP\nWe got a little bit more in this new NAFTA but it's by you know a couple of different decimal point but uh the automotive rules are very interesting um it had their share of benefits for cars to minimum wage but at least sixteen dollars an hour and that is new that was not in the TPP\nWhat's gonna terrorists early in the president's administration there was a lot of handwringing especially from folks on Wall street some people within the president said ministry nation thing\nWe've got to stop all this parents talk the economy when great the more we talk about parents the better chance that we knock this really great economy off the rails [laughter] so\nThe economy still seems to be doing quite well and the president hasn't stopped talking about parent does that mean the president has succeeded and using parents as a tool for getting what he wants for the U.S on trade\nWhile you're correct that the economy is still very robust and growing but\nI Would say and many economists will tell you that the strength of the U.S economy is what is shielding the president from the adverse effects of terrorists not it's growing because of terrorists and as far as what he was hoping to achieve it seems entirely political to me at this point we began by talking about what he campaigned on and talk trade enforcement in the form of tariffs was part of that\nYou know I Will count your unfair trade practices by several partners namely China but it's it's manifested in other partners as well and that's what's happened\nBut it's not really forcing\nAnyone to the negotiating table you know he claims that NAFTA doesn't happen without tariffs but as I just laid out these are two of our closest allies they will always sit down and talk with us and that's just now basically what you're seeing is the terrorists beginning to take root and the most rapid escalation has been with China that\nThe terrorists now coverage hundred and fifty billion dollars worth of Chinese goods and those are beginning to cover consumer goods the last round of tariffs started to cover home electronics computers furniture or things like that\nConventional economic theory tells you that you're going to start to see prices raised on that and even though he can go out on the campaign trail and say gee I impose these tariffs 'cause I'm at work for you\nThe forward thinking you know voter will say okay yes you did that but what does it actually do for us that sort of where we're at on terrorists here it's true that he's impose them and through that he kept to his word on that\nBut on a broader scale I don't know that there's anything they can point to stay the terrorists got you act you know there's really no they're they're\nThe other thing the president talked a lot about as a candidate with the issue of the trade deficit and how large wise has there been a significant change in the trade deficit since he's been president\nYou had a significant changes that it has actually gone up quite a bit since he's come into office it's been an interesting tight rope for critics to walk because well he said I'm working on reducing a trade deficit um it continues to climb\nBut at the same time critic also said when he made those arguments the trade deficit\nIf it's high isn't really like necessarily a bad thing for our economy in many contexts it can be the mark of a very healthy economy because consumers are embolden to buy things the Trump Administration of President Trump himself continues to frame that as sort of a like\nA bank account right it's just like look at us losing all this money you either not understanding or willfully distorting the fact that it's actually just private companies and citizens who wants to buy things with their money it's not like we're flushing money down the drain we have great purchasing power in this country and we're using it and the other thing the print\nThe drain we have great purchasing power in this country and we're using it\nAnd the other thing the president talked a lot about as a candidate and he still does today which is to say listen I'm a free trader I'm not anti free trade I'm just fair trade if you had to greet the president on a free trade scale where would you put him\nI mean it's it's in the ... range I don't understand how anybody could look at two years of like rapidly and largely unprecedented disliking thirty\nLargely unprecedented escalation of of terrorists both with allies and with countries were working with and say this is a free trade president I think that's such a foolish state just stay with us raid that you're a free trader\nDown from us and thanks for joining us appreciate and Alex Lofton is senior reporter on international trade for law three things\n\nMany of us would like to win the lottery one

annoyed on double uterus so forth so [noise]\n[noise] somebody said the other day was the first thing you're going to [noise]\nWell we'll work immediately on repealing Obamacare [noise]\nSince the campaign President Trump has promised to repeal the Affordable CARE Act otherwise known as Obamacare Julie Rovner is chief Washington correspondent for Kaiser Health news host of the what the health podcast she tells us how well he's done so far [noise]\nWell the administration has done quite a bit actually sort of Congress the big thing that Congress did was in the tax bill after they were unable to pass\nTheir repeal and replace legislation they eliminated the penalty for not having health insurance the individual mandate penalty the president also cut off federal funding also for a controversial or at least the contested part of the law they gave special discounts to lower income people\nPeople with incomes below two and a half times poverty although in the end the insurance industry was able to find a workaround for that that ended up giving not only those people discounts but some other people discounts to\nThe other big thing the administration has done is it allowed\nDifferent kinds of insurance plans with basically lesser benefits than are required under Obamacare um they're called short term planted some they're called association health plans\nAnd the concern is that healthier people will move into these kinds of plant because they're cheaper but the problem is they don't offer very much and sometimes it's not entirely clear what they don't offer until you discovered that you need something so those are sort of the big things that have happened to the law in the last year um\nPresident like say the law is dead and then the next breath he likes to say but we fixed it and he also talked a lot\nAs a candidate saying that the health care premiums are going up one point he said they are going up to forty fifty fifty five percent there's still talk from the White House and Republicans that premiums are still sky rocketing what do we know about premiums on the exchanges at this point well\nActually very interestingly premiums next year for twenty Nineteen are going to go down slightly about one and a half percent the average premium in the states that are run by the the federal government which is most of them\nWhat analysts say that they would have gone down considerably more if not for some of the changes that the administration has made so the administration trying to have it both ways like look we made premiums go down and actually other things made premiums go down their actions made premiums mostly go up\nThe other thing we see is a change in polling and perceptions of the Affordable CARE Act\nBack during the campaign plurality of voters said they disapprove of the law now here we are two years later and the majority not significant but a smaller majority said that they support the Affordable CARE Act so ... how do you explain that\nA I feel like twenty Seventeen and the fight over repealing the law was basically the the marketing plan that the Obama administration never had for the law it taught people what was in it um basically tell people what was in it by suggesting what they were going to lose a particularly things like protection for pre existing conditions\nWe're going to lose a particularly things like protection for pre existing conditions expansions of Medicaid that had helped a lot of middle class people not just poor people that little caused people who are you know are being expect to take care of their aging parents um their Medicaid has proved to be much more popular than I think Republicans\nRealized um so it was it goes too much more than the laws much larger than just a five percent of people who are in these individual markets buying insurance\nAnd I think people actually learned just as it was getting ready to go away that maybe these are things we actually would like to keep around\n[noise] so what happens in twenty Nineteen the Republicans have said if we keep control of Congress we're going to go at it again we're going to take another repeal vote\nYou have Democrats many of them are running this year on something they call Medicare for all saying that they are going to make that a priority should they take control of Congress should you can you help us understand what could really possibly happen including Nineteen\nIt interesting that sort of the health debate is by for ... you know where's the Affordable CARE Act was intended to be a middle of the road moderate plan market base it could attract some moderate Republicans which in the end they didn't but that was that was the idea now we're seeing sort of both sides are going to their corners Republicans\nSaying you know yes we want to get rid of this whole thing and start over with what we don't know Democrats are saying yeah maybe that's compromise thing didn't work we want to have Medicare for all single payer universal coverage\nCall it what you will but because I think people are frustrated with the state of the healthcare system right now\nEven if premiums are moderating out of pocket expenses are going up people are paying more or they perceive that they are paying more health care is simply too expensive\nAnd they're thinking that yes the Affordable CARE Act was a nice thing but people are still hurting and we need to do something more dramatic so you know what you end up with and are are are these sort of polar opposites and it's hard to see where there could be any middle ground where something could pass at least in the immediate future\nThe discussion about Medicare for all has been very active on the Democratic side the president himself took to USA Today he penned in an op ed\nWhere he argued that this proposal of Medicare for all is going to totally destroy Medicare as we know it for seniors and\nThat it's basically a form of socialism what do we know about the president's plan\nFor Medicare uh especially since we know that this is a big driver of government spending and there seems to be discussion every year about its potential bankrupting the country or running out of money so where does he seemed to be going\nWith discussions on this\nIt's not I'm actually surprised just didn't come up until now Medicare has been a\nA a traditional issues or Medicare scare tactics have been traditionally issue for Republicans in midterms um because older people tend to vote in larger numbers in midterms and this goes back to twenty ten when the Republicans were trying to undermine the Affordable CARE Act they were not so much arguing about the the parts of the law that we think of as Obamacare\nThey were arguing about all the money that the Affordable CARE Act cut out of Medicare\nUm ironically in the interim the Republicans when they got into office um said and yeah those Medicare cuts that were in the Affordable CARE Act which were mostly cuts to provider payment for beneficiaries actually got more benefits out of that law but there were reduction in payments to hospitals and doctors and\nFor a variety of other things\nAnd the Republicans decided that they were going to keep those cuts because they made sense and because they needed the money uh interestingly a President Trump's own budget recommend\nThe money uh interestingly a President Trump's own budget recommend more cuts to Medicare again mostly the provider payments um but for the president it to then go out and bashed the Democrats for having\nCut Medicare and the Affordable CARE Act yeah that that doesn't really work for the Republican now the argument that Medicare for all will undermine Medicare is a relatively new one that seems to be the favorite Republican line of attack it's like\nThey will not only make America you know a socialist program they will get rid of Medicare for seniors to um at least on her most of the Medicare for all bills we've seen seniors would get more benefits and have to pay less\nHow the country could afford it is a debate that needs to be had\nBut it's a little bit of an of an odd scare tactic to say that that seniors would lose Medicare if the country went to Medicare for everybody\nTo really wrap our thanks for joining us my pleasure\n\n[noise] whole lot of companies about a whole lot of trouble
