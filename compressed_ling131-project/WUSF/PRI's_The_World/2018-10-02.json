still being felt at the southern border while the majority of the children that garnered national attention this summer has been reunited with their parents there's another crisis in the making a record number of migrant kids in federal custody most of whom cross the border alone\nThe federal government is increasingly relying on makeshift tent cities for these kids one is in New York Texas and one is in Miami Dade County\nAnd while this is not the first time the federal government has used tempting captain for migrant children this time around critics say it's a crisis of the government's own making joining me now to discuss this is Bob more an independent journalist based in El Paso who writes about the border for publications like Texas Monthly and the Washington Post high Bob\nI thanks for having me thanks for being with us and mark Greenberg the former head of the U.S department of health and Human Services administration for children and families under President Obama mark thanks for being with the show and thanks very much\nIt's about let's start with you the federal government now has more than twelve thousand eight hundred kids in its custody that's five times as many as last year how did we get here\nOne topic to stop this is now well over thirty thousand according to numbers I got yesterday uh children have been crossing the border unaccompanied from Central America in large numbers sense around two thousand for the mark and talk about how the Obama administration dealt with it\nBut the Trump Administration has changed some policies\nYou have overall sort of this climate out there that makes immigrant families very unlikely to step forward and try to take sponsorship\nOf these children who arrive at the border on a company and then you had the implementation of very specific policies\nParticularly a new requirement that any family that wants to sponsor one of these children who arrives at the border without a parent or guardian which is usually another family member much now submit their fingerprints to ice as well as the fingerprints of any adult in the household\nMost of these families of course have at least one undocumented member in the household and this is just had a massive chilling effect on the willingness of the families to take these children in the city in federal custody which increasingly means thousands\nOf them are sitting in these temporary facilities intense or either in the desert here in Texas or or out in homestead Florida\nMark I'm going to ask we're being told that this is the highest number of migrant children being held in detention ever a but in twenty four Tina's Bob mentioned in at that point you were with the Obama administration there were far more unaccompanied children crossing the border what's the difference between twenty fourteen and today\nSo first directly right that this is the highest number ever in custody\nIt is not because this is the highest number of arrivals ever the number of arrival that use greater this year than it was last year but it's not nearly as high as it was in twenty fourteen or twenty sixteen\nAway\n\nDitches doubled USF eighty nine point seven

if you don't get it was worth pressure them to this day has not been clarified in a sufficient waiting until just after that it generated a tradition of consciousness and struggle in the public

movement daughter minted\nIn moved up yesterday in the present day movements that I served in the universities in the central part of the country you're seeing a new generation but his waking up to the struggle through social consciousness\nAnd it is also a generation remembers and knows that through the state there has been no justice and those responsible for the massacre have not been brought to justice has something to get your most are getting on your your body\nOh understand more about the massacre in what we learned about fifty years later is Kate Doyle she's a senior analyst at the national Security Archive who's researched us and Mexican Government documents regarding the event Kate\nThanks for joining us I think you tend to you know so we are talking about a turning point in Mexican history tell us what happened fifty years ago today [noise] fifty years ago\nThere was a real by student movement that began in the spring of Nineteen sixty eight\nWith students from universities all over the city and eventually all over the country pouring out into the streets and asking really for the first time for change for freedoms for an end to police and military brutality\nFor the president of Mexico to step down for authoritarianism to end it was exciting and powerful kind of civic movement that really had no precedent in Mexico\nAnd that a movement attracted a lot of anger from the Mexican government and slowly over the course of the summer and into the fall lets the movement ruin strengths and the demand became sharper and more articulate it\nThe government began to crack down and the crackdown culminated after months of back and forth between the government and the students\nWith the terrible shootout and massacre that took place during the protests meeting in the public square at ... in Mexico city on October second when dozens of students and bystanders\nThe city on October second when dozens of students and bystanders were killed and injured\n[noise] there were reports at the time that armed snipers were up into rounding buildings and shot towards the plaza which then forced a military response what do we know about what exactly happened there\nSo there was a very aggressive stance on the part of the president Gustavo the photos us that the students themselves had been firing from\nThe building overlooking the square that simply wasn't true with ally and what actually happened which we discovered slowly over the years that in fact the president had placed snipers in those buildings\nThat overlooks the square where we're at ten thousand students and other people were gathered to protest\nAnd that they had fired down into the crowd in order to create a kind of chaos which would then permit the military to move in and arrest hundreds of people which in fact what happened\nEarly in September this year we saw major student demonstrations in Mexico city and I'm Wondering when you see\nYou know students and young people getting very much political these days do you think back to what happened fifty years ago are you seeing similarities there in between what happened in Mexico today versus fifty years ago [noise] sure\nBut I don't think students are pouring into the streets because of what happened five decades ago I think they're pouring into the streets because of violence and impunity or from the government today I think they're pouring into the streets because\nFour years ago almost to the day forty three students were grabbed by police and drug traffickers in a tiny town and get rid of the state of NATO\nAnd disappeared and if never showed up and the government has done nothing or so the the students today yes there is a movement today there is a pushback against the government\nAnd in fact Mexicans just voted in a person to be president um looked as Obrador who does not represent neither the ruling party nor even the sort of dominant opposition parties but a new party that he has found and so there is a kind of a ... a resurgence say\nOf hope for change NF demand for an end to the kind of a huge less violence that has been going on in Mexico for much too long\nAnd last week a commission from the Mexican government recognized the massacre as a state crime in your opinion you've done a ton of research on this is sufficient and is it a step towards justice you\nKnow it really is and the government can imagine that recognize that is in the new and important commission that is\nWas set up by the current government opinion yet to to provide support and attention to victims of violence\nThat it's not a government recognition of state responsibility for the crimes of local Mexico is a long way away from fully\nEmbracing the state's role in killing young people on October second Nineteen sixty eight\nAnd right now the government is even trying to censor and withdraw records that have been available in the archives for some years now about ...

I think that people are starting to talk about it I mean especially given what's happened over the last year it's been almost a year since um the Harvey Weinstein allegations came out\nAnd there was a real trickle effect when that happens in Hollywood and in other parts of society and we stopped talking about what consent look like for ourselves in our daily lives and aren't ... and then they thing\nWhat is consent how is it being defined today and has that definition evolved\nA word you can also that question I mean it is it's actually an agreement between nobody to people as to whether we move forward with sex or not\nBut it is incredibly difficult to define which one of the things we found out in the peace and how you get to the point of consent is constantly up for debate one of the things that we throw it in the peace with affirmative content you know needing to have a ...\nBefore me forward with any kind of sexual interaction and that on the face of it it's great because I Would just to dispel any kind of confusion around this topic\nBut when we actually think about it you know needing to you have a yes when you started someone's hand when you get someone not always seen as very sexy but maybe that's a problem with our society and a new on the fourth sexy and for a month is maybe we need not redefining one\nWay and then the question becomes all part of the question in this film is what can be gained by talking to the people who have hurt you and I think that's a really delicate\nPlace to go I'm particularly given what we're learning recently about how long it takes how these memories can be stored I mean does it help to confront the person or talk to them\nI think that it depends on your situation how trauma has manifested itself and how you feel about that particular scenario paying out\nWhat we tracked enough documentary is a case of two adults who ten years ago had sex one person who thought consensual sex with drunken incident won't pass and crude about rape and they sat down and had a face to face conversation\nI told myself that was in training and that I thought I ... just take a rail like boiling not wanting to face the next level if life question\nTheir soccer I don't remember how was your room wired challenger room one shopping or any of those details\nWitnessing that was incredibly powerful very very moving role conversation with a lot of fun right below the and a lot of humanity and forgiveness that with well\nThey can fault with trickle up and I became\nTo clean up and I became\nSort of problem in our community a source of like a\n... to imagine I didn't want to see like they don't want to say like ethanol O'Hare traditional thing and so I don't fault everyone will have to change anything I think she was an\nAdult everything everybody [noise]\nOne of my biggest regrets throughout authors in addition to you know on a new documentary called you know ... years of opportunities to Rosa which are [noise]\nAre just started doing this but\nIt's interesting because at the time where we're talking about ... accountability looks like I mean we really don't have a lot of options for how to handle situations that often happens ... years ago or even decades ago um and said that this one option to face it with conversation and dialogue\nIsn't there I mean I Would also say it's a pretty dangerous way to approach it depending on your situation I mean do you recommend trying to do that with a licensed professional or is it something that you should just do on your own called the person or I just\nI Know that something that comes up a lot of feeling yeah definitely and and I bet that it's definitely not for everyone and I wouldn't recommend doing without seeking professional advice to um [noise] yeah I mean there's a lot it's a very controversial technique it can cause ... station\nUm it can be seen as a tooth often approached but some people I mean some people do deserve to go through the criminal justice system that the jokes an alternative option that I wasn't aware of before making the documentary and that we wanted to bring to the table as a possibility for some people\nIs there any other way that people should be thinking about getting to that level of reconciliation without a face to face meeting and I think we often talk about forgiveness and a way that that's the end goal but is it\nNo I mean I'm In charge of justice sessions I should say that the end goal is not necessarily forgiveness um the majority of justice sessions allow the survivors to be in the driver's seat\nAnd so it's up to them whether they forgive or not or whether they want more session the weather they want to continue the conversation or whether they want to just\nLet it go there are obviously many different ways in which individual find healing and find closure\nAnd this is definitely not a be willing and solution for everyone I Would say that there are limited options because you know as we all know the criminal justice system is\nOften failed and when we want to handle the situation than six out of a thousand cases of sexual so go without convictions and so\nWe have very limited options but this is just one of the ones that we tried to showcase\nAnd at the beginning of the film you mentioned your own experience um that you said falls into the sort of gray area of consent did that experience make you change the way you think about trauma\nI think that it's an interesting time to talk about trauma if the last few days have shown if anything it's the ... it's real and logging and can run extremely deep I'd be surprised over the last year will tell you that that experience\nTo have had a lot of things impact and that I Do find myself thinking back to not\nVery uncomfortable
