works where it's broken and what we can do to fix it and I tend to Vegas and that is the takeaway [noise]\nThere are more than ten thousand election jurisdictions in this country that is right I said ten thousand within those jurisdictions are hundreds of thousands of polling places and in a presidential election year you'll need about a million poll workers to make sure things run

the New York times reveals how the Saudi Government uses troll farm to orchestrate digital attacks against dissident and journalists including ...\nBen Hubbard into Beirut bureau chief for the New York times and he's been reporting on these social media campaigns\nTroll farms are basically you know the best way to picture them would be like a call center like you would have you know to to field public relations were cross or customer across something like that except this is this'll be a group of people who've been hired to be very very active on social media to promote some kind of agenda in the case of the story that we wrote this was obviously to\nSort of do a number of things to try to benefit the relations or the the reputation of Saudi Arabia so this has to attack content that was appeared to be negative to Saudi Arabia and promote content that is positive for Saudi Arabia\nAnd tell us who was behind the troll farm and whether that farm can be traced all the way back to the highest levels of the Saudi Government\nWell it would be pretty impossible for something like this to happen without the knowledge of the Saudi Government so I mean this is a monarchy it's an authoritarian state so it'd be very unlikely that ah say impossible for this to happen unless it was signed off on you know by the government said we know that so one of the officials who was in charge of\nIn charge of this effort is somebody who's very close to crown prince Mohammed bin Salman man who was you know the sort of the fact or ruler of the kingdom\nAnd what are some of the messages that these trolls were using\nTheir their various ways that they do this sometimes it's just to try to manipulate hashtags that are already out there so if there's a ... that they perceived to be negative to the kingdom they can sometimes just flooded with various kinds of spam so that it becomes in a way unreasonable\nThey also try to game the algorithms to Twitter has to try to get certain hashtags onto the trending topics so if there's a hash tag that picks up or that some cases it may have actually been create created by them they can drive a tremendous amount of traffic to that\nAnd don't try to get it on the trending topics list which makes it much more likely than anybody inside of Saudi Arabia who's on Twitter is going to see that particular topic\nYou know to take a step back you kind of have to understand how important something like Twitter is in a country like Saudi Arabia\nAgain this is an authoritarian plates that doesn't have really free media I mean almost all of the newspapers are government owned there's not a lot of public engagement or civil society they're not really places where you can go and discuss and so\nWhen Twitter started spreading in Saudi Arabia probably seven or eight years ago it was you know it was a huge deal for the kingdom and and a lot of people then we're very optimistic and said oh this is going to be this crazy technology that's going to lead to you know it's going to democratize the discourse\nWhat we've seen is that you know this government really had the ability to\nWell we've seen is that you know this government really had the ability to manipulate all of that because they have huge huge resources from the oil wealth they were able to buy really the best off the shelf technology that you can find\nAnd they just they don't know they're they're very organized so they can you know either create automated box or in the cases that we wrote about higher human boss who's going to our trolls are called her sock puppets there's various terms that people intact used for this but basically hiring people whose job it is to weigh in on the social media debates of trying to shape the way that they go\nThey drowned out a lot of messages they they've apple fight other messages they manage to get certain things that would not have been trending on the trending lifts on Twitter so they they've they've ended up being very effective\nAnd um they they they end up playing a role social media plays a very large role in these countries and just shaping people's perceptions of reality just as media doesn't any country\nBut the the difference in Saudi Arabia so if they're just fewer avenues out there and so when they can so effectively manipulate what people are seeing when they got on Twitter they can really have an effect on how people really perceive the world around them a perceived their own their own government\nReported on an ex Twitter employee who was spying on behalf of the Saudi Government what do we know about that person\nWell we know that there was the Saudi engineer Saudi Saudi tech person who got hired by Twitter was working there and then basically tipped off by American law enforcement and said we have suspicions about this person that he hasn't been whether he was working directly for Saudi intelligence or whether he'd been sort of recruited to do this bit of work for them\nIs not entirely clear but the concerns were great enough that he was using his access to the company and his his access inside of Twitter to basically look up information about certain dissidents and provide that information to the Saudi Government\nAnd wondering if attention to this more now because a democracy she'll be staff um he was in fact one of the folks who was targeted by these campaigns let's he ...\nHe was definitely targeted by these people you know there was you know ... mile by the time he was killed had last time I checked I think it was somewhere around a million and a half or more than a million and a half followers on Twitter he was very prolific on Twitter he would tweet in Arabic he would treat in English he would interact with people he would have post articles and\nYou also so for someone like him this was a very powerful publishing platform I mean there are lots of articles published by the New York times that don't get a million and a half views\nBut you know somebody like somehow had that many followers just on his own Twitter account so they put a lot of effort into trying to fight back against him and so he would get lots and lots of comments lots and lots of abuse and\nAnd and things like that so yeah he was definitely sort of one of the people on their list that they were\nYou know trying to influence the way that the content he was putting out was being received by people\nAt least enough to make clear that Twitter at the company had been under\nFire for a while now for what it allows and doesn't allow on that platform and how it controls where people can say and what they can't say\nAnd I'm Wondering from your reporting have they uh than anything about all this has some from Twitter responded to either the ah the employee who was supposedly working on behalf of Saudis or to how their platform is being used in this instance\nNot aware of any direct response from Twitter to the article that we published on Sunday I mean I Know that they they certainly have talked about other ways that they tried to do this there was you know they put out of information\nA few days ago I'm Talking about a large sort of bought network I think they called it that they had taken down to the sort of a pro pro Saudi Bach network that Twitter had taken down\nSo you know there there there are certainly aware of the problem and you know when when when um Twitter executives speak about this they say you know where we we want to do everything that we can to allow the medium to function we don't want to be censoring\nWe want to do everything that we can to allow the medium to function we don't want to be censoring people we don't want to be taking things down and less otherwise necessary so I I mean I think for what are they they're trying to find the balance between keeping the medium as open as possible but then also stepping in when they need to to try to shut down things that are in the areas\nThan Hubbard at the Beirut bureau chief for the New York times Ben thanks so much for your reporting on this [noise]\nTo take away supported by as low dedicated to helping entrepreneurs and
