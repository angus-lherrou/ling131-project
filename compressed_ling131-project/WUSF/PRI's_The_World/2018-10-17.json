audio recordings\nFrozen what would I Do\nBelieve that we have as far as if it exists with regard for if it exists prizes they have no I'm not sure yet that it exists probably does possibly to a level of full resort for Mike when it comes to\nThe president they're referring to secretary of state Mike Pompeo who visited with leaders in both turkey and Saudi Arabia this week in a statement ... said

human rights abuses and there have been reports of an increase of women and other activists being arrested and detained\nThis week we're spending some time trying to better understand the United

power in twenty Seventeen what to record been so far on human rights\nWell his record has been quite bad actually probably far worse than his predecessors uh exercising power\nIn Saudi Arabia because he has not only are arrested and jailed a activists or who have been the traditional are targets of Saudi repression but he's gone far far wider in an effort to consolidate all power in the

turn to the perils faced by journalist all around the world especially women there with Kim Wall aged thirty a\nFreelance journalist murdered while reporting aboard the submarine off the coast in Denmark and then dismembered Daphne Koran ... age fifty three investigative reporter and anti corruption blogger in Malta\nMurdered outside her home by a car bomb Victoria Mari nova aged thirty investigative television journalist in Bulgaria raped and murdered by blow the head and suffocation each of these murders took place over the last two years in Europe way from major conflict\nZones these journalists were not caught in crossfire they were targeted losing their lives at least in part for being journalists or for being women in high profile jobs\nTwenty Eighteen is on track to be more deadly year than last year so far according to the committee to protect journalists sixty two journalists have been killed men make up the majority of that number but some say that doesn't reflect the atmosphere of danger for many women in this line of work it used to be the\nCase in hostile environments that if you will the woods press on your vast that that would be some kind of protection would fooled you protection now it deems that having that kind of spot on your chest actually makes you a target\nThat's Judy Ginsburg she's the chief executive officer of index on censorship of freedom of expression nonprofit I asked her about Kim Wall Daphne car when I got ... and Victoria ... and the work that they were doing\nSo in the case of basic toy yeah I'm an Daphne that both investigative journalist we don't know yet whether Victoria was targeted specifically for him best to get to ... vegetation into corruption\nA we know that stuff was the target of repeated threat for her work investigating corruption at the highest levels of government and business and most to she was killed a year ago yesterday\nAnd she was targeted in a number of ways including through legal threats and others\nAre repeated criticism of how I look in the case of cam she was mud walls are doing a report in to a submarine and the inventor of the submarine and killed while on board the submarine what\nAre some of the unique challenges I'm and dangers that women journalists face do we understand why we're seeing journalists female journalists being targeted in general\nSo what I Would say that it's not clear that female journalists targeted disproportion late but cuts that done a list I think what we've got to look at here is the way in which women are targeted\nDisproportionate the way it's set of abuse or threats of rape harassment dog thing and the like\nAcross the board not stuffed in John ... and now that the thing about John ... minutes that women in journalism tend to be relatively well known in the high profile journalist I Am a done this myself\nRelatively well known the high profile journalist I Am a done this myself we need to be in the public high we need to be known to people that they feel that they can approach us with stories out by lined up on news papers up pictures are known to people if where a broad causes on television\nSo people are aware of who those women on whether they tell them because they joined little because the women it's less clay\nI think what is clear is that people are increasingly feeding able to\nHave a go at journalists in ... because of the environment that's being created by politicians and others have been criticizing John this publicly and that the public in general a largely men feel they are able in particular to Target Women with\nReally know the threats and we'll see so that and he's saying that on the rise\nTell us a little bit about the role here of social media in particular\nShow so obviously in the past it was more challenging to touch on this you how to write I left to or even cold a joined us now it's much easier to target people in general\nAll of us put out probably falls often out there in the public so it's easier for people to get in touch with us they don't need to know our phone number they need to know the address a home addresses the address of the newspaper they can contact us almost directly dots done on the one hand\nI think the Internet has been a great thing for journalism and democracy in general it's enabled those who didn't have a voice previously to voice their opinions that concerns\nThat criticism but also what it allowed people to do it to feel that they can\nPublicly birth rate criticized and in some cases abuse and harass people with whom they disagree I think it's less clear how fall these abusive messages on line translates into any real intention to commit violence we heard about the three women that you mentioned\nBut it's unclear how fall\nThe people who are sitting in their homes feeling that it's fine to abuse women online actually have any intention of carrying that out nevertheless it doesn't stop at having an impact it easy I think for people to say oh just suck it up pick nor it\nBut ... knows what it is like to be on the receiving end of hundreds of thousands of messages threatening you and your family is and and I think that's something that we don't often talk about it's not just that some of these threats real or not\nUm two women are not just about saying I'm going to attack you I Wish you would be raped and so on it's all said that often people's families a threat to\nAnd that gives any ... mantle female I think great poets about how far they want to carry on\nYou know what's interesting is that the three cases we're talking about here all happened in Europe and I'm Wondering if that tells us anything about what the environment is like for journalists there\nI think it does I think one of the things that we have new test most in our monitoring of media freedom in Europe in recent years that index on censorship\nIs the way in which the environment has changed for journalists generally and I think in part that's because politicians those in power have been able to opt environment we have\nThe president of the United states but not just the president of the United states a number of politicians throughout Europe who are openly voicing criticism of the media\nFor anything that they don't like enemies of the people fake news and that creates an environment I think in which the profession is devalued and watch him in which people then failed that journalists all fat game [noise]\nJody Ginsberg of index on censorship of freedom of expression nonprofit has

Boston [noise]\nFlorida is still in the early stages of recovery from hurricane Michael and in a few weeks voters will be taking to the polls for mid term elections\nAs Rick Scott's term ends a crucial race for governor is heating up Democrat Andrew Gillum facing off against the candidate Ron defensive and voters are closely watching how each candidate at handling the hurricane response effort [noise]\nThirty and will also decide on whether or not to restore voting rights to one point five million felons Florida is one of three states along with Iowa and Kentucky that permanently take the vote away from convicted felons and\nThere are questions about whether people who haven't voted during the last three elections but emerged during the primaries will turn out again David Smiley has been covering all of this is the Miami Herald political reporter David welcome back to the takeaway thanks for having me\nSo there's a lot going on in Florida as we know um midterms are just a couple of weeks away how it's a storm like Michael affecting or could it affect people's engagement not just getting to the polls but their desire to vote\nWhere Michael hit a interestingly is a\nHeavily Republican area and it really wiped out um a lot of the roads the uh infrastructure so immediately we're seeing questions about will those counties in the Florida Panhandle\nBe ready to vote for early voting on Monday and for election days so that'll be interesting to watch or they aren't the most populous counties\nBut that seems like it might affect Republican turnout um and just generally the hurricane has kind of reset the table for the campaigns\nYou know there were topics that were heavily in the media before the hurricane are formed in the Caribbean and began aiming for Tallahassee and\nThose issues like the economy and red tide were pretty quickly drowned out by hurricane Michael and um the devastation that caused and the ongoing recovery so I think it may change some statewide focus\nFrom voters on what they're thinking about and how they're viewing the candidates as governor Rick Scott runs against Bill Nelson N. is heavily involved in recovery efforts in as Andrew Gillum I had to take a break from the campaign or as mayor Tallahassee to handle the storm\nA Ron dissent is no longer a congressman trying to shift his campaign to remain involved without an official role hurricane certainly shook things up in the campaigns\nDo we know that that's affected Gillum lead at all that he had to step aside to handle the hurricane or is his campaign still going\nThe polls the recent polls have showed Gillum with a very narrow one point lead a new poll by St people's uh came out this morning the really the first poll a taken to ... to potentially show hurricane of fact and it still had Gillum ... plus one\nPotentially show hurricane of fact and it still had Gillum ... plus one um I think you know the the assumption would be that he would get something of a bump given that he was a so heavily on the the media rotation during and after the storm more dissent is\nDidn't have a invested role and the recovery and the preparations\nAre so I think I think we need to wait and see some of the polls that should be coming out in the next couple of days or a week or to see whether it will see any other shift but in a state like Florida where a top of the ticket races are typically decided by one point or I don't think we're going to see either\nAndrew Gillum or ride to Santa is a a head or behind by too much\nWe talked a little bit at the opening about the possibility of getting Floridians to restore the right to vote for one point five million former felons in the state has there been any movement can you gauge what the interest is so far I'm On that ballot measure\nOr late last month we saw a University of north for to pull that had a ballot measure at Seventy one percent support\nTo get on the ballot or the the backers of amendment for uh pursued a petition drive that\nReceived nearly nine hundred thousand signatures which obviously bodes well for support you would figure most of those sing the tourist would also both for the initiative um but in Florida you need you do need sixty percent to pass a ballot question\nAnd I I Do think one there is a campaign against it and to ... we're going to see some skepticism from people who either may not totally understand what the image seeks to do and the fact that I'm a convicted felons do have to complete their probation and parole\nIn order to have their rights restored\nAnd then there'll be questions from voters about it to what extent are they comfortable restoring voting rights for um people who are convicted certain non violent offenses uh and and I don't think that's a slam dunk\nWe talked a little bit also about the fact that the Florida Supreme Court um has ruled that the current governor Rick Scott won't be able to appoint three state Supreme Court justices who are the justices who are stepping down and I'm Wondering how that will affect the liberal majority\nWell right on the ah southern member court there are three of of four justices who have kind of formed somewhat of a liberal voting bloc\nAnd have at times ruled against Rick Scott they are due to age limits are stepping down um the day that the next governor is sworn in and given that that decision will now fall to either Andrew Gillum Rhonda Santas and they have\nSuch divergent opinions on what the court should look like\nThat seems likely to to energize a they're voting bases I I think Republicans tend to be more attuned to\nIssues of the higher courts and the significance of it and we did see some a speculation that perhaps the Kavanaugh hearings for the U.S Supreme Court might have actually\nA given Ron descent as a bump who was trailing\nPretty consistently in the polls by decent margin or and then seem to get a bump around the time of the cabinet hearing so it's possible that that controversy energized for the Republican voters maybe they were hesitant to side with his aunt is over Trump\nOr or or any other issues and um and that might have given him a bomb so probably better for the Centers for ... certainly Planned Parenthood a abortion rights healthcare rights are front and center in the minds of democratic voters are so I don't think that\nYou know a liberal voters are just gonna have to have their shoulders and\nThat you know a number of voters are just going to throw up their shoulders and think about other\nIssues never a dull
