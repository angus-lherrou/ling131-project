country swept up in a wave of populist leaders\nAnd for Brazilian to follow the title election comes after years of economic instability and political turbulence wholly unfair to the Brazilian writer and he joined me from Sao paolo to trace the roots of the upcoming election\nThe first moments where you can find relevant would be two thousand Thirteen when many people to to the streets to protest the PTA government\nAt first it was a left wing protests as we tended to have here in Brazil and then in the meantime or after the first one the second one that when it got bigger and bigger ...\nIt was a simulate that that's a a right wing movement\nAnd then from then on the started organizing themselves or they went to the streets again again in two thousand sixteen asking for do my roof says basement and then after a while they got that\nAnd well all this structure that works against the tea now is supporting both so now do the stream right politician and things got really ugly in that point\nWhy do you think it ... this extreme to the point where Los ... could potentially be elected\nWell I think it has something of a sudden character because well I don't believe that we have a fifty percent of a population then so far I thought I mean it just to be ten percent salt\nEvery last election and less Thirty years but then there was so much rage and so much hatred and there was also a media campaign against the tea and focusing lost in the corruption scandals that we're serious obviously\nBut they weren't only ... feet the fall and then people there's rage and hatred became a support for this terrible character this terrible guy\nThat people tend not to see all they see and maybe they don't want to have the exact conscience of while they are actually supporting\nHis boss and not only exploiting um any of the divisions that exist the social divisions that exist in Brazil right now\nWell definitely mainly the middle class in satisfaction because well er during the the workers but the government during the Thirteen years they were in power there was significant growth for the forest but\nThere was significant growth for the forest but middle class the state more or less the same\nSo they were after awhile closer to the poorest than to the reaches [noise] and this created some sort of the stuff that section through a great part of of a population\nAnd now I think both so NATO is exploiting exactly that and pass the support of these people even though it suits policies won't do anything good for them they tend to do a lot as well\nFor the reach of not for the middle class\nAnd I want to read an excerpt from an essay you broach and asking you to tell us a little bit about it in in your essay you said quote\nIt Brazil were not drowning under so much rain age so much hatred sandwich yelling if there were just a single moment of silence perhaps everybody would be able to hear the alarm bells founding something in danger\nIn many ways clearly understands a lot like the moment in the United states that were living right now are you concerned about what you see and what's happening in Brazil and also what's happening across the world\nYeah definitely it's a great a reason for concern and well perhaps we are now in the front line of something a lot bigger\nI'd like to consider it a backlash of many other advances we've had in the last decade in Brazil that seems to be the case of police because that was that's a progressive governments for Thirteen Years and then you have this reaction that very conservative and\nBesides the reactionary\nIn Brazil we don't have a strong democracy as you have been in the United states it's being only Thirty years of democracy at this point\nSince the last dictatorship and you never know when the military will get in the way again we'll start gaining power and becoming something else so it's a great reason for concern definitely\nIn in terms of those in Brazil and Brazilian society who would be most vulnerable under a ball phenomenal presidency\nWell first of all that's not really the poorest because she has a very violent program for fighting crying organized crime and without considering the risk of that than arming great part of the population\nThan giving license for policemen to kill without any serious investigation\nSo we know that in in the ... we'll see a lot more blood then we see now which is very serious then of course there will be also persecution of the aisle you beat the community because you've been talking about that suits entire career\nWomen will suffer because well he he tends to be against policies of the quality\nThe indigenous community as well he doesn't want to preserve the land\nAnd the original black communities as well so it's mainly the most vulnerable will suffer more\nAnd we don't know if that will be something similar to what we said during the dictatorship that bought persecution of viruses than those activists\nHe has said things that point to that idea but we are not sure how he's planning to do that or if he's planning to do that at this point is just a vague men and well sniping people don't want to see what it's called\n...\nDon't want

[noise]\nYou don't need Thomas I never see you again [noise]\nThat's just the off the government [noise]\nAs a matter of fact I bought the dumbest thing I ever heard of [noise]\nWant me to you because of something that happened two hundred years ago\nThat the film's protagonist Peter who returned home to fight for his land in Louisiana as he tries to court his love interest Maria when I sat down with Sasha he told me why the films still resonates with viewers in twenty Eighteen\nLand ownership is an important part of the story and there was a statistic that someone in the film said that like every week black folks are losing a thousand acres of land and\nBy the year X Y Z black people won't have anything and I thought that was a really powerful idea since this idea of owners should land ownership and the relationship that cultures have to the land in as people who have who are of African native dissent\nHaving this relationship and report the land and the ownership of the land in this you know sort of European system of what it means to own land well we're here so\nIf we're going to participate we might as well be owners as well that was an important sort of subplot in the story that when your mixed in with feminism color resume class there's a lot there\nDid you learn anything about your dad that you didn't know it didn't have a sense of through this film well\nYou know my parents split when I was young and he moved on to another relationship the the woman that he was in a relationship with before he died\nShe's from the region and she worked on the film and had a hand in sort of clue and him into the world and why it's interesting and important but inside of the romance in the film I had a sense of what it might have been like for my parents\nYou know what that courtship might have been like because it was something very\nI don't want to see simple but something so tender about the way the characters interact that it's very genuine you can't really\nYou can't make that up it would be super corny you know I mean someone said recently who saw the film that it it has a very eighties vibe\nWhat does that mean well I was a kid in the eighties so what does that well\nYou'll if you're a kid from the eighties you will love the parents of designer jeans everyone's ... rocket designer jeans everyone's but male and female looks great\nThere's a photo Matt you know I don't know for those who are old enough to ... days we used to have to take film right actually get a developed right out of little hut that was usually stationed in a parking lot there was a photo Matt\nYou know so the pacing you know there's an eighties pacing maybe like if you watch sixty minutes from Nineteen Seventy five it's like it's really hard you know it's it's really slow the pacing everything so quick now\nBut I think the pacing of the film is\nIs in the spirit of the story he wanted to tell he was uh\nPacing of the film is is in the spirit of the story he wanted to tell he was a documentary filmmaker so there are long scenes music is a very important part of the film and it was funny the editor was telling the story of how my father would make everyone listening to the soundtrack and he made me listen to it too that's the one thing that I always remembered\nBut in some instances the music plays out in a way that it's almost like a music video which to me like almost like a long long for music video which in a in an interesting way it was kind of ahead of its time or\nSort of merging with the emergence of music videos and I learned from someone that he was inspired by super fly for instance that that had like a amazing soundtrack and he wanted the soundtrack to almost be a character in the film and that's definitely the way it is\nDo you think that when you look at black film today in twenty eight teams\nDo you think that there is enough nuance I'm black everyday life in those films similar to the way that your dad was able to bring that to like it I think that is one of the most compelling things that you're talking about it just how nuance and how delicate these portrayals word do you see the filmmakers are getting better at\nThat well I think Hollywood is recognizing that there's money in this audience and people of color have more than one way to beat and there's nothing wrong with not having a broad world view but Hollywood television in particular likes to put people in boxes why marketing money\nOkay that's very specific group of black people like these hair care products or you can sell stuff to people I get it but I think the sort of box that that same litter you no pun intended black box that we've often been put in it's too small it doesn't fit anymore and um\nYou look at you know my man child is can be no\nYou know you look at the sort of new wave of okay here's some other black people to who have stories to tell who are great and so\nI had hoped that things are changing but you know changed never comes as quickly as you'd like\nYou're also filmmaker are there any projects um that you're working on coming out\nWorking on a four part film about the routine clan there twenty fifth anniversary this year and um to really understand Wu Tang clan I mean you can listen to their music and enjoyed it sounds great but like\nTo really peel back the lyrics is to have a real understanding of who they are and where they come from and as I tell people all the time to understand hip hop or blues jazz you know all these art forms or reflection of in a reaction to the environment and so to tell the story you've got to understand the environment all the things that they went through to become who they are and so\nTo me the music is the cherry on top it all the other stuff the environment the social climate all the things that they had to overcome that really make their story compelling\nIs there anything that you're taking away from your dad filmmaking process and incorporating it into the work that you do\nWell saying something every time I have the opportunity to make a film\nI say something you know I did a film called fresh stressed about the history of hip hop bashing and you you learn about a Sunday Best and most people you say Sunday Best and they think it means wear nice suit but they don't realize it means in certain states it was mandated that they had to buy their slaves and nice\nOutfit so they can go to church and worship God it's white or supposedly white there aren't a lot of people looked like me who have the opportunity to say things and so I like to entertain people but I think it's also important to say something so every film I Do and my father would definitely feel very strongly about that [noise]\nSasha Jenkins that the writer and filmmaker\n... thank
