[noise]\nNow we returned to our coverage at war in Yemen a conflict partially divided by the Saudi Government some eight million Yemeni currently depend on emergency food aid to survive and un officials say that that number is likely to ride to for ... million which is half\nOf the population last week the New York times published extensive reporting on the state of the crisis along with unflattering portraits of young children wasting away from hunger Declan Walsh with the reporter behind that peace and he joins us now from Cairo where he's the times has bureau chief\nDeclan thanks so much for taking the time my pleasure definitely remind us what Saudi Arabia's contribution to the crisis in Yemen what is their role\nWell the war in Yemen or other time starts at about\nFour years ago when a group of grill is called the ... the northern Yemen seize control of the capital and then starts to move across the country seizing more territory and just ... just come to the Saudis who six months later in March twenty Fifteen starts to air strikes a campaign of air strikes\nIn Yemen and effectively setting the war in motion as it stands now in order to find out who these power decided these these these as proxies for Iran because these are she is or they practice a form of shoes them\nBecause they have received some weapon supplies from the uranium the Saudis have been fighting the war principally by air for the last three years they've carried out almost twenty thousand airstrikes against\n... and also economic target in the country and that has brought a great deal of criticism of Saudis because\nHousing of civilians have died and those airstrikes and they have brought recently accusations of war crimes on the parts of the United nations against the Saudi led coalition the other part of the Saudi led campaign to oust duties as being a range of\nPunitive economic measures that the Saudis have imposed on territory that is controlled by who these in an effort to\nUh it offensively inaccurate to isolate them but we just had the effect of really falling very heavily on the country's civilian population because those same\nMeasures actively contribution to crushing the economy and that's what we've seen in the last couple of months the collapse of the country of Yemen already very fragile economy\nYou're reporting I'm In the New York times was accompanied by some pretty devastating photos taken by Tyler Hicks I'm calling it the New York times of young Yemeni children on the brink of death by starvation can you give us a sense of how and why that decision was made to include those photos and the reporting\nWell we're certainly some of the most shocking pulled it I think at the time says used in recent years on the decision to use them was not chicken likely and reporters have said often is now we tend to\nErr on the side of caution publishing very graphic pictures but there were a couple of very compelling reasons as to to publish these pictures and the one I was that these photographs constitute a very shocking reminder of the time and has no on who has\nA different consciousness there's an idea\nCommon has no one knew where a different consciousness there's an idea that bomb it or something that happened in the Nineteen eighties in Ethiopia or perhaps\nA in places like Somalia in two thousand and eleven and these are really reminder that in in this day and age and a very severe starvation is reality and Yemen and the second factor which I think was probably the most compelling one is that this is very much a manmade farm and this is not a potential your mom make ...\nThis is not a humanitarian catastrophe that as a result of a natural disaster or of a naturally occurring for junk food in these areas\nOn the country when we were travelling through Yemen and in many of the towns we visited you few stores full of food the problem is that\nNobody are very few people can afford to buy it because of the country's economy has the devastation is on the economic devastation is a direct product of the way that the war has been waged\nLargely by Saudi Saudi led coalition some of the decision they have taken by withholding reads from a million civil servants in government controlled and\nControlled areas has had an absolutely devastating effect on the local economy as well as the plunge into the value of Yemeni currency and\nThose kind of decisions have meant that people have far less money than before and the money they have is worth fall\nAre that I'm for people who are already living on the brink this is enough to push move at the edge\nAnd which ones they were talking to Declan Walsh of the New York times and he's joining us from Skype in Cairo Declan what is the international community's response to this and what is has it been so far it has it been sufficient because to say that there is food and yet there's this famine happening it just seems devastatingly cruel\nWell over the last uh over this summer the international community response has focused largely on the effort by the Saudi led coalition to capture a port called who data\nThat's the gateway for about three quarters of international humanitarian aid the entrance Yemen so a lot of concern has focused on ensuring I'm pressuring the competence that the fighting should not reached deport 'em stop the supplies reaching the country but increasingly now because of that\nNature of this bomb or the\nThreatened bombing and the problem with the cops the economy a lot of stress now he's on trying to pressure the parties to impose measures that would allow the economy to repair itself somehow and you begin any chance to buy the food that they need to stave off starvation\nDeclan Walsh is the New

to tailor energy setting off a massive oil spill on the coast of Louisiana that's been growing steadily for fourteen years\nEveryday the scientist and feeling between three hundred seven hundred barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico Taylor Energy had cleaned up some of the math but they've also been doing the government to avoid a full clean up on the site and if the spill is not stop soon it's on track to become one of the worst in us history\nMichael complimented the reporter with the Associated Press and he's been reporting on the Taylor oil spill for years Michael thanks for joining us thanks for having me I push it to this spill started in two thousand and four and it's now back in the news because the Justice Department had an independent analysis about this tell us about that what did they find\nWell they found that the weak appears to be a much worse than either the company or the government itself has been saying for many years the latest estimates which were put together by independent researcher from Florida found that between ten thousand thirty thousand gallons of oil is leaking daily\nFrom multiple wells around a platform that toppled over during hurricane Ivan in two thousand four\nAnd the reason why this is an issue now after all these many years that Taylor Energy company based in New Orleans that doesn't have the assets anymore it's actually only exist to fight the spill is trying to recover hundreds of millions of dollars that it set aside years ago to try to end this leak they want the money back\nThe government says no you need to do more to finish what you started your down below the surface of the Gulf\nObviously there's a money issue here but what is it about this film that why is it taking so long for this to stop this looks like it's an environmental disaster that's been going on in our own backyard\nWell hadn't gotten a lot of attention until recently that ... that's true the company's position is that basically look this is not any different than the natural seeps that occur out there out in the Gulf of Mexico that are harmless\nThat's their position is are they right about that well I mean that's I think that's open to debate certainly and um the government's position is very different that that does pose a potential threat to the environment and that they have to go out there and do it they can the problem is is that when that hurricane rolled through and knocked over\nThe uh drilling platform it also buried the underground wells under mountains of a settlement that they cannot go in simply dredge without risking somebody's life left the company the company says no company did kill some of the wealth they said but\nThey said that nothing more can be done without causing tension greater risk if they go in there and they\nTake the settlement are way could make the week even worse possibly so there's some there's very little degree and it seems like between the government\nAnd the company about what needs to be done next but the government believes that something can be done and they I Believe are going to order the company to do something else on their below the surface\nI'm just wondering the Taylor oil ... back in the news but its rivaling this BP oil spill in twenty tenants\nIn the news but its rivaling this BP oil spill in twenty ten I Can't forget the images of the BP oil spill they were like on loop and I'm Wondering how this is affecting the environment differently than the BP oil spill did in twelve ten\nAnd twenty tend to be people will feel as we all remember we are kind of transfixed by images of this billowing wave of crude oil coming out of the bottom to see for it it was coming out all at once you know over the period of grad\nI Believe three months or so but that massive amount of oil came out all at once and that as you know oil birds on the seashore and it created an environmental catastrophe and in this case this has been a slow motion environmental problem with a tailor energy it's it's seeped out slowly and\nI'm not a scientist but I've been told that the damage and the effect is far less serious when it's staggering out in the oil can be weathered\nBy waves and water and it doesn't have quite the same impact also the company has said that there is no evidence\nThat the oil from the ... is reaching shores about twelve miles off the coast of Louisiana and the slick stretch for miles every day or almost every day\nBut don't flicks also have an impact on the environment whether we can feed them or not I mean who's supposed to make sure that this is an environmentally sound place\nAgain I Believe that there are some a disagreement about this between the two sides of the company has its own experts who say that there is no one environmental ecological risk or danger or damage and then the government says\nDifferently that there's at least the potential for damage to the ecology out there even if it's not oil and birds on the shore and you know there's ... there's other marine life out there that could be affected by these persistent and chronic leaks\nSo we know the Taylor Energy is suing the federal government what else are they doing we understand that one of the former owners we do with a prominent philanthropists in Louisiana\nYeah so the Taylor name or his best known probably in Louisiana for a program called tops the tea and top switches financed free college tuition for many families over the years that this is a couple [noise]\nDidn't have kids of their own said vested a lot of money in um helping other people millions of dollars in flat or be work is Taylor or his widow is also a very influential political figure donor too many congressmen and senators\nAnd she had hired lawyers or to lobby on Capitol Hill to try to get the company a break so it's still a fight that's ongoing both in court and also a separately the company I tried to petition the somewhat obscure government agency\nTo give it a relief from this a long standing orders that it had to do more\nDown below the sea floor in terms of drilling a intervention well to try to kill underground well so there's two fronts but primarily it's has become a case about money and about how much more they need to spend or have available to spend down below the surface [noise]\nMichael Conn them in at the reporter with the Associated Press Michael thanks for joining us I think for having me for\nGiving out these scientists working around the Gulf about the Taylor\nOil spill bird and ask for a marine geologist at the University of southern Missouri told us that he thinks Taylor Energy should not have to clean up the\nSite that they should fund scientific research that he's a week there about twenty oil blowout and federal and state water every year professor at first that scientists can use the handler oil you know to examine the impact of the ... how the sea\nFloor community response to it how it interacts of plankton and how oil is transported from the floor\nEvents or ask for office said some scientists have requested intentional releases of oil basically creating a bill in the Gulf studied the fact that the Taylors type could be a good compromise\nWhat do you think about solutions like this to join the conversation on our Facebook page or tweet us ...\n... or tweet us at the table [noise]\n\nAfter
