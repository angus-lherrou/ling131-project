[noise]\nBut back to business before the party's since taking office Donald Trump has never really stopped campaigning often returning to speak in towns and cities across the country where support for his presidency remains high\n[noise]\nBut as the mid term elections approach Trump is spending even more time on the campaign trail trying to lift fellow Republicans in tight races in an effort to maintain control of Congress and in order to keep his base energize the president is keeping his messaging simple\nLaws or drop us our borders illegally will be sent back home court [noise]\nAnd\nWe tell them because they've got a long hike but they can't they cannot come in [noise]\nThe way they want a government doesn't work that way\nWith less than a week to go will the president's message motivate his core supporters to turn out like they did and twenty sixteen here to discuss is Christopher catalogue all the White House reporter for Politico Christopher welcome to the take away\nA pleasure to be here [noise] so let's talk about the president's messaging here as we said we've got one week before the midterm elections what are some of the big themes that the president is really knocking hard we've got obviously immigration what else are you saying\nThe president is going very hard on illegal immigration as you mentioned he has brought up a very unlikely proposal but one that he thinks it's going to motivate folks which is a ten percent tax cut on the middle class\nThe president has continued his barrage of assaults on the media\nAnd in the last few days he has really dialed up to critique of the Democratic party that is meant as something to really unified Republicans pointing to what he sees as kind of the extremes of the Democratic party\nYou know and I'm Wondering that President it's made no secret of his thoughts on migrants coming from Central America for Mexico but the very beginning of his campaign so\nIs there a reason why he still really doubling down on immigration um what did that strategy tell us as opposed to health care or as opposed to other issues that he should be looking at\nThis is a an election that's really based\nOn motivating his base nationalizing the selection around his supporters because the question that Republicans have always had as there were a number of people who turned out for Donald Trump much of them Republicans but not all of them and the question was would they come out and turn out for\nA member of Congress or a candidate for the house\nA member of Congress or a candidate for the house\nAnd that has been a much tougher thing to answer and so if Donald Trump goes out there and says this midterms is really about me my policies are on the ballot you'll remember rock Obama said that and it turned into a scandal will Donald Trump has been saying that exact thing\nAnd it's it's a way for him to ah to make this about himself\nIn a way to really sort of rile up his supporters\nUh what I Would say about illegal immigration that he's focused on is this has been a constant focus as you pointed out I mean going back to the beginning of his campaign obviously earlier this spring he went really hard on the MS Thirteen gang\nAnd started using terms like animals to describe people which are generated a lot of backlash and so what he's doing is we we flash forward to the beginning of October\nAnd the president's political team started to get a whole bunch of polling data come back to them\nAbout this issue of immigration saying that in a lot of these marginal districts these competitive house districts where Donald Trump is not always seen as the help\nIllegal immigration was resonating with folks this whole idea of the Republican Party being sort of the protectors of immigration and customs agents there was an abolish ice movement on the left obviously and so that whole issue was resonating and what happened was the the president sort of\nHad this migrant caravan issues sort of land in his lap after they had already decided that they were going to really close on illegal immigration\nWell and and there's also the the recent news that the president has decided to send troops to the southern border we should also remind our listeners that\nThese migrants caravan if you will the folks who are migrating are still weeks away from even reaching the United states border so the president doubling down on sending troops and reinforces the idea that these folks are almost the scapegoats in many ways right\nYeah I mean a lot of these attacks a lot of these statements are not grounded in reality as you mentioned these people are hundreds of miles away they would not reach here like you said for weeks and then in in the last day or so there's been this issue of ending birthright citizenship which um is has been\nReally sort of the third rail um and and it it has come up and it has worked in the president's favorite was obviously a question from a reporter was not something the White House proactively put out\nThere well let's listen to that 'cause I Want to hear that clip and then I Want us to sort of break that down\nFall immigration some legal scholars believe he can get rid of the practice and shit without changing the culture ... any second of water or have you thought about this law it was always told me that you needed a constitutional amendment ... and you don't need a number one\nNumber one you don't need that number to nothing to do as much as well as you can definitely do it with an act of Congress\nBut now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nI think the president was very frustrated and the folks around him were very frustrated over the last few days because the the narrative or as folks go head to the polls and a lot of these states that have early voting\nOr was all about domestic terrorism there was this obviously this is terrible a shooting in Pittsburgh and and ... you know\nEverybody sees these things as the tragedies that they are but we have to say that what Republicans have been saying all along they knew this was going to be a very tough mid term elections Donald Trump knew that as well\nAnd what they were saying was you know all these issues come up and they they last for a day or two and then they dissipate and so they never really knew where we would end what would we be talking about\nNever really knew where we would end what would we be talking about when voters finally start going to the polls\nAnd they were talking about these these domestic terrorism issues that we're not seen as a help to the party so the president's saw the the migrant caravan despite the fact that it was never going to reach a the border anywhere near election day as a political gift that was the term that the folks around him were using and then\nI Would say the same thing for this question that came up yesterday I mean these are things that are going to come up and what he's doing even if it's not something that they're generating they're able to amplify the stories and they're really give them life and I think that\nIf that is something that allows them to turn the page on the type of narratives that they don't find helpful they're going to do that\nPittsburgh ... the White House reporter for Politico Christopher thanks again thank you so much

chefs here kind of re chats say we're going to do it some time in the future we need to be doing this and the next thirty days we've admired this problem for long enough down there\nThe United states has long been criticized for aiding the Saudis and the war by most estimates while over two million Yemen needs have been displaced and the humanitarian crisis is that the scale that's hard to fathom\nEven having been there several times before I was shocked at how bad it had become\nNew York times staff photographer Tyler Hicks has made three trips to the war torn country his latest just this month and what he found there was unlike anything he'd seen before\nOn Tuesdays program we talked to the New York times is Declan Walsh who's recent reporting share vivid details of the desperate state of millions of civilians in Yemen a country now at the brink of famine\nA company that report were portraits captured by Tyler Hicks showing children and babies starving to death in the north of the country and the bloody conflict ongoing in the south I spoke to Tyler today about those photographs\nYemen's of very difficult place to work there are a lot of distance to cover you know lots of checkpoints but there were a few places that we'd heard that people are really suffering and these are areas where people\nComing from a pretty large region and and getting to just a couple of really clinics I mean these are so much hospitals as as we would think of them back home these are very small\nClinics where where people come and however they can we found out there a lot of the problems is just that the economy of there's absolutely no money they earned by people people don't have jobs they don't have\nMoney to get to these hospitals fuels very expensive and hard to come by and it it costs a lot of money for them to you know they're they're they're having a hard time just feeding their families are let alone going many hours in a vehicle to get to a clinic\nThat's how we chose to go to these specific areas\nNow the piece that you did or for the New York times one of the first images that readers will see\nWhen they open the piece it's a photo of a young girl named a mall can you describe the photo for our listeners and tell us a little bit about what you were seeing and experiencing and really what struck you about a mile [noise]\nBeen to a few hospitals clinics around the north and then when I when I walked into this particular one in a place called a slum\nI could tell that the moment that I walked in that this was a really were some of the worst case which were uh so that it kind of open court orders which rooms are surrounding it and just\nKind of open court orders which rooms\nAre surrounding it and just looking from that central area without even entering the rooms I could see that that the children there were were really in terrible shape skin and bone and the first room that I went into I saw this young girl a mall and\nThe poor child was just laying on on um Koch her ribs just showing completely through her skin there was an ounce of us out on her her arms and legs just like to see text is so scary you know something about her face also she was very calm\nChild who ... when you see your body is just heartbreaking and and I I spent a lot of time photographing her um\nI I knew that as difficult as this photograph was to take\nAnd as difficult it is for the the viewers just to see\nI knew that this was going to be an important picture and an important photograph to be seen because uh she she really sums up how tragic and how bad the the malnutrition and the starvation has really become in Yemen\nAnd Tyler ... there is often a debate about traumatic images right on the one hand people will say they're just too traumatic to publish tend to look at um on on the other hand there people who say are they exploiting people who are in their most vulnerable state\nAnd at the photo journalist I'm Wondering how do you grapple with those\nIssues I never take photographs that are difficult to look at just for the sake of of getting a traumatic photo or sometimes there's a reason to document things that can be difficult to look at and and this was one of those cases\nThere's a lot of decision that goes into both picking the photographs\nThan to file the photographs to the New York times and then there's a whole\nTeam of people there who decide whether that image or images will appear in the newspaper and this was one of the cases where I think it's really important for these photographs to be saying I mean there has not been\nA lot of coverage out of Yemen it's it's a very difficult place to get to because the travel restrictions they're western journalists not been invited very often do to go there so when we can see what's happening\nThat's an opportunity for us to to show what's what's happening in the country is as difficult as it is\nAnd Tyler have we become desensitized to images like this and the crisis in Yemen over all\nUm because I just think back to what two years ago when there was an image of a toddler or that the Syrian refugee crisis and it's ... you know with dead on the beach on the shore and I just think that image was so powerful like are we becoming desensitized to the ... out there because we're just\nThere's so much going on right now\nI think yes but at the same time it that doesn't affect the way I think that I should be doing my job or about how the media should be covering these places you catch tried to deconstruct what people's sensitivities are and in effect\nQuarantine what you what you choose to show I think it's the more people become used to these things actually the more that you should be out there covering them because people need to be reminded of what's happening out there but all that being said it's extremely important to keep the temple up\nAnd to continue to get these images out there\nAnd have them scene and to get a reaction from them and of course some people will disagree with that they'll think that these photographs shouldn't be shown wonder why would you show you know these these children\nThese photographs shouldn't be shown wonder why would you show you know these these children who are are starving to death I mean there there was another photograph that ran as part of that I was at the same hospital\nAnd as people were bringing in their their six children often with their mothers being completely malnourished and unable to breastfeed or to to give any nutrition for them\nAnd it was a child photographs and um eight hours later that that that child died I found out the next day and uh [noise]\nThat's just incredibly heartbreaking should be witness to such a young and and it's a life that then is just gone you know you hear it the next day though that that child died and the people who are volunteering and working in these clinics are they're kind of becoming used to it\nTyler Hicks is a staff
