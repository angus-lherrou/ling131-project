today and the mysterious disappear into Saudi dissident and journalists them off the show veep show gave us resident went missing earlier this month and turkey now it took us official tells the New York times that he was killed in the Saudi\nConflict and they stumble on orders of the highest level of the Saudi Government with me on the line with Carlotta Gall the assembled bureau chief for the New York times Carlotta thanks for joining us pleasure to be with you can you remind our listeners who could show he is and why he would being targeted by the Saudi Government\nSo he was one of the most outspoken critics but the most interesting thing\nFor a lot of us who knew him over the years was that he was\nWell connected to the government he had served in the government you become a spokesman for some senior official so for us we knew him that way and then lately taken up a poster with the Washington Post or the global columnist and moved away\nFrom Saudi Arabia and basically set up and self imposed exile in his in his criticism had increased so he was a real so on and I saw it as we see clearly now with fake\nAnd you've been speaking to sources within the Turkish government Carlotto what are the new development here\nSo we've been following the day by day and drip drip the information has come out of it was clear from the start the the Turkish officials here were very alarmed and they talked early on of his possible death um\nAnd now we are getting the actual evidence we don't have a his body yet but we've got very from\nSigns from Turkish officials they don't want to come out in public but that really giving it to John honest to publish that there was two groups of Saudi aids that arrived on the day that he attended a meeting at the ... he never came out from that meeting\nOn October the second over a week ago and these officials that came flew in on private planes on the left the same day I'm\nUsually the Saudi officials are Turkish officials\nSaudi officials Fifteen of them on two separate planes they came in\nIn in a different times that day and they left the same day and the Turkish officials are saying they were essentially a hit squad they were responsible for killing him this membrane his body and somehow disposing all that so the the mystery remains the investigation the types of now\nMounted an investigation there are ... access to the consulate which of course is diplomatic ... trees so that to a also unprecedented but they're taking it very seriously\nThere are some very lurid detailed in your story in the New York times can you tell us a little bit about what we know so far about how ... was killed if that's in fact what happened\nThe details are gruesome as one official told my colleague David Kirkpatrick that it's something like\nGruesome as one official told my colleague David Kirkpatrick that it's something like pulp fiction and that they even arrived with a bone saw among their equipment\nKnow they took several books is an suitcases out of the embassy of a consummate building putting them in the cold [noise]\nUm we know they traveled with luggage on that private planes so it's coming out slowly but there's some very alarming details um those even one team to do the job of killing him and another team to clean up the premises off to it\nNow what do we know about how the United states has reacted if at all and the United states obviously has close ties to the Saudis um has there been any anything from the U.S so far\nSo at first it was a bit muted I think perhaps for everyone nobody was quite sure what had happened was this a case of a disappearance or really foul play and the Turks I think have been keen to get international support on this because\nI'm everyone knows Saudi Arabia is a very powerful and rich nation especially in the Muslim world and so\nEverybody has been looking certainly from here from looking from Istanbul where where I'm based has been looking to the American reaction and we saw a couple of comments from President Trump but also from vice president Pence and I think\nImportant they are more and more comments coming out of from congressman and senator so the American I think sided waking up and taking this more seriously as the information is coming out and it's becoming more and more clear what happened\nThis is a moment in which the United states has made you know at least the president has pulls no punches in his day and I think for many I'm In the press and not\nAttack on press freedoms has actually I think extending worldwide we've seen a number of journalists killed in Mexico we've seen a number of journalists killed\nIn the ... you recently how do we know who we can trust with these stories Carlotta are there any of the actors involved in this ... story that you feel are telling the truth or not telling the truth um it just feels really difficult with these types of pieces to understand where to look\nUm it it is difficult and not least in Turkey well known any you know the president of the usa criticized John is with the president turkey often criticizes John including foreign journalists let me working here\nUm but this is a completely different league from you know complaining about the press or banning press from working or even here as journalists I'll put in prison [noise]\nThis is altogether different league because it's\nNot only an act against a journalist who is clearly\nA disliked by the kingdom of Saudi Arabia for his criticism but to dispose of him breaking international law I'm In another country\nAlso be disposing of him in the country or take him out of the country it's complete the I'm a different league of of what we we have seen from coming from the U.S president on on the touch president so it's also very shocked to hear both in government on in society\nI think the government a radio pool because they knew ... well he was he counted among his friends people who are senior advisors and the government\nHe had a great reputation because he'd been reporting for such he is on Middle East in Muslim a fad and so he was he was well known and well respected an for him to end up like this in a pool linked to a country that considered him a Muslim brother a new pride themselves on\nPulling to a country the considered to the Muslim Brotherhood new pride themselves on the the hospitality and openness to get so it's short people across the board\nAnd a lot of volunteers stumbled bureau chief for the New York times ... thank you very much like you\nKnow [noise]\nWe want you
