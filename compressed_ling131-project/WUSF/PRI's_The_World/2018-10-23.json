editor Andrea Bernstein co hosts of the Trump a pod cast it back in the studio with me\n... from the Trump team takes this deeper behind the scenes of the Trump Organization in a report that reveals a disturbing pattern of deception and fraud Andrea great to have you back on the show\nAnd it's always great to be here so one of the big questions we have is what is the Trump Organization is it a real estate company it's at a construction company like why did they do\nSo the Trump Organization starts out building building which is what Donald Trump's father Fred had done\nThen Donald Trump diversify eyes and he goes into casinos they sort of number of developments and he runs into an awful lot of trouble with the banks because his project start failing banks don't want to lend to him so that starts this new thing\nAround the beginning of this century where he starts licensing his name and that's the way that the Trump Organization has always presented it\nWe license our name we don't actually do the construction not what we found is that Donald Trump and his children even kind on junior in particular would go around and they would imply to people that their family had\nEquity stakes ownership stakes in projects and that the sales of these projects were going fantastically\nNinety percent sold sold out these are the kinds of terms that were being used when in fact they didn't have an ownership stake they weren't sold out the window the practice restructured was it they would get their fees no matter what so they would get paid the projects would frequently fail\nAnd people who had invested in them bought in would lose their money and the trumps would move onto another project\nAnd say the same thing we had begun to see this in various projects but what we didn't realize was how consistent it was the fact that if the pattern was what was alarming to us because it suggests that it is a business model it's not just a fluke is not just a project or a couple of projects combat\nAnd there's a about a dozen deals that you guys focus on in this episode and in particular there's one on the Trump ocean club in Panama City sounds a little bit about why that's so important\nSo the Panama deal caught our attention for a few reasons one is that Panama is a place in the world that has a\nLow rating on scales of corruption meaning that it is very corrupt at the time the Trump Organization got in Transparency International rated it worse for example than Saudi Arabia very low worse than India\nSo this is a country that is also known\nFor being a place where various narco traffickers want to run their money money laundering and want to run their money because there's all of this banking secrecy in Panama this is a project that went bankrupt\nAnd we have we serve on earth through this extraordinary process our colleagues at ProPublica on earth the audio tape up your bunker trumped in an interview she did in two thousand and eight where she was asked about this\nProjects or [noise]\nEight where she was asked about this project\nProjects or [noise] [noise] it's filled with salt over Ninety percent of it and we saw it on her for a luxury market ever scratch prior to our entry\nNone of those things were true and although the interview was published the audio has never been heard before and you can hear how this mechanism works and it's okay to say I'm going to build the world's best building I'm going to build\nA such a beautiful building everybody's going to want to buy and there's actually a concept illegal concept known as ... free which is fine you can say that it's when you start to make\nSpecific material representation and you do it repeatedly that it becomes a question of whether there was actually a criminal fraud committed here now having said that a lot of this stuff happened a long time ago very far away so there are all kinds of\nQuestions have jurisdiction there are questions of statute of limitation but I think what this deep time has done is really sort\nOf make it clear to us that these are not fluke situations but they're actually a feature of the Trump business model and they sort of really changed the way that we view this licensing model which seemed like a really great idea of no banks want to lend to you you just sell your name you don't have to worry about getting the financing\nBut that is in fact what happened in fact what happened is they got people specifically to buy in based on lies and miss representations early on what is\nThe Trump Organization up to now and it's funny that you mentioned the name and just over the weekend there were some New Yorkers who pulled the a lot of money together to get the name off of their building and\nThey do they took they took like a cherry pick her up and took off the letters of this building which is something that's happened since Trump's been president there are still Trump projects around the world that they are actively working on their working in projects in the Dominican Republic they're working in projects in India\nThey're working in projects in Indonesia Trump's sons are now on the campaign trail campaigning for the causes and candidates of their father but at the same time they're also going around the world\nSelling condos to potential investors that we don't know who they are also the president hasn't fully divested from his businesses you know he has not there was even one point and twenty Seventeen when Eric's Trump admitted to Forbes magazine that they actually we're still talking about it\nOfficially he's given up the day to day control but he can still make money from it\nAnd that is the thing that ethics experts say is so confusing you never know in any given situation whether he is making a decision as\nThe head of the Trump Organization because he could have some personal profit or if he's doing it\nBecause he's the president of United States\nShouldn't that'd be I don't know illegal\n[laughter] I think to some extent what has happened with Donald Trump and it's it's sort of like broken the ethics system for example the situation is just come up with regards to Saudi Arabia\nBecause he's done business with the Saudis and he took this initially sort of muted position on what looked like the murder of an American journalist residence in Turkey and people were like well why is he doing that is it because of his business ties\nAnd the fundamental instability of this situation is that it's impossible to know\nNow you also want to send out a little message to your listeners on the podcast go for it\nRight so we have been hearing from some people who had bought in to Trump developments and we know there's a lot of takeaway listeners and in some of these places in Hawaii in Florida a lot

[noise]\n[noise]\n\nIn Nineteen Seventy eight the pregnancy discrimination act was passed to protect against discrimination based on pregnancy and childbirth or other related medical condition but forty years later how well is the pregnancy discrimination act protecting the modern workforce\nDeborah dinner is an associate law professor at Emory University and she joins me now Debra thanks for being with us hello thanks for having me\nSo tell us how is this law meant to protect pregnant women [noise] what what the pregnancy\nDiscrimination active Nineteen Seventy eight that I'll call it the PTA is it a men's title seven of the civil rights act of Nineteen sixty four and seven it's a law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex as well as race color religion and national origin\nAnd what the PTA does it defined sex discrimination to include pregnancy and discrimination on the basis of related medical conditions including childbirth\n[laughter] so what are some of the limitations to this law I understand it the conditional law can you tell us what that means\nSo what's the pregnancy discrimination act does is it said that you can't refuse to hire someone just because she's pregnant or you can't deny a promotion to pregnant women because you have stereotypes about mother had\nAnd it requires that pregnant persons persons affected by childbirth be treated just the same as other persons who are similar in quote their ability or inability to work\nIt's a requirement effectively at the same treatment\nSo the biggest limitation of the PTA is that it's\nOnly an anti discrimination mandate and it leaves many worker it's bereft of protection and so what it doesn't require it doesn't guarantee enough ferment of entitlement ten accommodation in the workplace so let's imagine a managerial professional and a fortune five hundred company\nWhose fortunate enough I'm lucky enough to work in a workplace that gives\nGenerous paid leave so if she broke her legs she could get safe for weeks of paid leave\nSimilarly if she became pregnant and ... needed leave before childbirth or after childbirth she could get four weeks of paid childbirth because she would be treated the same\nBut let's imagine people who work in warehouses like in the recent New York times article they work in low income jobs um where they are much less likely to have generalized protections for disability so their employer gives no for example no light duty accommodations to any worker when they fall L\nIn that workplace and anti discrimination mandate does not get you very far so just the requirement under the PTA that pregnant workers to be treated the same\nAs other temporarily disabled workers doesn't get that much protection so they won't be given light duty which poses a risk to their health and the health of their fetuses\nNow I Wonder if does this have anything to do with the fact that pregnancy is considered a disability\nDo with the fact that pregnancy is considered a disability clause in this law because it feels like we're we're treating pregnancy the same as we would a quote unquote disability is not as a separate category is that right\n[noise] yeah the law it's important to recognize does not actually mentioned the word disability what the law says\nIs that sex discrimination under title seven includes pregnancy and then it gives you an example and it says that for example pregnant women should get the same benefits as other employees who are similar\nIn their ability or inability to work\nSo it might be helpful to explain a little bit where this idea of temporary disability came from\nFeminists lawyers in the seventies were really worried that any law that specially protected pregnant women would lead to hiring discrimination\nAnd so they promoted a kind of an approach that with sex neutral that analogy eyes between pregnancy and temporary disability in order to use the anti discrimination as a kind of bootstrap to get pregnant women some of the benefits that were available for temporarily disabled workers generally\nAnd to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of pregnancy but again this leaves the workers who most need protection bereft of protection because it doesn't provide a positive entitlement to the kinds of accommodations that are necessary for the health and safety of pregnant workers\nTook this law changed I'm In the past forty years and what do you see is the future of it [noise]\nYeah I think that law has evolved to 'em so for example and the two thousand Fifteen decision young the UPS the Supreme Court expanded what would count as disparate treatment on the basis of pregnancy or what would count as kind of a differential treatment of pregnancy that was on last fall\nSo if an employer for example against accommodation to a large percentage of its workforce\nFor whatever reason but not to pregnant workers that now can be considered unlawful\nAnother advance and the law we've seen is that stereotyping pregnant women is itself in a way that leads to kind of an adverse employment action firing our failure to promote or a denial of benefits that those kinds of gender stereotypes are themselves\nUnlawful [noise] what what what gender stereotypes are you referring to well for example I think that one of the calls I'm the woman from New Jersey who I was told by her supervisor that she needed to take more time off work or have a kind of less demanding job because she should spend more time with the baby\nThose are the kinds of gender stereotypes that are actually I'm Still very prevalent the notion that a new mother won't be able to be as committed to the workforce because she's now committed\nTo her child more than she ... her job those are the kinds of gender stereotypes that could be ... of unlawful sex discrimination I got the PTA\nDeborah dinners associate law professor at Emory University and she has a book
