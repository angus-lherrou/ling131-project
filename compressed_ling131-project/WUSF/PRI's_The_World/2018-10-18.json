for a chance to win back to back World Series titles [noise]\nPitcher revert those who may have lost the masters fans when he gave up that home run during Tuesday's game the Astros are currently down three to one against the Boston Red Sox and the American league championship series\nBut it was soon it plays on the team has also been question for reasons unrelated to his pitching since he joined the Astros last August in June major league baseball suspended a tuna Seventy five games for violating the league domestic violence policy\nAnd while he was still suspended the Astros picked him up in a trade from the Toronto blue jays\nThen the Astros made another move this week they announced a partnership to address domestic violence in the Houston area\nWhitney Macintoshes a reporter covering baseball for SB Nation thanks for being with us Whitney absolutely thanks so much for having me so there's not a lot of information public right now about the sooner or a domestic violence charge what do we know about it\nSo what we do know is that he was arrested back in may early may uh in Canada for an assault on an unnamed female victim uh in that case then a a police report was filed but because it was in Canada\nThink they're just a little different things are a little bit more under lock and key words in the U.S we would probably know some details what we know trial dates were pushed back throughout the summer while he was suspended\nAnd eventually just about a over a month ago\nThe criminal case which wrapped up with a piece bond which is about approximately the equivalent of a a probationary a restraining order situation in the U.S he has a year of probation he's not allowed to speak to the victim and essentially that was because the victim who lives in Mexico\nDid not want to travel back to Canada to testify so they had no reasonable expectation of connection um so that's where we stand the suspension has ended and uh\nYeah the the detailed or just a little fuzzier because we don't have that police report to refer to or an actual criminal trial that you know went under way so let's talk a little bit about ... a\nCurrent domestic violence policy like what is that it's only been around for a couple of years um but it led to some long term suspensions like in the case of tuna\nYes so I'm all these current domestic violence sexual assault and child abuse policy was implemented in twenty Fifteen I'm there have been a handful of investigations and suspensions to this point and those who know was a the third highest suspension so it was a pretty significant a suspension it was the third or fourth one this year actually\nI'm most recently African Russell of the cubs were suspended forty games\nFor a domestic abuse so uh they're having players offended before and after you know he is not the first but again his situation is very specific because\nYou know he is not the first but again his situation is very specific because\nThere was a trade that was involved um but MLD doesn't necessarily um similar other sports and as they do not necessarily wait until a criminal case it then completed they do their own investigation they speak to victims on their own time they may not speak to a victim uh at all when they take their a final decision into account\nUm an overall the processed it a little bit\nA kind of like hosting this case it's a little bit um [noise] non transparent we don't have a ton of information about why they do with Seventy five games as Russell was forty or a handful of players have been in the Fifteen to thirty range in the past two years we don't really know what ... investigation\nComes to solve and um so it's a little tough and it does make it\nUh it does open them up to speculation quite a bit especially in the Senate case you're saying\nHe's the third highest number of games he must have done something awful but we don't know um and we have no way of telling so it's a little tricky um and players under the\nSuspended under the policy are as we've seen eligible to play in the postseason compared to players extended for steroids or performance enhancing drugs which are\nNot eligible to play in the postseason so that's a little bit of a tricky line as well so there's definitely some criticisms are some issues of print parents the as far as how their investigations go about but uh it's been a few years and you know uh I think of a case by case basis it's worked on varying levels for them as I'd like it to\nThe Astros decided to trade to get us you know while he was still suspended and I get the ... and when he was speaking to the New York times earlier this week the general manager said this quote did we take a risk no question\nAre there are people that are still upset about it no question will do whatever we can at this point supporting the relevant causes and he went on to say that it was soon to actually make the team stronger what do you make of\nThat yeah I think it's a ... the way I've seen the Astros have been a little a little bit calloused in this case um you know this is not the first time that a team has treated for a an a legit or confirmed domestic abuse or in order to win the world series the cubs did this with our world is Chapman star closer currently on the Yankees a few years ago\nAnd it did when the world series and it worked and sand kind of had to\nCome to terms with whether that was worth it with those tuna um the ... been a little bit more blatant about that what we're doing um you know he ... he throws good pitches he's gonna win he could win at the world series\nWhen he what's interesting about this story is that the arrows now have a domestic violence campaign tell us about that what is that\nPurely for the optics of ... having gotten no sooner is that a real serious a campaign that they really have put a lot of energy behind what is this campaign\nI think it can be both but it does come across as significant PR spin Jim ... owner of the Astros did openly admit kind of we now that we've treated for oh through and we want to make sure that domestic violence awareness is a ... in an important thing for the ... foundation which has a thirty million dollar and Dalmatian\nUm so again he kind of fed the quiet part out loud we traded for domestic abuse are\nNow we'd like to do the work in the community that hope hopefully makes us feel better about that it feels like they're trying to have it both ways it it does um the players have been saying oh he's a great clubhouse presence you know ... flew an H J Hinch GM and manager of the team have kind of like\n... he's a he's a great player he can put that pass behind him it's great and now they're donating I'm Around three hundred thousand dollars to local woman

to the take away the investigation continues into journalist your mom cause show these disappearance from Saudi consulate in Turkey the crisis has brought international attention to the economic and political power dynamics that play in the region\nAnd while the U.S has relied on Saudi Arabia as a critical partner in the middle east the Saudi kingdom is also behind much of the instability in countries like Yemen in\nSyria here to talk about the potential geo political fallout from all this is not er ... made the director of the center for Middle East studies at the University of Denver professor Hashimi welcome to the take away\nI'm happy to be with you if you could prevent their help us understand where we are politically in the region right now what are the strongest alliances and which are the ones that are most strained\n[noise] well the the main alliance in the middle east today's the Saudi ... alliance that I think is um an allied a very intimately with Israel with strong support from the Trump Administration\nUm I think these players are hoping to rewrite the geopolitics and\nThe political map of the middle east by pursuing a series of very aggressive policies toward their adversaries fundamentally rooted in strengthening authoritarian\nAllies in the region a crushing civil societies and um and and playing very hardball with um with other countries in the region\nDo you expect that all of these things could potentially lead to another uprising similar to what we saw in the Arab Spring\nChicken evidently will to think that you know millions of people many of them young I'm with aspirations for a better future simply go onto except to live under\nForms of despotism forever I think is wishful thinking I think in many ways that really is the\nUm the ... bargain it many people in the west have calculated on these authoritarian regimes can simply keep things under control assuming that people will be too tired or two I'm disillusioned to resist and revolt of course with revolutions and revolts we never can predict when do happen\nBut almost certain uh another ... to some form is inevitable\nWell and I will also you know the Arab Spring within twenty ten twenty eleven were now in a very different moment\nUm at least internationally the United states has a different president in a different administration I'm Wondering\nUm what about that long standing relationship and support that the United states and Saudi Arabia have had a this isn't a Trump phenomenon solely this is something that the United states and Saudi Arabia have had for for quite some time\nDo you think that uh that relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United states could be affected by what we're seeing right now in the ground\n[noise] well I think it's bound to be affected I mean you're absolutely right to um to suggest that this is simply not to be diminished Donald Trump the U.S Saudi relationship and more broadly to us\nTo be diminished Donald Trump the U.S Saudi relationship and more broadly the U.S relationship to the region goes back to World War two where the United states effect of the I'm struck up a series of alliances with 'em\nOr autocrats and authoritarian regimes I'm hoping that they would preserve stability advance American interest\nIn this particular incident that we're talking about which amounts to show he\nThe United states and specifically President Trump has sort of played two sides of this coin on the one hand they're defending the Saudis they're saying they're regional partner on the other hand they're being confronted with more and more and more evidence just yesterday we heard there was an audio recording of\nA what could potentially be ... um last moments um then that evidence is showing that this could in fact be a state sanctioned Saudi murder what type of danger could there be in continuing that alliance given this increasing evidence\n[noise] well the danger is that it's simply going to um um perpetuate a very\nUm [noise] I'm odious regime in Riyadh that is responsible for a lot of the regional instability so I think the danger here is that it's simply going to deepen the instability in the region it's going to generate more anti American hostility it's going to embolden\nAutocrats and dictators around the world to see that at least this administration in Washington DC\nIs willing to go to bat apologize deflect criticism from the policies of authoritarian regimes who's going to have a lot of destabilizing consequences we've invested heavily in these regimes we've had invested heavily in this particular crown prince hoping that he would be our savior\nAnd all the warnings that uh people were issuing with respect to this policy with respect to the this particular crown prince no one took a seriously and this is not just a Republican Trump problem this goes across the political spectrum and as I stated a moment ago as deep historical roots\nThis is the consequences of investing in authoritarianism and political tyranny and ignoring human rights and basic um questions of of of democracy and good governance\nAnd we also know that the Washington Post published a final opinion piece from ... last night um which they had received right before his death or disappearance and in it he writes about the need for free expression in the Arab world\nCan you tell us what the role of the press and the media is in Saudi Arabia and how that impacts what people may or understand about what's happening in the rest of the region\nThe role of the press and the media in Saudi Arabia is to effectively repeat the propaganda oh the Saudi royal family I mean there is no independent press there is no free media that's one of the reasons why\nYou want to show you had to leave and moved to the United states um and so the role as a media in Saudi Arabia is not that different from the rolls the media and any authoritarian regime in Saudi Arabia I think it's much worse because the the the nature of the level of the repression\nParticularly under this crown prince has moved at a much more ugly and repressive direction you know this final op ed that um that you're mall has written is worse pondering it's worse worth thinking about but it's\nIt's important that we think about this this concept in this idea of a free press in relationship to U.S policy toward Saudi Arabia we haven't been pursuing a free press in Saudi Arabia we haven't been pursuing human rights we've been coddling dictators in death spots from the time that the United states emerged on the scene in Nineteen forty five\nIt's been a consistent policy of downplaying these basic values that we often espouse as being foundational to our own country and our own national identity but we rarely apply them to our foreign policy particularly in the middle east and I think we've\nBut we rarely apply them to our foreign policy particularly in the middle east and I think we have to we have to figure out a way out of this um just just broken pattern of of policies that are a lot in the long term interest of the United states and they're certainly not the long term interest that the
