point seven\n[noise]\nYou have a district attorney in a city or county who doesn't really see justice of the way you see it justice can be nearly impossible for\nThis year there's a grassroots movement to elect more progressive more diverse district attorney\nSean King is the cofounder of real justice for years king worked as a civil rights activists after the shootings of black men and women by police and despite it incredible ... that's on social media he wasn't seen much except in bringing about policy change we\nMainly loss those battles for justice for Eric Garner from my brown later for Tamir Rice for John Crawford for Freddie Gray for for Sandra Bland and and all of these fights we kept fighting for justice and losing\nAnd it caused me really an early twenties Seventeen to say\nWhy the hell are we losing so much when it seems like we're on the right side of history it seems like we're even on the right side of\nOf ethics morality integrity decency but nobody is being held responsible and it caused me to land kind of square in this space of saying\nHey I think a huge part of the problem is this position of district attorney and when you have a district attorney in a city or county\nWho doesn't really see justice the way you see it justice can be nearly impossible and um after all my life and to try to elect progressive reform minded compassionate district attorneys all over the country\n[noise] did you know anything about how district attorneys work how they get into their position any of that\nNo I I really didn't and I don't think most Americans fully understand what the position of district attorney is what responsibilities they have and just how much influence and power and uh and how much\nLeeway they have and what cases they pursue how they pursue them what cases they drop\nAnd um it was really in twenty four team that I first came face to face with that reality in in four different cases with the case of Eric Garner the case of John Crawford the case of Mike Brown and then the case of Tamir Rice in Cleveland\nWhen I came to understand and it and it it took me almost three years to really understand this is that the entire world can be incredibly frustrated and deeply agitated about\nA single case of injustice and we could have the top trending topic in the world we could be on the front cover of every newspaper\nBut if the local district attorney\nDoesn't feel the same way justice can be nearly impossible\nSo let's go to the numbers for a minute Sean about how the A's how they get into their positions [noise] how many district attorneys are there in this country and\nAnd how many district attorneys are there in this country and are they all elected\nYeah yeah so there are right now there and write about twenty five hundred district attorneys all over the country and while the policies governing them vary from city to city county to county state to state effectively your local district attorney\nNormally functions in a city wide or a county wide capacity and with the exception of of a few states where the governor gets to appoint those district attorneys\nThey are elected locally and they normally are elected even in places that are highly engaged like like New York city they're normally elected\nBy just three or four percent of local people who show up to vote\nAnd so the overwhelming majority of district attorneys literally are elected wants and often run on opposed sometimes not just for a few terms but for decades\nIn some states they are non partisan positions are in others they run as Democrats or Republicans\nAnd uh when I say that out loud most people around the country and around the world rather gas because the the their version of district attorneys around the country\nAre appointed nonpartisan positions so the idea that the person who's overseeing their local justice system is an elected partisan shocks people\nUm I think some of the challenge comes in here they are Ninety five percent white those twenty five hundred people\nThey are nearly Ninety percent male uh and they are overwhelmingly conservative and what we're saying hey we can change the system's a little bit from the outside but that's not nearly as effective as what we can do\nInside of these positions and so we're trying to encourage people hey you need to consider running for district attorney\nWell let's talk about one of those places where you got involved in Dallas County Calif a little bit about the candidate that you back and what happened in that race\nEffectively what we saw in Dallas and in other cities and counties across the country\nIs the best civil rights leaders in those cities all they are telling people sometimes is go vote and go vote is not sophisticated enough is not complex enough to really change a very complex justice system and um\nWe saw a an amazing woman who stepped out to run a local judge named Elizabeth for now\nAnd uh we were so excited to ah to backer and a lot of people are sometimes kind of adopt reform talking points\nBut she like deeply want it to reform the system she saw how broken it was up close and personal and uh we were running against a a a former Republican who became a Democrat and\nUm we ran our hearts out and I thought and I thought for sure that we were going to win that race and or something wild happened we on election day actually won\nOver cruise though by over Fifteen Percent but because he did so well in early voting a we ended up losing by just five hundred votes\nI think we also think we made a mistake there there is this a sliver of America that is desperate for reform but for\nAmerica that is desperate for reform but for most people who are coming out the vote\nReform is not the main thing that's getting them out to vote its safety and you will struggle to win any race if your opponent convinces voters if you want to be safe\nVote for me and if you if you want some reforms that may or may not affect you you can vote for your opponent but just know if you vote for me you will be safe and it took us losing to see that\nWhen we run exclusively on the phone and give the issue of safety over to our tone it will probably gonna lose every single time\nWe have to take a quick break more with Sean King in just a minute stay with [noise]\n\n\nThe political left and right are bitterly
