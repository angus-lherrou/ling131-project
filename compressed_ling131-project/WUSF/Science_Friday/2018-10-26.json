NPR's lead politics editor hide him and go hey they're so obviously we're going to be keeping close track of the story and learning more about who the suspect is who has been arrested what we know for sure though is just how devices these crimes have become in American politics and I wonder if you can tell us why\nWell you know I mean polarization has been at an all time high for quite some time uh you know you look back at a couple of different arrows and American history maybe the Nineteen sixties and the civil war or come close to the store or worse than than today but there's not much in between\nUh and you know President Trump let's be Frank has been somebody who has created the sense that the price of the enemy of the people\nHe continues to fake news at his rallies and a point the finger at the pen world kept in at the rally is a behind the riser is I was at a rally in Houston people were very nice to me going in\nA happy to take my question a lovely people to chat with and talk to by the end and through the middle of it was a crescendo of just anti a media stuff so that is what comes to be seen and President Trump has been somebody who has been a take no prisoners\nYou know I'm kind of politician for anybody who disagrees\nWith a bunch of medical the president's started this week by calling for you\nBut to medical to president started this week by calling for unity and then he has come to this place of that you're describing now and I want to hear from a White House press secretary Sarah Sanders who was speaking on Thursday\nPulitzer Prize or that I\nCould not have been more presidential yesterday when he spoke directly to the American people picking them this violence let's not get well often who is responsible for this heinous act it is the person who made and sat at least ... packages what's not I\nForget that that is ultimately the person that is responsible and will be held responsible by this administration now clearly\nThe president thinks he's being unfairly linked to the person who did this\nBut why hasn't he been able to stick to that message of unity that he started this with\nI mean it's pretty typical pattern of President Trump's I mean this is somebody who anytime he has criticized or becomes the sort of a focus of criticism and then he doubled down he tripled down he digs that uh you know that trench and is going to fight for every inch\nAnd you know to some respects but Sarah Sanders says is true ah the people the person who committed the fact I'm is going to be held responsible or its adjusts department that the president overseas and that person is largely responsible for what they did obviously\nRelated to his life that's fresh air tonight at seven on W. USF Julie Marquez of spectrum\nTonight at seven on W. USS Julie Marquez of spectrum a new sign says sixty percent rain chance today in a high is eighty four it's two twenty\nThis is special coverage from NPR News I'm Lisa Mullen\nI'm Peter O'Dowd and we're waiting for a news conference from the Justice Department just a few minutes from now will be learning new details in our top story today one person\nIs in custody in South Florida in connection with a series of suspicious packages mail to prominent Democrats and critics of President Trump let's bring in Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent Carrie or tell us about this man who is in custody now in Florida\nAnd parents identifying him as Caesar ... fifty six years old from South Miami as you said and his background includes a long wrap sheet\nA number of charges for related to drugs and fast and also charge in two thousand two for a threatening to throw place project or discharge an explosive device he also has a bankruptcy and has passed and we also know he's a registered Republican\nYou said that he has a district long criminal record and the police were aware of him would do we know what led them to him at this point in this investigation\nAnd we are going to wait to hear from the Justice Department the FBI the postal inspectors and others about what exactly are led authorities to this man's so quickly this is a remarkably\nSwift investigation is President Trump has already said this morning we do know that a number of the devices were not exploded so they were in ... in essence a mother load of evidence for the FBI lab in Quantico the FBI lab has been looking at whether there was any DNA are fingerprints on those devices we don't yet know\nWhether this suspect may have left those traces which led authorities to him so quickly\nCan you talk about the fact that these bombs did not explode was one of the big question leading up to his arrest or was it on purpose that the suspect with ... you know just a bad bomb maker\nOr was it um you know something else I'm sure that's something investigators will be tracking\nA ... a authorities are likely to shed a little more light on that at the news conference I suspect but it's important to note that um as of yesterday the NYPD and federal authorities were advising anyone who came across such a suspicious package one of those manila envelopes\nTo treat it as if it weren't dangerous and to not touch it and I can handle it call ... ... and at the local level are called the FBI so it's not yet clear to me whether\nThis person or if he is in fact the uh the bomber or wanting to hurt somebody and just didn't know how or whether there was some other uh issue at play and has making these devices\nAre once again we're talking to NPR's Carrie Johnson and waiting for federal officials at the department of justice to\nGive a news conference on the latest on the investigation into the male bombings that's happening at the bottom of the hour carry the arrest do they expect that they're going to be making anymore do they have any idea if the man they arrested today was acting as as a lone wolf\nAttorney general Jeff Sessions yesterday said that he is I'm expecting to bring to justice any and all people involved in this\nRight now we know that see their say I guess the only person in federal custody I think it's the ... are going to be looking for a while yet to see if he had any help any assistance whatsoever we don't yet know the answer to that question\nWhat about the white van we saw pictures of it on the TV all morning long do we know that it belongs to the suspect because of course there were images\nOf the president there were also ... you know stickers bashing CNN visible in the window I mean it's very early in this investigation but do we know anything about why investigators a came\nBut do we know anything about why investigators or came and got to that than\nWe do know that these are saying I was taken into custody in or near an auto zone business and that shortly thereafter people with FBI jackets and other law enforcement were seen securing this white van and transporting end up possibly to evaluate it for ... century purposes or other purposes\nAuthorities have not on the record yet connected that van ...\nIs there any notion at this point as to whether or not he was considered armed or dangerous at the time or any uh arms apprehended\nOut we don't yet know the answer to that question we do know that there was a massive manhunt under way for this individual that involve federal and local authorities\nAcross multiple states and we do know he is in custody now we have no reports of any law enforcement officers injured or hurt in any way in connection with that apprehension\nOkay Carrie Johnson NPR justice correspondent stay put if you will were awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department are but for now let's turn to the political side of this of course it's a major part of this story a Republican strategist Allison Stewart is with us now Alice welcome to you\nThank you Peter great to be here and we also have democratic strategist and host at he'll TV Jamal Simmons\nA ... or ... or ALS want to start with you know have a suspect in custody ... what are your thoughts going into this it has been a very politically fraught past couple of days\nAnd it has been and it's been a very tense time and of course we can all say our our greatest gratitude and thanks to\nThe FBI and law enforcement and those who put their their lives on the line to to make this apprehensions so swift and I bring bring about a a sense of calm and and of course look we're in a very politically charged climate and it's a very uh an intense time in in our politics I\nI I think if we're looking at this through the the political land ... we have to give some credit to the president this afternoon who who did say that this is a time for Americans to unify\nAnd while we don't know the cause of this or the motives of of this is a ... this is a time to bring the nation together and the president was was wise to say that anyone involved in this will be brought to justice in the face the full extent of the law\nAnd to rightly claimed called this despicable a despicable act of political violence and it's time to\nHave peace in the United states\n... I'm Sorry I interrupted you do want to bring you into this conversation do you think the president can do that can unify the country right now\nI really want him to really want him to try um I I've been to support\nIt so far but every time he has spoken out on the words that are about Seventy five percent like so and then ... minutes or hours later he does or says or something that was to blame on the victims let the media or\nYou know tries to lessons in some way to make light of it in some way and I think\nThe president um his job right now it's not it altered his job is to bring people together I Would love to see the president um do something well maybe he called President Obama may be called President Clinton and offered has is health and and and made sure that the FBI all the other resources or look at their disposal\nThey were protected it you know him and made sure the attorney general Jeff Sessions called ... older to make sure he was going to be okay\nBut this is the moment we're supposed to reach out and not just with words\nAlso with the actions well that's what\nThe president has has not apparently reached don't do any of those do ...\nThe president has has not apparently reached don't do any of those do whom the ah the the male bombings or bombs were addressed\nUm but I Wonder if you could tell us about the suspect we don't know a lot about him but if you were to believe the pro Trump ... stickers on the windows have been banned he is apparently a Trump supporter so how would you as a Republican strategist Alice advise leaders of the party to address is\n... ... more than anything it's important that we not jump to conclusions and not speculate prematurely what his motives were but as you say looking at that van with a lot of the the photographs you saw\nAnd there was also that sticker on there with mention of CNN and it was not in a favorable term and I am a contributor CNN I met that building where this happened the other day or at least once a week and it it's frightening but I think from a Republican standpoint we need to send a message\nThat a while we can disagree politically we need to do so in a non violent way and we need to do so in a calm way and uh the best way to show if you're disappointed with the way things are in this country is to go vote and let your emotions\nBe heard at the ballot box and I think it needs to be consistent and I will say that\nIn my view the call to end the race to the bottom starts at the top and it needs to be a farm\nIn a consistent message and as your mom said it needs to not be Justin word but also an action\nThat we were in the you're saying starting at the top meeting with the president a drawl absolutely how do you think Democrats you deal with it\n[noise] well I think Democrats would be the same way there's no time to play all three I wa disagree with the rhetoric that the president has been using so last year and a half a couple of years regardless of the media lock her up and all the chance all the things that we don't want to go through the mall I disagree with those\nI'm willing to say maybe he didn't know maybe he didn't understand the impact of those words maybe even if you did you never thought anybody would take actions upon those words I don't blame the president for the actions that have occurred after those actions occurred the president now knows those words have impact\nThe big I'm a motivation there\nOkay hang hang with us if you can on NPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson let's bring you back in uh we are awaiting this press conference from the Justice Department is remind us who is uh that we expect to hear from it and what are some of the unanswered question that we're still waiting for\nYeah this is quite a line up we're waiting to hear from including the attorney general the United states Jeff Sessions the FBI Director Chris Wray the U.S attorney in Manhattan Geoffrey Berman and that's important because that's where we think\nThis individual ultimately will be prosecuted where he will face justice several of those devices were recovered in New York and we know the FBI is New York field office has been particularly active we have a\nWe have an official from the FBI is New York field office William Sweeney we also have the NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill\nAh we have the postal inspectors we have the secret service in somebody from the Capitol police as well so this is a murderers rose law enforcement it's very rare you see that many of these top officials on the stage in fact I have a question whether all these men are actually going to fit on that time the age of the Justice Department\nAnswer unanswered questions did he have any help did he have any help\nAnd are there other devices out there as we speak I've gotten an email confirming that Tom's dire a prolific democratic donor has confirmed that he was addressed to package and there may be other such devices out there\nWe've got to find that out law enforcement desperately is going to be hunting for those things because they fear they're dangerous even if they don't go offer detonate um they do contain material that could be problematic and law enforcement wants to wrap their arms around all those devices out there\nThey also want to find out what isn't this man had any help and what he was planning next if anything as for motives it's not clear right now there is a social media account that's been linked to the suspect fifty six year old Caesar salad from South Florida\nIn that Twitter account he has gone off after a prominent Democrats including some of whom have who haven't been to address the use of be suspicious packages and that's one hint as to his motive but of course law enforcement is going to be digging ever deeper for more evidence and more information\nNPR's Carrie Johnson I'm ... and just to to reset for the audience where we stand no authority is arrested in South Florida Man this morning in connection with a wave of suspicious packages addressed this week to political critics to President Trump law enforcement is confirmed that that man is Cesar ... fifty six years old as interested in Davey Florida\nThat that man is Cesar ... fifty six years old as an address in Davey Florida and has a criminal record all to have some ties to New York\nAh the arrest followed the discovery of three more suspicious packages and carry junk and you just mentioned that a democratic fundraiser Tom Sawyer has said that he was the recipient of or at least the intended recipient of one of those packages and he issued a statement as well did he say anything about the package or how he found out that he was targeted\nYeah serious spokesman he said I'm it's confirmed that a suspicious package mail to Tom Steyer was intercepted and had a male facility in California\nHe says we're thankful every one we work with is safe and sound that's our first priority but he says were seen as systematic attack on our democracy and the rule of law that extends much further than one isolated incident in Florida and he's talking about the need for people to come together and rebuild\nA democracy for each and every American I'm trying to find some unity er during this very dark period where many prominent Democrats had been at a vet a recipients are intended recipient of these suspicious devices that was the last few days right I'm\nJust thinking that if you are a prominent critic of the president and you have not yet been targeted but perhaps you could be because of positions that you've taken and again we don't know fully know the motivation but this so far though the people who've gotten these packages had been critics of the president\nI'm Kerry have you have you been hearing from people who who are concerned that they could be next to it that they're taking precautions in case they are [noise]\nI have been hearing from people former officials in the federal government and the Obama administration\nWho are trying to be more mindful of how they handle mail where they open mail and I'm being basically on the lookout for one of these suspicious looking on yellow mental envelopes with patenting that we've seen on the news for the last two days\nOf course some of the targets a or intended recipient of of these devices are really well known the attorney former attorney general Eric Holder\nThe former CIA director John Brennan this morning in New York another package was intercepted\nIntended for the former director of national intelligence Jim Clapper and another one this morning in Florida intended for New Jersey democratic senator Cory Booker the list just kept growing and growing and it's not clear to me that were done yet with outlet\nHave all those packages for all those people that you just mentioned where they all exactly the same so that you would continue to know what to look for a ... in in the mail string\nAh for the vast majority of those packages the FBI or local police are both have confirmed that these were similar looking packages that you have seen\nNPR justice correspondent Carrie Johnson I Wonder if we can bring back in the loop William hunt former FBI special agent to teachers in the criminal Justice Department in Radford University in Virginia a new country there yeah I'm here yes\nSo you've seen on TV a lot of the scene and had described as Carrie Jones did what the packages of looked like\nIt at what point if there are packages that are are more and more packages to come at what point um can you identify those is coming from either this suspect or somebody connected with the suspect or maybe some buddy who's a a copycat as often happens in cases like these\nYeah yeah it's it's extremely difficult I mean you know it's obviously a easy to get\nSome of these materials but it it it's a lot of materials are tall and and so it's really going to take a a a close look by law enforcement to confirm whether or not it is I'm the same suspect or coffee get so we're talking about um review of the law\nSo you know we're talking about um review of by the FBI the FBI a lab back in the field office looking at the actual forensics a so it's not going to be an easy call a quick call until it's actually you've had a a thorough look at these things\nAt what point will you feel that the threat is over\nThere the threat is over you know that's\nThat's a great question I mean I I think as a as a couple of things so first that he's got a a interrogate destruction show 'em if he's willing to talk and that's a that's a big gift um you know you can have a sense of of how for telling is\nHow you know what his lowly age what else is out there the other thing is just physical evidence and the electronic average is you get in and with a search warrant and you're able to take a look at is I'm a computer his phone records\nThat lake give you a really good sense of what all he's done I mean there may be just a ton of evidence at his house or in his car business\nAnd that's going to give you an idea of how extensive these threats off so I Would say within the next\nYou know twenty four hours you're going to have search orange executed you're going to have a done it initially Jerry Asian or they should have a good idea of how far this has gone with this particular suspect but then there's a whole question of again is working with someone else or tracking down any potential each other a associates that made and healthy\nAnd it's ... special agent Luke William hunt a NPR's Carrie Johnson it looks like it would be like very soon\nTo the Justice Department for this press conference about the arrest that happened today just very quickly we know that there was a white van with all sorts of political details apparently pro Trump ... spent details on the side of it\nDo we know for sure if this vehicle is directly tied to the stuff that he was arrested\nHere's what we do know law enforcement is proceeding on the idea that it is somehow connected to the fact that they have not said it is and his definitively on the record I expect we're going to hear a lot more about that in the next two minutes or so when it's a news conference start as law enforcement decides to tell us\nWhat if anything this individual is charged with and how they would act\nAnd does he just like the individual you're talking about a fifty six years old of daily Florida where he is he right\nNow he is in federal custody or he was taken into custody in South Florida and the likelihood is that he as um everybody's are trying to find out more from him about whether he had any help whether they're additional packages out there and and any number of other questions they want to know to protect public safety we have gotten a warning\nThat this press conference with attorney general Jeff Sessions is going to be getting started within the next few seconds I Want to say thank you to Luke William ... former FBI special agent thanks very much for your incite\nPleasure good to be here and Republican strategist Alice stewards um we uh we want to thank you to please hang tight because we do expect to hear from attorney general Jeff Sessions in just a moment\n[noise] thank\nYou all for being here over the past week more than a dozen suspicious packages have been sent to through the United States
