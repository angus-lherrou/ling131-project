A. M. U. dot org let's get back to that story of the Saudi Arabian journalist ... who has gone missing possibly murdered\n... we've heard a number of accounts particularly from the Turks about what Saudi Arabia allegedly did to Mr to show you that they basically said hitman after him what do we know for sure about the disappearance at this point\nFor shall we know that he ... to into the come fill a in Istanbul and he didn't work out\nThat is what we know for sure there are then reports that they were to go stream jet that came from Saudi Arabia or with fifty men if they go into a blackout a vines are drove to the ... so the consul general's residence which is allegedly showed he may have been taken\nAnd they did what they did to him now there are reports that collecting that attacked U.S intelligence have proof\nOr that or that they know what happened to him and that he was tortured and dismembered and I met the most brutal brutal debts\nUnder the fifty men then flew back to a Saudi Arabia on the Gulf Stream jets a little later in the day now we know that the the planes that were those two plane movements at different times that came into his stumble ... and then went back to react\nWho was on them ... that designation was within the state capital right just widowed one hundred percent no but you get the distinct sense that ah the ... the ... are telling the authorities here\nA ... you will start he's here in the U.S to understand is not a million miles from what I have just sketched out because I think that there has been a willingness to believe and that is why you're seeing\nThe deep expressions of anxiety and on these over what has unfolded and what the implications might be there's some things that you can easily sweep onto the carpet in international affairs on there are some things that are just there are a bit more ... quit I miss definitely falls into that category\nWhere we I Wonder if we can talk about the U.S in Saudi Arabia is relationship the real long time allies at a press conference at the oval office yesterday President Trump was asked about to she'll use disappearance here's part of what the president's at\nFirst I Want to find out what happened and we're lucky again this took place in Turkey and to the best of our knowledge because she'll be is not a United States citizen is that right or is that right [noise] permanent resident okay we don't like John would all like it and we don't like it even a little bit [noise] but as to whether\nTrying to do like it and we don't like it even a little bit as to whether or not we should stop a hundred and ten million dollars from being spent in this country knowing they have\nFour or five alternatives to very good alternatives that would not be acceptable to be okay but we're looking for the answer and I think probably you'll have an answer sooner than people say\nThe president speaking at the oval office yesterday and when we was referring to the human Saudi Arabia and the four or five alternatives would be other countries from whom the Saudis could buy arms the hundred and ten billion dollars is an arms deal a military deal between the U.S\nAnd Saudi Arabia I Wonder if you could give us your sense of how this case\nFits into the relationship between the U.S in Saudi Arabia especially in light of the comment that I read it earlier ... sixteen forty three wrote on our website the one eight dot org\nThere is no reason to maintain close ties with the country that heads more people than ISIS\nFinally gives women the right to drive but it's only window dressing is killing civilians in Yemen and murdered a journalist who was critical of the quote unquote royal family if I were king for a day all the weapons we've sold them would be rendered useless and Jared cush there would be banned from any policy making\nLove the sharp elbows throwing that comment I Wonder if you can help us fact\nChecked that yeah I think um it's a it's a really a fascinating point and also that that um clip you played of Donald Trump was really striking because I'm the one hand\nIt seemed so I'm cold lead transactional in the sense that he was saying you know we have billions of dollars pouring in why am I going to stop that just because they have murdered a dissident journalist in other words I I'm so you know I don't care about human rights I mean we usually end up for I care about money pouring into the United states economy and\nThat attitude had activated a lot of um people in Washington who are against our alliance with Saudi Arabia for example senators on both sides of the aisle Chris Murphy and Rand Paul who have an argument for a long time just as the commentator said\nNow we're supporting the war in Yemen that it unconscionable that is starving civilians and killing civilians killing civilians and you know bus attacks and other things that are just horrendous um\nWhy the hell out of the country short but since you mentioned Rand Paul I'm really sorry to interrupt you but we have a clip of Rand Paul speaking to reporter this week on that very thing he said he would try to force a vote on us arms sales to Saudi Arabia I'll let you finish your thought but first let's hear from Senator Paul\nI think that the early reports have shown that this is linked to the Saudi Government and nothing happens in Saudi Arabia without the government's approval so no I think that ah unless the unless hell of a sudden the journalists turns off alive\nI think that we should we should just continue our arms sales to Saudi Arabia [noise] plus I think we need to be voting in the Senate and debating whether or not we should be involved in the war in Yemen\nThat was Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky where we go ahead\nSo I was gonna say people like Rand Paul are going to push back against arms sales about about our support for the war in Yemen um even saw a at a law makers invoking the global Magnitsky Act which said that it out of the U. S. Trump ministry and had to investigate what happened and if they find Saudi officials responsible they need to impose sanctions all that being said I Want it there is a counterpoint to that which is that\nOur relationship with Saudi Arabia has always been transactional Trump kind of said the quiet part out loud a little bit in the way he in a way he framed it out yesterday because we have never had a relationship an alliance faith and values since World War two it had all been about money\nAnd oil think about nine eleven Fifteen of the Nineteen hijackers were from Saudi Arabia that can lead to a permanent rupture in our alliance because we have always seen them as a strategic ally\nNot at the values faith ally as in Europe and I think that's important to keep in mind that Trump said it in a particularly accentuated way and he feels you know is very transactional way past presidents have but it didn't somewhat reflective of what you at the presidents have sat quietly\nBut it's been somewhat reflective of what you at the ... president of sat quietly for a long time\nYou know just reflect a chip in the Nazis out here I mean I think Donald Trump said out loud what other presidents and other prime minister such said ... could moments in relationship to have with regimes that are far from perfect I mean I remember when Tony Blair was prime minister\nAnd there was a huge arms deal that was about to be concluded\nAnd the British serious fruit authors launched an investigation into Saudi Arabia or had been doing whether they'd be paying kickbacks or whatever to get contracts through\nUm old ... and you know it was clear that the Saudis and said to Blair you've got to call this the cooled off the dog's otherwise the deal is in jeopardy\nAnd highly unusually mercifully controversial Leigh Tony Blair intervened with a ... an independent investigation and said right we're canceling this investigation\nAnd he used his power as prime minister because he felt he had to because Saudi Arabia was too big a customer\nToo important an ally and you've seen with Donald Trump you know one of the first place if he went to when he became president was to Saudi Arabia I traveled with him on that trip\nAnd it was they were one hundred percent in with Mohammed bin Salman now whether they're regrets you know oh no it's an open question however they they are there are there and don't Trump is determined that the arms deal will go ahead\nJoshua for we keep ... ... oh I was just going to\nSay if I could just add one thing that struck me as what the president didn't say he didn't mention Iran and he didn't mention the peace deal as you recall last month at the un\nAnd the United states has pretty aggressive in calling around the biggest threat to the region and by extension it was seen Saudi Arabia is that stopgap against possible Iranian expansion\nAcross the middle east on and of course on Saudi Arabia would be key to any sort of he still so I think it's interesting that I'm a month ago we were talking about\nPolicies and going against Iran and so going forward how much will the U.S focus on Iran and stopping an Iranian expansion on shape it's reaction or lack there of um to to what happened in Saudi Arabia and if it if an impact is the case that they have\nKilled a journalist inside their conflict who is it a resident of the United states\nSpeaking of journalists who have been killed there is another journalists\nAnd you can join us 'course you it is to Ninety eight from demos anyway Seth eighty nine point seven news jazz NPR\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Boehner with the bone a certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractors committed to expertise in customer service contract to locate her and more information or at bona dot com [noise]\nFrom capital one committed to reimagining banking offering savings and checking accounts that can be open from anywhere capital one what's in your wallet capital one in a\n[noise] and from listeners like you who donate to this NPR station\nBut now to the front of news round up with John ... uses and Henri Friedman still time to get in some of your questions and thoughts about the week's top stories as well one a ... W am you got for\nUs the story of the president of Interpol Ming hung way who's reported missing last week by his wife ... moved Maine was detained by Chinese authorities on corruption charges\nHe resigned in immediate effect this week the arrest as part of a larger official anti corruption campaign by China's president Xi Jinping know grace Meng the ex Interpol president's wife\nIs speaking out she told the Associated Press but she felt threatened nephews have do we have a sense that you know of why this was going on and what it is it makes me so important to the Chinese government of what this means a larger sense\nWell he's been a long time operative of the the Chinese government and their arguments being made that this is part of an effort to purge non loyalist to the Shia government and so there is no definitive answer but\nI think the message that um many are taken as if somebody who's been in government this long and the police capacity um it could be sweat swept off the streets and his wife sent a knife ... the day the day he disappears that no one in China's safe and and at the time of all this there was talk from\nParty officials about the importance of absolute loyalties so their suggestion certainly has that somehow he was less than loyal and the eyes of the government I\nWill say I think I'm One of the more interesting developments as well as his wife and how outspoken she has been she has been ah she's in French protective custody but she's been speaking out in a way that we wouldn't normally see out\nOf China and I thought it was an interesting development and may have led to more information coming out quicker than Chinese officials wanted to happen and so it was fascinating to watch her sort of use um the public platform in a way we see more often in the west as a way to get information about her husband then defend her husband that's something we don't normally see\nAbout her husband then defend her husband that's it's something we don't normally see\nWhich had now to Brazil were far right presidential candidate John ... surprised the nation when he shot to the top of the rings he nearly took the election with forty six percent of the vote just shy of preventing a runoff Brazilians will vote in the runoff election soon on October twenty eighth\nHenri Freidman can you remind us who ... is and what makes him and his policy platform so newsworthy\nYeah he's a fascinating character he'd been he's a former army captain and been in a Congress for almost three decades\nUm he had the law and order candidate that it's his big thing so he said you know our crime rates are too high we need to empower the police used very controversial and saying you know the police need to shoot first\nUm and and um shoot to kill 'em and and also to lose in gun laws to address crime right he talked to very controversial in the sense that he said things that are massage genetic\nUm that are anti algae beauty and one other thing that's really important is to Brazil we often forget I'm only became a democracy in Nineteen eighty five or return to democracy Nineteen eighty five for Twenty one year they had a dictatorship and he has spoken ... um\nAbout the time of the dictatorship at the time when there was a law and order one other point to know is that he ... with Donald Trump a lot of conservatives feel that Donald Trump had the right formula be pro business you know loosen regulations\nAh you know be nationalistic\nAnd be about cracking down on crime and he had promised me a really close ally of the United states all of this is I'm very shocking because Brazil for many days for decades has been led by a leftist government uh there was a little more ambivalent about its relationship with the United states and certainly a didn't espouse come to the right wing views\nThat he espoused is so this is a real shock to the system I think it really goes to the fact\nThat Brazil I mean in deep recession it's embroiled in a massive corruption\nUm crisis or that affected all parties except for both an arrow who is actually not been implicated in ... that was hit a winning point out say one other thing we you know the Atlantic wrote an article in which they interviewed a a cab driver\nWho said you know things are so bad maybe we need someone with crazy ideas out who else is going to fix this mat and so I think that that is that is the sentiment that it's worth keeping an eye on because that was a similar sentiment inbred that and Donald Trump's victory in the victory of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Mexico I mean this is a sentiment that people are feeling against the establishment in many countries in the world\nGlad to hear from some Brazilians who are listening today and looking ahead to the election\nOne listener emailed I'm and I'm a Brazilian listening from me sitting next to Brazil's capital Brasilia I'm very concerned about the future of our democracy the candidate leading the polls is an ex military who has a very anti democratic discourse which was also racist massage and his and homophobic\nSince last Sunday the election day more than fifty people have suffered physical and verbal aggressions from both for NATO supporters social media specifically what's app is playing a very important role and lots of fake news is circulating I really believe that with both an auto our democracy is at risk\nJohn ... what's projected to happen for the runoff is there any sense of whether ... could win this\nLast poll I saw suggested yes the the latest post suggests that he is at fifty eight percent\nOn the opposition leader is at forty two percent or something in it for them to her dad and so I kinda think that you'd have to say that it's it was that sort of margin of error is going to take some quite something for the left is kind of confidence\nTo come back from that position um I mean you know they talk about violence and the other thing about both not a it's a he was stabbed in September as a rally I'm sure there's been a lot of violence around but it has meant that he has it been able to say\nI really love to take part in debates I really count at the moment because I'm Still you know slightly getting ready for the stopping that I had been ...\nBut I really count at the moment because I'm Still you know slightly getting ready for the stopping that I had been so I'm afraid I wouldn't be able to come to your studio this evening on so I think that there is kind of a feeling that you know he is he's got his head down he has said what he said people know exactly where he stands and I think he sees the finish line\nOne story that much of the world has been talking about has to do with a new report from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on climate change the IPC see\nThe report says that the world is quickly running out of time to stem catastrophic climate change scientists predict we're on course to go beyond a crucial threshold of the world's average temperature rising one point five degrees Celsius or to point somebody refer and hide\nIn just over about ten years they saved that would leave us dealing with the risks of extreme drought wildfires floods food shortages for hundreds of millions of people\nWe talked about this report on the program this week one comment from a listener stuck along the lines that at least here in America\nThis is just not a big enough issue I mean people vote for a lot of reasons and the state of our climate is not something that lawmakers talk much about or that voters demand to discuss Nancy use if what is your sense of that or whether or not this report has made an impact around the world enough for people to start demanding action\nI think it's made an impact but the problem is the effects of this already being seen in various ways around the world so where one country can say it's not\nA big impact another country could see it as an immediate impact on something that needs to be dealt with aggressively in of course the kinds of changes at this report says need to happen are so I'm\nDrastic that in demand sort of a uniform world agreed upon action and we're not there yet and so I'm ... years scene of variance in response and they think it really reflects the variants of impact that nations are already seen\nAny I don't work correspondent and one of the things I see it come up most often as as a cause of the start of\nWars and conflicts environmental changes changing where people live how they're able to eat so I'm ... ... ... it's an area that doesn't just hit the environment that really hits other parts of of national security and government writ large but there's because of the complexity in terms of its impact\nI think it's hard to get a uniform agreement particularly at it in such a polarized time um so it's hard to be optimistic that that will see at least in the short term the kinds of drastic changes at this report says needs to happen to stop literally famine drought wildfires really severe consequences\nJust sure I was in Europe at the beginning of the week and when the report came out and I on the main national news shows a half an hour long so the same as the nightly news programs here the the first six seven minutes with devoted to decide PCC report\nI Wonder how much was devoted I mean there is one of the things that really strikes me about living here ... in America where you get more was a I think the square inch than any other\nKind of country on the planet or you know huge amount about whether the climate is not discussed\nAnd that is one of the things that really strikes me whereas I think there's a much greater consciousness whether they're doing that much about it is another issue but I think that you know I Am struck by how a lift all this ... the national debate a competitor in other parts", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Tampa", "day": "12"}
