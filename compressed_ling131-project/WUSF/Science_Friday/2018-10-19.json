A. M. U. dot org\nLet's keep going with this investigation and the disappearance possible murder of ...\nCatherine wrote on our Facebook page\nPutting denies Russia had anything to do with the poisoning of the former military officer and his daughter\nSaudi prince denies any involvement in murder of journalists to criticize him Trump goes along with both anyone else worried about the u._s. abandoning our moral authority Sonia\nWrote on our Facebook page here's what I don't understand a Saudi national was grabbing the Saudi embassy in Istanbul it's been determined that show was murdered based on recordings hurt by no one but some Turkish government officials who want to remain anonymous\nTurkey has not released the recordings but there have been leaks of what's in Turkey's government is not above repression and this kind of the various behavior themselves what exactly are we supposed to do as an uninvolved third party\nBefore I let you respond to that ... tweeted and uninterested third party hardly ... was a legal permanent us resident with children who are us citizens the usa using interested party even if Trump is not interested in the euro would you respond to that\nAbsolutely I think it's right that were not an uninvolved third party that man was a resident he was not only that he was a columnist for a prominent American newspaper the Washington Post\nAnd let's be honest that a lot of the reason this has gotten so much attention in this country is because the post has rightly put a huge and hot spotlight on it and not let anyone forget about it\nAnd you know other newspapers in the United states and world media have picked up on it too and really kept the attention on it I was struck\nBy President Trump thing yesterday when he finally acknowledge that yes it appears that man was murdered that he said this story has captured the world's imagination unfortunately and I thought unfortunately what's unfortunate about it it is the job of the media to demand accountability to seek truth\nAnd our values as America and as we've always been a global leader we try to put ourselves forward as the leader of the free world\nPart of that is about moral values and when we have a very close ally who by the way our military hardware is used in that Saudi campaign in Yemen that has killed so many thousands of civilians and children\nAnd is now leading to a huge famine in Yemen\nHow can we say that weren't uninvolved party\nYou know this is someone who was a resident of our soil and working for one of our companies and it's absolutely not true when you have an ally who is alleged to have done something like that we have ...\nNot true when you have an ally who is alleged to have done something like that we have certain forms of leverage that include arms sales and include potential sanctions threat and many other things\nI Will say though I James I do\nKind of feel worse Sonja is coming from in a way because and we've talked about this on this program before the U.S in Saudi Arabia have had a long relationship\nBut we've never tried to exert strong moral or ethical pressure on Saudi Arabia I mean it's a very transactional relationship and so just because one is uninvolved doesn't mean that when it's on entangled but I kind of take Sony has point like the U.S\nDoesn't really want to have to spank Saudi Arabia over its actions because there is a tremendous military and economic entanglements so I'm not really sure what the us has the power to do or if it has the moral authority to do it\nWell this is the limit ... to me amplify that point Josh records is absolutely critical and you know ... someone who's been actually very good on this as Senator Marco Rubio who made the point I'm I'm paraphrasing here\nThat all the money in the world and all this military contracts in the world would not be enough to buy back our credibility on human rights if we don't stand up against something as fundamental as murdering journalists for their opinions that's an international norm there's a lot of other norms that were broken here but that's like a critical one\nI mean the show is called one eye for the first amendment ... that is in our DNA to stand up for a free press around the world and if we don't stand up strongly against that it'll be a very very damaging precedent and as a Senator Rubio said will never be able to buy our credibility back on these issues\nSenator Lindsey Graham made a very similar point he was so angry and he said I've been a huge ally as NBS in Saudi Arabia but I'd never going there again as long as he is in power he's outraged by it so this is a bipartisan issue\nThan have it is worth noting that the Washington Post this week it published\nWhat is believed to be some other show jeeze final column it's called what the Arab world needs most is free expression it was published in English and Arabic and he writes about the systemic the systematic dismantling of the free press in much of the Arab world here's one brief quote from that column quote\nThese actions no longer carry the consequences of a backlash from the international community instead these actions may trigger condemnation quickly followed by silence as a result Arab governments have been given free rein to continue silencing the media at an increasing rate\nUnquote Hayes what do you think is he right\nI think he is definitely right so\nUh this has been you know one of the longstanding problems with U.S foreign policy in the region\nIs that oftentimes strategic interests have taken of the friends he compared to human rights issues under the Obama administration you had a lot of great words about how he he actually did stand up to Saudi Arabia in word but if not indeed we never halted arms sales to Saudi Arabia\nOr despite the ongoing campaign in Yemen we'd never\nThreatened to sanction them over a there as you over their funding of ... and other extremists in Syria we never have really taken very strong action against Saudi Arabia or any any country or any country in the region for their actions except for Iran\nWho has been fundamentally aligned against the Gulf\n... a Gulf states so I I I completely agree with the sentiment in his column if we haven't been willing to take action\nBefore it it's I Hope that we have the fortitude to actually the people in ... that members of Congress actually have the fortitude to actually pass some sort of legislation that or does something if the Trump Administration does not but it seems unlikely given the history of the issue\nNot but it seems unlikely given the history of the issue\nSo basically the people who killed ... may get away with this they may never really know who killed him there may never be any real prosecution because of just the cold hard fact that that the relationship between the U.S and the Saudis\nIs a business relationship and you you're totally see that when you look at the president's comments that it might have been wrote killers\nWho took out the show G and reporting earlier this week that said that the U.S is actively working with the Saudi Government to try and come up with some sort of feasible solution that admits the death of show gee but does not blame Mohammed bin Salman\nA coach or dress reckon I commend him out because there's there's a point here that's important to make I think the reason compare went over to to Saudi Arabia was to say that look\nUm you have to get out in front of this this is that you cannot sweeping some of the rug I'm absolutely convinced we are going to get to the bottom of this because there's just so much evidence with the Turks now have\nThey've photographed these Fifteen individuals who flew in twelve but which part of\nThe ... the crown prince of security detail or intelligence services I think we are going to get to the bottom of this now I also think there's going to be a fall guy but somewhere just below the crown prince there already are stories that they'd be there to offer up there and tell his intelligence chief\nGeneral Ahmed Asiri as the scapegoat so I I think we will know who did this and I you know I think probably the crown prince will try to ... you know offer up a a senior scapegoat\nBut I I'm I'm pretty convince we're going to figure out what happened to her\nWell we will keep an eye on the story we're glad to get some more of your comments on this for now let's move on to some of the other big stories that made news this weekend may have flown under your radar because of all the attention about ... G rightly given of course\nBut there's also an update from Afghanistan where the war continues to rage Seventeen years after it began with no clear end in sight\nYesterday the Taliban killed at leading police chief in Kandahar\nThe commander of us and NATO troops in Afghanistan General Austin Scott Miller escaped unharmed today the Afghan government announced it's delaying elections in that province they were supposed to take place tomorrow\nThose elections will carry on his plan and the rest of Afghanistan despite widespread violence the Taliban have already killed at least ten candidates and scores of voters\nThey venture begins tonight at nine O W USF eighty nine point seven [noise]\n\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from ... am committed to changing lives through math by building math achievement problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students every day and nine hundred franchise locations not sneezing um dot com slash NPR\nFrom logged me in makers of go to meeting a collaboration meeting platform that comes equipped with the church to help people stay focused to get work done learn more it goes to meeting dot com\nAnd from the listeners to support this NPR station\nBack now to the friday news roundup with James kid field of the center for the study of the presidency in Congress in the ... of the Boston Globe and the Pulitzer center and have brown of buzzfeed do still a little more time to get in some of your questions and thoughts\nAbout this week's top stories from around the world one a at W. A. M. U. dot org\nThis week some Americans were probably green with envy and our neighbors to the north\nRight out guy now\nAnd I got a job\nThey were celebrating in Montreal this week because on Wednesday Canada legalized recreational marijuana\nNationwide it's only the second country in the world to do so why was the first in twenty Thirteen Andrew tweeted Canada legalizing we was like California legalizing we'd both were like a long relationship where you've been dating forever but just now made the fish all\nHays how big a deal is this and do you think this is the start of a Global Trends something that has just kind of been understood for a long time and just hasn't been made official yet\nYou know that's a great question because I'm not really sure I mean I think that when you look at the way that the criminalizing drugs has gone in places like Portugal\nThat at first you compare that to things like the un officer drugs and crime still is very hard on marijuana and claims that it you know marijuana is that evil so it's really tough to tell like where the global feeling is on we legalization\nIf um you weren't you bring it up say at a meeting in the European Union's\nOf European Parliament then I'm guessing you still would not have nearly a majority of people in favor it even in a place like they used to Canada I don't know it really depends on how it goes in terms of the government controlling the access to marijuana which he did it doing now compared to you know it being a private business\nOr that private but illegal business among many small dealers uh\nThat private but illegal business among many small dealers\nOr it depends on how it affects the global drug trade it and whether\nUh there's going to be any sort of shift and you know I'm sure that Ken is going to be putting unlike the U.S a lot of funding into studying the effects of this new policy whether it causes surgeon traffic accidents where their claws asserted tops realization or medical affects so it can be really interesting ten years down the line to see what has happened in Canada\nYeah the CBC out of Ottawa has a story about how police there are increasing some of their a surveillance efforts for intoxicated drivers to make sure the more drivers aren't driving stone it is of course worth noting\nThat in this country marijuana is considered the most illegal level of illegal drugs they schedule one narcotic it's right up there\nWith heroin LSD ecstasy ... and ... the drugs that are deemed to have new currently accepted medical use\nAnd the high potential for abuse\nThere was a conference call this week with Todd oh and who was in the Fisher with US Customs and border patrol here's how he answered one question from a reporter\nIs it possible to be not let into the states by saying yes I did smoke a joint where I had smoked in the past\nYes admission of illegal drug use our our ground be found in the midst of all in the state so yes that's possible\nThat's taught or one of US Customs and border patrol Indira give us a sense of what this might mean for the relationship between the U.S and Canada along the border\nWell it's one more complication when you know border issues have been one of the primary issues of the Trump presidency they already had a very difficult negotiation and doing this NAFTA to point out which in the end turned out to just take elements from the Trans Pacific partnership which was updated trade deal\nThat the Obama administration negotiated that the Trump Administration pulled out of and then sort of pulled the TPP things tax them on to NAFTA and said NAFTA to point out but it hasn't been easy there have been so many strains between the United states and Canada\nAnd you know that people are saying that essentially this is a potential marijuana masks right now I'm so I think this could be an issue because we certainly did not have legalized marijuana across the United states it's only on a state by state basis\nI Wonder also James what other kind of unintended consequences there might be for this I mean\nJustin Trudeau now has to kind of owned is whether it's seen as a good move\nOr a negative moved there remains the question as to what legalization of the national level mind me for Canada on top of that there are early reports that suggested supplies are running low because candidates takes time to cultivate the point of being syllable and there are long lines around the block and things are running out supplies running out\nI Wonder what kinds of additional unintended consequences we might keep an eye out for a\nWhile you know the Canadian Medical Association journal called this a an uncontrolled experiment so we're going to we're going to find out a lot of things about this but I must admit that I'm not\nThat surprise when you can walk into the major states the United states like Colorado or California and mirrors dispensaries for recreational marijuana everywhere I I think this is a trend that's happening all over the United states and it's gonna it's gonna it's gonna keep going because people are going to realize that there's a lot of money to been made when you tax marijuana\nA and the uses happening anyway and putting these people in jail is probably not the best use of public funds so I I see it as part of a continuum I think it was kind of inevitable that are progressive neighbors to the north for probably going to get a jump on the summers\nBut um you know I I just been struck by going around the country and see in states where this is already happening and everyone kind of shrugs it's not a big deal\nYou know this doesn't seem James to have the kind of energy I mean it's not like to fly to love against prohibition you know where it was considered this major like its issue about liberty and of course it helped spur of the rise of organized crime\nIt's an issue about liberty and of course it help spur the rise of organized crime if you've never seen the Ken burns documentary what are you waiting for go see it this feels very much like something that was just kind of a matter of time like if they legalize it was going to happen sooner or later\nThat's my sense to you know that this is the trend is pretty clear in this country and and Canada Canada's had medical marijuana says two thousand and one it's very popular so too does not out on a whim 'em by endorsing the so I I think it's a it's kind of inevitable\nYeah not one of the loudest most aggressive social movements with regards to the legalization of cannabis a much more impactful movement that has reverberated around the world is the me too movement and we should talk about that before our time is up this week M. J. Akbar who's the minister of state for external affairs in India\nLeft that post after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual assault\nAnd harassment also in India this week there were protests and violence meant by that but any woman trying to enter the ... temple in ... state in India groups of conservative Hindu men threw stones and attacked women and journalist who tried to get too close let's start\nWith the story involving and Z Akbar have how have we seen the me too movement play out\nIn India or is this just kind of the beginning of its effect on men in power\nI think so it's it's interesting because the me too movement really kicked off here in the United states a year ago and for a while uh I Know that our reporters at least we're watching\nIndian waiting and wondering when is it going to affect this culture where are we were so sure that it would finally have an impact and now a in recent weeks at has finally like grab the country and shaking at\nA we've seen as all started with one actress a one Bollywood actress coming forward and just it's been a tidal wave of accusation sense than women taking to Twitter and being unafraid to name their alleged ... abusers and assault or by name\nAnd just being really willing to step out and do what the Indian courts haven't done before which is try to bring these men into account and um it\nIt's really interesting that ... one of the first to go considering um she had such a long run in the Indian journalism seeing ... and\nUh the most women who came forward about him were fellow journalists were fellow reporters so I feel like that is a bit of credence to the allegations and we'll see whether in the future they uh the the women who are I guess lower down on in social status will finally\nStart to be believed as well with regards to the protest of the ... temple in ... state the BBC's James Gleason was they're asking people why they were protesting here's what one man said\nNo no no no no I wouldn't want to know the media and it turns out of making this among them they don't really want to destroy it goes up underneath religion that's the only thing the idea\nThat some of what the BBC's dreams Clinton was told in Carol estate outside the ... temple there in there I Wonder what your stance is of this protest particularly what the gentleman said it made it sound as if there's this external pressure from the media and politician he wants to destroy our culture they want to destroy our religion he says", "show_name": "Science Friday", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "19"}
