U. dot org\nWith regards to cyber hacking Michael asks with the loss and result in widespread dissemination of the CIA tool kit which allows one to spoof packing from another country how can cyber bread crumbs lead to certainty that another country is actually guilty David what do you think well\nCyber attribution is something that people are getting a lot better at I'm certainly there are lots of ways to make it appear that a cyber attack came from other places when the New York times was attacked by the Chinese and its computer systems uh years ago it looked like the attack was coming from a University in the southern part of the U.S [noise]\nBut the fact of the matter is that a combination of forensic evidence a motive\nPast uses similar tools can get you most of the way most of the time so there are some pretty good ways to go do it\nThe bigger question facing many governments is once they've found this out and perhaps decide when now to this happened in these most recent cases than the political pressures on them so what do you do about it\nThat's why the president signed a new set of executive orders and I'm\nIn August we haven't seen them they're all classified that pushes down into the system or the ability for commanders in the U.S to do cyberattacks back without having presidential sign off\nTill now that's been something that the only only the president authorized the use of nuclear weapons and cyber weapons now it's not entirely clear that only he can authorize the use of cyber weapons in retaliation but you want to make sure you're attribution is pretty good before you strike back\nYou know who to attack yeah great married before we move on\nFrom there first of all that is no small thing that that the U.S military might have the latitude unilaterally to shut down a power grid or turn off a hydroelectric dam through the Internet\nBut beyond that do we have a sense that certain countries certain organizations are getting a better handle on dealing with cyberattacks to world clearly hasn't figured this out\nIs anyone making progress I think about the ... because I hear so much about Internet regulations from there on the consumer level but on a military level is anyone making progress\nOr not that I'm aware of the U.S I think it's still the world leader and in in terms of you know advanced Internet abilities and and the threats are pretty clear or Russia or China and North Korea or Iran\nBut a ... figuring out or response in how you want to calibrate that response so it doesn't become this open ended escalation and you don't know the capabilities of your rivals if you respond\nOr you you are entering really uncharted territory Vivian do we get a sense of countries beginning to kind of work together to\nReally uncharted territory Vivian do we get a sense of countries beginning to kind of work together to figure this out to to figure out some kind of international response to cyber attacks or is Russia really got the whole world kind of running with here on Florida say\nWhat we've seen in the last couple of days and the coordination of um indictments than [noise] you know raising concerns about um sighing and otherwise obviously there's a lot of discussion that are taking place\nWhere countries our western allies trying to coordinate some kind of effort to counter the threat that that that the Russians oppose but at the same time again you have so many a\nRestriction than many um uncertainty as to how to approach the cyber world in general and cyber threats and as David said the U.S trying to really formulate some sort of attack plan or something to counter and to protect our infrastructure so that we don't have um we're not as vulnerable as we've seen ourselves\nIn the past but obviously you know the u._s. it's still trying to figure out a way forward and having looked at what happened to us from the two thousand and sixteen election still we're talking about the fact that we are vulnerable in two thousand Eighteen we could be vulnerable in twenty twenty so we haven't actually tried quite figured out how to protect ourselves get alone\nThe world's kind of coordinating on a global scale to do the same it's it's it's not an easy task\nBelow twenty kind of a decentralization of the way that we vote that we are so many different kinds of voting systems might in a way kind of help so why it helps insulated from according to the fact that we've got all these different utility company yeah but you know but but the key element here is we've done a better job at discussing internally how we would\nDo counterattacks than we have organizing the world than the sort of digital Geneva Convention of what the standards of what's on limits and often it\nLet's shift gears and talk about the Nobel Prize is particularly the Nobel Peace prize the winners were announced this morning Dr Denis ... and ... one for their work combating sexual violence as a weapon of war\nThe announcement from the Nobel Committee said in part quote Dennis ... a little quicker if the helper who has devoted his life defending these victims not him a rod is the witness who tells the abuses perpetrated against herself and others\nWere rod is an Iraqi woman she was captured and held by Islamic state scraped captivity after three months and told to her story in a book called the last girl\nDr ... founded a hospital in eastern Congo that treated thousands of women many of whom are survivors of gang rape ... pretty extraordinary people to be wanting this prize especially as we've learned more about how sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war and has for quite some time\nYeah really has to two individuals who seem really deserving the peace prize has been a lot of had a lot of controversy in recent years very politicized\nA couple of people who really been thrust into dangerous situations handle that with with incredible courage and Dr ... gay up built this hospital in eastern Congo which is in the middle of nowhere urged them very remote region Twenty years ago for maternal care they're just as much health care of that was his intent\nBut as the Congolese civil war metastasized um rape became a huge issue a huge problem that the various factions un peacekeepers who are involved in in rape there\nAnd so he became the voice of rape being used as a weapon of war and so he's been asked this for Twenty years very prominent a voice but still operating in a very ah a dicey region of very deserving winter\nI mean I I can really speak for the case of hum mirage who I I spend a lot of time in Iraq and two dozen Fifteen sixteen I'm intervening gets ET women who were released from captivity\nSixteen I'm intervening gets ET women who were released from captivity from ice that's and\nThe impact yeah obviously psychologically physically or the the the use of sexual assault\nAnd rape as a tool in war it's obviously a huge thing but you have to also remember that these women go back to their\nTried to go back home a lot of their family some them because of cultural sensitivities to such things and so their lives are essentially up ended by their families a lotta times don't take them back home a lot of these women were impregnated I'm as a result of this and had to really know where to go because\nThey were single mothers which in Iraq is it's just it's\nA completely a taboo and so I you know it's something that you should raising awareness for that is that something really really important you had a lot of people on the ground in Iraq trying to educate these families that this is not a no fault of the women that they had no say in the matter but\nObviously you know changing cultural perceptions that's it's it's an uphill battle and stuff that's women obviously I'm trying to do that and it's a it's it's worth the the know notoriety that you're thinking\nLet's shift gears and talk about China vice president Mike Pence spoke yesterday accusing China of trying to sway American public opinion and undermine the Trump Administration\nTo put it bluntly President Trump's leadership is working in China wants a different American president there can be no doubt China is meddling in America's democracy\nDavid what is vice president Pence mean by meddling what do we know about what China actually is doing\nWell it's it's pretty fascinating because he is appropriating the language of the Russian attacks from on the twenty sixteen election and transferring it over to a different set of activities\nThat the Chinese are are involved in that there's no question that the Chinese have views cyber before in for political purposes but they largely haven't used it here they've used it in Taiwan they've used it\nIn their arguments with Tibet they've used it internally a lot they've used it to some degree in Australia and New Zealand\nBut what he is arguing is that in putting together retaliatory tariffs terrorists that are retaliating for terrorists to the United states put on China\nAnybody can hold off a blue wave in Florida it seems like Rick Scott and he's well known as

very close vote fifty one to forty nine\nThat came after more than an hour of speeches including a last ditch effort by Senator Dianne Feinstein to convince senators who were still on the fence Feinstein is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee here's part of what she said\nBoth Ford and for a merit submitted evidence to support their allegations including naming over two dozen witnesses age unfortunately the limited investigation that was conducted by the FBI\nFailed to interview any one of the witnesses these two women identify who can support her a town\nThat was Senator Dianne Feinstein speaking on the Senate floor just a few hours ago of course the Ford and Ramirez she referred to our professor Christine Blasey Ford and Deborah Ramirez both of them have

talk about Iran\nAfter the Trump Administration abandoned the nuclear deal that was negotiated during President Obama's tenure and reimposed sanctions Iran took us to court the international court of justice to argue that the u._s. actions violated the terms of the Nineteen fifty five treaty of ...\nWell the Trump Administration hit back this week\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo announced on Wednesday that the U.S is ending that treaty\nThis is a decision frankly that his thirty nine years overdue in July around brought in Marilyn's case and the international court of justice alleging violations of the treaty of amity\nOr on six to challenge the United states decision to seize participation in the Iran nuclear deal and to reimpose the sanctions were lifted as part of that deal\nIran has attempted interfere with the sovereign rights of the United states to take a waffle actions necessary to protect our national security than Iran it's abusing the icy Jay for political and propaganda purposes\nThat was secretary of state Mike Pompeo speaking on Wednesday Vivian salami some have said that ending this treaty is largely symbolic or is that so\nYeah it is an unknown and a lot of ways I I think in general it's more just stem reinforcing the administration says standing efforts to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal and um crackdown on Iran and kind of show that they're not messing around and so\nI'm basically this was just one more step in that process but as far as any real uh changes on the ground it really doesn't do much it's really just our sponsor\nTo on the international court of justice says ruling that ah that essentially said that sanctions that we they re imposing sanctions on were not fair to Iran\nBring my we step back for just a second what is this treaty of apathy [noise] uh I'm sure that was the question of the state department I just had this vision of some low level staff are going through the basement looking treaty\nI really am a nature really damage that I can [laughter] result think through what we've heard about you know ... the the big acronym of Jaycee peel away the Iran nuclear deal but what is this treaty of Amman\nWell in Nineteen fifty three us help orchestrate that coup in Iran bringing the shah of Iran back to power or if they were us in Iran where buddy buddy at that time and so two years later it's yeah you brought me back to power shirt treaty of it\nSo two years later it's yeah you brought me back to power shirt treaty of amnesty great and they were indeed good friends from fifty three until\nThe Seventy nine revolution this is the shah who was deposed in these women revel in the Islamic Revolution of ... Seventy nine so for thirty nine years uh there has been no enmity between us and Iran\nThis again seems very symbolic I'm just a last little relic that somehow didn't get shredded after the the the revolution in Seventy nine\nIt was the last hurrah of Kermit Roosevelt grandson of Theodore Roosevelt CIA operative who almost singlehandedly staged this coup and then they got everybody we put in power to go sign the treaty port Kermit he's getting no respect from the state department these days it was permanent\nRoosevelt I'm taking it I I liked that name for it for a man who had such a place in history Kermit Roosevelt and I'm not worthy American David ... is there any real effect in terms of\nThe sanctions the consequences to the U. S. for refusing to lift them if this treaty of am at sea is more sim Bali where might there be more tangible impact\nSo the tangible impact is November when President Trump has said that he will impose the full sanctions on Iran He's given allies warning that this was coming\nAnd those sanctions if he does it as he has pronounced would say to any ... company around the world but particularly European companies\nIf you do business with Iran you're not doing business with the United states and it's an effort to choke off the Iranians\nBy making the big aircraft makers Boeing's ready pulled out the big oil a production equipment makers all get out of Iran and they're doing that what's happening now though is that the ... the Europeans are saying we're going to find a method\nTo buy oil from Iran without clearing it in dollars so that the u._s. can affect it with the sanctions\nAnd a number of us went up and met a with the Iranian foreign minister when he was at the un ah last week and he made an argument to assess who Saturday evening\nThat he believed to this method was going to come together so we're heading toward a conflict between the U.S and its European allies over\nOn do we have a sense Vivian I I think I feel like the the big issue really is Iran's nuclear program and the argument from the other nations who are still signatories to this this deal the Iran nuclear deal\nIs that it's it's not perfect but it's good and that it has done something to impede Iran's ability to develop a nuclear weapon do we have a sense of where we stand in that regard setting the economic stuff aside for a moment just this put us any closer on that path\nOr we still kind of in a holding pattern I mean what is what's that looks like\nThe Europeans as you say they they consistently say that they they don't want to North Korea is I mean this is of course before we became buddy buddy and\nPresident Trump declared that he and Kim Jong un or love\nOr right we we didn't want to North Korea and the sense that we didn't want this to very active or potentially rogue nuclear states and so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Science Friday", "city": "Tampa", "day": "05"}
