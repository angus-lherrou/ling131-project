we're all the locations are at um we can look at their script breakdown individual location see All right well that might work here that might work there\nUm and we try to put them in touch with those business owners if they are private or a local residents I'm or any city or county facilities that we might have access to directly\nOr and then finally as our crew you know Tampa uh speaking specifically for Hillsborough County where one of the largest commercial markets in the state and we're certainly one of the larger markets in the United states as far as commercial productions not feature films\nOr TV series but commercials so we have a actually a very deep crew base that's unique in Tampa Bay area and I would be the one helping to put the productions in touch with those individual filmmakers\nI think that's interesting can film it seem would be trained yet you know they come in and they film with all their people and their production and then they're gone whereas if you go for something like a TV show or a lot of commercials something like that when you get a company is going to be doing different commercials it seems like it might be a more long lasting relationship\nI I actually agree with that if you look at our incentive here locally the way it was written was specifically to engage with high impact commercials and TV series that have some longevity to them and the last two years we've incentivized the discovery network's a TV show called St science\nUm we've also had night watching several other fairly well known TV series shoot here either in whole or in part uh we have a lot of reality t._v. series that shoot here um party down south Ninety Days fiance I mean we are so many different reality shows that like to to film here as because one why as\nThere certainly are in Asian it could be are interesting characters we ... a locally but it's also just a beautiful weather um you have to keep in mind that production schedules are very tight and if I'm having to worry about\nA snowstorm in March when I needed to look spraying happy and fun I Can't shoot that necessarily in Chicago or New York or anywhere in the mid west\nSo I'm going to come here I say this I wouldn't put this on a postcard but but Hillsborough county's biggest asset is the banality of Hillsborough County we don't have anything necessarily iconic on film that would identify us as being Tampa our downtown can look like any downtown\nAnd that's really served as a benefit to the local community as far as productions go\nI Want you to tiny follow up on that because you think the weather is a big draw\nYou know if I'm not if not filming in July and Florida and her in the even if one of the most beautiful places to film a shot five films in Florida and I've relied on the natural beauty and the weather that allowed me to be outside and he is from now until June and that's a that's a production window that that's pretty rare\nWhat else decides whether and is there a labor pool that you find a track there\nThere is I I'm a filmmaker they've got to happen\nAll that you find a track there\nThere is I I'm a filmmaker they've got to tap into maybe five commissions to pull off my my film that I shot in April\nNineteen thirty five India and so I didn't lean on Florida to look like Florida I looked at Florida to look like Nineteen thirty five northwest India\nAnd so I had to find architecture of high society a Hindu society that would exist and so I reached out to Tyler I reached out to\nSandy Letterman Miami gene ... soda I ended up using the power crowd we mentioned in Madison County the Filipino state at the teeth mansion in Sarasota County the how we mentioned out in Lake County near Orlando I hired a Hillsborough County a production company to produce my film\nSo I've got crew locations everything that I Need and the state of Florida just take the the integration 'cause we're we're all kind of working together at this point to bootstrap a lot of production that at least in my budget to get them out the door\nYeah so you found a movie that is supposed to be an end yeah but you were able to use Florida and you mean a lot of your interviews\nAnd people were filming here because it was Florida and they were drawn to it for their creative inspiration I think you had one quote where you said the clash of cultures between retirees criminal beach bombs I'm paraphrasing but I thought it was perfect\nYeah I think Tony would probably met his film is kind of unusual in that most people that are filming here now they're filming because they don't have the budget or something like a Ben Affleck slip by night which could go to Georgia\nAnd could create literally a fake rubber ... city like most of these productions do not have those millions of dollars so they need to come here to Florida to shoot what they're interested in whether that's a Liberty City neighborhood and moonlight whether that's the strip of motels in Florida Project\nAnd that's where a lot of the productions now in the film industry or come here for their smaller scale films\nThat or don't have the budget is really to go to Georgia and that's kind of what's been helping sustain production around here\nDon't have the budget to go to Georgia if they're putting a Florida scene and they're sure that they want a pine forest there good\nThat is the minimum spend in Georgia in order to qualify for that really attractive rebate from did you have to spend a half a million dollars for speaker found so you have to be a bigger film just to just to qualify for that ...\nYeah I Want to talk about that because that's an example that used a lot for Florida losing out to Georgia and the film business has been asked like new movie he recreate ... city in Georgia rather than filming it here\nBut Jimmy and your reporting I mean if Ben Affleck maybe doesn't that make enough money won't movies think twice again about recreating a town or does the state funding cushion that loss in other words um they're losing other people's money they're not losing their investors money because they're getting that big break from the gate when it\nDidn't do well it was a box office bomb this may be eliminated and got great reviews people didn't go see it I'm sure that's a that's a possibility and what you are seeing some of these big budget productions a for instance here in Hillsborough County to infiltrate or an ... for peculiar children\nThese are big budget movies and they filmed elsewhere because of the lack of tax incentives are both of them filmed in Europe primarily but\nThey did come down here and they came down here partially just because they were struggling to recreate the Tampa that is a production costs if you're having to like\nCreate palm trees or whatever would represent a Florida so what you're seeing now in the film industry Lisa what I found in my reporting\nWas that you are primarily getting smaller scale films commercials reality television\nAnd the big budget films I Do come here first man for instance came here and shot partially a Kennedy Space center you have to do that guy right so they're coming here partially because um they're not coming for full shoots like they used to but they're coming here partially because they want to still have some of the accurate three creation in their projects\nWe have some of that accurate re creation in their projects\nI'm Robin ... ham and you're listening to Florida matters we're taking a short break and we'll be right\nBack important for Florida matter it's coming from the national foundation for transplants right now hundreds of Tampa resident need an organ transplant they cannot afford\nJoined National Foundation for transplant an organization providing financial relief to transplant patients for more than thirty five years that transplant stat or to learn more\nComing up on fresh air voting rights and voting restrictions we'll talk with the author and give us the ballot that's coming up at seven I dabble us that this\nIs Florida matters I'm Robin ... and we're talking about the future of the film industry in Tampa Bay and in in the state you're in the studio with us in Tyler Martin ... county film commissioner Jimmy gr it's a reporter with the Sarasota Herald Tribune and Tony stopping a filmmaker based in Sarasota\nSo Jimmy talk about the tax credits that were discontinued in two thousand sixteen how how exactly did that work\nVery similar to how they work and most other states now basically you would get I think it was twenty to thirty and our initial program and right now in Georgia it's thirty so basically you get tax credits\nBack ... percent twenty to thirty percent of what you spent is that what you're saying\nIn in terms of your local filming\nAnd so the first system that we had here in Florida in two thousand and ten a it was criticized by some including some people who are very pro stay film program even they'll say they think it was flawed because it was the first come first served in Florida in other words\nYou've got tax credits back based on one you applied and when money was available rather than perceived economic impacts to the state\nSo I didn't get into too much in my story but part of that you know ... the video games studio they got quite a bit of the tax credits even though they're not going to have the same kind of job creation just because our video game studio you're not hiring gaffe first you know for a video game [noise]\nSo now when we're talking about a new state film program they're kind of going away from what they had before they're the first come first served and less from that traditional incentive program the new bill that senator an today has proposed\nAnd it's going more to they would have a certain amount of money that they were kind of fun to productions on separately it wouldn't have work in the whole tax incentive system\nTyler what are we losing by not filming some movies or TV shows even video games in Florida is there a or their intangible benefits\nYou have this entire creative community there's about five thousand people in the bay area who work in some way shape or form in film and digital media um their livelihoods are dependent upon film productions coming to this area or at least somewhere within the state of Florida\nAnd the further out in time we go more and more of those people are having to go elsewhere to find gainful employment and again these are jobs that are making Seventy plus a thousand dollars a year a is a very meaningful salary and what we've seen as most of them have been moonlighting elsewhere Georgia Louisiana\nBut further on time we go those residents are stopped the stop moving and they start relocating and that's when we we really see a deficit is when they actually move someplace else so even if we had an incident come back tomorrow", "show_name": "Florida Matters",
