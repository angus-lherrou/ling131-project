{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WUSF", "content": "When we saw that the street looked like a river\nThat where they could buy soda will\nMove after the hurricane passed there was so much water inside the house the bedroom where I put the babies to sleep which I thought was the safest and wouldn't get flooded with a room that got the most flooded that's also where we archived all of our personal documents\nBirth certificates Social Security cards important documents\nAnd it was a room that flooded the most\nBecause of the windows weren't very secure they broke\nWater everywhere so much loss because of water damage\nMake and then got only not act I think that it will be ... and got her lean until November twentieth when I came here it was horrible lines in the supermarket to buy ice and water lines at the gas station so you couldn't buy gas for the generator\nIt was desperate and even more so when you're going there with little kids ... my ... ... ... I made the decision that was back for my kids and also because my husband and I were out without jobs [noise]\nMy mom lives here and she told me to come here for a few months well things in Puerto Rico stabilized a little bit so I decided to come here with the kids first and then when I was here because I found a job\nI made a decision to stay here permanently\n... but it was a little younger than me momma you know when I got here I spent three or four days at my mother's house\nAnd then I got approval for the FEMA helped to move to a hotel and I went there with the kids\nTo a hotel with a pool that was here in Tampa I was alone with the four kids and it was funny because they thought we were on vacation\nBut it was hard for me because I was alone my husband stayed in Puerto Rico turning in the house and getting everything in order over there so that he could later reunite with us but it was very hard because I had to find someone to stay with my kids so I could go to work\nThey would tell me okay and then last minute they would say no I Can't help with that\nIt was very hard for me but in my ...\nMy first job was cleaning at night and then from there I started working in a school cafeteria in the mornings and on the weekends I Would dedicate my time to making cakes and helping my mother with our clients that I Am still making cakes but I'm not cleaning anymore now I have a job and telemarketing\nSong which I'm On the ... being sewing thing if I thought I knew I have so many feelings when I think about the past year messy and sometimes I get sad but I also feel quite content with because I was alone and able to work almost for jobs and still take care of\nBecause I live alone and able to work almost for jobs and still take care of my four kids I feel very happy and proud of myself ... the film that got Iraqi I made the decision to come here for the quality of life for my kids my kids are better here than in Puerto Rico\nJoke it but I enjoy a joke at look at all I might have noticed that but also evil lonely hearts\nDo I want for them I think what Henry mother wishes or their best you'll get I Want to back if I can give them the world I Want to give them the entire world I Want them to do and wealth for themselves to study and to succeed\nI Want the best for them [noise] the only thing I ask is health and life to be able to guide them I don't want anything [noise]\n\nFollowing all the performance is at the event your real story is executive director Lillian deadline came to the stage to interview some of the actors along with the people who stories they told about their experiences with the process\nNow we'll hear done lap talk with Jesse Giuliano and Isabelle no Tara who perform the story of Hurricane Maria survivor Leslie Diaz she also speaks with Jonathan French and the actor who portrayed him Christopher Rutherford\nLet me just ask you about the experience of doing these stories what was it like preparing for this\nYou know it's funny 'cause I think one of the one of the things that I found is um I find that easily connect to these stories I'm Dominican and Dominican Republic was hit pretty hard I'm not anywhere near as hard as Puerto Rico but I I had family members who\nYou know had a hard time transitioning after the storm as well so it's it's a very easy thing to connect to and being Latina I think\nI think anybody in the Caribbean when it happens to one we all feel it right so I I just felt like I went on the journey with her with her when I was listening to the story in here and I'm In reading it it sounded like you were in the world\nI mean I I Love what you guys do I think these are very important story that I feel that really need to be heard if they really need to be told they need to be shared I'm I'm originally from Puerto Rico if you didn't hear it and the accent\n[laughter] however my vantage of like straight up\nIt was very devastating for me to see because I was born and raised there I'm I'm from the very day my husband as as well so for us it was very difficult for us to see friends his grandmother is over there so just trying to get in touch with his grandmother to see how she was doing\nUm that was really side it was very sad for me to the close friends that I grew up with that we're struggling to be able to provide for their babies and to the light you know that they would be in line for hours and hours and hours just trying to get water\nSo just to witness dot when Hurricane Maria happened what I did was I collected donations and I got very involved so that it another way for me to continue staying involved so for me it's something very very important that I'm very very passionate about it was very easy for me to connect I'm a\nI'm a mother and other human being right like it wasn't hard to connect\nWith this story at all whatsoever the last line all we've got the what I read it because it's true it's what every mother once and I think that was so beautiful about these stories is that\nI always find it more interesting to look out what we have in common versus what makes it different yeah um so the story to allow it to connect with each other and ... we are all the same and like she said you know what I Want is not any different from what any other mother want I Want the ... for my children so that even if I mean\nFirst of all thank you [laughter]\nSo that even at that me first of all thank you\n[laughter]\nWell said Kris welcome back\nTo um I Want to introduce you to somebody that you don't know when when we come to this point the actor and the story teller have usually not met Chris meet the real John [noise]\nI'm grateful for you for people like you who are are are there to just when everything goes a ride to the bottom drops out smart people like you show up\nAnd I just get the lights turned back on the water going again I'm and I'm I'm very big walls are grateful to tell your story and uh I'm just on on her and I'm Glad we we shared a little bit of your experience\nBut I did a great job I'm going out of Puerto Rico was it was one of those things I Wish I could have done more\nAnd or in any of it you have to have people that are willing to go out there and do that and uh I was hoping with with my story coming across that there are people that do go into it's it's kind of like a fireman and why why in the world is apparently going to run into a burning building you know um but\nThe reality was like down in Puerto Rico there were a lot of the coast guard there were there were um a ... there from Puerto Rico and they had like a day or two to to kind of get their their families squared away and then they had to go and start working\nAnd you know there's a lot of people that are that when there is a ... you know a natural disaster or something like that that go out there\nAnd uh really do is watch as I can it's it's never it's never enough\nBut uh I Hope that kind of came across in the story\nYeah it's you know that we were working I was ... and I didn't read the story which it was written on the page I read it right out before I came out about the restaurant and it really got me because\nIt's such a a simple thing and it's what they are therefore they're a restaurant but when you don't have power and you know you've limited your food is limited to give that gift to help is just a wonderful story and\nYou know it goes to show that you were there to help but you know what they chipped in to it when it was almost a crisis everybody starts putting in their little there there are a little bit\nIt's a one of the most like humbling humanizing and inspiring thing so I thank you for\nWhat you do have incredible incredible and thank you I could get [noise]\nYou're listening to Florida
