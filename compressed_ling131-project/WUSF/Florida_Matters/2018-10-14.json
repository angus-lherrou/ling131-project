Brewing Company in Tampa their partners on the project and he wants to use some of the Hillsborough hops for small batch of beer\nCompared to you know last year it it's just like day difference on how much better the hops cone size you're all model evil and production everyday is some off out here it's not really a\nHuge says he wants to buy hops grown in Florida it would save a lot of money on shipping but he also doesn't want to alienate his main suppliers\nYou know we're always going to be buying off from second or less we're always going to buy hops from New Jersey on and off\nIt's going to be buying hops from North less we're always going to buy hops from New Zealand Australia I Hope to be you know soon always buy some help from Florida to everybody's always excited to see a new off somewhere else they all play out and that's something that I think for that can do pretty well\nFor now researchers don't care if people see made with Hillsborough hops the next time that they buy a craft beer they just want to prove that a plant meant to grow in the Pacific northwest can thrive in Tampa Bay and taste good reporter Rodin W USF eighty nine point seven news\nDo you think of hops in places like Germany such a different climate than Florida from Roberta peace though it sounds like the research is really coming along Sean do you know about the hops in Florida\nYeah and it's uh it's pretty exciting to see that happening here for ... for a long time all you heard was that you can't grow up in Florida\nAt well you wouldn't be here you know and and really not anything like the Pacific northwest it's\nNot we we don't have that kind of cooler weather we we have\nThe rain but we also have the humidity at a heated you wouldn't think that it would work but that's what the scientists do and and these are agricultural specialist they look and see how can we make this happen here and not only that they look at you know we've had such issues in the citrus industry because of the ... kinda currently raining and stuff like that\nI'm giving some farmers perhaps an alternative to something that could be done here\nTo nail it could be a kind of a farm to table for beer which the guy said he be interested in anything like that\nDo absolutely and we've been working with some of the University of Florida professors and scientist there looking it up to the sound board on what a brewery would look for in hops what they're looking for chemical you out of that hot but they're looking for flavor and aroma wise what they're looking for a volume wise\nAnd um that's been sort of the hurdle that I think right now we're trying to jump over is there is a bit of acreage that is devoted to hop growing right now and in an experimental phase\nThe issue with that even with that large relatively large acreage the amount of ... that are needed even to brew very very small batch you've been one barrel which is going to be thirty one gallons it's a lot of hops that we need so we actually are very very first all Florida hopped beer that was on a one barrel system so against their just thirty one gallons\nThe amount of hops that are needed it was a pretty large percentage of what was available to us so would we be able to brew beer that would be distributed all over Florida with just Florida grown hops\nProbably not for a number of years but we're really excited to be able to really get our hands dirty with the tops and see what they're going to taste like in the beer what they're going to smell like in the beer feedback that we can bring back to the farmers and and to the folks that University of Florida\nDanny what's the most popular kind of the air\nOut at our place on it's an IP a that's and I think that's because that's what people here and we get a lot of folks that are your typical beer nerds\nSo they hear I.
