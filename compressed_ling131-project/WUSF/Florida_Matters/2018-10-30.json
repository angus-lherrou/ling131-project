{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WUSF", "content": "Right well they're not going to speak out because they're the culture of that age is very strongly to the left right how are they are not going to tweet anything conservative and I don't get the wrath of all of their Twitter ... subsequently\nTrue but it's fascinating because every reporter I talked to from out of Florida\nThe first thing they asked me is when they come in and what I'd like to really go to some areas to talk to some older voters and I say well I can certainly point you to those places but the real story in Florida\nIs what we knew would be happening generational replacement because now the younger demographics are bigger the millennials engines ears are bigger than the boomers\nWell I think that's true that you would be hearing that from from out of state reporters because I don't think that thinking has caught up and you still think Florida as Miami Beach retirees not thinking of it as a young state but that's what you're saying and that's going to determine the vote this time\nAnd just look at the age of many of the candidates running in fact the candidates for governor wants thirty nine and one's forty\nOne of the Ashley Moody she's all yeah forty three\nRight then there are young people at the there's there's a generation generation X ers and if you look at the hundred and twenty two women for example that filed to run for the Florida House of representatives and the legislature\nA lot of those are very young though we're we're definitely seeing in Canada sees more and more young people are saying I Want to write something out who's real important to notice about them do is there a lot of them are not registering where the party there registering is no party affiliation\nThese younger generations of looked at Washington since they've come of age politically and they see a broken Washington and they don't really care for either party\nSo let's bring in William March now William is a correspondent for the Tampa Bay times have you here Williams Robin wrote a bitter that we've been talking about the ... record or and also speaking of some young candidates I'm actually moody as a Republican candidate for attorney general\nShe's going up against I'm Democrat Sean Shaw says share\nAnd then there's a high profile race this race also has national implications because attorneys general are now joining together to either block or enable President Trump's agenda can you talk about that a little\nWell sure the outgoing attorney general Pam Bondi who's got a term limit has been very active and joining with other state attorneys general basically to attract the Obama agenda that they feel amount to government overreach and include some environmental regulations some of which don't even apply to Florida\nPlus joining with um some two dozen other states with Republican attorneys general to try to have\nA the Affordable CARE Act Obamacare declared unconstitutional [noise] so that's kind of ...\nAffordable Care Act Obamacare declared unconstitutional [noise] so that's kind of an example of what attorneys general can do ... or if they wish and Sean Sean has promised that if she's elected she'll be very active uh on on issues including a lawsuit\nIn which some democratic attorneys general are trying to determine whether President Trump violated the ban and the constitution on receiving foreign emoluments\nOr she might act on on state issues including public education funding guns so these are hands issues these are ... use\nTheir they have some pretty big differences that to Canada there's\nAn extremely stark contrast she is promising as we've been talking about this this very activist attorney general's office she on the other hand\nNews the office more in terms of defending the state against legal challenges to its laws and serving as the the top policymaking law enforcement agencies to act against crimes like human trafficking and older abuse\nCitizen you said the governor's race is the one that's going to drive voter turnout and why is that\nWell first of all the candidates that were nominated really surprise a lot of people especially Gillum and sort of an upset underdog\nAnd secondly you also see that their age I mean they're both young they reflect in a way the passing of baton from one older\nGroups to these younger groups now thirdly they couldn't be further apart on their issue positions of anything\nBut I think also that particularly Gillum is very interesting to a lot of younger people are not just Democrats but no party affiliation because precisely because he brings diversity to the ticket\nAnd he has a very inspirational speaker on a debate send draws a lot of people too there's forums and town halls\nAnd his bus trip was really a very brilliant strategy for how he put together a winning coalition of blacks and young people in the primary those are two groups are typically don't turn out for a mid term so it's his personal appeal the centers\nIs interesting because he was handpicked by the president and some Republicans still read that the intrusion there\nBut he also has a strong military background which is quite appealing to a number of Floridians who have no military service a lot of people in the service and families and so forth\nBut it's the national element so this race also is important because\nThis governor whomever elected will have veto power over the congressional redistricting plan that will be drawn at twenty twenty which means that it's tied right again to national politics and it looks like at a minimum Florida is going to get to more seats in Congress\nAnd besides that every presidential nominee loves to have a governor setting their of their party they helped him and overthrew the state nowhere to go word raise money what issues\nAnd also Democrats have been locked out of the governor's mansion a very long time it has all of the elements of intriguing surprise it's much more interesting to the average person that are US Senate seat even though both are equally important international politics\nAs well as the interest in this governor's race going to help the seeds down ballot in other words if I'm the interest in Andrew Gillum bring in a lot of Democrats to vote for him\nAre we going to see Nicki fried for agriculture commissioner maybe or I'm Sean shock for attorney general and that kind of help the people down ballot there's some\nSean shock for attorney general that kind of help the people down ballot\nThere's some that say that is true you have two schools of thought one is that people are just gonna vote straight took it all the way down interestingly the first name on the ballot\nIs the U.S Senate race in us Rick Scott ... Senate race comes ahead of the um new editorial raised in terms of your belly button that currently you have a lot of these in the age which are a large portion of our voters right now\nWho really are NBA is because they don't particularly like either party and they may be more willing to split tickets down the way depending upon the candidate or even skipped races\nSo I think there's a lot of intrigue Democrats are counting on the fact that it's going to be a straight ticket or Republicans do but they both realized that could really see sort of cross over\nMost talked about Andrew Gillum on an FBI agent posing as a developer paid more than four thousand dollars for a gallon fundraiser and bought him Hamilton tickets these um documents and just released a recently but voters even care let me give you my theory and then you tell me what you think I mean\nI think the fact that he is to the left\nUm helps him in this case because a Democrat isn't going to vote for Iran to Santa Fe because he's so far to the right so so they're not going to cross over and vote for Iran to stand us no matter what Andrew Gillum does\nAnd Republicans who might have voted for Gwen Graham are never going to vote for Andrew Gillum no matter what to Santa's dies you see what I'm saying\nI think you're exactly right I think those races so ... divided or an so divisive with the most extreme founded it's from each party I'm winning or nominations on the moderates losing in the primaries but\nBut the problems that you're talking about the the ... with us if we are investigation probably won't affect to supporters now it could have a fake effect around the margins no party candidates the independents who who might actually be undecided\nThey could be a factor but I think that'll be a marginal if certain rather than a dramatic effect\nI'm Robin ... ham and you're listening to Florida matters we're taking a short break and we'll be right back\n\nSupport for Florida matters comes from the national foundation for transplants right now hundreds of Tampa residents need an organ transplant they cannot afford you can join National Foundation for transplants an organization providing financial relief to transplant patients for more than thirty five years\nVisit transplants dot org to learn more\nThis is your NPR station W USF eighty nine point seven\n\nThis is Florida matters I'm Robin ... minutes aren't October news roundtable we're talking about the upcoming election with William March he writes about politics for the Tampa Bay times and Susan MacManus a political analyst and a political scientist affiliated\nWith the University of South Florida I wanted to ask you both after hurricane Michael hit the panhandle recently the feeling was that it was going to hurt voter turnout and it's a heavily Republican area citizen couldn't make a difference\nIt could but I took a careful look at the numbers and there's only around eight counties where there were schools closed in whatever one of the gaps then that's a pretty big part of that area", "show_name": "Florida Matters", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "30"}
