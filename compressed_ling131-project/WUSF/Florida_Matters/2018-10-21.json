{"month": "10", "state": "FL", "station": "WUSF", "content": "And also because my husband and I were out without jobs [noise] my mom lives here and she told me to come here for a few months while things in Puerto Rico stabilized a little bit so I decided to come here with the kids first and then when I was here because I found a job\nI made a decision to stay here permanently ... but it was a little younger than me ... you know\nWhen I got here I spent three or four day that my mother's house and then I got approval for the FEMA helped to move to a hotel and I went there with the kids to a hotel with a pool that was here in Tampa I was alone with the four kids and it was funny because they thought we were on vacation\nBut it was hard for me because I was alone my husband stayed in Puerto Rico turning in the house and getting everything in order over there so that he could later reunite with us but it was very hard because I had to find someone to stay with my kids so I could go to work\nThey would tell me okay and then last minute they would say no I Can't help with that it was very hard for me but in my ... my first\nJob was cleaning at night and then from there I started working in a school cafeteria in the morning and on the weekends I Would dedicate my time to making cakes and helping my mother with her client I Am still making cakes but I'm not cleaning anymore now I have a job and telemarketing\nStone which I'm On the ... the fact that our new I have so many feeling when I think about the past year\nAnd sometimes I get sad but I also feel quite content because I live alone and able to work almost for jobs and still take care of my four kids and I feel very happy and proud of myself\n... the film that got Iraqi I made the decision to come here for the quality of life for my kids my kids are better here than in Puerto Rico\nJoke it but I enjoy a joke at look at the amount of this I thought it was an evil long horn\nDo I want for them I think what Henry mother wishes or there was the best you'll get I Want to back if I can give them the world I wanted to give them the entire world I Want them to do and wealth for themselves to study and to six feet\nI Want the best for them [noise] the only thing I ask is health and life to be able to guide them I don't want anything [noise]\n\nFollowing all the performances at the event your real story is executive director Lillian deadline came to the stage to interview some of the actors along with the people who stories they told about their experiences with the process\nNow we'll hear done lap talk with Jesse Giuliano and Isabelle no Tara who perform the story of Hurricane Maria survivor Leslie did she also speaks with Jonathan French and the actor who portrayed him Christopher Rutherford\nLet me just ask you about the experience of doing these stories what was it like preparing for this\nKnow it's funny 'cause I think\nFor this\nYou know it's funny 'cause I think one of the one of the things that I found it um I find that easily connect to these stories I'm Dominican and Dominican Republic was hit pretty hard I'm not anywhere near as hard as Puerto Rico but I I had family members who\nYou know had a hard time transitioning after the storm as well so it's it's a very easy thing to connect to and being Latina I think\nI think anybody in the Caribbean when it happens to one we all feel it right so I I just felt like I went on the journey with her with her when I was listening to the story in here and I'm In reading it\nYes it sounded like you use it but in the world\nI mean I I Love what you guys do I think these are very important story that I feel that really need to be heard if they really need to be told they need to be shared I'm I'm originally from Puerto Rico if you didn't hear it and the accent\n[laughter] however my vantage of like straight up\nIt was very devastating for me to see because I was born and raised there I'm I'm from I'm not very dead my husband is as well so for us it was very difficult for us to see friends his grandmother is over there so just trying to get in touch with his grandmother to see how she was doing\nUm that was really side it was very sad for me to the close friends that I grew up with that we're struggling to be able to provide for their babies and to the like you know that they would be in line for hours and hours and hours just trying to get water\nSo just a witness dot when Hurricane Maria happened what I did was I collected donations and I got very involved and so there is another way for me to continue staying involved so for me is something very very important that I'm very very passionate about it was very easy for me to connect I'm a\nI'm a mother and other human being right like it wasn't hard to connect\nWith this story at all whatsoever the lifeline always got me when I read it because it's true it's what every mother once and I think that was so beautiful about these stories is that\nI always find it more interesting to look out what we have in common versus what makes a difference to 'em so these stories allow it to connect with each other and ... we are all the same and like she said you know what I Want is not any different from what any other mother want I Want the box for my children\nSo that even at that many personal thank you [noise]\nWell said Christ will come back to um I Want to introduce you to somebody that you don't know when when we come to this point the actor and the storyteller have usually not met first meet the real John [noise]\nI'm grateful for you for people like you who are are are there to just when everything goes arrive to bottom dropped so smart people like you show up\nAnd uh just the lights turned back on the water going again I'm and I'm a very big walls are grateful to tell your story and ah I'm honored and I'm Glad we we shared a little bit of your experience\nBut I Do disagree job I'm going out of ... was it was one of those things I Wish I could have done more\nAnd or in any of it you have to have people that are willing to go out there and do that and ah I was hoping with with my story coming across the there are people that do go into it's it's kind of like a permanent and why why in the world is apparently going to run into a burning building you know um but\nThe reality was like down in Puerto Rico there were a lot of the coast guard there were there were um ah that are from Puerto Rico and they had like a day or two to pick out and get their their families squared away and then they had to go on\nLike a day or two to to kind of get their their families squared away and then they had to go and start working and you know there's a lot of people that are when there is you know a natural disaster or something like that that go out there and uh really do is watch like and it's it's never it's never enough\nBut ah I Hope that kind of came across from the store\nYou know we were working on the script and I didn't read the story which it was written on the page I read it right out for it came out about the restaurant has it really got me because\nIt's such a simple thing and it's what they are therefore they're a restaurant but when you don't have power and you know you've limited your food is limited to give that gift to help is just a wonderful story and\nYou know it goes to show like you were there to help but you know what they chipped in to it when in those moments of crisis everybody starts putting in their little their village bit\nIt's a one of the most like humbling
