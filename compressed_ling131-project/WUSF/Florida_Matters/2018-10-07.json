they had to live there and wait until everything was over before the EMTs could go in and the question has been whether fire department paramedics should have gone into the night clubs sooner than they did\nIn may the SPA released a set of standards and training models for active shooter response was that response to the polls shooting in Orlando\nI wouldn't say just the poll shooting but definitely pulse had a huge influence on the creation of the new standard the request for the new standard came from auto drove from Orange County Florida fire chief there\nBecause there was a lot of guidance out there from the federal government different agencies within the federal government as well as guidance from associations and other things and none of it was a standard none of it was
