and then they're gone whereas if you go for something like a TV show or a lot of commercial something like that when you get a company is going to be doing different commercial that seems like it might be a more long lasting relationship\nI I actually agree with that if you look at our incentive here locally the way it was written was specifically to engage with high impact commercials and TV series that has some longevity to them and the last two years we've incentivized to discovery network's a TV show called St science\nUm we've also had night watching several other fairly well known TV series shoot here either in whole or in part uh we have a lot of reality t._v. series that shoot here um party down south Ninety day fiance I mean we are so many different reality shows that like to to film here as because one way is that\nThere is certainly a nation it could be are interesting characters we ... a locally but it's also just a beautiful weather um you have to keep in mind that production schedules are very tight and if I'm having to worry about a snowstorm in March when I needed to look spraying happy and fun\nI Can't shoot that necessarily in Chicago or New York or anywhere in the mid west so I'm going to come here I say this and I wouldn't put this on a postcard but but Hillsborough county's biggest asset is the banality of Hillsborough County we don't have anything necessarily iconic on film that would identify us as being Tampa our downtown to look like any downtown\nAnd that's really served as a benefit to the local community as far as productions go\nI Want you to tiny follow up on that because you think the weather is a big draw\nYou know if I'm not for not filming in July and Florida and her even if one of the most beautiful places to film a shot five films in Florida and I've relied on the natural beauty and the weather that allowed me to be outside and he is from now until June and that's a that's a production window that's that's pretty rare\nWhat else besides whether um is there a labor pool that you find a track there\nThere is I I'm a filmmaker they've got to tap into maybe five commissions to pull off my my film that I shot in April\nNineteen thirty five India and so I didn't lean on Florida to look like Florida I looked at Florida to look like Nineteen thirty five northwest India\nAnd so I had to find architecture of high society a Hindu society that would exist and so I reached out to Tyler I reached out to\nSandy Letterman Miami gene ... soda I ended up using the power crowd Lee mansion in Madison County the Philippine stayed at the keys mansion in Sarasota County the how we manage him out in Lake County near Orlando I hired a Hillsborough County a production company to produce my film\nSo I've got crew locations everything that I Need and the state of Florida just take the the integration 'cause we're we're all kind of working together at this point to bootstrap a lot of production that late that my budget to get them out the door\nYeah so you found a movie that is supposed to be an end yeah but you were able to use Florida and you mean a lot of your interviews\nAnd people were filming here because it was Florida and they were drawn to it for their creative inspiration I think you had one quote where you said the clash of cultures between retirees criminal beach bombs I'm paraphrasing but I thought it was perfect\nI think Tony would probably met his film is kind of unusual in that most people that are filming here\nI think Tony would probably met his film is kind of unusual in that most people that are filming here now they're filming because they don't have the budget or something like a Ben Affleck slip by night which could go to Georgia\nAnd could create literally a fake rubber ... city like most of these production do not have those millions of dollars so they need to come here to Florida to shoot what they're interested in whether that's a Liberty City neighborhood and moonlight whether that's the strip of motels in the Florida Project\nAnd that's where a lot of the productions now in the film industry or come here for their smaller scale films\nThat or don't have the budget is really to go to Georgia and that's kind of what's been helping to stay in our film a productions around here\nDon't have the budget to go to Georgia if they're putting a Florida scene and they're sure again right they want a pine forest to their good\nThat is a minimum spend in Georgia in order to qualify for that really attractive rebate from did you have to spend a half a million dollars so it's bigger found but you have to be a bigger film just to just to clarify for that ...\nYeah I Want to talk about that because that's an example that used a lot for Florida losing out to Georgia and the film business is Ben Affleck new movie he recreate ... city in Georgia rather than filming it here\nBut Jimmy and your reporting I mean if Ben Affleck maybe doesn't that make enough money won't movies think twice again about recreating a town or does the state funding cushion that law in other words um they're losing other people's money they're not losing their investors money because they're getting that big break from ... when it\nDidn't do well it was a box office bomb this may be eliminated and got great reviews people didn't go see it I'm sure that's a that's a possibility and what you are seeing some of these big budget productions a for instance here in Hillsborough County the infiltrate or an ... for peculiar children\nThese are big budget movies and they found elsewhere because of the lack of tax incentives are both of them filmed in Europe primarily but\nThey did come down here and they came down here partially just because they were struggling to recreate the Tampa that is a production costs if you're having to like\nCreate palm trees or whatever would represent a Florida so what you're seeing now in the film industry Lisa what I found in my reporting\nWas that your primarily getting smaller scale films commercials reality television and the big budget films I Do come here first man for instance came here and shot partially a Kennedy Space center you have to do that\nGuy right so they're coming here partially because um they're not coming for full shoots like they used to but they're coming here partially because they want to still have some of the accurate re creation in their projects\nI'm Robin said thing ham and you're listening to Florida matter it's we're taking a short break and we'll be right back [noise]\nSaudi

than thirty five years visit transplants dot org learned more\nDishes W us after eighty nine point seven your NPR station\nIs Florida matters I'm Robin ... and we're talking about the future of the film industry in Tampa Bay and in the state\nHere in the studio with us is Tyler Martin ... county commissioner Jimmy gr it's a reporter with the Sarasota Herald Tribune and\n... reporter with the seriousness of the Herald Tribune and Tony stopping a filmmaker date in Sarasota to give me talk about those tax credits that were discontinued in two thousand sixteen how how exactly did that work\nVery similar to how they work in most other states now basically you would get I think it was twenty to thirty and our initial program and right now in Georgia it's thirty so basically you get tax credits\nBack fat twenty to thirty percent of what you've spent that what you're saying\nIn in terms of your local filming um\nAnd so the first system that we had here in Florida in two thousand ten it was criticized by some including some people who are very pro stay film program even they'll say they think it was flawed because it was the first come first served in Florida in other words\nYou've got tax credits back based on one you applied and won money was available rather than perceived economic impacts to the state\nSo I didn't get into it's too much in my story but part of that you know ... the videogame studio they got quite a bit of the tax credits even though they're not going to have the same kind of job creation just 'cause they're videogame studio you're not hiring gaffe first you know for a video game [noise]\nSo now when we're talking about a new state film program they're kind of going away from what they had before they're the first come first served and less from that traditional incentive program the new bill that a senator and today I was proposed\nAnd it's going more into they would have a certain amount of money that they were kind of fun to productions on separately it wouldn't have worked in the whole tax incentive system\nTyler what are we losing by not filming some movies or TV shows even video games in Florida is there a or their intangible benefits\nYou have this entire creative community there's about five thousand people in the bay area who work in some way shape or form in film and digital media um their livelihoods are dependent upon film productions coming to this area or at least somewhere within the state of Florida\nAnd the further out in time we go more and more of those people are having to go elsewhere to find gainful employment and again these are jobs that are making Seventy plus thousand dollars a year a is a very meaningful salary and what we've seen as most of them have been moonlighting elsewhere Georgia Louisiana\nBut further around time we go those residents are stopped the ... and they start relocating and that's when we we really see a deficit is when they actually move someplace else so even if we had an incident come back tomorrow\nWe have so few talent left and so few resources left that it will be several years before we can actually gain enough traction to see those people come back and see the infrastructure rebuilt again\nI'm so it gets harder and harder as time goes on for us to really read jumpstart the film production cue here in the state we don't have the resources\nSo you don't want to see that infrastructure leave I mean I Can't I mean any ... any and destroy a decade ... why are you seeing that said all Tony are you seeing eye people leaving or
