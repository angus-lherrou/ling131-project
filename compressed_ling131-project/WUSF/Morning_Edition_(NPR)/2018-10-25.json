Iran is involved with the facts and the Saudis defining United States inside of it the bodies\nThat they're serving in Congress which showed up in the last defense bill of trying to protect civilians\nAnd there's talk of sanctioning Saudi Arabia in some way because of the journalist killing us well Cokie thanks as always good to talk to you to stay in commentator Cokie Roberts you can ask Cokie your questions about our politics and government work by emailing us at ask Cokie your NPR dot org or feeding us with the hashtag askcokie [noise]\n\n\nIs NPR News and this is W.

on prime video\nThis is MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm David Greene and I'm Noel King markets in Asia were mostly down overnight after a bad day on Wall street yesterday the Dow fell more than six hundred points\nToday Japan's Nikkei index fell more than four percent the hang saying index and Hong Kong flipped by a full percentage point but the Shanghai stock exchange was stable and this is unusual because China's stock market has fallen by thirty percent since January and its currency has fallen to its lowest level against the dollar in nearly two years\nNPR's Rob Schmitz is with us from Shanghai good morning Rob good morning to ours with thirty percent drop for China stock markets sounds pretty darned bad what's going on\n[noise] will just kind of been lagging for the last few years the government dealing with a lot of problems you've got public debt spiraling out of control you've got a fairly significant property bubble and through all of this ... making painful changes in how China's economy runs moving from\nAn economy based on building things to one based on buying things and the downturn in trying to stock market this year reflects that but it's important to remember here that when China stock market drops by thirty percent like this year it isn't going to have\nAs big an impact on the economy like if the dog the Dow fell by the same percentage and that's because in the U.S much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't a great indicator of the overall economy if say the value of China's currency\nLet me ask you about China's currency the UN is edits weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\nWell it's interesting hearing that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing years\nThe opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make experts cheaper but that's not what's happening now what's happening now is that\nThe u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the un to weaken and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nCharge doing a China doesn't want its currency to appreciate too quickly because it can lead to inflation as a last thing China needs right now so if China should get out of the way and stopped managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and\nChina are these terrorists that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a communist I'm speaking to it's a little early to tell us tariffs are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here in China's economy\nIn my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes all of their supply chains to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war and that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U. S. China's economy was already vulnerable from a host of economic problems that are finally coming home to roost\nNPR's Rob Schmitz in Shanghai thanks out ...\nAccording to a un climate report that was released earlier this month the world has only about twelve years to roll back carbon emissions and avoid the worst impacts of climate change\nSilicon Valley has been at work on a solution for years often promising quick fixes blocks chain the technology behind crypto currency like bitcoin is the latest solution coming for big tech\nMember station KCUR December net has more\nUntil about a year ago hardly anyone in climate science is talking about watching but at the recent global climate action some in San Francisco it was all over the place there were panels papers people were talking about how he could help mitigate climate change in\nAll sorts of land use agriculture part of an oil to frustration over power\nSometime and co chairs the climate change coalition he came to the conferences spread awareness about ...

S. much of the country's retirement plans are invested into the stock market but not in China it's still relatively young market and it isn't\nA great indicator of the overall economy as say the value of China's currency\nAnd let me ask you about China's currency the UN is edits weakest level against the dollar and nearly two years and President Trump says Beijing is keeping its currency low to make exports cheaper which could give China an edge in a trade war is China manipulating its currency\nWell what's interesting here is that China is likely manipulating its currency but it's doing so in the opposite direction of what President Trump is accused China of doing\nYears ago China used to weaken its currency to make exports cheaper but that's not what's happening out what's happening now is that the u._s. dollar is stronger and this is putting pressure on the weekend and Beijing has stepped in to try and prevent it from weakening too fast\nStarted doing a China doesn't want its currency to depreciating too quickly because it can lead to inflation and that's the last thing China needs right now\nSo if China should get out of the way and start managing its currency like the UN would likely we can much faster which is what Trump does not want because that could lead to an even bigger trade deficit between the U.S and China\nI think parents that President Trump is imposed on Chinese goods having a a big impact on the economy there\nWell from a kind of time speaking to it's a little early to tell us parents are certainly having a deep psychological impact on the movers and shakers here and try to calm me in my conversations with business owners here I keep hearing stories of how companies are making plans to move parts are sometimes\nAll of their supply chain to countries in Southeast Asia to avoid this trade war\nAnd that of course does not bode well for China's economic future\nBut it's important to note here that even without the trade war with the U.
