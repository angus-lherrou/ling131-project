I'm Steve Inskeep let's recall a Supreme Court battle before the one we're living through no judge Brett Kavanaugh's contentious Senate hearing last week recalled some earlier ones including a night\nTensions Senate hearing last week recall to them earlier ones including a Nineteen eighty seven showdown between Democratic senators and then federal appeals court judge Robert Bork we've been nominated to the Supreme Court Senator Ted Kennedy library attack\nIn Robert Bork America there is no room at the end for blacks and no place in the constitution for women and then our America there should be no seat on the Supreme Court for Robert Bork\nThe Senate went on to reject the Bork nomination adventure early Anthony Kennedy was appointed to the court in his place the very sweet but it's been a battle over now so let's ask Cokie about the sometimes contentious nomination process commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions each week about our politics of the government work hike okay Hi the here's our first question\nMy name is Melissa us back from Santa Clara California I'm Wondering how often has a highly contested nominee felt to be confirmed if ever and what happens to hotly contested nominees after the confirmation process offended how does that affect their legacy or not but\nOut of a hundred and sixty three nominations advantage to send to the Senate a hundred and twenty five and been confirmed many on voice votes and some have withdrawn without ever having been voted on\nSo we don't have the means that it's not controversial and that at all in favor say aye and they just go right\nOnly about a dozen have been rejected but the first one to the administration of George Washington while when the Senate refused removed Justice John Rutledge into the chief justice but because he disagreed with him over a treaty with Britain\nAnd then Lyndon Johnson's Nineteen sixty eight decision to move justice aid for just have to achieve also found in the Democratic Senate he was the first to be rejected tense Rutledge but by the way he was also the first to appear before the Judiciary Committee\nWhile the other part of our question was interesting because Brett Kavanaugh has been so you've ruined my life with this with this confirmation process what does happen to nominate after a contentious fight like those\nDifferent ones have different courses Robert Bork resigned from judgeship and went on to write books and make speeches then the man President Reagan named after work a failed judge Douglas Ginsburg which forced to withdraw because Haiti legally smoke marijuana but he said on the federal appeals court until they took senior status a few years back\nKevin crow rights to ask assuming Kavanaugh is confirmed if it's later found that he lied in front of the Senate Judiciary committee could cause them to be removed\nIt would be highly unlikely the way you remove it Supreme Court justice through impeachment just like the president only one just never been impeached by the house and he was not convicted by the Senate that was Samuel Chase an Eighteen oh for\nThomas Jefferson wanted them off the court because he disagreed with them politically he accused him of partisan rhetoric John Randall off in the house represented had hit wiped the floor with chase a so this nastiness and hardly knew\n'em dead then the Senate failed to go along and and that pretty much ended the idea of removing a justice for political reasons and\nThat leads to another question Hi this is Kelly my her from birth Connecticut I was wondering do other comparable countries have lifetime appointments and have there been any other nominees similar to what is going on now\nIf so what was the result of what is it with these lifetime appointment to swell lots of judicial plan in various countries most do have either a term limit or a mandatory retirement age some at both\nUh they've been talk of an Eighteen year time limit for Supreme Court justices here not likely to go anywhere [noise]\nThat would require a change in the law or in the constitution OK Cokie thanks very much and good teams commentator Cokie Roberts and you can ask Cokie

us about the winners presumably you're not gonna do it verbatim translate to ask you to know who won\nSo half of the award went to France is Arnold she's a researcher at Cal Tech in Pasadena, California and\nThe other half of the award is shared by George Smith at the University of Missouri in Colombia and Gregory Winter at the end Marcy laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nMarcy laboratory of molecular biology Cambridge in the United kingdom\nAnd what did they do that has given them is on her so the Nobel Prize committee said that they introduced a revolution in chemistry based on evolution\nAnd so basically the idea is they took the principles of Darwin of evolution and apply them to the test to basically you know developing new types of chemicals in enzymes by inserting an element of randomness ... of the whole process\nSo it used to be that people would try to develop new chemicals are enzymes by you know using logic and trying to design right that ends on to do exactly what they wanted it to do but Francis Arnold uh called that a quotes somewhat arrogant approach\nAnd so she realized the thing to do was to use randomness in the early Nineteen nineties she started trying to improve their performance of enzymes by taking a gene for an enzyme\nUp putting a whole bunch of random mutations into it and then putting these into bacteria that would then spew out a whole bunch of different versions of the enzymes and then you could screen does to pick the best one for whatever purpose you you had\n'em and then the others who won the prize did something similar George Smith\nDeveloped a technique called phage display it uses a virus to infect bacteria and it can be used to evolve new proteins and including antibodies that is what Gregory Winter did took phage display and apply to to antibodies and you know by doing that you can create anti bodies is all kinds of new medicines to treat diseases\nI mean I just love that idea of of inserting randomness into important scientific discoveries how did that practically change our world\nWell you know by using evolution to produce new enzymes you could improve almost any industrial process\nI mean you know enzymes make chemical reactions go faster and you can develop enzymes to do things that people hadn't thought were possible before you can create more environmentally friendly chemicals you know you can produce renewable fuels are better medicines\nAnd in terms of new anti bodies um there are medicines based on this I mean the first medicine was approved I'm In two thousand and two and it targets are rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease\nSo you know other anti bodies urban development that could do things like fight cancer we heard yesterday from of NPR science editor Geoff Brumfiel ... the Nobel\nAre ... are actually struggling to stay relevant I mean is is that something that a good discussion you've heard around this particular press two yeah there's a question about whether it's keeping up with modern times I mean for instance Arnold is only the fifth woman to win this chemistry Nobel in over a hundred years\nUm the prize can only go to three people can't go to anybody who's dead um some people say that you know it's a little bit um archaic in this day and age but I think they're trying to keep up All right

USF eighty nine points at a news\nYou may have heard people comment on the heat these past few weeks now we have the numbers to back it up meteorologist Jeff Hoffman with the Florida public radio emergency network confirmed with W us that's Alisa peaks that last month was the hottest on record\nIt was a hot ... not only here in Tampa but across the entire state more than a dozen cities will reporting stations had the hottest September on record and\nEven more unique or astonishing is here in Tampa not only was the hottest September since records began an Eighteen Ninety it was the warmest months of ... months\nSince that time suggest why it's so hot well it's a couple of things that contributed to the hot weather we had more of an offshore flow much of the month coming in from the Atlantic and they're in West central Florida\nWhen the wind is coming all the way across the peninsula does not moderated temperatures as much as it does when it comes off the Gulf also we did not have the uh interruption of any tropical activity\nSo there wasn't these days with lots of rain and cloud cover and it was just a pattern that was persisting high pressure ridge overhead for many many days but did you see this coming well yes we can predict a within reason general trends are forecast whether we break a record or not\nIs a is a little bit more granular to the environmental conditions at that specific location for example\nMany cities probably had their all time record high for the month because of the lack of thunderstorms and we know in Florida the punishment can dance around anywhere so\nGeneral trends are a little easier to predict in specific numbers that we're talking about today\nI was looking at some of the temperatures for St Petersburg and they weren't as high as Tampa's why is there a difference\nWhen there's more of a water influence in St Petersburg if you think about where it's located it's kind of on a peninsula and there's water on both sides so when\nI mentioned that that wind had been flowing across the Atlantic more often in the Gulf this past month\nThat still means that when I came across the bay and you know temper down the are the numbers just a bit there in St Pete so it's because there's water on three sides of saint Pete only water theoretically on one or one and a half sides of Tampa this pattern seems to be pretty well entrenched I mean here we are first week in October and temperature is still in the nineties\nYeah this was the weather pattern that was projected to occur in the latter part of the summer night lingered a lot longer than I think some of the doubt it's adjusted but it's not uncommon to get a big rigid high pressure\nIn this part of the nation that just doesn't want to move and it's still theoretically holding strong here in early October\nAll right one for the record books radiologist Jeff Hoffman with the Florida public radio emergency network thanks you can see a charge to the September temperatures for our area at W.
