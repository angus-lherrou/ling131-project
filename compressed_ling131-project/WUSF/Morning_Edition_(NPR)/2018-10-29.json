... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive bill Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to our co host Noel care\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\nUh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple test I mean basically what we're seeing here is the kind of ...\nOut of sophisticated level that you could do more rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergy so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it that much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay\nThat this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which is just an expensive place to live\nWell no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital system in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high prices become the norm because insurance look at what's usual and customary so if everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices\nIt's not about competition it's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things I can do first don't write the check that's the general advice for healthcare second if your providers that hey this might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy tests\nOh how could it expensive could it be a thousand bucks\nBut here we see it can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable\nDon't just look in your area I mean the expert and the pizza that thirty five dollars per skin tests is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars\nSo I think we have to look nationally for references\nDr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much\nThanks [noise]\nSupport for NPR health coverage

election he'll take office\nOn the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo many things to ask you about when it comes to this man but I mean you you've talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusion can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all over the last decade in the hospital sick of corruption and crime and\nThe union for the restoration of national pride I think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively I should say though that most NATO himself insists the survival of dumped democracy is not an issue here last night he again and promised to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty rather help part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future president to respect\nThe judge had to remind him and the people that people really do about the constitution what it says\nAnd I think that underlines the extent to which these he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and its potential issue but don't forget\nHere is about democracy it's a young democracy and its potential issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd think that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these jokes all they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt for example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not at home in\nThe rainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any racism I don't believe that I think he's really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him is his promise to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said does he have a game plan to do that\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he also believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they do they were ready people hit David a sick of robberies and the sky high motor right\nYet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people [noise] because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAs I and I found out about that comes to when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to Luis Fernando ... power to a black man age twenty seven who lives that\nI think everybody is worried about it most of the people are actually that poor people than minority\nOkay so

Need to make the three hundred miles by Wynton as an English professor in rural eureka California\nWhen she needs to see a specialist she often drives the hours one way to Stanford healthcare just

made the trek to see a dermatologist at Stanford and she suspected Winston was allergic to something in the skin cream she was prescribed maybe her shampoo I started going back over my whole life

Nineteen settlement usually found and beauty products Basset traced in some aerosol they put it into a tiny plastic tactical\nThen they drew a grid on when since back in magic marker said that they know what stops him going where and then they use some kind of medical tape and they tape these plastic capsules to your back\nThat's it when it's been left then came back two days later and they take everything off my back and then they quote unquote read my back turns out Winston was allergic to eleven substantive they tested she was so relieved to have answers but then two and a half months later\nThe bill came I was in total shock\nForty eight thousand three hundred and twenty nine dollars to tapes and plastic capital sure back I didn't have any needle stalking me I had no scalpel stuck

affordability and provider choices\nBut ... says that's still really high the mass just doesn't add up ... says the customary charged for this test is thirty five dollars and that includes a twenty six percent markup for the expensive San Francisco bay area even if you charge defeat hundred Nineteen times for each allergen\nOr just do the math on that it's four thousand one hundred and sixty five dollars less than ten percent of the entire bill and only slightly more than this patient as being left with to pay out of pocket so the ... still doesn't make sense to me\nIn the end Winston was personally on the hook for about three thousand dollars she goes she did that down to Fifteen hundred she put it on a credit card but she thinks of all the people who couldn't afford that or don't have insurance like hers\nWhen I Walk into the clinic and I see a grand piano and on this last visit I saw mano grams embroidered pillow cases I thought that forty eighth out and going to pay for those ... cases and that grand piano\nWinston says if all that money went to pay for the care of low income patient maybe it'll be worth it for ... five star hotel maybe not\nOr that reporting coming from April Dembosky from member station ... in San Francisco but we wanted to take an even closer look at how simple allergy tests can produce such an expensive to Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal is editor in chief for our partner Kaiser Health news and she spoke to a ... there\nWas a lovely image at the end of the story this grand hospital lobby up but forty eight thousand dollars for a skin test\nUh yeah you know it's nice to have a grand piano in the lobby but that's a fairly simple task I mean basically what we're seeing here is a kind of test out of sophisticated level that you could do\nMore rudimentary level in your home I mean I have skin allergy and so a lot of products come with something advise you to put a little on your arm the night before and make sure you don't react to it this\nIs a much more sophisticated version of that but forty eight thousand dollars more I\nWas part of the reason that this bill was so expensive because she was going to a hospital in the bay area which\nIs just an expensive place to live well no the bay area is an expensive place to live but it's also an expensive place to get medical care many markets are highly consolidated that means there are few hospital system in the bay area there are four\nThey can compete with each other and you would think that would bring down prices but instead basically high price has become the norm because insurers look at what's usual and customary so everyone is charging high prices they all get away with charging high prices it's not about competition\nIt's about what's customary that's interesting for people who find themselves in this position what should they do\nWell there are a couple of things I can do first don't write the check that the general advice for healthcare second if your provider says hey that's might get expensive ask what expensive means to them because expensive and healthcare you might think while the allergy tests oh how could it expensive could it be a thousand bucks but\nHere we create can be forty eight thousand dollars and the other thing is I Would say when you look for comparison prices to bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area\nTo bargain to say that's unreasonable don't just look in your area I mean the expert in the piece that's that thirty five dollars per skin tests is normal in the bay area well in other places it might be four dollars or six dollars or ten dollars so I think we have to look nationally\nFor reference to Dr Elisabeth Rosenthal of Kaiser Health news thank you so much thanks [noise]\n\nSupport for

runoff election he'll take off and\nOn the first of January we should say this is a huge change of direction for Latin America's largest democracy and let's hear now from NPR's Philip Reeves reporting from Rio either Phil Hi\nSo so many things to ask you about when it comes to the man I mean you you've talked about but she is an admirer of the military dictatorship\nI mean you you talked about that he is an admirer of the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil for for two decades or so I mean what what is this moment mean what conclusions can we draw here\nI think we can conclude that many Brazilians are prepared to overlook warnings that both NATO could be a threat to democracy because they're so angry with the leftist workers' party you govern Brazil for almost all over the last decade and a half sick of corruption and crime and they ... the restoration of national pride\nI don't think that it helps explain why does not have defeated the workers' party candidate Fernando ... so comprehensively\nI should say though that both NATO himself is the survival of the democracy is not an issue here last night he again promise to defend the constitution\nBut he is setting a lot of alarm bells ringing and that was clear yesterday when the president of Brazil Supreme Court voted an off duty read out part of the constitution to reporters about the need for the future president to respect the judge had\nTo remind him and the people that people really do about the constitution and what it says\nYes and I think that underlines the extent to which these he's a ... you know the debate here is about democracy it's a young democracy and it's a central issue but don't forget ... also has a record of making sexist and racist and homophobic remarks\nYou'd see that would be seriously damaging possibly to him but his supporters tend to dismiss these jokes do they say they're willing to overlook them because it's so important to them to have a leader who is competent an on corrupt\nFor example here's Kevin ... lawyer I spoke to outside both not as home Andrea\nIs rainy on that he's going to do a good job I don't believe that he had any race it and I don't believe that I think he really good guy\nOkay so she's optimistic and one reason a lot of people are optimistic about him and his promise to fight corruption to fight crime as as you said that he has a game plan to do then\nWhen he wants to allow the public to bear arms at the moment it's very difficult to get a license he believes the police should have more leeway to use even more lethal force and they ... they were ready\nPeople hit David a stick of robberies and the sky high ... yet the prospect of more guns and more police violence those are concerns a lot of people because a lot of innocent bystanders wind up getting hurt or killed\nAnd I found out about that concerned when I visited a federal court or senior last night which is a sprawling low income neighborhood in Rio and I spoke to

challenge to serve as a chancellor for the past Thirteen Years and as head of her party for the last Eighteen but that it was time to to move his side to listen to what citizens had to stay a and and that is that they have a lack of faith and her government um and so she is stepping aside to make room for the next generation\nY feel like I'm you and I have talked um countless times of America on

dogged her and her party and her allies ah especially\nAh the the most recent ones we can talk about her last night's election or or yesterday's election I should say and has to do which is where

have gone down I mean this is something that is definitely going to send a very strong ripple effect across Europe people or\nAre they knew this was coming but again she had never announced that until today so this is going to make it very difficult for Brussels for example to push through its plans to try and integrate the union more\nUh this is probably not going to help the the burns it situation does negotiate that are going on I mean she is the strongest leader there and she's also been someone who's helped forge consensus and she's in an incredibly weaken position now even though technically what she's saying is this isn't going to happen until twenty Twenty one you know she's not going to seek re election until ... in twenty Twenty one and that she's\nBasically going to
