nearly a year ago NPR's Tom Bowman was in the Syrian city when he spoke to our colleague Steve Inskeep\nThe soccer stadium right in downtown Roger and this is\nSuch stadium that ISIS used to jail people for executions as world beheadings and it's interesting that now the stadium is being rebuilt to be used for an actual soccer stadium now how\nIs the city different than it was when you were there earlier leave here shortly after it was captured from ISIS for Steve Rogers seems to be coming back for whites defies that there's still a lot of rubble removal being done for the other streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available\nDone for the streets are pretty clear\nClean water is widely available now some electricity is coming back it was really interesting is a lot more shops are open it's kinda bustling in a way for what's curious to the shops are open on the first floors of a lot of buildings it's sort of a skeleton of the building and a lot of rubble just above the shop\nAnd they said there were more than five hundred homes have been cleared of booby traps and more and more kids are going back to school but there's still an enormous need for health officials say\nThey need hundreds of millions of dollars from the international community or just for the basic sort of water or electricity and so forth are people\nReturning home people who had fled the city or fled Syria entirely\nYou know a lot more people are coming home and the interesting thing is it's straining the services now but people are going back into their homes\nYou'll drive these streets so look can fully ducks away from the damage from the air strikes ISIS blowing buildings out and you'll see your family actually walking into their homes the city was roughly two hundred and twenty thousand before the war and now it's around a hundred and sixty thousand but people are coming back\nSo there are Syrian forces aligned with the United states to control that part of the country do they have enough territory that it can govern itself it can run itself even though it is still obviously very separate from the parts of Syria controlled by Bashar al Assad\nThey can sort of govern themselves are sitting on local councils they're creating sort of local security forces to patrol the area so it really is sort of a little oasis here in Syria far away from Assad and his forces\nAnd where does the United states fit into all of this President Trump canceled two hundred million dollars in aid for Syria\nRight and there was a big topic when we talk to the council some of them are really upset and that it was roughly fifty percent of the usa for returning these basic services and some of them wonder if the U.S going to stay with us so they're going to support us in the years ahead and what's interesting Steve is when the president cut that money\nThey had to basically stop some of the programs here in Raqqa searches bomb removal and also education programs and that really worried a lot of people and it was only fifty million dollars from the United Arab Emirates that got these programs rolling again\nNow President Trump said Saudi Arabia as pledge a hundred million dollars to the relief effort but that money has not shown up yet and here's the bottom line with that Steve\nIf you don't provide people with the basic needs for living resentment will grow people become more desperate and radicalized and ISIS already is trying to slip back into Iraq or in other liberated areas trying to recruit and they still have money to pets around so um there's a concern that\nISIS could continue to come back if the rebuilding effort doesn't continue\nNPR's Tom Bowman is in Iraq and Syria thanks very much Tom your workers do [noise]\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News

think ... you know many of whom I gave us two options either be a victim and don't do anything or become a protectionist in the lives of these kids\nI talked with William Kramer about his reporting earlier this week\nCan you introduce us to the women you met so you go to a break now to try to follow up on the children who were born out of the week a crisis and you meet this network of mother\nYeah that's right I mean it was a it was quite remarkable because they they are overwhelmingly from very poor backgrounds on educated men even very young as well mothers so they did have a hard time I'm typing with what happened\nBut they certainly didn't come across as victims to me when I went over that um they were very very they were very tight group lost his solidarity very determined women some of them I'm wearing caged in you know political campaigning\nUm they certainly didn't take any known since from us that it was a song or a degree of skepticism towards the ... they feel like the press was involved in their lives and then kind of just forgot about them um they are pretty skeptical about don't too as well which is kind of common to special needs parents\nSo

most of those ... about three hundred and twenty children most of us children probably died very soon off the bus\nOr a few of them are cut things I checked infections through breathing food in when they were learning to wean but on the other hand there are children who are actually doing pretty well I mean this is actually this is one of the things that fascinated me the most is\nThat there were very mixed group of children so there was some children's you can walk to can stand there is some children who got what we can talk\nI'm Still may be a little bit behind ... you know at the at that age but then there are other children who you know they can't roll over and that the fed through achieve into that tell me that that much much more um you know just save old\nSome of the children who were more physically disabled actually cognitively less on some of the children who are more cognitively disabled cannot stand up and and walk around it's an incredibly makes saying\nI'm not so much so that you actually tell the story of twins or a girl who was born with a virus and her brother did not with matter of fact it\nYeah it was you had this job little ... minutes of a chore issue was

expect it to an offer a boy to act [noise]\nJumping up and down and climbing on his mom and I know I Know this kind of thing um so they didn't really understand they didn't know why it affected one
