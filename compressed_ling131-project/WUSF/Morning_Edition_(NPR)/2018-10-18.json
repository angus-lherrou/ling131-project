Sally and Democrat cure stint cinema [noise]\nTravel it's super politically active\nSee the regional director for the Arizona federation of Republican win in the end of member of the Pima County Republican women's\nBut today she's at a pizza restaurant in ... Arizona have lunch with another Republican when Andrew\nOn I got scared I'm child these ladies that hand like a lot of Republican when she had her own feelings on the same logic for decades they I don't know I feel they should put it that really feel should put up to that I can tell when she was an issue\nHer at odds with leaks out who has said she believes Ford is an assault victims still prevalent is firmly on the mic Sally [noise] and she thinks the Ford Kavanaugh hearings have amped up enthusiasm in her party\nI think it helped to Italy but I think it has played on both sides [noise]\nI'm not saying one side more than the other because I'm hearing from our side [noise] how does the Republican protest we go to the vote we put money down all of that\nIs one reason why Jim filled with phone banking for Democrats here and send them on one night last week to stave off any Republican\nSearching as well a lot of my friends are progressive those jobs are going to do everything they can reflect IRAs and while he hasn't seen evidence of the cabinet\nEverything they can die or\nAnd while he hasn't seen evidence of the cabinet controversy boosting turnout he has seen it inching Democrats into becoming\nEven more engaged wedges made it even more [noise]\nI'm not sure if it's said okay we're going to vote but now I I'm\nI'm definitely a vote what else can I\nCan maybe getting more fired up now but there was already plenty of democratic fury almost two years worth of it and democratic strategist Andy bars things his party's anger has much more staying power\nThey will tend to do stuff out of anger and like I think are sort of more than enough of that and the ...\nFor whatever anger the Democrats in Arizona might be feeling over the cabinet controversy send them on the Democratic candidate doesn't sound outraged cinema has focused a lot of her rhetoric around process like the FBI investigation affords claims\nWhen I learned that we were not going to get access to the report I was very disappointed I think many Americans were\nSo I was forced to make a decision without being able to see that report\nForced to make a decision that's a far cry from other Democrats who have emphasized that they believe Kavanaugh had assaulted forward right now the races in a dead heat polling shows and I'm a slight lead on mic Sally has narrowed in the last couple of weeks Republican strategist John Seton things cabin all played a part in that trend\nReally what I think it did do is somewhat anyway galvanize go center right and Republican voters to come home if you will and make sure that they mail their ballots vote for the Republican ticket\nBut especially with the candidates and their allies sticking to other areas like immigration and health care as well as personal attacks democratic strategist bars says it's hard to say that the confirmation hearings are what narrow that gap\nThe undecided group typically more Republican and they always start to come home or at around you know weaker to balance\nIn a debate this week both candidates chose not to weaponize the Kavanaugh fight too much while the president has gone so far as to call for Jackie stations a hoax mix Sally focused her criticism on Democrats and activists not foreign herself\nWe understand the mob rule in Washington DC and and the and Arizona's wanted a yes vote on justice Cavanaugh I can be for survivor there's one myself and for justice Kavanaugh\nMeanwhile moderators had asked cinema multiple times before she'd say how she'd have voted\nWe still haven't got enough to know asked her from you out that way I Would have voted no I Would have to have an hour and I put out a statement saying such\nWhether the cabin all confirmation gave either campaign a
