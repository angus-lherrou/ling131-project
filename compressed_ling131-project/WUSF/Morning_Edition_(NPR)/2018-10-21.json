considers it was all to be an lightened is um [noise]\nUh that regulation that a lot of the things that are coming up people that's what needs to be done in fact it's not about ... herring like not about how do we whole I mean you said you know the question of how could repairs being made\nA lot of people find you know that their bibles are more useful in that sense and that government mhm\nMhm [noise] so that's a question okay what has the government doesn't feel that you know maybe they will point may be a\nIt hasn't lived up to its promise or maybe it's getting blamed some things that didn't do okay let's figure that out a terrible right back for public conversation about just that [noise]\nAll right spectacle public conversation about just that [noise] it is some of the government kind of um [noise]\nIn fact letting people down you know or are they expecting too much of it what's the record into a lot of talk about that specific yeah yeah\nThere's you know there's a paragraph

mhm\n[noise] you I'm and I'm strangers in their own land you near the end you say you write a letter to a friend on the liberal left you write a letter to Louisiana friends on argued say ... you know if you imagine if Iraq if I had a right to my friends in Louisiana and the writers are right to liberal friend I mean I there was a sentence and\nIn your letter to\nYour friends on the liberal left I just kind of humanizing and its provocative and human way consider as a possibility that in their situation you might end up closer to their perspective\nThat's it [laughter] I think I think that's true mhm that we are products of our own experience and what if you\nGrew up in a family um but so many said oh we were poor but we didn't know it had a great childhood but we were poor you know [laughter]\nUm okay what does that have been your experience and what if your dad's job and how much you earn was the central fact of your life you know and what if it was a blue collar job but you felt put down for doing that blue collar job\nNo [noise] I think\nThat there's something actually missing in the\nEntire vocabulary we have for talking about social class yeah 'cause I didn't go just to another region or two in people with different political views I went to a different social class\nAnd there is a lot of smearing\nOn the left off at the blue collar class and they don't live there serious said look we're the daily workers we're climbing the telephone pole ... repaired or telephone wire re paving roads were\nWho were you know to put that down and there's a lot of humble pie to each year\nAnd a I think it's a problem I didn't know when I set out that I Would come back and be as critical of ... a little cocoon I've long been here\nAs I Am kind of you know it's not only a a contempt that really bothers me now whenever I hear it or see it um\nAnd that and buried to some degree but there's a kind of a reluctance to to reach out since ...\nA reluctance to to reach out since this\nOn the left there's a lot of good political will but it's gotten curled up in\nOn ... and become a kind of self monitoring program oh you said this wrong on instead of reaching out to build coalitions and we're a big country not ruin like everyone's like them\nOr we need our sturdy coalition said and I think\nLabor unions when the labor movement was much larger him and [noise] there there was a way that people of\nDifferent colors in class who's got together and we knew we had a compulsory draft right right look different colors and then in classes got together natural way they're going to be theory on each other you know\nPublic school systems um bought were down on those [noise]\nThose crossover connective institutions I think we need to build another one I Would like to see a civil service you know one year required of every one\nOf every one where a very yeah yeah everyone can you go to a different reach ... get to know people getting first of all get to know how to\nTreat people respectfully and listen to actively be immediate everybody should learn those skills and then go cross a to see if we can rebuild votes that connective tissue yeah [noise]\nI'm I'm sure people are said to you and I I I I came to this conversation myself that um\n[noise] this critique that [laughter]\nThey're all kinds of groups of people including like people of color um who have long felt like strangers in their own land in this country and they ran this late right in this yeah yes and especially now yet again and change its when white people\nThat you know the critiques that white people wake up to this phenomenon when it's about other white people\nUm how do you have you work with that in your mind\nIs true and I think it's a it's an important insight\nYes I I think it's an excellent point okay I mean for example the opiate addiction problem has has been oh now they're called a disease of despair which is kind of a compassionate way crack\nEpidemic with no yeah yeah oh whereas the crack epidemic in the inner cities with chip blacks ah wasn't it was criminalized timely yeah yeah that's right now in worse [noise]\nSo and so it's a point is that should be broadly received\nMhm [noise] so and when it draws closer suspension such a big wonderful conversation I'm just kind of curious about that you say somewhere that\nThe English language doesn't give us many words to describe the feeling of reaching out to someone from another world and ... and I ...
