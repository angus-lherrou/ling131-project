Liberian curled its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe had thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which in a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lawyer\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go like on the street selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girls are still on the streets when her dream is to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by ProPublica and time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man who was a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with this charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what's up more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me I'm particularly for undercut the mile or hugging incredible ability to connect with those recruits commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story but will really engage with hearts but will make people reach into their pocket and think that they individually but ... that are making a difference\nSo who is Katie ... why did you start this organization\nCan be ... a woman from New Jersey who cut along but growing in doing various forms of gift community help volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on on events\nVolunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on on evangelical internship and then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight\n[noise] she didn't have a lot of nonprofit management did she\nKnow and kicked him ... has been very clear and her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start that organization on the ground in Liberia are demanding Macintosh Johnson tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in adopting up of this organization he was a he was the guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nAnd he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was doing the domestic way that he was abusing these curled\nJohnson was heavily involved in their equipment the girls thought he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie my other and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within the scope of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and [noise]\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie minor the founder of the organization now what he was doing [noise]\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported their responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my allowed an intimate relationship with them but she's going to read it in an interview\nBut that same year and twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nDecides that she said something on the lines of you know I told her that she loves the children but she didn't really get it\nNow my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that jumps and had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said you fold up and she asked the girls themselves and they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he did trial if it's a hung jury and after that it was revealed that he had HIV rain\n[noise] while it was it was known by people within the organization and there were rumors it was never formally revealed that he had aids when he died\nAnd as a consequence you know potentially all of those who have contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also with the court documents and organizations internal documents was many many girls\nAnd more potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girls who actually testified in court those who actually were willing to bring a case they were retested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for that says\nYou know where are your school what are the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly fields that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this to be that it has been a net positive for ...\nNot turned a blind eye to this to be that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had from the charities leadership so there was this sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early pointed organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within the tuition and any other context\nAnd Liberia still allows the organization to operate schools there\nWell the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people that are involved in the building up as an organization like the local government to\n... mile or had strong support from first of all

is a charity that aims to educate and protect Liberian curls its founder is an American woman named Katie ...\nShe has thousands of social media followers they're mile or tell stories about life in West point which is a slum in Liberia's capital stories like the one about a girl named Abigail here's my lower\nA little girl in Liberia who doesn't have a mom or dad I'll go down the street selling herself at eleven years old because she didn't have a glass of clean water there should be no girls on the streets when her dream is to go to school but according\nThree minutes to go to school\nBut according to a report just released by pro public at in time magazine some of the girls that more than me was supposed to be helping were victimized they were raped by a man with a staff member with the charity Rachel Martin spoke with Finley young who wrote the story\nBefore we get into what went wrong with that charity more than me I Want to ask what was going right what is that more than me apart from other charities at the beginning\nI think that more than me and particularly its founder Katie mile or had an incredible ability to connect with those who could commit money or resources to their mission\nAnd I think that in a way this is a story about about social media on about how you present the story level really engage with hearts bubble make people reach into their pockets and think that the individually by taking a small step or making a difference\nSo who is Katie mylar why did you start this organization\n... a woman from New Jersey who had along background in doing various forms of gift community help and volunteer work who ended up in Liberia in two thousand and six on an evangelical internship\nAnd then from there she continued her relationship with the country and she started ... first registered in two thousand and eight [noise]\nShe didn't have a lot of nonprofit management ditching\nKnowing kitty ... has been very clear in her own promotion of the organization that what she brought to this wasn't incredible depths of love it's a love driven organization\nHer co founder a man who really helped her start this organization on the ground in Liberia or the maddening Macintosh Johnston tell us about him\nI never met Macintosh Johnson but he was someone who is fundamental in starting up of this organization he was a he was a guy who had had a childhood interrupted by war who told numerous people he'd be a child soldier\nUm and then in in West point had also been part of the vigilante groups which is a a group of you know community members who in the absence of of police um you know help to provide those kind of that kind of support to the community so he was a well known guy in the eighty of West point where he operated he was well liked\nWhen he became very highly trusted really very very quickly\n[noise] can you explain exactly what he was stealing the economic way that he was abusing these girls\nJohnson was heavily involved in their equipment to girls and he was the point person for the organization in West point it was viewed as his organization along with Katie my either and he was using that power according to what the girls told the court to abuse those who are within the scope of power\nAccording to what they told the court girls as young as ten years old I'm were exploited on numerous occasions and [noise]\nAnd when they talk to the court they all said that well he he threatened to remove me from the scholarship\nDid Katie ... the founder of the organization now what he was doing [noise]\nWell that's something that we ask Katie and something that we've reported our responses in the piece one detail of this which also helped in power Johnson was the fact that my mother had an intimate relationship with them but she conceded in an interview\nBut that same year and twenty eleven there was some form of conversation takes place which involves Johnson's ex wife who\nWho says that she said something along the lines of you know I told her that she loves the children but she didn't she didn't really get it\nNow my lower recounts that conversation differently she'd Harrods she described I think there's rumors that jumps than had been in sexual relationships with young girls and but she said she fold up and she asked the girls themselves when they said that that he was a good man\nThere's a second level of tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson wants\nThe tragedy to the story in that after Macintosh Johnson was arrested he stood trial it was a hung jury and after that it was revealed that she had HIV right\nWhile it was it was known by people within the organization on the rumors it was never formally revealed that he had it when he died\nOn other consequence you know potentially all of those two have contact with them which according to reports on to our reporting and also to court documents and organizations internal documents\nWith many many girls him or potentially at risk now it's important to say that the ten girl who actually testified in court those who actually we're going to bring a case they were re tested and one of them tested positive\n[noise] it's so complicated right because as you outlined in the piece Katie ... at one point to you in a bottle to whether or not her organization was responsible for that says\nYou know where are your schools what are the schools that you have dealt in Liberia she clearly fields that even if her organization willfully or not turned a blind eye to this abuse that it has been a net positive for the girls have Liberia\nYeah I think that you can see in in a lot of the responses we had in the charities leadership so there was a sense of why are you telling the story you know look at these other girls that we've educated\nBut I think that to to view this as you know just a an unavoidable thing that happened in the early points of the organization it just that's not a logic that we'd applied to to sexual abuse within an institution and any other context\nAnd Liberia still allowed the organization to operate schools there\nWell the story is really hard in Liberia because of course a lot of people that are involved in the\nBuilding up as an organization like the local government to ... mile or had strong support from first of all from the president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf\nAnd then also the local local donor community I think I'm a local community or the sense of\nA lot of people have a feeling that something going wrong in this in this organization but didn't know the ... so there's a whole lot of soul searching going on on the government has not stuff flew investigation involving seven different ministry they've said that they are looking into reopening the case [noise]\nUm um they're looking as well as more technical stuff like well how do we how what's the process for credit than these organizations have we help them accountable they're looking into whether they charge ... policy was was followed and the school\nThat was Finley young for pro public or talking to Rachel Martin that story was published Katie my lawyer has temporarily stepped
