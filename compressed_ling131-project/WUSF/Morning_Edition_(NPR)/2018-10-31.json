I Believe that she experienced what she says she experience but I don't know that I Believe that it was Kevin not and I there was just not quite enough\nEvidence brought forward for me to fully believe that yes this man committed this crime so I don't know who to believe but I don't think that we should put this guilt on someone when we we just don't know [noise]\nSo how how does that affect how you vote it's made me uncertain I think the way that the liberal party at least from what I've seen in the media has been handling it\nWith you know chasing after people and and restaurants and yelling at people and and it just seems like a lot of\nBullying and and I guess some people would disagree with me and said that it's no that's activism but I think with everybody just yelling at each other we're not really getting anywhere you don't think the right has participated in that same vilification of the other side\nI think they have I I think they're equal problems on both sides because you hear the right calling the left snowflake said and you know they're just whining about these issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally\nThese issues and and I I think it comes from both sides but I haven't personally seen it on the left like this up until this past year\nWhat do you think about President Trump I'm not a fan I voted for if I ever Clinton I I don't like Trump I think you know going back to the calving our questions I think what he said about Dr Ford was horrendous\nI guess I I don't feel like I'm afraid of him as much as the liberal party feels like they're afraid of him and not afraid just angered\nI guess I feel I feel more passive because I'm tired of it\nSo you are still considering your choices but what I hear you saying is that you would perhaps vote for Republicans for the first time despite President Trump correct and because it's more than that it's I Would rather look at things issue by issue\nAnd decide based on that rather than based on\nStrictly party lines and rather than going out and filling out all of the Democratic checked boxes I I Want to feel like I've done my due diligence in at least gone through and and considered the other side so yes I Would consider voting for a Republican and upcoming election [noise]\nHave you talk to your family about your about your evolution\nI have been avoiding it\nYou know prior to this conversation I decided well I'm yeah I suppose I should let them know before they hear it on the radio and I I don't think that they would ever think less of me they're very very accepting people although they might hear me say things and go why would you say that so I just\nIt's it's taken me some time because I'm Still trying to work it out myself so [noise]\nI'll do my research and whoever I think is you know best for the job then you know that's where I'll put my check mark and that's where all focus my optimism Alexa groom and they get so much for talking with us and thank you I'm\nIn ... ... and\nThis is NPR News and this is W.

often don't understand the motive that is not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh\nAccording to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism but critics say he has to visit rhetoric contributes to a climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assessments that argument\nAnti Semitism is the ideology that Jews are mobile level it out to control the world Jeffrey her for his story of the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operated behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nDon't go to first and only go so I don't get paid by Soros or somebody\nThat from a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish does that mean that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Geoffrey ... read any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nCan't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another doesn't bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run\nBumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says he's deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as he did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere the smartest talking about they talk about the lead given these elite you are the LA [noise]\nHalf says when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether it's Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in law are Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that is the editor in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guys semi who might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and urge them on and it's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism\nWhatever the reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply over the last two years Tom Gjelten NPR News [noise]\nThis is the time of year when once bacon stores take on a temporary new life is Halloween or Christmas shops that temporary model is becoming an increasingly popular marketing strategy and not just for the holidays from member station WBHM easy in Chicago's Suzie on reports\nAt a pop up Halloween store in downtown Chicago shoppers are trying

it's expected to generate\nNine billion dollars this year and pop shops are all about getting some of that retail dollar Courtland ... general manager of Chicago costume\nWhen people are looking to get costumes we want to be where they are you know it is a very delicate balance for small business like ours the cost of doing business can be quite high so we have to make very good and thought out choices\nHe says in the past they've opened as many as eat pop up shops but this year they only have one he says they're facing more retail competition in getting squeezed by more expensive short term rent many landlords to shine short term leases that is the short with commercial real estate service Jay allows says that view appears to be changing\nI definitely think it's a benefit um it really allows a lamb or to activate the storefront in activating storefront in any way is always a good thing Halloween shops you know they're fun they're positive they're engaging they attract families\nIn shorts notes that pop ups aren't just holiday themed anymore he points to online retailers and digital companies that are adopting the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nStopping the model to build their brand and interact with customers in person\nThey're using that pop up model to sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stores may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting it\nOne company helping them perfect model is New York based storefront think of it like the air being bea of commercial space is CEO Mohammed oh wash says everyone's using pop ups from small Internet retailers to large companies like Facebook\nWhich should also be pushed coming from ... regret and we walked in the ... and we've seen a lot of to the British you know like fingers and performers function that owned Brian\nHe says record labels have even set up pop up centered around a specific artist all washed as as recently as five years ago many landlords would rather sit on a vacant property for a year then entertain a short term lease but now he says more are seeing the upside of getting rent from a pop up store\nYou're changing the traditional model for long term is then you're ... a space which is getting booked every day or every week\nHe says in some cases the pop up render turns into a permanent tenant\nThere is a solution moved up right now the short term is and your doctor\nWhen it comes to pop ups landlords can charge higher rent in some cases making that more attractive than long term retail leases NPR News I'm

News I'm Steve Inskeep and I'm Rachel Martin when now shootings happen in this country we often don't ever understand the motive\nThat's not the case with last weekend shooting at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh according to court documents the alleged shooter said he wanted to kill Jewish people President Trump who visited the synagogue yesterday has repeatedly denounced anti Semitism\nBut critics say his division of rhetoric contributes to a climate in which anti Semitism can take root NPR's Tom Gjelten assesses that argument\nDoing some of them is the ideology the Jews are most liberal it out to control the world Jeffrey her for her story of at the University of Maryland throws the ideology depends on the ...\nA historian at the University of Maryland says the ideology depends on a certain type of argument a way of thinking most importantly a willingness to buy into conspiracy theory\nThe world is governed by small groups of people who operate behind the scenes and are enormously powerful and enormously evil\nThere's no question Donald Trump at times deploys conspiracy theories like TV networks and big newspapers produced fake news like the protesters they interview are actually hired by somebody like philanthropist George Soros\nDon't go to a person holding us I don't get paid by sorrows or somebody that\nFrom a rally earlier this month in Missoula, Montana\nNow George Soros happens to be Jewish and that means that President Trump is promoting anti Semitism seems unlikely a large segment of the Jewish population in this country supports him and his agenda especially on matters related to Israel\nBut Jeffrey her fire use that any promotion of conspiracy theories is dangerous because the logical conclusion of such thinking is anti Semitism\nI Can't think of conspiracy theory that at some point or another dozen bumped into the most famous conspiracy theory that the Jews run the world\nPurpose written extensively on the anatomy of anti Semitism another key element he says is deep distrust of intellectuals and the elite class in general again a biased Trump is personally promoted as they did in August speaking to a crowd in Ohio\nHere this modest me you know we're talking about they talk about the leaf you ever see the elite you are the late [noise]\nHalf says when people are encouraged to resent the elite Jews get nervous\nThat danger for the Jews is that we are very small in number but we are prominent whether Hollywood academia banking the print press\nAny connection of Donald Trump and his rhetoric to an environment in which anti Semitism grows is controversial his own daughter and son in law are Jewish and her is careful in what he says about Trump\nI think he loves his daughter and a lot of Jewish friends so I don't think that his intention is to bring harm to the Jewish people know\nSo then what's the connection\nHe wants to win and he has a special talent of knowing how to appeal to the resentments and hatred that if they end if in order to win he needs to fanned the flames of conspiracy then it's perfectly willing to do it\nTo be sure other factors may be at work behind any worsening anti Semitism like the growth of social media Nathan diamond is the director of public policy for the orthodox union representing Orthodox Jews\nYou can have individual and guy semi school might have been very isolated but now have these platforms when they find other people that share their views and urged them on and\nIt's fostered an accelerated a climate of heat and anti Semitism whatever\nThe reason it does seem to be an increasingly dangerous time for Jews the Anti Defamation league says the number of anti Semitic incidence has risen sharply over the last two years Tom

interact with customers in person\nAnd they're using that pop up model to sort of test the waters so I think that the Halloween stores may have invented it but some of these brands are perfecting
