sure he would die overnight they didn't even bother to pass on his medical chart to the day shift\nAnd the thing that's amazing is his talking to us and here's like being aware of what we were saying and yet then not knowing and not remembering any of that I Would say it ... we were at at the rehab how bad for weeks\nNow a decade later Richard Langford says he's still struggling to work its way

coming into the ICU\nWith a previously ... very well working brain and they leave critical care not being able to have a good conversation they can't balance a checkbook they can't\nFind the names of people at a party and they get very embarrassed when they start socially suck loading themselves are patients tell us what a misery this form of dementia is is it permanent\nIt's permanent in some we've been following people for over ten years now from the brain ICU study which we didn't hear at Vanderbilt and many of them a decade out still have elements of the dementia\nOverall he estimates that a third improve a third stay the same and the third end up on a slow decline for many the mental damages akin to a traumatic brain injury re Alzheimer's or even sometimes are farmers that solve\nThese problems are linked to the degree of leery um people experience well in the ICU ... says\nEvery day you're delirious you have about thirty five percent increased risk of this dimension so if you do the math on that three days of delivery him you got a almost a sure thing that you're going to have some elements of the dementia\nHe can't say exactly why the leery of leads to dementia but

spot in the world series a couple of the team's star players are Cuban now a new report in Sports Illustrated lays out the ...\nTeams star players are Cuban now a new report in Sports Illustrated lays out the dubious ways that some of those players make it to the U.S\nThe Dodgers have long had a very rich pipeline to the Caribbean and to Cuba and one document that we cited in the in the article they at some point had an internal ranking system of just how corrupt some of their own scouts were\nAs I executive editor John ... says that at one point the Dodgers called one of their own employees unbelievably corrupt or if I'm told me that in order to get access to top baseball talent in Cuba teams often goes through agents called boost counties\nThe ... is a middleman base in Latin America who essentially takes equity stakes in prospects sometimes it can be forty fifty sixty percent of future earnings but for prospects desperate enough that's a that's a risk to undertake\nAnd now it might be a legal risk according to Sports Illustrated the Justice Department is investigating whether some teams broke federal corruption laws to sign Cuban players\nExtraction of Cuban players has always been shrouded in mystery in baseball but this evidence that the FBI was presented with and we were as well indicates that uh the complicity runs potentially to teams and agents as well as the middle man that ... that have always been implicated in this\nAnd basically impossible for a baseball player in Cuba to find his way into the the major leagues without help from one of these middle man\nIt's very difficult part of that is\nBecause of the embargo with Cuba and a player must establish residency in another country usually in the Caribbean or Mexico before coming to the U.S [noise] so what you have is a network of the street level agents that really have been operating outside of anything that the u._s. or major league baseball has ... over\nSo you obtained these documents that are you today offer a window into how baseball teams operate in Latin America especially in Cuba can you explain what you found and what is ...\nWe were given hundreds and hundreds of pages of documents that were also turned over to the the FBI just off the air and what it shows is that\nTeams and agents have what seems pretty clear from the documents any way on a level of complicity and in some cases that's scouts on the take and in some cases that is about helping to arrange documents using outside counsel to\nEssentially falsified documents and one does think that this is something that could implicate teams in major league baseballs and institution which is something that hasn't really happened before this is the first time so far as we can tell where you have this level of documentation\nClearly I mean as you've articulated this has been somewhat of an open secret for for generations really but now that you have the documents that allegedly showed some of this a dubious recruiting behavior do you watch these players on these games differently\n[noise] it's interesting as applied with this information you do watch these games and some of these players differently you realize that the story of the extraction is often a lot more complex than if perhaps portrayed as being and you also wonder about the economics but again a lot of these players are not operating under the standard\nRates for agents you know four or five percent agent fee if not applying in a lot of these cases and to me one thing you think about it is just how many people along the way how many institutions even have profited by these players making it to the major leagues\nDown over time of Sports Illustrated and we have to sixty minutes John thanks for sharing your reporting on

at Vanderbilt and many of them a decade out still have elements of the dementia\nOverall he estimates that a third improve a third stay the same and the third end up on a slow decline for many the mental damages akin to a traumatic brain injury we all timers or even sometimes are farmers that solve\nThese problems are linked to the degree of leery um people experience well in the icy you usually says\nEvery day you're delirious you have about thirty five percent increased risk of this dimension so if you do the math on that three days of delivery him you got a almost a sure thing that
