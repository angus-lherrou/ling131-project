propose the voting rights act you outlined some of the bill's provisions finally this legislation\nYou outlined some of the bill's provisions\nForeign reverse legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not\nProhibited from voting\nBut even though when it comes to voter registration laws there is a good deal of confusion and in some cases controversy here's Noel King with commentator Cokie Roberts who answers your questions about our politics or the government work\nAhead of this year's election some states have already closed voter registration while others states allow people to register at their polling places on election day what is the deal with the patchwork system one of the bill to jail All right here's our first listener question\nCraving a heart from San Francisco California I'd like to ask Cokie whether voter registration laws were controversial before the voting rights act in Nineteen sixty five how last changed for print court granted black citizens' direct vote have white ... barriers to voter registration\nThe basic answer is yes voter registration laws were controversial uh at first people staffing the polls were just expected to know everybody didn't in their neighborhood but then in Eighteen hundred Massachusetts instituted the first voter registration\nAnd ... century moved on it became more widespread partly in a move to make sure that non citizen immigrant didn't vote by the late Nineteen the early ... centuries a rural dominated state legislatures impose registration on city voters again it was named immigrants and at fraud by big city political machine\nWhat about the the rest of her question there what about the effects on black citizens versus white citizen\n[noise] well of course black men were given the right to vote and the fifteenth amendment in Eighteen Seventy but at the Jim Crow laws in the south effectively stripped African Americans of their voting rights in terms of white of course white women and black\nWomen couldn't vote nationally until the nineteenth amendment and Nineteen twenty but you know before the sixty five bill a lot of whites in the south couldn't vote either just because they registrars in frozen the roles they didn't want anybody new voting\nAll right we have a couple of questions about current controversies my name is Rachel ... from Shaker Heights Ohio why is the candidate for governor allowed to purge the voter rolls shouldn't he recused himself from secretary of state while he's a candidate\nBy them this is a reference to Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp who is the current secretary of state and this and thinking about recusing himself he's provoked a lawsuit by buddy more than fifty thousand new voter applications on hold for minor inconsistencies\nThe lawsuit charges discrimination saying eighty percent of those applicants are members of racial minority groups\nSo they can't vote early or by mail they can still vote if they show up the right polling place with the proper ID\nOkay that that idea of proper ID that gets right to our next question Hi my name is Amy pigment chart and I live in Omaha Nebraska\nWhen I heard about the Supreme Court ruling the ideas for voting would need to have a street address it didn't faze me and I heard that a lot of Native Americans on reservations only have a post office address how is that going to affect their ability to vote\nWhile they're complaining about it this has to do with the recent Supreme Court decision upholding in North Dakota voter id law does require a current residential street address Native American groups say that off and on reservations they don't have those and pointing I see irony that the nation's original residents are being questioned about their residency\nVery dark irony thanks so much Cokie good to talk to you\nKnow the Roberts ...\nYou're going to ask Cokie your questions about politics from a government by emailing us\nAt our

a lot of it is a there was lots of excitement about the election but also lots of concern and worry\nPartly because of threats by the Taliban which has now come true uh and partly\nWidespread of

an anxiety at the same time\nSo you've been reporting that in Kandahar Province of really large an important province the voting will be delayed for a week brokers does raise a question what is
