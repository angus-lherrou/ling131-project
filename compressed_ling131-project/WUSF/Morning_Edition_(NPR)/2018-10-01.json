Aubrey NPR News okay if you're looking for a\nCheaper health insurance and you can currently find on the individual market a whole host of new options will become available starting tomorrow this is due to a change the ... the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are a niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nSimply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but during the Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage [noise]\nMore than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nPay for it but there's no government help for short term plans the new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which badger says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk\nPeople who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need to use much medical care they may still want to back up they may want something and they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want and for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to your medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage\nThat's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules they don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that the ... met\nOr people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs\nThese policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live in the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover and\nWhat they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people\nAlison Kodjak NPR News

is the land of equal opportunity but that depends on exactly where in America you live it's often said that you can predict the future as as many kids by finding out that ZIP Code where they grow up\nAnd online data to all being made public today let you see for yourself the link between where you are and the American dream Here's NPR's John Ydstie\nEconomists Dr ... has been worried about the fading American Dream for years he's crunch the numbers and they're troubling if you were born in the Nineteen forties or fifties he says you were virtually guaranteed to achieve the American dream of earning more than your parents did but you\nSee that for kids turning thirty today who were born in the mid Nineteen eighties only fifty percent of them go on to earn more than their parents did better to coin flip as to whether you are now going to achieve the American dream\nChatty and his colleagues that opportunity insights to research and Policy Institute located at Harvard water improved those odds\nSo they've partnered with the U.S Census Bureau to develop an online program it works a lot like a Google Map you can see the whole country or you can zoom in to local neighborhoods and you can click on a neighborhood and get an immense amount of data from incomes and racial makeup to marriage figures\nWe were able to pinpoint you know what are the places where we're seeing lots of kids climbing the income let our border of the places where the outcomes don't look as good and we put this all out in the form of a publicly available interactive tool called the opportunity outlets but we hope\nCitizens local policymakers nonprofits people working on these issues can use to make better decisions\nYou found that moving out of a neighborhood with poor upward mobility to a better one increases lifetime earnings\n... with poor upward mobility do a better one increases lifetime earnings for low income kids by an average of two hundred thousand dollars of course moving a lot of people these impractical so the focus is on helping low performing areas improve\nCharlotte North Carolina has gotten the head start on this effort back in twenty fourteen chatty and his colleagues found Charlotte was dead lashed out of fifty cities at providing upward mobility for low income kids that shocked many residents\nIf you knew anything about Charlotte Charlotte wants to be number one\nOphelia ... brown a prominent Charlotte physician so that ranking ran counter to Charlotte's image of itself as that's driving banking center with an expanding high tech sector and a city that's been a leader in job creation and wage growth over the past two decades\nOut what surprised that we had done poorly I've been up for this issue for a lot of years work with people who live in poverty so I saw\nWhat she saw was segregated city where a low income black residents especially faced little chance of moving up the economic ladder\nCarmen brown joined an effort by the foundation for the Carolinas to address the problem\nThe group identified early childhood development college and career readiness families stability and strong social networks as key factors that enhanced upward mobility it singled out segregation as a key obstacle\nAnd now Charlotte officials are learning to use the opportunity to effectively target some remedies things like pre K programs and affordable housing\nSo I have that here right now it's just kind of a share of math median income in Charlotte put\nA lot of Williams from the Chinese team and demonstrating the opportunity outlets for a group that includes the local officials zooms into Charlotte in clicks on neighborhoods if the area is reddish brown it signals low levels of upward mobility if it's green or blue it has higher opportunity\nFor the outcome for children who grew up in different tracks in Charlotte Frank\nFlorence is the chief equity officer for Charlotte Mecklenburg school he says the jewel has already exceeded his expectations I think the key thing that has happened is\nThat the fathers for the Carolinas have brought a lot of partners to the table to think about how to act on these data I think that's the power it's in the community collaboration in the community partnership\nCharlotte's effort to improve upward mobility is already taking shape at ... field middle school it's located in a majority white maybe not far from downtown Charlotte\nBut assistant principal Eric ... says the schools students are mostly\nBlack and Hispanic so we got forty eight point nine percent are Hispanic forty four point five percent are African American four percent are white\nIt's not unusual for a public school in Charlotte to have a student body this larger minority\nThat's because many white students attend private schools or public schools outside their neighborhoods that segregation hinders upward mobility James e for the former North Carolina teacher of the year is working with such fields administration to make the school more racially balanced\nFor now an education consultant says to local elementary schools have already emerged for that reason\nEventually something someone who's going to pay the demographics you are going to shift a quite a bit this majority black and brown now but when in the coming years that it changes it started to look more like the neighborhood\nThere's another challenge here beyond segregation it's the lack of social networks minority children need to succeed the ... neighborhood is more affluent than a nearby majority black neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows\nBlack neighborhood called south side park but the opportunity outlets shows African American boys growing up in that field in the Nineteen eighties and nineties are now doing worse than their counterparts from South side park Ford says that might surprise some people\nWe may soon because the areas of flu like that's a high opportunity area when the truth is that may not be a high opportunity area according John metrics that we're looking at\nIn this case it may be that the majority black neighborhood of south side park offers young black man this social networks friends extended family churches that help them get ahead those kinds of networks might not be accessible to them in a majority white neighborhood\nFord said the opportunity atlas should help reduce misconceptions about economic mobility\nThis permit started making really smart really intentional decision so that twenty Thirty years not allowed to

University in Japan he's Seventy six now you know how some years the Nobel Prize comes with a complete surprise itself not this year these names are on just about everybody shortly\nOK so not such a big shock but what exactly did these two scientists do\nWell I'll start with Jim Allison and back in the Nineteen nineties who was working at UC Berkeley and he was studying the immune system that's the system that keeps us healthy by attacking threats like bacteria viruses and even cancer so I came across a part of the immune system that actually hold the system and check sort of think of them is the brakes on the immune system\nAnd it occurred to him that if he could release the brakes may be the immune system would be more effective and attacking cancer\nAnd that indeed turned out to be the case his observations led to in fact what's been called the revolution and cancer treatment it would lead to a whole new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors you may have heard of that we talked about them a fair amount on our airplanes and today they're used in melanoma lung cancer a whole bunch of other cancers and the list is growing and growing and growing\nOkay so that's Jim Alice and the other scientists who's winning that's word ... how do you have any you know that him\nA hundred work independently of Jim Alison but he was also exploring the same biology molecules that put the brakes on the immune system response\nAnd he came across another set of molecules that do the same thing in his discovery he discovered these molecules called pd one and ... one of which have become prime targets for these checkpoint inhibitor drugs\nOne example one of these drugs that you may have heard about is a drug called ... notes that goes on a attacks these things so it was a very similar line of reasoning and sort of biology but he found a different set of of of targets to attack and in some ways are more effective target\nSo fascinating so how did these two independent but related discoveries ended up changing how ... how we think about ...\nWell before the so I just made their discoveries cancer treatment was focused not entirely but more or less on killing or removing cancer cells and tumors so that could be with chemotherapy or surgery or radiation\nAnd all these treatments are still used and in many cases are still very effective treatments but there are many instances in which they don't work and these new checkpoint inhibitors have opened up the entire new realm of cancer treatment they are particularly effective\nTo get way to get the body's own defenses to fight back more effectively and the whole world of immunotherapy is now really the driving force behind drug development\nThese rights I mean we hear a lot of immunotherapy how effective are these new therapies that is what if one really wants\nTo know why it went and that's an evolving issue in many cases they succeed when conventional therapies of failed\nAnd some people had remarkable recovery remember president former President Jimmy Carter and I was a great example of that he had a checkpoint inhibitor to treat melanoma in this recovery was spectacular\nBut it's also the case that they are not the cure for most of the patient to take these drugs but researchers are now working on combinations are combining checkpoint inhibitors with conventional chemotherapy or to improve outcomes\nTo very exciting area of research but clearly there's a lot more to do this is not the end of\nThe ... okay NPR science correspondent Richard Harris with us Nobel winners thank you

options will become available starting tomorrow that they do to change the Trump Administration is making to insurance regulations but buyer beware with lower prices come fewer benefits Here's NPR's Alison Kodjak\nThey're known as short term limited to ration health plans and the idea is to give people who think Affordable Care act policies are too expensive or don't think they're worth it a different option\nThese are a niche product always have been\nThat started badger a visiting fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation in Washington\nIt's simply another choice for consumers that for many ah is more affordable than the other products with them on the individual marketplace\nShort term health insurance isn't new it's there for many years that stopgap coverage for people who are say between jobs are just out of college but they're Obama administration the plans were limited to just Ninety Days\nNow the Trump Administration is expanding access so that people who don't want to pay for insurance that meets Affordable Care act standards or who don't qualify for subsidies confined coverage\nMore than eighty percent of people who buy insurance on the a C a exchanges get subsidies to help pay for it but there's no government help for short term plans\nThe new rules allow people to buy a policy that last year and they can renew two times which badger says is a good option\nInstead of remaining uninsured to have a product that makes sense for them\nBut Alison Hofmann with the University of Pennsylvania law school says this insurance may have a role but it comes with a risk people who think that they're healthy they're unlikely to need\nTo use much medical care they may still want a backstop they may want something\nAnd they made by these plans thinking that they're going to get them what they want\nAnd for some people that could be true and for others when they actually go to use medical care or if they get sick or if they're in an accident they'll find that they don't really have very much health insurance coverage that's because the short term policies don't have to meet the Affordable CARE Act rules\nThey don't have to cover people with ongoing health problems and usually cover fewer services than required under the CIA\nPolicies may cost as little as Seventy five dollars a month but they often carry big deductibles more than ten thousand dollars on some and they may not cover things like prescriptions or mental health care and generally they only pay about half of any medical bill after that deductible has met or people have something called health insurance\nBill after that deductible has met or people have something called health insurance um but it doesn't necessarily pay for all of their health needs these policies are regulated at the state level and some states have banned them altogether so your options will look different depending on where you live\nIn the new rules say insurance companies have to be very clear about what the policies cover\nAnd what they leave out the government estimates about six hundred thousand people may buy short term insurance next year and after five years that market could grow to about one point two million people Alison Kodjak NPR News [noise]\nSupport for your health comes from exact science is offering color guard for average risk adults over fifty a non invasive colon

had only been in session for a couple weeks last year Hurricane Irma arrived in Florida\nThe brunt of its damage focusing on the keys it took weeks before all of the counties schools reopened a year later reporter Nancy cleaner talks with Monroe County superintendent mark Porter about how the district is doing now\nDo we have a teacher shortage now because of the housing situation and the keys is so difficult especially after Irma\nEvery principal can tell you a story about the individual who they have recruited interviewed selected a new teacher for Monroe County only to have them back out of that offer or decline that offered in very openly stating that the lack of affordable housing was really the number one problem\nSo what is the district doing to address that issue well\nWe're kinda dipping into in the water first of all with a a a potential uh\nEmployee housing effort on our property a true to law school there happens to be a piece of property where we have perhaps more property than we actually need for the functioning of the school at its current capacity and so we're trying to develop a relatively small employee housing proposals that are well\nDevelop a relatively small employee housing proposals that we'll we'll see if this is the kind of thing that employees are interested in I think that's always the the other part about it\nI don't know that employers always wanted to live in the housing that's provided by their employer we continue to emphasize programs where we can grow our own teachers because we know that sometimes bringing people here doesn't work as well as we might hope or think guys I always say to people the reality of living in the keys is a very different than the dream\nWhat are the big lessons you think the school district learned from Herman how will you prepare and respond differently next time\nDefinitely you can always get better I think we we did some things you know pretty well I think the staggered start reopening was a it was really a good thing we we kind of had a a finger on the pulse of our communities and we didn't reopen our schools until uh until they were ready\nOr perhaps even more a time for staff or prior to the to re engagement with students are I think we probably rushed them people back into the the schools that really didn't quite have their home circumstances as as well resolved\nBut it but again that's really a tough balance you know uh how long they're going to keep kids out of school a we had communities like marathon who were saying to us we want our kids back in school because that way we can attend or the other things that we need to do\nYou know so uh it's kind of a delicate balance that way probably one of the biggest lessons learned is is just how difficult it is to in challenging it is to use your schools as refugees and again these are different in shelters okay refuges or at the end there's supposedly know personnel\nYou know supervisory personnel available fortunately our law enforcement agency did have people on site but also the clean up after a being used as a refugee is a is a real challenge and something that we have to have a\nA little better plan in place for saying okay here's who's coming in and going to do it and get it done as quickly as you possibly can there was some confusion apparently over or who had the keys or who was going to be responsible for for doing that I think we have very clearly\nA clarified that uh it still is do a very difficult challenges to who is going to be quote assigned to be there uh everybody is very reluctant to to say to anyone that are unique to stay in a life threatening situation that everyone else is being told to leave what would you\nTell somebody in your position in the Carolinas right now\nOnly some of your people are going to be able to to help you but it's just a reality of life that certain people are gonna just reach the threshold of what they can or can't do and that doesn't mean they're they're bad people doesn't mean you should get rid of them and so you need to be ready for the fact that you're going to operate with less than a full complement\nOf your team and the other pieces or be ready for the long haul you know don't don't exhaust yourself in a sprint because it is definitely going to be a a long haul and you need to take care of yourself and others accordingly so that everybody there
