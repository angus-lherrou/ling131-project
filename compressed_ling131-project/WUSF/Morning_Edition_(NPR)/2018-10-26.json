target of conspiracy theories from the right\nSebastian Mallaby is the author of more money than God a history of the hedge fund industry and I asked him recently if he was surprised to see George Soros among the U.S presidents and other prominent Washington figures who've been sent these packages\nWhile the whole phenomenon of the pipe bomb over to the predators media report me Berg um if you were to say that somebody was to make a list of you know progressive leader they wanted to attack\nThat I wouldn't be surprised with the story served on the list I think he is the single most important known politician I'm spearheading progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tells us about\nHas a really interesting personal history tells us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen Seventy two well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary and so his childhood was dominated by the Nazi

Seventeen to go to London and from that he went in to find on the move to New York he opened one of the very early hedge funds in New York was a very successful stock market trader so that by around Nineteen eighty\nHe was worth a hundred million dollars but that was just to start because then he went into currency speculation in the eighties and nineties\nAnd tell us briefly how did currency

he's seen as Saturday you caught expanding rushing neighbors actually his philanthropy is called the open society Institute He's very open about it he publishes cigarettes are about where

if you were to say that somebody was to make a list of you know progressive leaders they want to attack\nAnd I wouldn't be surprised if the stores or on that list I think he is the single most important known politician I'm spearheading a progressive causes worldwide\nGeorge Soros has a really interesting personal history tells us about that and tell us how did he make all of his money\nWhen he was born in Nineteen thirty or well to do Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary a sort of his childhood was dominated by the Nazi occupation in the country and if the drive by separating

the critics you say he shot every I'm a ... on a long tradition of anti Semitism where a judge finance are portrayed as the shattered me figure to manipulate the politicians and therefore I think it's

Clinton got it because of shifting demographics people from other states and other countries are flocking to jobs in places like Raleigh Durham and Charlotte young generation of farmers are doing it too you sound like the rest of America Democrat in North Carolina dominate the cities and suburbs but things change the further out you've got\nYou look at the political fine but I mean you can almost

the network because of the fallout from those comments morning David ... okay so this is not the first time that making Kelly has made controversial comments about race\nHe said this is not the first time that making Kelly has made controversial comments about race here she is in twenty Thirteen when she was an anchor on Fox News for all you can watch at home than it just is white a white man to tell us about her history of making racialized comments\n[noise] while these aren't uh the only examples of their number I remember back in twenty and the Santa Jesus comments back from twenty Thirteen she later said she'd been joking and last year claimed that she she regretted those remarks but\nI remember back in twenty ten um she spent a fair amount of time on a tiny tiny heat group

during the OJ trial um many people saw that as a as discredited thing she welcomed among show\nDo you think that history played a role in NBC's decision to let her go\nI think it's played a strong role in uh the reaction of NBC's colleagues particularly but not exclusively NBC's I'm African American journalists are outraged to her remarks about ah what she thought was the acceptability a blackface NBC's\nNightly news with Lester Holt did a whole thing about this controversy on its OWN Network which seemed to suggest something about making Kelly's colleague an attitude toward\nHer well for you and me it might be an admirable exercise and transparency and I think it was that I think it's worth pointing out also Lester Holt the only African American anchor yeah uh uh of any made of the big three broadcast networks but it's also a sign that NBC was saying we're not going to protect us starting with we we might even though she's one of the most recognizable faces in t._v. news which\nIs really interesting the fact that she has been dropped I think it will surprise some people and I wonder does the way the network has handled these comments see something bigger about the way networks and companies are are tolerate it tolerating racialized or racist comments\n[noise] well it's hard not to look at this in light of a you know the reaction at times very slow of major news organizations to ah the me too movement which was something that for a significant time making Kelly embraced a sheet\nAccuse her former boss at Fox News of sexually harassing her I also think you can't divorce it from the fact that making Kelly I received very tepid a welcome from her colleagues NBC News she'd just play some popular colleagues\nAnd that her ratings themselves were mediocre and
