avenues education's a big issue for both of Florida's major gubernatorial candidates Democrat Andrew Gillum is pledging to mandate a salary of fifty thousand dollars for new teachers\nEducation reporter Jessica Bateman joined Lewis Hernandez to break down Gillum proposal\nSo the average starting teacher in Florida makes about thirty seven thousand four hundred dollars\nThat's actually only about twelve hundred less than the national average\nWhich is according to the national Education Association that the teachers union still give you an idea of how dramatic that really would be if you look at states that are a lot more expensive than us like New York or California they're starting teacher salaries aren't fifty thousand in fact the only places where starting teachers aren't making that much or New Jersey and the district of Columbia we\nKeep hearing the teachers in ... the lowest salary is in the country but so I was like really average\nFor starting salaries yes but when you look at what all teachers snake that's when we start to really lagged behind and we end up much lower in the rankings so our\nAverage salary for all teachers is about ten thousand dollars below the national average which is around fifty thousand so basically going as saying let's make the starting teacher salary what he's currently the national average for all\nStarting teacher salary what is currently the national average for all teachers\nAnd a lot of teachers are very happy with that but really how does he want to pay for\nIncreasing the corporate taxes\nAnd legalizing and taxing recreational marijuana so both of those things as you can imagine would be extremely difficult to get through a Republican legislature I spoke with Erica Donald's about that she's a a Collier county school board member she founded a state wide association for conservative school board members here's what she had to say about gallons plan\nI Would liken this to someone running for student council president and promising free ice cream every day it sounds great it makes everyone feel good but he has no way of actually implementing\nShe obviously supporting dissent\nThis idea than if you're really part of the sky the way she's making\nIt sound well like I said obviously the legislature is going to be a huge hurdle for Andrew Gillum if he does get elected governor another challenges the money itself right like you can mandate that school districts pay starting teachers the thousand dollars but you don't give them the money to do that they're not going to be able to do it\nAre there any other states have mandated starting teacher salary\nYeah so some states have salary scheduled for teachers that are mandated that the state level but those are states where they don't have collective bargaining which is that negotiation process that happens on the local level between teachers' unions and the school district administrators\nAnd Florida does have unions and collective bargaining and so here it would be a huge shift to see that happen at the state level rather than having that power rest in the local\nWould betrayed for the teachers union what do you think about this\nAnd they certainly are supporting them but they do have some questions about whether this could potentially take away some of their power to negotiate the local level so I spoke with Joanne McCall she's president of the Florida Education Association which is the state wide union and here's what she had to say\nWe absolutely want to raise teachers' salaries all across the board that just beginning teacher salaries everywhere but what we really need as a governor that will put money into the education system and go back to the local so that local can negotiate their salaries\nThat he wants to start everybody at fifty and then F negotiate from there you know I guess that's a starting point\nWhy use its mandated starting salary for teachers politically a good news for doing well\nLast school year you remember there was a bunch of activism all around the country from teachers in Florida teachers are not allowed to strike but there has been a lot of pressure on school boards to raise teachers' salaries and we see that on the ballot with the referendum in Miami Dade County in Palm Beach county coming up there was one and Broward\nDuring the primary election that past\nAndrew Gillum probably thinks if somebody is motivated to go to the polls to vote yes on a referendum why wouldn't they vote for\nGet ready get set boats voting resources and information
