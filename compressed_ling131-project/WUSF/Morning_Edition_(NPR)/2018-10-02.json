the Supreme Court nominees still in the news it's hard for a lot of us to get last week's hearing out of our minds author Rebecca Traister keeps thinking about how differently the tone was of the two witnesses\nDr Blass before it was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impacts that if it had on my life and my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his\nOwn behalf of his number one in the class I thought well no no no no no going on out there so I'm going to borrow more I don't know I mean I'm sure I'm going to talk about my high school record our city you're mocked me was\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible he had in his arsenal the ability to use\nAnger fury\nBuild each use anger fury tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that same tool that she could yell and be furious in her retelling of what\nHappened to her place or has been exploring the idea of women and anger and her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women thinker\nThat moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger\nAt some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the interim ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march and it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious\nAnd it was really just missed in a lot of quarters as being about the pain cats the put the hats you know a bunch of women getting together\nAnd there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road but this week and of course then that gets us to a year that has\nWomen protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then meet you\n[noise] you lean into history in this book and it's full of examples of men's anger\nBeing laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party is a great example what historically was so threatening about women think well in part that anger of\nThe founding our founders who were the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protest it in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government\nSo they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out our condemned it in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outsized penalty for women of color [laughter] so\nDo you think those voices are being heard loudly enough in this moment I think it's\nAlmost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and\nSo marginalized for so long when in fact it's women of color who has been the leaders and the leading thinkers have so many of our social movements in ways that have remain invisible to us so when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost [laughter]\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment\nStems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color who were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases have been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces\nIn Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of ...\nHis testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that he sexually harassed her sort of cemented the idea that sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter] it's Toronto Burke who in two thousand and six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained\nBut in fact all of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of a race\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come out [laughter]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past\n... years although we have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that that's where the character assassination by the left so as women think are only a productive force if it's done in the service to a progressive part of the antenna\nNot at all it is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time and the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around calving off\nIs going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future [noise]\nRituals\nFor their with Rebecca

Steve Inskeep one woman found a way to attack higher health insurance prices and the news because it's hard for any one person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges\nFor any one person to do if you go to the hospital the hospital charges your insurer\nWhich passes the cost on to you and it's hard to negotiate a better price and that system Marshall Allen of the nonprofit newsroom ProPublica has been investigating high health insurance costs and he has the story of a woman who used her power to hold them down either Marshall\nGood morning Steve who is this woman we're talking about sixty eight year old grandmother named Marilyn Bartlett and Maryland Bartlett took over the Montana Employee Benefit plan and twenty four teen and\nWhen she took over the plan which covers about thirty thousand state employees and their families and that plan was in deep trouble it self funded so the employer paid all the health care bills and it was projected to lose about fifty million dollars in the coming years and basically go broke\nSo the classic situation here that people in all sorts of insurance arrangements face where they're basically told healthcare is really expensive gets more expensive every year and we're short of money we need more from\nYou exactly and if people hadn't noticed the cost of your health care benefits is rising there's about a hundred and fifty one million of us\nWho get her health care benefits through our employers and part of the problem is our employers have been deferring to the medical industry when it comes to the cost of health care and so the industry keeps raising the cost and basically those costs keep getting passed on to the workers what did Maryland Bartlett do differently\nShe had spent Thirteen Years working in the insurance industry\nAnd so she knew a lot of the games she was also kind of a massive nerd who knew how to follow the money\nAnd so working with our team is she compared what her plan paid\nEach hospital in the state the bigger hospitals to what they were paid by Medicare and Medicare published as its prices and so she could see that her health plan was paying hospitals in the state anywhere from two times what Medicare gets paid to five times what Medicare gets\nPaid while and so she said that was too much\nIt was too much I mean the plan was going broke her charge was to get things under control and so she had to do some really hardball negotiating and why she decided to do which is kind of a revolutionary idea in the health care world as she decided to set her own prices and set the plans prices\nNow in this case she had some leverage and actually all employers have this leverage because of the healthcare industry really does need our money\nSo she said look you hospitals that are five times the Medicare rate you're going to need to bring your prices down to about twice the Medicare rape\nI Wonder if hospitals simply had to accept that I'm thinking but in Montana there can't be all that many hospitals there surely would be a hospital that would just say listen our prices are price\nIt took some hardball negotiating she threatened to go public with the price variation and expose the high priced hospitals she called in the union to campaign against the hospital was holding out and they had a whole campaign state wide they spent hundreds of postcards and made phone calls to the hospital executives and leaders\nAnd eventually all the hospitals signed on and the plans saved about a million dollars a month just from the reduced hospital prices\nIs there a lesson here for employers of all sizes that if they put in that time they can get the leverage to hold down what is paid for hospitals and other medical costs\nMaryland would say absolutely yes her message really to employers is you need to push back you need to read the fine print in your contract\nYou need to demand to know where the money is going and why the costs are so high get an itemized explanation for all of the expenses and when you do that you know you may need to smaller employers may need to join together with other small employers to increase their leverage but they can bring down the prices\nMarshall Allen of ProPublica thanks very much thanks so much Steve\nThis is NPR News\n\nThis is NPR News\n\nThe national fire protection association released new standards this year

different the tone was of the two witnesses\nDr blondes before it was so deferential so polite so constrained\nI understand and appreciate the importance of you're hearing from me directly about what happened to me and he has said if it had on my life and I my family\nAnd then in came Brett Kavanaugh his instinct was very public fury on his own behalf\nOf his number one in the class I thought oh no no no no going on out there so I'm going to borrow more I don't know I mean I'm sure I'm going to talk about my high school record in the city on mocked me was\nThat was an exchange between Brett Kavanaugh and democratic Vermont Senator Patrick Leahy during those hearings Rebecca Traister says men in general are allowed to use a full range of expression and still come off as credible\nHe had in his arsenal the ability to use anger fury tears\nIn a way that he felt confident would resonate with the American people I don't think that Dr Christine Blasey Ford I Can't imagine a scenario in which she would have gone into that hearing room\nArmed with that same weapon that same tool that she couldn't yell and be furious in her retelling of what happened to her\nTracer has been exploring the idea of women and anger in her new book out today it's called good and bad the revolutionary power of women thinker\nThat moment that it occurred to me that I wanted to write this book it probably was just in advance of the women's march and you could feel the post twenty sixteen election anger building and it wasn't just the anger of the women who were planning a women's march it was also anger\nAt some of the white women who were planning a women's march after fifty three percent of white women had voted for Donald Trump the intra ally anger was crucial and important and then there was the women's march\nAnd it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nThe women's march and it was the biggest single day political demonstration in our nation's history\nAnd it obviously made a big impression and yet I saw the political press not treated as politically serious and it was really just missing a lot of quarters as being about the cats the Pussy hats you know a bunch of women getting together\nAnd there's a pundit mark how print on MSNBC who asks the Monday after the women's march seriously what are these women gonna do not just running for school board down the road but this week and of course then that gets us to a year that has\nWomen protesters opposing the health care repeal teachers' strikes women running for office in historic numbers and then\nMeet you [noise] you lean into history in the book and it's full of examples of men anger being laudable creating admirable political change the Boston Tea party and the great example [noise]\nWhat historically was so threatening about women think well in part that anger\nOf the founding our founders to or the white men chafing against their lack of representation and who were angry and protested in ways that we understand correctly to ... this is our revolutionary moment but when they made their new nation\nThey codified some of the very inequities that they themselves were angry about with regard to the British Government\nSo they built the nation on slavery and the disenfranchisement of women\n[noise] you referenced the racial dynamic of the me too movement earlier but I Want to ask again because women who speak out our\nCondemned it in the broader culture under many circumstances but there is an outside the penalty for women of color who do so do you think those voices are being heard lousy enough in this moment I think it's\nAlmost impossible for us to conceive of the voices of women of color as being heard loudly enough because they have been so unheard and so marginalized for so long when in fact it's women of color who have been the leaders and the leading thinkers have so many of our social movements in ways that have remain invisible to us\nToo when we think about me to one of the things that gets lost [laughter]\nIs that the definition of sexual harassment\nStems from cases that were brought in the seventies by women of color\nWho were actually borrowing legal ideas from a civil rights movement around racial discrimination and applying them to their cases of having in many cases been brutally sexually harassed in their workplaces in Nineteen Ninety One it was a need a hill his testimony against Clarence Thomas claiming that sexually harassed her\nSort of cemented the idea\nThat sexual harassment was not individual behavior but damage done to a class [laughter]\nIt's Toronto Burke who in two thousand six pioneers and leads the me too movement and then when the me too movement Iraq\nI think it's really important that we understand that the first people to gain attention were very wealthy white actresses which is in no way I don't say that to diminish their experience with the reality of the harm they sustained\nBut in fact all of that is for grounded by women of color who stories so often get lost or kind of erased\nAs the author of a book called good and bad the revolutionary power of women's anger you could not have to find a more appropriate time for your book to come [noise]\nThat's true but that could have been true of so many other weeks of the past ... years although we have to say there are plenty of women who support Kavanaugh women who are indeed angry because they believe that this was the character assassination by the left so we women think are only a productive force if it's done in the service\nTo a progressive partisan agenda not at all\nIn the service to a progressive partisan agenda not at all\nIt is very often politically potent and yet we're told not to take it seriously still\nI think that the anger that women are feeling around the country that is having a catalytic connective impact and this is part of a long process social movements take a long time and the kind of anger that women are feeling in this moment around Kavanaugh\nIs going to be part of a far longer story that's going to extend deep into our future Rebecca Traister is the

Florida's who I'm at ... am and pro public uh finds some people might have survived if paramedics had been allowed inside the club sooner this week on Florida matters we hear that story and talk about how response efforts have changed since the massacre\nIn this preview host Robin tossing him talks with John ... is an expert with the national fire protection association the group released new standards this year for responding to active shootings\nIn the past emergency responders and the fire department or EMTs emergency medical technicians had to wait until the threat was neutralized in an active shooting incident in other words the police had killed or arrested the gunmen\nAnd the consequences of that which we saw the pulse nightclub shooting was that victims were shot or wounded they had to live there and wait until everything was over before the EMTs could go in these new standards have they changed the actions of first responders\nFor our hope that these standards will for it\nSins of first responders\nWill it's our hope that these standards will force first responder agencies to work together\nThe standard isn't a prevention document it doesn't talk about assessing people's mental health or gun rights or gun prevention what it does talk about is these are incidents that are occurring more frequently and more severely\nAnd we need to be prepared as communities and in doing so we won our first responders to train together to come up with tactics and policies\nAnd to use those tactics and policies to access victims as quickly as possible\nSo the big change would be that the paramedics would go in and tried to save people before it's a completely secure situation\nCertainly that's the goal it's a goal for responders to access victims as quickly as possible so you can say okay you know the bad guys in the back of the building we have a wall set up between the bad guy in the good guys and we can get in there and help everyone in the front of the building while we address the guy in the back of the building\nThat takes a lot of coordination communication that's not easy\nAnd that's why you have to work together and practice this far in advance\nIt sounds like part of the changes would be that paramedics an EMT is perhaps they would be asked to wear special vast protective uniforms\nThe standard says if EMTs and paramedics that aren't law enforcement based and not part of a specialized team are going to go into these war zones intentionally the expectation is that they wear a level three a National Institute of justice rated vest\nAnd that's a bare minimum\nThe technical committee that wrote the new standard an FDA three thousand felt very strongly that they need to be provided some protection if they're going to be going into the zone similarly like law enforcement wearing the vest as well [noise]\nThey also recommended helmets they recommended other things as well I protection but they needed to set that minimum because the understanding is that we're moving in that direction and that expectation across the country is shifting\nHas there been any pushback from paramedics any empties who say you know I didn't sign up for this I thought I was going to be going to a person's home that was having a heart attack and saving their life I never thought I Would be going into some sort of active shooting hostile event like this\nOh I'm sure there is and it makes a lot of sense you know day one and he in the school the first lesson you learned is seen safety body substance isolation scene safety means that you you only go into secure scenes\nAnd body substance isolation means that you protect yourself from blood borne pathogens wearing gloves and protection you know that's the first thing you learn as an EMT and\nThis is new and different and certainly there's going to be complications with departments doing this around the country and an ambulance services for example they're going to need to
