married by Bush writes I was at thirty year old American traveling in India with the smell of incense in my hair and monstrous repeating in my ears\nBack then if you had told me that I Would someday be training employees have corporate America to apply contemplative practices to help them become more successful I would've said you'd been standing too long in India is hot new ...\nYet as soon as

Google's wildly popular employee program search inside yourself\nNearby Bush is called in to work with educators and judges and social activists and soldiers\nHer odyssey from India ten now tells a defining narrative of our time and it's not just a story of tools that help us be more successful it's a rediscovery and reclaiming of contemplation in many forms and many tradition in secular thick of modern life\nIn the beginning you couldn't ever say with the environmental leaders called the L Word and [laughter] wait a minute the L Word was love and it's really when someone's heart opens that dreams really change\nI had been more and more willing to take the risk to offer those practices even in just very secular working situations recently than I used\nTo be because people really want to look for it turns out [laughter] and um it always ends\nOn sounding like a hallmark card but I have sent it to be very powerful if you can find the right way to do it\n[noise]\nI'm Krista tempted and this is on being nearby Bush's co founder and former director of the center for contemplative mind into science team she's just written a new book together with Romney us walking\nEach other home conversations on loving and dying we spoke into that I'm Fifteen so I Wonder\nHow would you start to describe what the spiritual background of your childhood of your life or early life\nWell my early life\nYou know early life well my early in life [noise] I\nWas brought up Catholic and when I was seven my father left and my mother had to go to work and it was right after the war I say the second\nWorld [laughter] and you have to be the war [laughter] and um [noise] there wasn't daycare\nSo my mother would drop me off at the church and I'd go to mass every morning and then I just go right over to the school they were both across the street from us so I was in church every morning\nFor my whole childhood and um I think you know the conflict children are part of the way morals and ethics are taught is through the models of the lives of the St right so there were a lot of really\nPretty extraordinary and some preposterous stories of saints [laughter] but I really loved I'm Joan of arc\nThat an interesting idea that Joan of and so I just we know how to Joan of arc and by the aspirations of a girl in Madison New Jersey\n[laughter] well ruined her life is a lot more interesting than mine [laughter] I I I liked that but she did start out as a kind of ordinary little girl and then\nMeditation we still had the model of it being monastic and so uh\nHad the model of it being monastic\nAnd so having a child and being a meditation teacher was just knowing that imagine [laughter] right [laughter] ah [laughter]\nSo but I was just just committed as everybody else to finding a way to bring this into um our lives in the west so\nFirst I started a business with my then husband John Bush and I was I eliminated and and yeah yeah I thought when I was most interested in women nations was integrating the sense\nNot just practice because not everybody who work there wanted to learn to meditate\nBut we integrated in ways into the business fat would embodied the perspective and the spirit and the values of contemplative practice and how do\nYou know that was the beginning of the time when we were discovering you know it's all one [laughter] yeah I mean now we recognize that it's more\nComplicated and subtle and so on and it is all one and yet it's more than that but\nAt the time that was radical yeah so we really wanted to express it and we knew that doing it visually would be easier for people and trying to do it in words\nAs you can appreciate [laughter] yeah so I ... we were trying to create an organization based on principles of what they call in the east right livelihood now where what you're making\nIs wholesome and contributes to now we would say you know sustainability of the planet and the bases and [noise] and at the same time the way in which you're doing it is helping everyone who's involved\nTo wake up\nInterestingly we did so many things that when I many years later arrived at Google because they wanted to have a program there where their engineers could learn meditation\nSo many of the same things that they recognized about what makes a person more creative more able to ah bring their their whole settled into work and to be able to grow\nFrom their work as well and not think of it as you know now I'll do my work and then I'll go home and be a real person\n[laughter] right right [noise] that is the shaft that is still a\nStill has a long way to go for short term stuff on American corporate culture and\nIdeals and practicalities yeah this story of search inside yourself\nFirst of all I I I Love the story of how you that you had to find that language I mean isn't that right when you first just were offering a meditation course are mindfulness course it didn't take [noise] yeah [noise]\nUh actually my friend Ming who's now written a book on search inside yourself um he called me up one day I was at the Ritz still running the center for a contemporary of mine and he called up and well first of all he said when I was younger\nHe been through some difficult times and meditation had really helped him\nSo he'd been thinking for some time at Google that or it would be really great to bring into the workplace he'd\nBeen there since almost the beginning he was engineering number one o seven [laughter] and um when Google went public they told their engineers set who no longer needed to work if they didn't want to um [noise]\nThat they could stay but they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google\nBut they had to do something that would in some way advanced Google's mission\nBut they could decide whether it was so ... decided it was going to be bringing meditation and he said I posted it and nobody signed up I don't know what to do and I heard you could help\nSo I went out there and we talk to and we looked around and what we identified was that people ... employees there are\nAll quite young very smart graduate the top of their classroom MIT or Stanford um [noise] had been in front of their screens most of their lives so I'm after talking for a whole day and figuring out what was going on there\nI suggested that we could\nOffer the same practices but emphasized the practices that that more directly cultivate emotional intelligence and that we could frame and then a different way and so we called it of course they came up with this great name since they're the big search engine search inside yourself and\nThen the subtitle is mindfulness based stress reduction and we asked Danny Goldman who also is in bug guy or with us back all those years right right\nI'm asked him to uh give a talk at Google about the relation between about ... just so important in the workplace and on the relationship between meditation and emotional intelligence he did that and then we posted the course\nAnd in four hours a hundred and forty people signed up and since then you know over two thousand lawyers around the world have taken the course and there's a lot of talk now about\nBringing mindfulness into the workplace yeah how's superficial it is and how it\nHelps bad people do bad things better and and it doesn't help people question\nAnything it just makes them more satisfied with what they're doing but\nThis is a serious course and when you sit down and quiet down can calm quiet stable you have to do that in order for any kind of insight to arise and you do feel better usually although sometimes\nYou know really disturbing emotions rise [laughter] but it needs to be taken to the next kind of level of deaths in order for people to begin to\nQuestion right higher\nBut this course actually offers enough time practice and a teaching to help people do that\n[noise] I mean yeah and I think that's an important and refreshing thing to name that if you can be a great meditate or and also remained narcissistic right [laughter] I mean this can be superficial and it can be abused it's like any like any spiritual practice like yeah politically active um [noise]\nBut you know nearby something that really so intrigues me in um in your work and in some of your writing is how you know like the language of emotional ... state you've just been using and that's now so widely familiar including workplaces um [noise]\nThat what this tradition is bringing forward and bringing to the surface for modern people has [noise]\nYou know has is faring noble lineage um [noise] you know it's what is that is the tradition that has ... for ... years but you know you wrote about how in Eighteen Ninety William James and the principles of psychology\nSaid that the faculty of voluntarily bringing back I'm Wondering attention over and over again\nIt's called the involuntarily bringing back I'm Wondering attention over and over again it's a very root of judgment character and well and I mean I don't know I don't think he was British But that is the intention right have yeah\nThat is and it's just quite amazing and then in the seventies you had a somebody who actually I had never heard of David McClelland\nYay and William James hall mhm um who became a teacher to all these figures have gone on especially in narrow science to this ... David than Daniel ... mark abstain\nAnd also to me what's fascinating is that she was Quaker and they knew something in your work they ... through and seeing that this contemplative impulse\nIs a kind of human tradition as much as it yeah it's in their religious traditions I'm In ... center Owen cs Lewis ... the idea of holding that goes back to play down high tech are somehow that you're just looking at your work has brought all that far away from me and it's really crazy him\nSo much [laughter] I'm honored [laughter] but\nIt's true when we started the center for contempt of mind we uh we're looking for ways in which these practices might be helpful and\nSectors of American society other than health inhaling which is where it had started right and um we interviewed\nEighty people we identify this isn't Ninety six and seven so it was early but we kind of word of mouth heard and knew a number of people in different fields who were beginning to integrated into their work or their organizations and we enter your eighty people and we are some for\nWhat practices they were there's and that they were teaching or [noise] and um we gathered these I don't know hundred practices from all the different traditions it I mean\nAll the religious and spiritual and of course psychological traditions to they are human practices they really about waking up to who we are appreciating and we are opening our hearts recognizing compassion recognizing that you know there's a way in which\nDaydreaming ... which researchers found that daydream is good for your brain [noise]\nUm I don't think we do as much of that [laughter] teaching these students also we\nAt the end of the day we did that the yoga and and a deep relaxation\nAnd um of course they weren't allowed to use their phones during the day but it\nDid show us in a deep relaxation and everyone who's ever done a yoga class you know none of sites like okay this is the time you know completely let go and you drop into the floor you know\n[laughter] as soon as like breathing in and breathing out about three brass fan and I saw these arm's reach out [laughter] I'm sure their phones\nAnd about lying down [laughter] sorry for far right they brought their phones in front of their [laughter] I couldn't believe it was like the little ... girl and ... what's sacrilegious right [laughter] right\nWell but okay so I knew were denied all that beautiful work has Google and Google is part of the problem here I don't understand the point that nothing is pure and um but you have written about ... it's very\nPractical like mindfulness practices like social media practice mindful emailing what do you talk about that yeah that's really interesting yeah\nYeah um we device that at Google loves that she put it in her magazine plus I'm I mean it's so simple but like most mindfulness practices if it's a simple and we don't do it um [noise]\nYou just type out your email either a response or an initiating email and then you stop\nTakes three deep breaths follow your brass\nIn and out in and out [noise] and in and out and then you read the email\nAnd you read it from the perspective of the person who is going to receive it and there we were focused on emotional impact so you know is this person likely to be\nAgitated or angry or you know frustrated or whatever the emotion would be negative emotion or maybe even as this person likely to thank you I mean you're offering more than you actually are\nWhat whatever we asked them to think about it from that person's perspective and then either you know change it or not and then send and the first time we we did it there was a week\nAnd then send and the first time we we did it there was a week in between the classes and so a week later and they came back and we said how did it go and um they all said that was radical knows me using right and then one guy said\nI did something really radical I said what is that I picked up the phone\n[laughter]\nRight [laughter]\nSo you know I mean there we all are emailing to the people on the next cubicle you know and so uh that's really helpful\nReally helpful I wanted to go back for a minute because I didn't answer your question about social justice activism really house yeah I got off on the leaf but yeah one theme that comes up so often with activists is that if I give up my anger\nWill I lose my motivation right and it's my anger that keeps me working for this change yeah what what mindfulness compassion practices and others help with is\nThe understanding that it's not either acting out on your anger and being driven by it on the one hand for repressing it on the other hand but there is a way to\nNotice your anger begin by noticing the sensations in your body and been noticed what your anger is see it and\nRecognize it as energy energy in your body right but at the same time holds a compassion and echoing immunity\nFor the situation because you're more likely to be able to see what can be done to make that change if you're not driven by anger because it causes your mind\nAnd it also makes communication with people on the other side of an issue really difficult yeah whereas if you can cultivate equity and compassion for the situation you're much more likely to both see\nInteresting ways to resolve it and to be able to act on it I communicated we\nDid a lot of work with lawyers and\nJudges and that loss I didn't hear anything about that I Want to ask you about that so interesting every especial retreat for judges where they wanted to learn how to be non judgemental\n[laughter] it's I mean we we laugh but it's yeah you know it they will lawyers worry that\nCan they be a zealous advocate for their client and the same time have compassion for the person on the other side of the case and um of course the answer is yes and what that means and what those judges men\nIs not eliminating wise discernment it's eliminating pre judgment\nSo that they judges are unbelievably overworked they have so many people coming in front of them all day long one after another and they said you know\nSome young guy comes up in front of me and before I even know his name I'm already thinking\nThat this was probably who he is and what he's done right\nAnd they can't not having that arise because they're they're they are all day long hearing all this stuff but they don't want to prejudge they want to be really there in the mom and clear and open minded with whomever comes before them but it's really hard so\nJust being there and really listening to what's actually being said that can be cultivated through mindfulness practice and\nThey loved it oh yeah I just read in uh\nThey loved it oh yeah I just read in a a science magazine that the present moment as we experienced it is about two to three seconds long\n[laughter] kind of interesting great like physically like what we experienced as a press about why there's two yeah\nAnd also that you can that it can be a longer right which is what you're saying meditate or have said oh yeah absolutely and that you can also completely not be there [laughter] you can do it for all of the ... yeah [noise]\nI'm ... and this is on being today with what his teacher mirror by Bush who worked at the intersection of industry social hailing and diverse contemplative practicing [noise]\nYou know you said a minute ago like with everything with mindfulness and contemplative practice [noise]\nIt's so obvious and in some ways easy but we don't do it and uh and I have to say like for myself I have um I've had many experiences across the ears on different settings retreat settings or something less intense we're having the irony is that uh [noise]\nEven a kind of one off contemplative experience can be instantaneously gratifying right it can be on just transformative and now they're asleep and all this\nScience about how good it is for us on these very basic biological levels and stress and all of that\nBut it's very hard to create this habit and has been hard for me I I have recently I wanted to ask you about that since I have you [noise] you know I recently decided that I could do six minutes in the morning while my teeth tapes which just seems so pathetic but\nYeah it it it's our time yeah\nAnd I wonder um I Want to ask you this you work with so many different practices I mean are there is this something where you really do have to find their way that works for you yeah well at the center\nWe we've done all kinds of things I mean we've had retreats where we've offered you\nKnow we've had a Buddhist teacher and a Jewish teacher teaching traditional Jewish practices brother David teaching Christian practices um someone doing should be chanting\nWe've done it that way and then\nInvite people to find something from all of that that works for them sometimes we've offered really simple practices like um\nMy ... breads and walking meditation right and my listening and so on as an opening for people and then knowing that if they begin to appreciate it'd be interpreted the inner life\nAnd the benefit that comes from as you said I mean it's amazing that they found the reduction in stress and cortisol levels yeah after ten Fifteen minutes of meditation or that", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "28"}
