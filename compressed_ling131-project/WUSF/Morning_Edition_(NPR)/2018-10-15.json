Goldwater responsible for one of them Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump does she see each of these waves that connected to to the previous well he does\nBut what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you could make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal [laughter] which I think actually illustrates a broader point about\nThe politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal in nature partisan and nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about a desire to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's totally versus them President Trump put it on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the backstabbing duplicitous and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable was was Gingrich as comfortable swimming in the swamp he\nWas I mean a lot of ways he created the swamp that the Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that ... like most about Trump when you try to get him to talk about Trump is more or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most is the personality and the larger than life style and\nHow how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end no I mean whereas Democrats implored the idea of what Trump has a right in terms of our political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions says Gingrich see all this as a long awaited political break through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics have gotten more tribal and more vicious and has kind of shed a lot of these civilized and trade she thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and ... and that's how he uh he sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nLike a ... of the Atlantic magazine his new profile of Newt Gingrich appears in this issue it is called Newt Gingrich said You're welcome the cake topping thanks much for coming in thank you and this is NPR News this is Debbie ...

Morris campaign monitored dot com\nIt's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Rachel Martin it would be understandable if executives and Kentucky bourbon industry said they need a drink bourbon whiskey at the target of terrorists in Europe and elsewhere Europeans imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and is the home of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper steel and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world's resources to the same reason where the world's greatest bourbon Kentucky system lumps don't show\nThat lumps show filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with with how global of businesses that more and more so now than it ever has been ah we export Kentucky bourbon about hundred twenty six\nCountries [noise] so at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market is a nice little extra\nOr it's just getting the point where it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh independents juniors you're probably your global sales have been out\nFor your domestic while and just to just to be clear on the fact of you said for the larger distillers more than half their market your\nDoor to door but yes the I I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global market has really increased ever since we started with the free trade agreements\nHere's the global markets really increased ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements because they well a nasty and the EU agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements have become under trail\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know you have to stores they're starting to look at what happens if this starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that look like just your profit a little less or does the market go away we'll\nAh we don't like the options on the table with the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks there's no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs the consumer and hopefully you have people you converted from God's do remain Berman drinkers or you take your profits back\nA which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so do a lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any of them\nSaid in the obviously the state that voted for president has voted for Republicans a lot that has um [noise] when you have conversations with people do you run into people that were having conflicted feelings [noise]\nAh [noise] I think we all understand that there are no winners or trade war and you know we're we didn't have for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why you know we're kind of collateral damage or you know to be honest with you I'm not but I again I haven't heard much\nUh uh come up as an issue to\nGive me an an issue like an election yeah it has to come up I mean Cancun bar has been very helpful to us in the past few months the step and meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how does the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows will probably mean the Kentucky he will\nNote for the non geographically minded right across right in front of the\nRiver yes ah in and he told us he understood exactly the ... with the sushi could mean for us\nBourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks for the federal law right as a federal in Nineteen sixty four\nCongress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous spirits United States I'm like you know highly David sandwich announced it moves to production overseas we can't do that with ... and you got to make it here in American if he wants to sell you better maintain Kentucky\nBeginning of next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been\nA I think that's when you can start to leave some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinkers that we've converted over the last few years deadly if they started looking and from a fight standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they were\nDrinking before you know we might lose people for our industry and if we lose them now than we might lose for generation ferret Gregory of Kentucky distillers association\nNext we turn to the effort to total the damage damage from hurricane Michael which had Florida's panhandle last week NPR's Camila Domonoske reports since hurricane Michael hit impassable rather than non functional found and made life difficult for residents and rescue teams and for insurance adjuster\nJust on the outskirts of ... or ... miles across\nTown the

Ninety to many companies went bankrupt or backed away from covering coastal areas and with good news analysts say that's not likely to happen now but communities are still facing a long difficult

Bush has a different prediction about how Republicans will react if they lose the house\nI think there will be miserable and in Boulder there'll be miserable because they're in the minority there will be a bullet because what if the Democrats take it by narrow margins it will be deep divisions within the Democratic party\nAnd Republicans who are experts at opposition will do their best to exacerbate those democratic divisions\nThere'll be other changes in store for Republicans if they lose one or both houses President Trump without control of Congress could decide to triangulate he's already talked about making deals with Democrats on infrastructure for instance and that could leave congressional Republicans on the sidelines\nTrump has never hesitated to throw an ally under the bus says that high the former communications director for the RMC\nIt could be bad for Republicans if he tries to do that but it could be good for Trump for his own personal political goals I think the challenge for a lot of Republicans is what is good for Republicans in what is good for Trump or not necessarily the same thing\nAnd something else will happen if Republicans lose big in November their ranks in Congress will get smaller but also whiter older more male and much more conservative in other words more like the Trump the base of the party\nFormer house Speaker Newt Gingrich says even if the Republicans lose even if they privately blame Trump for their loss and even if he cast them aside to make deals with the Democrats they'll have no choice but to stand by him\nThe Republican Party first of all is gonna be the Trump party you know these consistently had forty to forty three forty four forty five percent approval 'cause she's eighty eight or Ninety Ninety two percent among Republicans\nSo Gingrich says Republicans will have no choice but to become even more committed to Donald Trump after November\nThe first thing they'll say the morning after the election as we're dedicated luxury election of Donald Trump and that becomes the overriding go\nAnd if they managed to hang on to power in Congress Republicans will still have the task of showing the country they can govern\nThat means funding of all replacing Obamacare overhauling Medicare and Social Security accomplishments that looted them over the past two years and if they keep the house they'll certainly have a narrow majority making it all even harder Mara Liasson NPR News Washington [noise]\nYou're listening to NPR News and you're listening to double USS eighty nine point seven good morning it's Monday October Fifteen Seventy one years ago today\nGood morning it's Monday October Fifteen Seventy one years ago today Tampa's drew field was renamed Tampa international airport October fifteenth Nineteen forty seven coming up later this morning we hear from a Huffington Post reporter about discrimination in some Florida schools yes father felt like\nThey were denying his son entry because of his sons of parents and apparently has some lab tests hairstyle he was very proud of it\nJoined us for that conversation at seven forty five ... this morning right here in W.

imposed a twenty five percent tax as retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on aluminum and steel\nIt's no coincidence that the taxes fall on an industry centered in Kentucky which voted for President Trump and the homeless credit majority leader Mitch McConnell the Republican congressman from bourbon country Andy Barr faces a hard fight for reelection which President Trump supported with a visit on Saturday\nWe visited the town branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon\nTown branch distillery in Lexington where bourbon is made it a giant copper still and we met Eric Gregory of the Kentucky distillers association who described a product rooted in the United states\nThe same reasons why we have the world trade sources to the same reason we have the world's greatest bourbon\nKentucky sits on the lump sum shelf ... filters out the water takes it all the impurities and um it just became the perfect place to make the world with how global business is this more and more so now than it ever has been a we export Kentucky bourbon Shabaab hundred twenty six\nCenturies so at this point if you looked at a percentage of the industry is the export market a nice little extra\nOr it's it's getting to the point where it's it's more than fifty percent of the bigger players um but uh in the past ten years you're you're probably global sales have been out\nPacing your domestic sales as well and just to just to be clear on that fact that you said for the larger distillers more than half their market maybe over ... from the\n... but yet they I Would say they're international sales are starting to pay their domestic sales in the past Fifteen to Twenty years the global market has really increased ever since we started with the free trade agreements in the mid nineties what were the key free trade agreements today well a nap to on the agreement\nSo what have people been thinking about here as those free trade agreements just become under is Ralph\nVery concerned um a lot of the big players are were able to stockpile overseas and kind of hopefully get through a short term problem uh but at the same time we you know you had distillers they're starting to look at what happens if it starts to escalate and that's a point where we don't want to go\nWhen people game that out what does that looked like just your profit a little less or does the market go away and well\nUh we don't like any options on the table this is the twenty five percent tax increase terrorist attacks is no doubt about it so you're either going to pass along those costs a consumer and hopefully you know have people that you've converting some scotch do remain Berman drinkers um or you take your profit back\nOr which means less investment back home here in Kentucky and we don't like that option either so the lot of different ways out of this and we don't like any of them\nSaid in the obvious things in a state that voted for President Trump has voted for Republicans a law passed um [noise] when you have conversations with people do you run into people who were having conflicted feelings [noise]\nAh [noise] I think we all understand that there are no winners or a trade war and you know we're we didn't ask for this issue we're kind of caught in the middle of this so that's where the conflict feelings are we don't understand why you know we're kind of\nCollateral damage or you know to be honest with the ... again I haven't heard much uh it come up as an issue yet\nDo you mean an issue like an election yeah it had to wake them up I mean congressman Barr has been very helpful to us and the past few months he set up a meeting with the vice President Pence when he came to Kentucky and the spring how did the vice president respond he you know being from Indiana he knows what pardon means Kentucky or he\nWill not for the non geographically minded right across\nThe river yes uh and and he told us he understood exactly that this with the district\nMean for us bourbon is uniquely American Spirit you can't make it anywhere else you can make it in the United states which can make it overseas and called bourbon thanks to nine tenths of a federal law writers they federal\nIn Nineteen sixty four Congress passed a resolution declaring bourbon to be an indigenous\nSpirits United States unlike Harley Davidson which announced they can move some production overseas we can't do that would bar but you've got to make it here in America if you want to sell it you better make in Kentucky\nBeginning next year and you're going to have a problem with exports if this has been\nI think that's when you can start to see some real long term consequences because one of our greatest fears is that all these scotch drinker so that we've converted over the last few years suddenly if they start looking and from a standpoint if the bourbon is higher price maybe they go back to drink and what they're doing\nOne is the bourbon is higher price to go back to drink and what they were drinking before you know we might lose our industry and if we lose the now than we might lose your for generations beret\nGregory of Kentucky distillers association\nNext we

Goldwater responsible for one of them Ronald Reagan Gingrich himself and now President Trump says he the each of these waves that connected to to the previous well\nHe does but what's interesting is that when you press them on that you know why why how are all these connected because you can make a case that philosophically they're all quite different\nUm what he said to me was you know basically they're all anti liberal [laughter] which I think actually illustrates a broader point about\nThe politics that Gingrich helped create which is it's tribal and nature partisan in nature and driven especially by negative partisanship it's about ... to beat the other team more than it is accomplished some unified goal\nIt is a zero sum it's I don't really versus them President Trump put on sixty minutes last night talking about what a nasty place Washington DC is the backstabbing duplicitous he and almost in the same breath he said I feel very comfortable [laughter] uh what was your team coverage as comfortable swimming in the swamp he\nWas I mean a lot of ways he created the swamp said Trump now says he's trying to drain right\nI'm ... and you know I think that this is actually one of the things that Gingrich liked most about Trump when you try to get him to talk about Trump is more or the brand of conservatism that the president stands for what he talks about most of the personality and the larger than life style and\nHow how cutthroat he can be that's what Gingrich likes about Trump and I think that says a lot about his worldview\nTo what end though I mean where Democrats support the idea of what Trump has rotten terms or political discourse erosion of norms undermining of institutions that Gingrich see all this at the long awaited political break through\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things\nYou know totally I think that in in the big scheme of things she actually likes that our politics have gotten more tribal and more vicious when I was kind of shed a lot of these civilized and trade she thinks that it should be two teams you know duking it out and ... and that's how he or she sees the world and he's happy that it's gotten to where it is\nLike a top end of the Atlantic magazine his profile of Newt Gingrich appears in this issue it has called Newt Gingrich says You're welcome McKay coffins thanks so much for coming in\n\n[noise] It's MORNING EDITION from NPR News I'm Rachel Martin and I'm Steve Inskeep\nAnd I'm Jessica ... you were listening to MORNING EDITION on your NPR station W USF\nFeller avenue east is closed due to an accident between north fifteenth street and north twenty second street", "show_name": "Morning Edition (NPR)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "15"}
