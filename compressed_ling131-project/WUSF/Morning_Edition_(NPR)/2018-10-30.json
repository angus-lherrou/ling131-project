I think ridiculous reasons and we're not focusing on our own people and what our own people need to make it through the day sometimes\nAre you talking about like President Trump and allegations against him the Russia investigation all that stuff feels really far afield to\nActually I voted for President Trump did you I did not like the way the country was going and I wanted to make a change I was willing to try to change and I still don't think the president's role in this is as much an issue as\nOur local governments like why is it state to state so different why is there help available in one area and not in another\nState so different why is there help available in one area and not in another area why can't it be uniform I look at the realities of our life what candidate will\nGive the access to the programs are people need health care drug counseling who will support that and to me I really don't care what party that is I just wanted to be someone who will say okay this is my cars and I want to fix this problem\nThat means it's about your your whoever won month president from especially want to keep your vote a with a GOP even though he's not on the ballot in these midterms in general are you satisfied with how he has done in the job in the past couple of years\nI'm very satisfied with his performance on the job I Wish she would get off Twitter though because that is an unnecessary [noise]\n[noise] I don't even know how to verbalize that I just think that takes away and it feeds into all the hatred we have right now and all the discord\nIt's like if he would just do his job the economy's doing well I Believe on for the things he stands for he wants to that's best for America and I really truly believe that but he can't help themselves\nBut to take criticism many just blows up and goes on Twitter with Iran and that takes away from all the goodies trying to do in other areas [noise]\nFluffy I'll just closed by asking you how\nThings are between you and Marco right now I mean I understand he's in a good place how was your relationship\nIt's as strong as it's ever been I've never given up on my son um I've always loved him he knows I Would do anything for him that I've got his back till my last breath\nRings a bell thank you so much for talking with us and sharing your story You're welcome thank you\n[laughter]\nOriginal Martin speaking there to Isabel Simon and this is NPR News\nThis is W.

sat down with political analyst and us that professor emerita Susan MacManus we along the ice for record or are used to getting a lot of attention in elections\nIs still an important area and determining the outcome of elections\nAbsolutely we always see the most television ads in the Tampa in Orlando markets because that's where the most people are now and being a divided area each side is really trying hard to convince the voter vote my way or vote against the other person we are just the epicenter of Florida\nThat's why we often revert to the odd for a quarter of the highway to heaven\nOr the other direction if you lose but it's very critical and for Republicans this is the largest media market and second largest for Democrats\nHow does it breakdown Republican Democrat unaffiliated I Know unaffiliated voters this\nRepublican Democrat unaffiliated unaffiliated voters is getting bigger and bigger\nRight now statewide thirty seven percent registered Democrats thirty five percent Republicans and twenty eight percent other but of the twenty eight twenty seven percent would be no party affiliation the true independents the one other one percent or mostly libertarians\nAnd is that exactly how we're seeing it in his eye for a quarter that same breakdown\nPretty close to it and uh there's some variations\nWhat about money raised how is that breaking

diverse black populations and they make up about Thirteen and a half percent of registered voters the real story this election season is the fact that fifty three percent of Florida's current registered voters now are the three youngest generations\nThat would be the millennials the Gen x ers and the Generation Z which was Eighteen to Twenty one year olds think of that\nMany people still think it's all older people or what you need to know about Florida that has changed drastically that's why the number one question that we have this election cycle\nIs whether these younger people will turn out because they historically have not in a midterm\nWhether they will turn out and will they all lead in one direction or not or enough of them they can tip the election my opinion is\nThis younger demographic is going to be there's a site or in this year's election and Florida if they stay home one candidate is likely to win and men and the Republicans are if they turn out in force and
