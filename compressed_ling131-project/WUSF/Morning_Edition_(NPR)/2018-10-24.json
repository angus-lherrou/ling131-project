take some of that power away\nYou know the older you didn't see\nA faith based approach to mid term elections you always afraid of the candidates would win but we didn't do much else democratic\nChairman Tom for as is working on the Nevada governor's race as we hear elsewhere this morning\nFor years Republicans have dominated governors officers and legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw district lines for future elections Sommer our future national leaders according to the Republican who oversees his party's efforts\nThere part farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments have\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group as the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWell when you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense and when you have an environmental historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that regression to the mean\nAren't there are several states where the flipping of a couple of seats could make a significant difference or even change the chamber\nYes you have a one seat majorities in Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding\nOr what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten votes when he votes with outlook votes so it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up on the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last\nYou're being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys want to drive you got the drawing even though you've lost a lot of ground in the election how much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you've got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber wanted them being Wisconsin and two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appear to have a big majority in votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing of district lines that's where they came from right well\nI Would raise a couple of points out that um first and foremost the system we've designed as to have local representative that people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that statewide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives a is a fundamentally against uh the basic structure of our system but if\nYou drew the line differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issues that isn't there a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level um you've seen Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful is understand their district an advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election in two thousand ten and that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand Nineteen\nWell certainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if there are winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district the Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win a\nPrize in local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically it'd be more focused on sort of installing a a a master architect at sixteen hundred Pennsylvania Avenue a in a more conservative philosophy wants to defuse that power out to the localities\nThat's Matt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee after historic\nFlooding in Austin, Texas that cities one million residents have been told to boil their drinking water most shells member station KCUR has more [noise]\nThe water rushing into Austin reservoirs has the look of chocolate milk it's\nBeen so turned off by flooding around still T even when it goes off treatment plant it takes a lot longer to filter so on Monday the city told people to conserve\nWater and as a precaution to boil what they're going to use for drinking and food for the good probably guess what happened next and I'm calling you know they\nYesterday Maggie Chapman was one of a bunch of shoppers at a supermarket wheeling out bottles of water supply had improving the day before when shells were bear\nLing out bottles of water supply haven't proven the day before when shells were bear after stores started to limit how many bottles people could buy\nIt just inconvenient at this point but I start to think about you know just daily things that we use water I hadn't even thought about\nWhat kinds of things some restaurants are closed cafes aren't serving so you meet a lot of people desperate for coffee and on a more serious note the city of San Antonio central water tank or to help keep the local jail supplied with drinking water and the city of Austin worried about maintaining water pressure in its system\nWe've been providing water for a hundred years than it ever happened to us this is blowing our mind to\nGreg moved there is the director of the city's water utility he said after all that still slowed water treatment the city's system of pipes and reservoirs started to lose the pressure\nIf he loses too much pressure that said he won't be able to spray water from hoses to fight fires and water pipes risk getting contaminated as microorganisms sneak into a hole and opening they wouldn't normally access\nThe good news is there is that is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water is going into the system and water pressure has improved\nThe one thing we can control is how much water we use we can't control the weather but we can control that aspect of it\nHe says if conservation continues and the weather cooperates things could start returning to normal by this weekend if heavy rains kick up more silt and the river could last\nDays beyond that for NPR News I'm mostly shell in Austin [noise]\nAnd this is NPR News good morning It's Wednesday October twenty fourth and you're

dominated governors offices in legislatures state lawmakers make big choices about Medicaid expansion taxes roads schools and they also draw the district lines for future elections solve our future national leaders according to the Republican overseas his party's efforts\nThere part farm team and their part a current leadership\nSee his party's efforts there part farm team and their part a current leadership people underestimate the impact that state and local governments have\nMatt Walter of the Republican state leadership committee was with the group is the party captured two thirds of all state legislatures they've recently lost some ground and hope to avoid losing more\nWell when you're at all time highs you are naturally playing defense so when you have an environment that the historical trend lines are going to tell you that you're going to wind up losing seats um you have to fight against that are aggression to the ...\nAren't there several states where the flipping of a couple of streets could make a significant difference or even changed the chamber\nYes you have a one seat majorities and Colorado and New York Maine two seats are in Wisconsin and and the number of other states are quite close further compounding what you're saying is the narrow margins by which those seats chain chance ten votes twenty votes a thousand votes\nSo it is critically important for people to get out and vote\nI guess we should remember that the Virginia house of delegates after the election in two thousand Seventeen ended up\nOn the verge of being tied between Republicans and Democrats and they had to have a drawing to decide the last seat and you guys won the drawing you got the drawing even though you're lost a lot of ground in the election how much of an advantage is it for your side that Republicans were in charge of many state legislatures at the beginning of the decade and so they did the redistricting in many many states\nIt's important to make sure that you got fair and competitive lines and our contention is that better candidates with better ideas when based on ah the quality of their campaign\nThere are some pretty dramatic examples where states as a whole voted for Democrats and Republicans ended up in control of the chamber one of them being Wisconsin in two thousand twelve\nWhere Democrats appear to have a big majority in votes and yet Republicans ended up with an overwhelming majority in the state legislature that's drawing the district lines that's where they came from right\nWell I Would raise a couple of points out that um first and foremost the system we've designed as to have local representatives of people can count on carrying the interest of that community we don't have a parliamentary system\nA it's a winner take all system within districts uh and so applying a notion that a statewide total somehow should be apportioned out two representatives\nEither fundamentally against uh the basic structure of Russia but if\nYou drew the lines differently in Wisconsin the election result could have been completely different with the identical set of votes from the public\nCould have that and you could have had different candidates and you could have had different issues that isn't there a lot of hypothetical\nBut what you've seen within Wisconsin a is overwhelming Republican success at the statewide level I'm using Republican governors lieutenant governor statewide elected officials be reelected which has nothing to do with lines and you see that all across the country\nHow if at all do you advise state legislative candidates to deal with questions which must come up about President Trump\nThe state legislative level has very little to do with the federal government as it as it relates to um personality issues and dominant figures now there's obviously an environmental impact it's going to drive energy and resources in certain categories\nBut the best thing any elected official can do to be successful his understand their district can advocate for the things that are important to their constituents\nView at a wave election and two thousand ten on that went all the way down to the state level um how do you deal with the danger of a wave election in two thousand I team\nWell certainly always need to be prepared for the challenges that come but when you look at the special elections that have taken place this year if there are winding up for a wave I think they're going to be extraordinarily disappointed\nWould you argue there is something technically or politically that you are managing to do and district after district that Democrats are failing to do in order to be in position to win a prize in local government\nDo in order to be in position to win a\nPrize in local government I think part of that is an ideological difference between the two parties the Democratic and progressive movement seems historically to be more focused on sort of installing a ... a

businesses blow in our mind to\nGreg moved there is is the director of the city's water utility he said after all that silk slowed water treatment that said he'd system of pipes and reservoirs started to lose pressure\nIf it loses too much pressure that said he won't be able to spray water from hoses to fight fires and water pipes risk getting contaminated as microorganisms sneak into a hole and openings they wouldn't normally access\nThe good news is there is ... is that water conservation is working people in Austin or using less more water going into the system and water pressure has
