from the process you are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction\nAnd as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my clients unless my clients stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase fail amounts and in many cases

France was a man named among Hong way he's from China\nBut in a stunning move China's government detained mom put him under investigation and now he has resigned from Interpol I talked to NPR's Shanghai correspondent Rob Schmitz and asked him what do we know about my whole ...\nSixty four years old he served as the vice minister of public security bureau which is China's national police are twenty sixteen he became the first Chinese headed Interpol and there's no election was a big victory for trying to government which under leader Xi Jinping was eager to use Interpol to locate him extradited Chinese officials\nPaying was eager to use Interpol to locate an extra day Chinese officials that it deemed corrupt would escape China but as it turns out among himself is under investigation by Chinese authorities for corruption\nWhat exactly are they investigating him for\nWhat China's government hasn't released any details besides that he's under investigation for bribery and other unspecified crimes and the little we know about how is the tension unfolded has come from his wife greats among on September twenty fifth\nThe day her husband arrive to China for a visit she allegedly received a text from him that said wait for my call which was followed by a ... knife fish who just think that she was in danger a week later she reported him missing to French police on Sunday she spoke to reporters and we own friends wearing trouble is headquartered in here's what she said\nIn a way to go to the heat on half of my kind of thing when my children and all the people in my mother is an all the wide and children's hot ions and fathers that they may no longer disappear\nAnd then you can hear in that tape now while she's crying during this part of the video with their back turned to the camera because she's received threats and is under protection by French police\nWhat when he talks about the husbands and fathers who disappeared in China what does it mean\nWell she's talking about the government anti corruption campaign was launched by seeking paying immediately after he took office in twenty Thirteen and smeared hundreds of thousands of official both on the local level as well as among the highest echelons of the party\nIn fact the man who appointed Malone way to vice minister of public security was Julia Kong the highest ranking Chinese official who was brought down by this campaign Joe was a former member of the pull up your standing committee the group of seven men who rules China he was China's security czar before he was sent to prison for life and twenty Fifteen\nRob by removing them from the presidency of Interpol China loses a lot of sway within that organization that much is clear what does this mean for ...\nWell even before this happened trying to use of Interpol and amongst presidents he was starting to raise some red flags earlier this year China attempt at issue in red notice that it's an international alert for wanted person\nFor an exile weaker activists were yours are mostly Muslim ethnic minority who live in northwestern China who China's government blames for unrest and who are increasingly being sent to re education camps\nOther members of Interpol vetoed that particular red notice after China could not provide any evidence of criminal wrongdoing but it was an example of how China was using the organization for its own political means in this case with lung is a good example of how China's messy politics is spilling over into international organizations\nReally interesting stuff NPR's Rob Schmitz joined us from Shanghai thanks Rob thanks do\n\nAcross the United states more criminal courts are turning to video proceedings this isn't an effort to save time and money that that happens some public defenders and others in the criminal justice system are questioning whether the rights of those accused are being affected by this technology\nFrom Illinois newsroom in Urbana league games report\nToday like most days thousands of defendants will show up in criminal court for their first appearance in front of a judge it's likely that more than half of those appearances will not be in a courtroom in person then the defendant will instead face a video camera from inside a jail\nSheriff get standard like stat system he's in Lewis ten in rural west central Illinois he demonstrates what his deputies you'd have to deal\nThey would have shackles on their steps are going to be half of all we're taking and their belts are going to be chained together or you're walking on the line it's kinda like a three legged raised\nStandard says the video system they now\nAnd it's kind of like a three legged raised\nStandard says the video system they now use freeze up more of his officers for patrol and he argued that the convenience of the system is better for everyone so\nWe can become friends of ours flew in from the video camera the judge has access to the video camera or our conversation just what we are now but it's just a ... video screen\nBut Charles Davis and says it's just not the same Davidson is sixty years old and a recovering heroin user who was in and out of jails and prisons in Illinois for over two decades he finds the video process both off putting and demeaning\nWhen I first went to the radio cord it just blew 'em up because it was and everybody get up and go in front of the screen and just to you sir no sir you know you couldn't Sunni\nDavidson says when you're in the same room at the judge it's easier to have a conversation with them and he's noticed there's a greater chance to listen to what you have to say he says the first time he appeared in video court he didn't think he got a fair shake\nOh shortage glued to the judge what happens they told me to record\nSoon after Davidson was sentenced to Eighteen months in prison [noise]\nLawyer Rosalie Joyce said she hear stories like David since all the time she's with the national legal aid and defender association and says the increasing use of video court has some defense attorneys concerned that alienates the acute from those deciding their fate\nEven before the proceedings began you already feel like you're treated as though you're guilty you are feeling excluded from the process you are treated as the least important part of the process because there is nothing that can replace human interaction\nAnd as a defense attorney I Am never going to be as effective in the courtroom for my client\nUnless my clients stand shoulder to shoulder to me\nWell there's little research on video court what's out there shows it may increase bail amounts and in many cases makes private communication between attorneys and clients more public\nOn the prosecution side many defend video court for its cost savings and efficiency while acknowledging that some of those advocating for the accused say it's a trade off that's unfair to defendants for NPR News I'm league games in
