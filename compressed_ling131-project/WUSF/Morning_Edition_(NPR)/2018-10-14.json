S. political spectrum\nIt became a sold out public event in the spirit of Montana's Senator Mike Mansfield who famously modeled integrity courage and humility across the partisan aisle in the two most of the Nineteen sixties and seventies\nWe first reached out to CNN commentator Sally cone who for several years was best known as the liberal lesbian contributor to Fox News\nShe just written a book which gathered its own controversy called the opposite of hate Sally asked to be paired with Erick Erickson he was a long time executive editor of the conservative blog red state and he's an evangelical daily drive time radio host in Atlanta he enthusiastically agreed\nSince we recorded this conversation the two of them had been on polar opposite sides of the Kavanaugh hearings and as controversial as ever before\nBut I couldn't let go of a conversation I had after the event with two twelve year old girls who waited in a long line they told me that come at the insistence of a teacher and had expected to be bored\nThey were instead exhilarated and the short span of time in which they've come into political awareness they told me they had not witnessed or imagined that this was possible\nA true back and forth marked at once by bedrock difference and goodwill and humor and a willingness to bring our questions as well as our arguments our humanity as well as our positions into the room if only for an evening\nMm I'm Christian Tibet and this is on being this conversation unfolded at the dentist in theater in Missoula, Montana and with co hosted by Montana Public radio [noise]\nYou know as as I moved to ... thousand sixteen um what started being clear to me kind of midway through that era is who ever won\nUm\nDeep work that we were going to have to do as a society with about was human work about repairing like stitching relationship across that rupture that has suddenly become on you know we can no longer nuts\nThat rupture that has suddenly become on you know we can no longer not see it\nAnd that somehow that was going to involve each and every one of us wherever we were on the political or social spectrum taking some kind of stock in terms of how we got to this place and um\nYou know sell you a\nYou know you you mean you say you're a liberal like your credentials are from um\nThank you and I don't think so [laughter]\nI've worked really hard on that you know that you tell a story that I found very you know and you're you know how you\nYou grew up as a community organizer and ... said that you know right wing or is it more than my enemies and I hated them and you even grow up in a kind of a flip philosophy of community organizing that formed a lot of people that you're political enemies or a devil [noise]\nUm and you you've worked to not be that way but in this election that all read service for you um you tell this story and I think also something that you both have in common is you're both parents are right in the thick of parenting and that's influencing how that's reckoning are doing and you tell a story of being in your\nLovely leafy neighborhood block party in Brooklyn in the summer of two dozen sixteen and and there was a penny out of Donald Trump's head\nTook away the most um one was um [noise] no one thinks they're mean no one thinks they're mean and again it goes back to ... it's not just ... talking to neo Nazis and talking to terrorists people think their motivation is fundamentally good\n... and\nThese crows didn't think they were doing something mean in fact they often thought I was the one who is meaner on civil war are cooler unkind\nUm and and\nIn fact when I heard some of their stories I was so struck that here I Am mildly irritated by the annoyance of\nBeing called things I Can't repeat on public radio and online um and they're going through real hardships in their lives and I think it's unfortunate in a number of ways that this was one of the things they choose to do with their time but still\nUm no one thinks they're mean no one thinks their hateful no one wants to be able\nTo do with that what do we do about that because because we are we're we're meanness well the only thing I'll just say this was I think part of that is that they also didn't think anyone was paying attention to their tweets which is like right now but still there were like I didn't think anyone was reading them I mean they are\nAnd ready forgotten it's or it could hurt you that they make you feel the way you were feeling and the minute they had the opportunity a lot of them apologize ... thanks but why did you then do it right and it's sort of it has something to\nDo with a lack of accountability it also has to do with this way that the Internet comes to exist within our own heads\nAnd so I mean there are studies that when people have to ah you know are sort of challenged to engage on line and a computer scenario but where they can see the eyes see a video of the eyes of the person that they're writing to\nWe behave more kindly to there's this ... of technology that then allows us to fuel a demonization that you're exactly right Krista didn't begin with technology but but they they end up sort of\nNurturing an ambulance by it yeah yeah I'm ... so I mean part of what I think we do\nIs start to understand that we all have a problem\nRight and I don't look I don't I don't care who does it worse I happen to have an opinion on the matter about ah I'm actually an honest what I really think I'm curious do you agree with Eric as I come to think that\nAh that the left by and large uh\nIs nicer to humanity in general but not people in specific and conservatives are nicer to people in specific but not humanity and Jack [noise]\nThat's actually something conservatives say regularly [noise]\nSo that's really interesting and and if we can somehow figure\nOut a way to say okay you know like let's try to do both um but also from I think that point of recognizing at the at least at the very beginning nobody we all have a habit of dehumanizing and demeaning the other ...\nAnd we all think were justified and doing it because of them I've heard so many people in this election I've been a dinner party so many people\nMy liberal friday say oh they're game from supporters me that there are so he has been there so as long as they can I hate them [noise]\nBecause they're so hateful I hate it out of high end\nWe blame the people for than expressing these use as do not it's been done to them but it's inherent in them that that's who they are as people how can we say those two things at the same time so I Do think we have to have some faith in people's\nIntention to be good and uh\nIntention to be good and assume\nI Try very hard in this is where I think it is a spiritual quest I tried very hard\nTo assume I tried very hard to assume that you liked me\nIn spite of some of the foot in spite of some of the things I Know you've read\nAnd and and they're in written and said\nAbout gay people I still don't assume you mean me oh well I don't\nI can and that and that the rest of that is sort of in the tension but it's also I I I Want to believe the best in people and it seems to me that's the gift I have to give other is if I Want them to believe the best of me\nYou you actually call that a daily spiritual practice fats if you know or I mean Eric I feel like you also have been caught and one of their related dynamic throughout this\nWhich is that the culture we've created that dynamic is that we also really want to freeze people and the worst thing they ever said and then associate everybody who might be remotely like them\nOr who voted like them so but in a been a very particular instance are you said something I mean you said a lot of us here at pundit but a few years ago you you made a comment which you later really have said many times in many places I regret\nYou said something and coarse language about a Supreme Court justice\nAnd I'm wrote a whole chapter in the book about that one yes yes\nAnd um and there were goat within any adult yes I'd like to talk too much with adult about this okay and and and when we announced on Twitter that we were doing this interview and I said how excited I was to talk to both of you you know and I hadn't actually picked up I hadn't followed the saga yet that if\nSomebody came through and it shouldn't be on ... ask Erick Erickson what are you know saying this has to do with repairing civil discourse\nYou know you usually only made earlier that we sometimes in in what I did that it was I think two thousand nine\nAnd it was just I didn't know any body but it a couple of dozen people on Twitter at the time and it was just friends and it wasn't my remark it with someone else's and we were laughing about it and I took ownership of it though and I've had to apologize for nearly every day since\nUm but the number of people who still bring it up because they think I Need to be defined by the yeah and I've gotten a lot of people you wouldn't see there's about right\nActually I wrote several weeks ago about people in the right suddenly being okay with dictatorship as long as it goes their way and the common themes or one people don't know the record but to the fact that both sides really are at a disturbing point in this country\nWhere as long as their site is winning they don't care\nUh and I think that is only possible again and I hate to sound like worker record all those but it really is where my heart is right now that it only matters when we're oblivious to the people in our city blocks\nTo the homeless people in our community when it's just national politics from Washington is the be all end all of everything everything's obstruct because none of us are in Washington\nI'm don't look I think it's very ... to point just it's dangerous to suggest the justice sort of return to prevent ... emerging it could be the solution right because we have to remember that\nBefore the Internet before globalization and global interconnectedness and global awareness we still had segregation and we still had sexism we still had homophobia we still had all the things we had a lot of things that I think made this country great but a lot of things I think that we had to work on and that that\n... that especially given the historical way in which our neighborhoods have been shaped led to a lot of my opium so I'd say that look I have a bent on this\nTo a a lot of my opiate so I'd say that look I have a bent on this and I I'm clear on it which is I Will never be nicer I Want everyone to have less and I think progressive should lead the way to go first to\nFeel like look to the points that were making here or if there was a sign that says that professes\nUm that people can change and grow and in fact that is a core of progressive politics is that please don't stay where we've been as a country in the divisiveness of\nRacial segregation and slavery and the subjugation of women and the you know yawning inequality economic inequality we are not we don't have to stay there please don't stay there let's progress that is the idea of progression that that just made it invites\nChange in the country at an individual's and so if you if if your vision involves people changing and growing then you have to be able to literally practice what you preach and creates space for people to change in ...\nWhen you see this because I said something somewhere on the right to you know we we've got to we've got to improve ... review others are we going to reverse or\nAnd I get a lot these days will that unilateral disarmament we we can't be nicer because the other side's gonna there's this is absolutely use the the lack of faith to believe the other side is capable of growing\nYeah I um I get it to 'em I still have friends that you know activists and organizers who feel like hate and and ... says one of the strongest tools in their toolbox\nUm you know look I just I always returned to I'm One of my favorite quotes Martin Luther king quote and he says darkness cannot drive out darkness only light can do that yeah hate is not the answer to hate and he said\nHey is too great a burden to bear correct yeah and and you can't hate your way out of hey yeah\nI don't know what I Want to say liberals and I love that definition of progressive\nBut I don't think progressive have you know a corner on the market of believing in human gross and change right and and you are a ... a a devout evangelical Christian and conversion is an important value and belief in Christianity\nYou have to be open to being persuaded yourself these are two way street they have to be and not like you're faking it really authentically meaningfully hearing what someone else is saying [noise]\nUm I don't look we have to do something about um the way in which our lives in our communities are segregated and that is increasingly ideological ah it's also racial economic um\nAnd you know it's a very interesting thing about the gay thing right like you could have these stealth gay people I was one\nWhere I was like ... in my family that whole time and then suddenly surprise I'm gay and they already liked me so it's sort of worked out well and that's why we've got a quick progress on gay rights as a country that doesn't usually happens say with like black people are Muslims\nYou know like your cousin doesn't just suddenly one day come out of the shows\nThat you know look kids to go to racially integrated elementary schools ... grow up to actually they have less racial bias\nAnd college students who participate in racially integrated uh activities and after school programs are actually reduce their racial bias so there's something about us knowing each other [noise] being together relating to each other but then how much more positive effect\nMore broadly Mm mhm [noise]\nActually I actually leads me to one of the questions I Want to ask a three um [noise] as we wind down which\nIs if the goal of a robust civility is not that we agree\nRight and that in fact ah we really do have some deep deep differences where there's not even going to be a lot of common ground in the room but I think an assumption we're making hair or a proposition\nIs that we we're not we're not going to let common ground easy common ground be a prerequisite for common life like we're going to insist on creating something called con life that if it is about\nAlso just learning to disagree better when we're integrity more personal integrity not hating 'em what what difference does it make and like the two of you have been and you're both really good at saying you know I'm not perfect at this you know Sally says\nI haven't learned to stop hating it and and and and Eric ... yeah you said some of them not what your book you know you said the need for a relationship and community as why it pains me to have to acknowledge what a jerk I have been and\nStill be on social media so so this is a work in progress for any of us we're all sinners\nYeah so so this is a work in progress for any of us we're all centers um what is the experience you have a what does shift what shifts swept becomes possible what difference does it make\nI um\nHave had the experience myself\nOf being unexpectedly kind in the face of people being cruel online are off and seeing the difference it makes in yourself\nIn for Neal better I feel better when I'm not a jerk I just do 'em try it\nUm but it and then as well mhm uh people\nWrite back and say hey you're you're All right you know I'm your friend warning you that you might like it [laughter] ah\nI had the privilege of finding example after example I mean\nThere are ... credibly powerful stories of people who were you know professional hate mongers or kids who were just saying nasty violent racist things and who the targets\nOf that hate showed kindness and generosity and transformed those dynamics\nOn Twitter people who left entire hate movements because the people who they hadn't been raised thinking we're hateful showed them kindness and I have to say I'm aware of the power of the burden\nThat in a way this suggests is that those who are perhaps if you believe it's not even those who perhaps are at the receiving end of more of the hate\nShould have to shoulder the burden of taking the high road I I get that there are times where it feels daily unjust and an end in some cases it's too much to ask for like there's going to laugh at us and the other hand this is where those of us who are yeah privileged can in fact step up\nYeah and also I Want to say I I look I Believe in the high road I Believe in treating people like they are all extraordinary and beautiful in equal and so I Do feel like that is the that is it that is the work\nAnd I I Am blown away by the difference it makes\nIt which I'm always struck um are you ... if it ... riddle to some degree or what is the first bad\nIn scripture but what is the very first bad thing that happens in genesis it's not Cain and Abel and it's not the fall the serpent in the apple especially in the garden of Eden before evil even ears world God says it's not good for men to be alone\nThat's the first bad loneliness and show many of us concoct\nRelationships and communities on line\nAnd we're still alone and then we get in our tribes\nA Republican conservative liberal progressive Democrats will that tribes then becomes a loan insulated we don't mix and mingle with the other and when you don't mix and mingle with the other it's a lot easier to believe the other is the enemy\nAnd I really push myself more\nAnd I really push myself more and more to to make sure I'm actually having physical interaction with other people you know we were with a wife\nWho had cancer\nAnd I know we're we're running out of good years um and being in middle Georgia where most of my friends are on line a and not there\nAre more and more mindful of the fact that it really is necessary for people to an actual real friends\nAnd I don't think there's a coincidence that all related Lee that we both began having these internal
