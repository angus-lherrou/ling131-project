Khan writes vinegar the things you buy in supermarkets but\nWhen you taste a real race vinegar it's kind of like taking a shot of ... or ... for the first time a there is so much expression [laughter] there's so much tear war to it and\nMuch expression [laughter] there's so much tear war to it and raise vinegar can be the same way there isn't just acidity there there is flavor\nAre dependent on what kind of rice to use and how much it's polished down and on top of that you know the traditional race when air come as you as probably the standard the gold standard of rights many years in Japan but then there's the suit this red vinegar\nMade from the age ... and it literally turns almost black and Nikki wouldn't boxes before it crashed um then there's ... from the south west of the ... province and it's black vinegar that's used more as a drinking vinegar than it is as something in common area practices\nHappening there are so many different flavors of vinegar and we know about things like say you know ... or ... in the vinegar but some of the elements maybe it's more scientific elements that give vinegars there distinct flavors\nWell then there is nothing more than four to six percent a CD acid in solution and that pollution is\nWater so kind of like wine there all these\nVolatile s jerseys aromas that are carried within that solution\nSo that's what you're chasing and that's what you're smelling so when you're making an infusion you're calculating whatever that aroma is in that solution in pairs with the guy said and you know kind of goes through that olfactory motion of tasting smelling but vinegar or a is often the sensation before it's a flavor\nSo you have that on your palette you you have that you know feeling of brightness of lightning it makes you celebrate a little bit and that's when it hits that's when the flavors get picked up so like I had been saying before it is a carrier but the thing that it ... does is open up your palate to be able to experience those flavors\nIf anyone is going to get a snake vinegar at home it's going to the year ... [laughter] what some of the basic tools we need to get started\nWell first you need a good juice I'm vinegar is made from any starch that can convert into sugar that can turn into an alcohol and then eventually become vinegar or see the gas it\nSo you have to find one of those basis uh starches include grains and Rice's sugars include honey and Cain um fruits and vegetables as well so you have to define what you want to make it up because you have to figure out what you're going to use it for\nAnd they used to be like a thousand bucks to two hundred is way way cheaper now too so I guess the time starts to kill any dinner like so much for that\n[laughter] and thanks for having me [noise]\n\nMollie ... is executive editor of science at America's Test kitchen you can find those who've read recipe for Mexican roast pork coach needed the deal that splendid table dot org [noise] coming up I get to talk with you and we have a love story that evolved over oysters [noise] I'm Frances\nLab and this is the splendid table from ATM American public media\nNext time on studio three sixty since we were so low water before it's the public perception of late force than is\nKind of had been doing one commercial how those TV commercial dig we're funding Orson Welles unfinished final passions project you said as an actor or buy him a prostitute but as a director I remain virginal Oscar winning filmmaker Morgan novel on Orson Welles next time on studio three sixty\nStay with us for studio three sixty just ahead at three o'clock join us election night for special coverage beginning at seven o'clock with an hour long call in show asking voters about your experience in the mid term election\nThat at eight o'clock is local and national returns from the U.S up news team at NPR you can become a reading ... here with the United way son toasted mentor\nChildren preschool through third grade would need a little extra reading help and encouragement information a ball and tearing his United Way sun ... dot org slash reading pals\nYou're listening to the splendid table from eight PM American public media I'm Frances lamb\nWe're both you by double immune prep service delivering fresh corn made dinner catch that our table ready in Fifteen minutes with just one pound\nDoubled does the ... works do you spend less time chopping him more time with family learned more gobbled dot com slash splendid end by progressive insurance compare and car insurance rates for multiple insurers so shoppers can evaluate options in one place not vast progressive\nComparisons are available at progressive dot com one eight hundred progressive [noise]\nAll right now it's time for us to talk you could find is always on Facebook or Twitter or pick up that phone one eight hundred five three seven five to five to we want to know what you're cooking and sixty about let's do it [noise] we as Amanda on the line from Decatur, Georgia in Bend Oregon\nGood how are you I'm well thank you what would you like to talk about so about ...\nI'm well thank you what would you like to talk about\nSo about a year ago I went to my friend ... challenged beautiful liquor is that right there and I was so jealous I couldn't stop talking about it my wife and got me well I think a little ... the joke and then for my birthday this year he got me the phrase ... they make something with them\nA problem with I don't know what to make with them um I accidentally get a little bit I made chicken like ... I made 'em some ... that's really all I Know how did you and I would love to be able to use the lord shall off you know age I guess\nPart of the you got as a gift a big cast iron and an animal casts our brains are about what signs\n[noise] um I Would say probably watching inches pretty large\nA big you know we got a big oh yeah\nOh cool and then you have some cats aren't costs which was like the big of a little mini brings it was right and how big are those are\nSome way shape or and I can okay so what so and\nI have to say they're really cute like they're really adorable um I think baked eggs are shuttered eggs or you know something like that really kind of they're just so pretty in there and honestly I don't own a type of pot because I'm\nA I have to be honest at home I cook a little bit more Neanderthal there so I um [laughter] so I don't use them a whole lot but I think yeah something like that like a single serving of\nMaybe like a if you want to do like a spoon bread in there or like you know do it on the side I'm at a really nice dinner or Jew for like a breakfast or ... if you're doing a beautiful little baked eggs with a little bit of cream and there may be a slice of two of country ham\nAnd just sort of low heat in the oven to sort of gently bake they're just so beautiful that way and you take off the top and it's just such a pretty presentation um but\nYou're twelve or fourteen inch brazen and they were talking can that\nIs a really fun to be the appointment to have [noise] I think from that\nI Want to talk to you about in general what I think that kind of pot turns really well to what I think it's a beautiful about like a big cast iron an animal brains are you saying it's a cast iron so hold Pete really well\nAnd I think people want to usually think about that in terms of like oh that means you can crank the heat up and and like get like amazing like hardcore searing action there which you certainly can but for me I think what's exciting about that is that\nIt can actually hold heat really evenly when you're cooking it a less intense temperature and so what that means to me is\nIf your steering say you know short ribs you want to do some brain short ribs or if you want to raise chickens and you want to see or to the skin or you want to do something like um like a pork shoulder you know like a nice sort of like heartier kind of meat\nI think what's great if you can get that thing hot but only like medium heat or medium high heat instead of having like wrap it up to all the way high you know what I mean\nAnd you know get your oil there and get your protein like pat dry with paper towel season them lamb and they're gently and what's really nice about that if you can get such a\nMore intense or like a deeper sphere is maybe a better way to describe it and the pan hold that heat so well\nAnd you can take Fifteen minutes you know to get a good year on all four sides of a short you know like really take your time with it and you get this really beautiful crust the you know it doesn't burn it because you're not having a over such a crazy flame\nBut you know just really get that theory nice in deep into the ... does that make sense\nAnd that's something I didn't really think about what that piece of equipment that I thought it was kind of ...\nSomething I didn't really think about what that piece of equipment because I associate it with kind of stealing or break they are no longer not smart see things more moist things\nYeah and what's really awesome them though is once you get that really nice dark fear\nThem what you do is you also get you know all those great sticky brown bits on the bottom that haven't Bert event you continue to you that your brain like you said the stew and that's when you add your liquid you cannot you know beer or wine or stock or you know whatever using\nAnd it just build so much flavor and then you put it in there and put the lid on put an oven and I just think it's great for that kind of cooking to looks beautiful when you pull out of the oven and you can take the lid off and just sort of a write in part because it's just going to be such a cool rustic beautiful dish what a gift\nIt only gets on the U.S [laughter] like oh I gave you this thing and now you're cook food I get to eat out of it too [laughter]\nOh yeah it was it was perfect for both of us to tell you the\nTruth like well enjoy it I'm so glad to hear that you got the gift that you want to\nThank you thank you I'm excited to eat it All right let's now go was Louis you're making it yeah absolutely thanks for the call thank\nYou\nSo we have a question from an anonymous call her\nA hopefully it's not 'cause they're ashamed of their question but ah so this gentleman bought a contraption to make ... noodles and he wants to learn how to cook the noodles like noodles turnout machine when he does them any really prefer them to be more authentic [noise] um I don't know exactly how the gentleman's cooking his bikini noodles but I think\nMy first reaction is to say probably what you want to do is cooked some in smaller batches than what you're doing over higher he because what happens when you have like you know it's still ... they're going to look like beautiful linguine or whatever but it's filtered teeny Andrew teeny eight cooks really fast\nAnd get yourself really fast and if you have a big pile of it in a pan than what's going to happen in you know the stuff on the surface of the hands of cooking and getting soft himself in the middle in quite cooked yet so would I Would suggest is divided into small batches maybe just a handful at a time\nAnd get your Pam ripping hot put in some nice oil maybe ... whatever you want to do whatever the rest beers and just give them quit tossing them hand just until they softened up on the outside take 'em out start over and just do not until you get all you can you talk [noise]\nAll right so a little while ago we asked you all for your secret ingredients and let us know what are the things that you you said you know that we might have never thought to use and we have Erica on the line from Seattle right now to tell us about her hair and how are you\nI'm ... I'm good how are you\nI'm well thank you so what is your secret ingredient\nSo my secret ingredient is a new mommy powder [noise] um and ...\nAnd ... and ... mushrooms and that are pulverized should've very fine powder on land that gives them things you know for a big chicken for example the typical things like burgers and meatloaf I recently did it on the savory oatmeal that was phenomenal\nOh cool where do you buy this [noise]\nNo I've made it I can tell you the rest of it like [laughter]\nYeah I usually do\nAbout six tablespoons of Bonita flakes and then an ounce each of ... mushrooms and ...\nAre going to come from the ...\n... is even [noise] um the ... and you don't have to reconstituted or anything like that you just use it as is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "city": "Tampa", "day": "28"}
