I think we're both in the same boat that we never knew her personally we never met her I was right but are both fascinated inspired by her so tell me how you got to be that way\nI was introduced to her through gourmet magazine in two thousand eat when the editors publish entire issue devoted to the American south and they built that issue around an essay that have been published posthumously written by the Senate Louis called what a southern\nAnd in this essay or miss Lewis position to the culture of the American south and the culture of the African American south in particular alongside\nThe kind of work a day ... kitchens and also alongside of music and literature and painting and other forms of art and for me it was this incredibly\nStriking moment as someone who was interested in food in and really desperately wanted to get involved in the work of food it was a really key moment in sort of seeing what it was like to try to put food alongside these other bastions of culture and to try to make sense of that and I never heard of that and Louis before that I loved cookbooks I Love cooking\nUm but I I had no idea who she was I didn't know much about the American south I didn't come from there I grew up in New York\nAnd I sort of quickly realized I needed to know who she was\nSo I ordered some for books and I read them and sell in love with her and it was many years later that I was working with a notice is editor Judith Jones who's the editor that also published\nJulia Child in modern ... oh my gosh the list goes on Claudia in Rhode Island and yes the diary of Anne Frank famously edge of the time and really sort of a cannon of American cookbook author is their English writing I should say ... and she published and the Lewis says most famous book the taste of country cooking in Nineteen Seventy six\nAnd in interviewing Judith Jones about his work\nIt became apparent to me that her book that she did with missile Lewis was a real hinge points for her but she turned away from working primarily with authors who are writing about international cuisines and cultures to someone who's writing very explicitly about American clean and culture and a very particular region within America\nAnd it for me it was a sort of stand up that sort of temp to attention and pay attention moment in into the Joneses career\nOf what it meant in you think about the kind of mid seventies what was going on politically in this country and the women's movement civil rights Vietnam War it's come to an end I mean this really tremendous moment of conflict and confusion I think around our identity what it meant to publish a book\nFrom the perspective of an African American woman about the American tells the rural American South and then through the perspective of home cook\nOn and it just I think for many people who come across that it was this really\nBeautiful piece of writing it was extremely political in its sensibility and sort of unfortunately direct a it was making a statement that it was not going to a gym down your throat um and you need to kind of be ready to receive it and her in your own time and I think for a lot of people that come late many many decades after its original publication\nWhat do you mean by ... ... when you say that came late\n[noise] well you know it's really interesting you can read the taste of country cooking and love it it's a ... and sort of leave it at that the recipes are wonderful the pros is lyrical and beautiful at rights of of living on a farm in a farming community\nIn a rural part of Virginia and sort of moving through the season the work of foraging of working in the field of putting food up in the kitchen of eating alongside one another but if you read more closely if you look at the way the menus are organized as sort of holidays that are being celebrated like revival or emancipation day\n... this is a work of African American history in the American south of of really giving dignity to that culture as its own entity in a lot of ways that's\nSeparate from what American culture mhm\n[noise] so I I wrote a story about to lose a number of years ago and in my research ... cold you open and spoke with you and your ...\nGo and do my research ... called you up in and spoke with you and you inspired me to think of a lot of things that I I didn't think it before\nIt including by I think this idea of the face of country cooking as being always a political work like you said it's beautifully written and it's very easy as a as a friend of mine put it to think of ms Lewis as oh just the sweet old lady yes a sweet old lady writing about her time growing up in the country\nBut I was struck by how she position the life of\nBlack people rural black people in the early Nineteen hundreds of people who ... her her grandparents who are the people who founded the community she grew up in where in slave if they were trying to explain that one that's right and\nI think if you think of that story you dimensional story that was one of hardship and you know just trying to scrape by and and she writes about it like the most beautiful society the most beautiful community it with the life of beauty literally children are singing in the book yeah and\nI thought that was so powerful and so remarkable to say\nHey whatever stereotypes you have of us ... if you're not including the fact that we created this beautiful cuisine your started after all that's right and that's\nA profoundly political thing it's a massive correct and I think just so much of what had been written in what continues to you've written\nThat the lights on the American south and black culture with in that large regional culture of large series of regional cultures that was one of just hardship and poverty and that even though these needing communities that were financially pour their life with rich\nAnd and that included bounty you know if this had nothing else they always had food on their table and lots of it um and and things that we think that's sort of still is luxury food meets cream butter and foraged mushrooms mean for I mean this is stuff that people pay top dollar for now and this was\nYou know this was everyday food by virtue of the life they had created for themselves\nThey're ... they're literally making souffle it in their kitchen literally yeah yeah that's right and there's also this fearlessness to it too and I think is so\nAgain maybe subtle uh maybe I'm reading stuff into it that isn't that wasn't intended to be there but there's a scene I remember a small tropical hog killing and she describes the tradition of you know when you bought the hogs in the fall and how they put up all the different parts and\nThere's just really incredible image of and they take the bladders out and they blow the butter looked like balloons and tie them and those are the Christmas ornaments when they're dried like you know several months later if I\nCan you imagine like being that close to the guts right literally ... and but also remember reading it and the way she describes the hogs after they've been slaughtered\n...\nIt almost sounds I mean the way she described in the hanging quietly like statues it's like that song strange fruit it's it's almost like a Lynch scene and then I found later that when she was young there was a black man and a nearby community to hers\nWho was lynched after he had talked to a white woman and asked her to help them with their ... yeah and I have no idea if that's what she intended to be a connection but it's like now you know this many years hence understanding history or hopefully understanding history as we do an adult reading list [noise]\nUm and the reality of it I I Can't help but think put Amazon had those things in her mind certainly I'm On a few broke them in that scene but\nYeah I think that's what I Am a leading to the sense that she was so unsafe lynching and her probably you know that that there was incredible ... much he presented us whether it was beautiful or difficult are often both at the same time\nWhether whether it was beautiful or difficult are often seen time and and that she was going to see it sort of quietly and many people in New hurting her as being fairly quiet woman she often say more than needed to be fat and she said nothing at all especially with an open her mouth or play pen to paper\nIf it's going to be with clarity it was going to be concise and she wasn't going to dart away from ... and and then she just Minnesota place it there and leave it there and and you can see that\nYou know for the beautiful find or you can read it for the difficult side or if you're ready you can try to find out you know apart from that and I think there and like your balance\nYeah man credible incredible life thank you so much to her and my pleasure fans\nFranklin the editor of Edna Lewis at the table with an American which\nShe teaches writing at NYU and she's

Cuba narrowly anyhow\nSo what are some of the differences in the southern food that send to grow up with and what we I think more stereotypical you think of as being southern food\nWell I think they overlap I think the food didn't miss Edna grew up with because she lived in an agricultural seasonally inflict the universe was very local very local\nWe talk about the kind of cooking that she did which was very for one of a better term sophisticated ... but I mean sophisticated in its simplicity the sophistication of ms and the food is that it's simple\nAnd simply beautifully done\nIt is about the manner in which it is cooked it is about the ingredients in his about all of that now that inflict in various different ways throughout the south\nI'll never forget speaking with Leah Chase in New Orleans and Mrs chase simply said you know\n... are picky about what they put in their pot [laughter] okay [laughter] they are they're very very\nPicky about what goes into the various dishes African Americans have not always had\nThe ability to be as picky or picky about what goes into the pots and sometimes then that makes for a different kind of cooking to the degree that you have a choice to the degree that you have ability to the degree that you have\nVariations or things that you can grow raise all of that right the best of the best is what is fair\nWhen those things go arrive when those things aren't quite as universal with one my hope then you get other kinds of food then you've got other kinds of cooking then you get that stuff that I call hardscrabble [noise] you know my mother was\nVirginia My father was up country Georgia\nThat always plays out at the dinner table my dad was shuttling man but collard greens the hog mall all of those things my mother was the you know roast pork with crackling and you know stuff like that so you get diversions right but it's ...\nStuff like that for diversions right but it's always the best of what you can serve\nSlowly thank you so much for talking with us today disgusted she's always a pleasure thank you for having me [noise] that was Jessica the Harris author of many books latest hold my soul looks back\nAnd fun fact about her the national museum of African American history and culture actually called on to define the different regions dislike cooking for their service restaurant\nJoan Egypt in Martin is a hero and full disclosure she's an author I work with but before I knew her knew that she was working on a massive project a book called the ... at the history of African American cooking told through her research through two hundred years of black and\nThey paint this picture of it would seem that way more diverse\nTechnical and sophisticated than the stereotypes blacks and [noise] so I knew that she must have a story rooms where after the joined us today a Tony read the happier [noise] Hey Frank thanks for having me how old how did you meet him and said\nWell you know ours was a chance meeting many many years ago when I was a young journalist at the LA Times\nAnd I attended a conference that she was at and I'm embarrassed to say that I did not know who she was but um she was surrounded by adoring fans who did know men so I went over to introduce myself to her and find out what\nIt was that made her so special and it didn't take long for me to figure that out\nWhat about you about her\n[noise] well you know I have to say that my initial reaction was clearly one of her typical stature I'm sort of like going on that first blind date right you have [laughter] traction\nAnd you you don't know anything about the person and um but she was so incredibly beautiful and statue west and\nSo poised intelligent and\nClear headed and not to say that other African American women aren't that it's just that\nThat the impression that she late\nIt's amazing 'cause so many will describe her as being regal\nThat's usually the ... name was in fact Regina right it's like she was fated to that wow I don't know if I knew that a while well you know we get stuck\nSometimes in in making physical observations but\nHave to say that given the work that I've been doing and how it started in my desire to find an alternative view of African American women in the food world I don't guess that I can escape the fact that what she looked like made a huge impression on me as well\nBecause he was so contrary to the stereotype miss about ... character ah as being the representation of an African American women in the kitchen\nAnd my goal with my all of my work is to use African American cook as an example of people who have been disparaged and spoken about prejudice fully", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "city": "Tampa", "day": "07"}
