incredible\nStory about a pilgrimage in India to cook for a garden and we'll hear about an iconic writer who mused on both feasting and faster but let's get the desert first\nDown [noise] do they do\nWhen I was in ... school Fifteen Years ago I knew a woman named Stella\nShoot the pastry chef in the making and we really didn't know each other that well but she was smart and thoughtful and at some point I went through a really rough patch where I really needed a friend and she was there and she showed me untrue kindness [noise]\nMuch graduated not long after and we fell out of touch with eight years later we found each other on the Internet\nShould become extra chef but even more should be done writing\nQuirky terrific blog and eventually got more and more into writing about\nScience in history of desert getting inspired by how classic cookies and take some pies and putting were made in the past and then re imagined those recipes for the president [noise]\nAnd just a few months ago I was so thrilled to see her first cookbook Braveheart debut on the New York times so\nA hostile thanks so much for joining us examined me [noise]\nSo I Want to talk to you about the subtitle of your book actually it's iconic American desserts so what makes a desert iconic American\nWanted to be a collection of desserts that the majority of us could say played an important role in our childhood so for me growing up in Kentucky sweet potato pie was a tremendous tremendously important desert that we always had her on the holidays than that\nA tremendously important desert that we always had around the holidays and that you know people just made in general\nAnd I realized pretty quickly that you know outside of the house not a lot of people are eating sweet potato pie\nAnd and that that's not iconic it's a very American desert but it's not iconic because there's plenty of Americans who you know born and raised here this is their country this is the culture that they love and they've never had that until I didn't want the book to be a collection of\nRegional desert or deserts that are important to some people but not others I wanted to be the celebration of all the desserts that connect us together coast to coast and\nSo how did you decide which ... qualified\nMaybe it's kind of like that um classic a quota about porn you'll you'll know when you see it but you kind of have this instinct right like I mean to me like yellow cake Betty Crocker and Duncan Heinz have ensure that yellow cake it's something that all Americans had a chance to try and love and\nWe all know white cake is and we all know chocolate chip cookies are and so on a certain level of some of it's instinctual but then there's other ones that\nLoom a little bit larger due to pop culture or something like ... pie and so that was kind of a at least a starting point for determining what it was on some of it was a little bit crowd sourced on Twitter and just asking people like\nIt the pilgrimage where millions of women traveled to one city to cook a dish together and that sense\nAnd traveled to one city to cook a dish together and that simplifying on it a little bit um but it really is it's about devotion to one got us and they're traveling to the home of this got us and her temple and a city called ... and\nThe the trains are filled with women starting a few days ahead of time for all going to the place the fares are actually suspended for women who are going so they have a free ride 'em and the women are taking with them a single bag usually\nThey have a bad that it's filled with\nAll of the ingredients that they need to cook what's called ... and the entire ceremony revolved around arriving to the temple arriving to the city and everyone's setting up and what they're setting up our\nA makeshift horse of three bricks a clay pot and some usually coconut bark for firewood and he set up all over the city so they're in how many women are you talking it's been about a million or two million I'm ... wow\nYes it's hard to hold on your mind thinking about what one or two million women look like and this year the temple actually reported that it was close to four million wow big year okay so they're all going to a single temple devoted to a gotta yeah that's the way that they refer to her is actually called my mom\nUm she sometimes conflated with another got us and there's there's such mythology around all of us that this is what's so interesting about this\nThe Scottish she's an incarnation of a female deity usually known as ... collie and um she worshipped locally by these women and she's seen it sort of a a giving figure but also a very intense strong and sometimes furious figure\n... so set the scene for me so you were there and there's millions of women are setting up makeshift hearth with three bricks right mhm and they're going to cook simultaneously mhm which is an amazing bought 'em and tell me about what they're cooking [noise] so\nThe morning that this happens and women wake up very early as they wake up to prepare themselves they they wash their hair they wash the rice um\nThey dressed often and new clothing I was told that women are often brand new outfit just for the ceremony um and then they all gather around the hearts that they've made the city actually provides the bricks for the hard and and sometimes the pots\nAnd they they wait until\nThe signal from the temple comes and the signal is that um the priest and the temple light the fire\nAnd that fire gets passed on from woman to women and then there are also volunteers running around and helping to light hearted so all at once at the same exact moments all around us it either speakers that women light a fire\nAnd they all start cooking\nSo was actually really incredible about this is the smell you're you're walking around the city all of its smoking all over the place and everything smells like burn rice and fire and coconut park and these women it's Ninety seven degrees there sweating their smoke in their eyes\nAnd they're all praying they're all looking\nAt their pots looking at the sky all in that same active devotion at the same exact moment [noise]\n[noise] and they're really cooking so tell us a it's a right to porridge yes\nBecause they basically they start off they have a a clay pot over an open fire 'em they add water they wait for the water to boil and then they have this specific kind of race it's called Carolyn rice or read rice it's got a partial has left on so it has a ... hue\nAnd they scatter rice into the pot usually in three handful [noise]\nAnd then the they wait for that\nThe pot usually in three handful and\nThen the they wait for the for the pot to boil and part of the ceremony at the ... over to satisfy the got so when you look around all the pots are bubbling over at the start of steamy was beginning to be a rice porridge\nAnd they eat it then they did so they they it's been time cooking it to the right to get stuff like any rice dish wedding and then at the end\nAnd they add all of the seasonings and sweet flavor it and it depends on where the women are from some you know some women say that you have to add eat because either a purifying a sort of symbol um many women Atkins I there's always coconut there's always cardamom there's always\nA what's called ... which is an honor find palm sugar and\nUh at the end they they cover their pot once it's cooked they cover it with a banana leaf and they wait for ... to come around that can take hours instead of in the interim time they eat lunch they sit around and they each other's shoulders at a nap\nAnd then when the priest kinds they all get behind their hearts again they\nTake off the banana leaf and the ... comes in scattered holy water over their their pot and then they're free to yet and this moment it's so beautiful because it's a thing that I've been waiting for all year that's the sort of symbol of feeding themselves feeding the gods getting their families\nAnd they all take months alone they taste each other's tongues Ala they feed each other\nAnd then they put the banana leave back over top they packed the pots away and they leave\n[noise] definitely it's such a beautiful story thank you for coming in thinking how [noise]\n\n\n\nWhat did we Paris so it's a contributing editor for a magazine you can read her

something a bit counterintuitive about\nMaking the claim that an author most people have never heard of it was one of the most important food writers or the last half century\nUh there were many incarnations of patients gray she was born in ... in the south of England grew up mostly in the country although she went to to queens college in London and then the London School of economics\nAt a remarkable experience during the war raising two children out of wedlock and lived in a tiny cottage only by her mother or through to the Nineteen fifties when she returned to London and took up a career as a translator editor and writer eventually publishing her first cookbook butter Jordan I too\nUh and writer eventually publishing her first ...

K. Fisher who has far greater notoriety or than patients does and patience wrote about\nA food and uh ideas and the food that that have really become mainstream today so in some ways it's surprising that she hasn't better known you know I I still encounter people today who say that honey from weed or changed their life and you know that's something you don't often hear about a cookbook yeah\nAppearances first cookbook ... it was published in the Nineteen fifties it was extremely influential in England uh what was it like and how to set the table for her future work\n... was a remarkable book and as you say it was a a run away a best seller published in Nineteen fifty seven\nAnd one of the first mass market paperbacks of its kind penguin\nUp until that point I hadn't done a

five to seven five to five to [noise]\nWe have Fernando from point a to Ecuador\nFernando how're you call your friendship is for you too thank you for the call\nYour voice is such a familiar and pleasant one it permeates our entire house speakers and all the rooms and we listen to you so much and so so often that you're like my brother and you've been you've been here at all\n[laughter] well thank you I Hope to actually conduct with her one day because it's a credibly beautiful but uh what are we talking about\nWell here's the uh we live in a very hot place or do we get a real like Lori ... like eighty five degrees and actually sweater uh it's it's very hot and humid all the time so stuff spoils really quickly we refrigerate everything\nAll the time so stuffed spoils really quickly we refrigerate everything [noise] and uh you know even refrigerate things like red wine and sometimes even salt not not so much for the soul mates preservation but just to keep it dry\nAnd a ... and so we we really are are very careful with a you know how we store sayings and one day we were having a party and a friend came a friend that just came from Italy and he brought us a huge piece of prosciutto a huge chunk like\nThree pounds something like it's like six inches by five inches by about four inches high a huge piece of pro should do is just my wife and I\nWe we love it when in fact we call it ... around him and uh we we do enjoy it but we didn't know what to do it to ... chunk [noise]\nAnd so in the midst of the party at my wife says why should we cut the what we are sitting alleged ... put it in the freezer for now she put it in the freezer and it's been there [noise] and ah anyway we have no idea what to do once we ... we cannot possibly\nThree pounds or ... before it was for oil and I totally committed\nTo your chair suggestions because this morning knowing out speaking to my what pulled out of the ... is currently defrosting\nIn the refrigerator [laughter] oh wow so you're okay there's no turning back yeah there's no [laughter]\nYou've you've got the guardian not on the phone numbers you know I see this is an interesting problem I Am honored than you would trust me with it I Hope it don't fill you I have to say I've never actually had to deal too much with a giant fruit and block appreciate them before that's a [noise] a thing in the end of ... in some ways a blessing problem\nNow have to tell you given the fact that it was frozen in a home freezer I don't know how well it's going to do for us meaning if you're on my way and my question to\nYeah you only give you flash freeze meats and things of that nature in a in an industrial freezer that didn't work because it freeze so quickly\nThat the ice crystals um stay pretty small but just like ... and then they're they're they're in their home freezer begin to take a while but ice crystals start to grow and they and they start to poke through the cell wall and so you may find it leaks from Jews\nAnd your main line that the texture when you when you bring it out it's not going to be quite in um for more you know sort of to some of the ones before and maybe not as delicate\nThat said if it's not totally do frosted what I might think a lot of doing and\nIf you have a deli or if you haven't done we slice yourself you know a deli nearby men don't consider running over there and having them slice it thin won it still a partially frozen\nSo ... license and\nYou know package it however many slices you ... you might have the time and then if it's still kind of still frozen you can re freedom not too much damage that the only thing you can do now is um hey you know maybe you won't have the same beautiful texture as when it was you know originally\nA fresh per se um but it's not thinking about cooking with it\nThat's what I was going to ask dessert cooking solution because I I thought the same thing that it would probably watch list at first it even if it were sliced up it wouldn't be quite the same\nYeah I mean I Would think use it in in in ways where maybe your wrapping it around something maybe your wrapping it around this piece of chicken you wrapping it around me and then you can sort of serious so you become the layer of flavor [noise] I don't know\nYou can cut it into ... and use it to do some vegetables it'd be beautiful with green beans it'd be beautiful with green I'm treating\nGreen beans it'd be beautiful with greens I'm treating it like a song the cure ham if you're if you're not in a position to be able to enjoy it and that sort of like silky thin sliced a\nState [noise] you know I assumed that since sliced of phase of it slices over it would be something\n[laughter] I wondered even or even maybe we're just putting the whole thing and the slow cooker and sort of raising the whole ...\nYou know I have never done that but I I think right where like freedom another word for nothing left to lose\n[laughter] so hey try it and I'm\nSure someone in Italy with like you know role in their grave when they heard someone done this to a procedure but hey I'm sure it'd be delicious 'cause a lot of flavor is still there for sure\nThe texture of me and all the flavor on a beautiful cures labor is going to be there so if you do that and the smoker\nI'm sure the liquid that comes out would be incredibly rich delicious\nUm it'll be like salty so of course you you want to think about that one eating it you may want to you know cut up into pieces and use it to flavor a larger dish 'em that of cooking the whole thing but you know in the in the American south they have these um cured hands that they do exactly that with\nIt cured it aired dried and then when they prepare it traditionally you didn't slices indeed thin you took the whole ham and you would boil the whole ham and much of the salt would come out you might save some of that\nLiquid I'm used to I mean that would be incredibly beautiful you could freeze not in Utah hundreds of stock or is that a a flavor base for other stocks and then eat the meat\n[noise] you know I think I I liked the idea of cutting it into chunks and using it or you know as a flavor an answer for you know vegetable dishes maybe\nSauces and things like that I I kinda liked that idea in Argentina which is where I was born we have a fish called ... and one of the things it's like a big giant stew\nAnd one of the things you should do is put a big piece of pork belly you know not like not like sliced bake it a big square of it into which at them\nAs a flavoring and as a kid I Would always fish for the entire pod looking for that thing to eat it\n[laughter] so I kinda like that idea of like different things that you're\nCutting it in half and using some of it for chunks for added to the vegetables stews and stuff like that and then the other half slow cooking and see what happens\nYeah yeah yeah well if you cut it nice and small you can start that in a pan um you know render that maybe you can add a little more olive oil or or or other facts of the parents when they get a little bit nice and brown scrambled eggs or not and that would be\nSo delicious yeah I was you know I Would like use of prosciutto with\nSomething that's maybe one or two other ingredients you know just really kind of feature that flavor 'cause I mean it's a beautiful flavor whenever you do with it thanks so much for listening all the way from Glen Akil\nBut thanks so much for this fantastic advice night land to put actually we have enough to put into practice\n[laughter] didn't let us know goes\nI sure well thank you so much the well\nThank you take care aren't we have a message a question from Tim from Fort Charlotte Florida So Tim wants to master bone marrow how to cook it how long
