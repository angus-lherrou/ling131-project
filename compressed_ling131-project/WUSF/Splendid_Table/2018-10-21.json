time these to make cooking seems so fun\nNow Mary students Susan are way more than just a TV show they've been in business together for almost forty years they opened a quirky little restaurant called

military and the students ... this year's winners have truly a child a war and when we last left her her when they were telling us about the first years of their seminal Eli restaurant city cafe\nFor French food which we can before [noise] and then how they got is we've figured if nicely with Susan would take a trip that would change both are [noise]\nThey're going back to tape up security [noise] after\nAbout two years neither of us had had a break more than one day a week for ages and Susan I'm decided that she can take a trip and go to India and uh I'll never forget it the night before she left we were having a little kind of like a fake fight\nOr rape thing we were racing to see who could bona leg of lamb quicker\nAnd that's how it's worked out like [laughter] yeah I think I Want and she didn't win because well I like through my arm up in the air as in a gesture and she had her knife in the air and I cut the tendon and my finger so I had to go to the hospital and get a cast and she's like oh maybe I Can't go and I said no no you got to go you got to go\nAnd so then there was me and Jose Luis and we're talking everything for those two weeks ago she was gone but what happened is when she came home\nShe was gone how to put about you know four or five Indian dishes on the menu we did the core is like little vegetable freighters we did a tuna pancake\nWe made doll and curry and did a shot navy and right and it was really like immediately we just incorporated into the menu so it was all these rustic French things and a bunch of Indian thing [laughter]\nYeah I Do that and and I had been so inspired over there by all the flavor profiles and just that it was such an interesting cuisine all vegetarian ... it was the place where I was staying on an ash from where a friend of mine lab type spent the whole time in the kitchen with\nHis cooks and all the women were not allowed in the main little kitchen\nThey're basically we're just three holes in a cement block that you know you put a fire underneath the but\nAll the women were out on the porch grinding spices making all the different Brad than it was so inspiring that it just was something I felt like we have to put these things on the menu and then\nAbout a year later married to check her first trap she didn't cut me rag before she laugh [laughter] she took her first trip than to Thailand and had a very similar experience yeah\nMy uncle was there and he acts lined up so I could work in the kitchen of the hotel where he was and it would have had a big very very authentic type of fate and the woman who cooked it was actually the cook for the king and queen of Thailand for ten years before that\nAnd she didn't speak any English and I didn't speak any time but you know we got along immediately and we cook together all day every day for three weeks and then same thing I came home and we were you know time Ellen salad and\nSame thing I came home and we were\nYou know time Ellen salad and Chinese sausage salad anti red curry duck and I'm scallops and\nOh my gosh we have pictures that are just amazing and so then you know that our menu them became had cats lay and then duck red curry and then potato budget with mint cilantro chutney and then\nYou know put do for a and so it was a very mixed like that and one day the rigatoni that we bought from a person who made fresh pasta and delivered it came and it was like three or four inches long instead of the normal inch and a half\nAnd we were like what happened and I said oh we had a problem with the cutter and blah blah blah blah blah\nAnd then I you know we were we this is how student and I kind of work together we're in the kitchen going oh you remember those chicken breast we we've got to use them today no matter what we can't let him go another day okay well let's just let's make of sausage outta that chicken breast with a lot of ... stuff it into the rigatoni and then\nI don't know what do you think oh let's just try with cream and parmesan anyway that rigatoni became like a signature dish that everybody ordered and so we had to tell the pasta company can you make our rigatoni long all news [laughter]\nAnd literally it became one of those favorite dishes and some of the inspiration comes that way of trying to like get rid of things that we think we need to get rid of\nAnd other ... other is free she comes from people that work for us it someone whose mother made something when they were growing up in a tiny town in Mexico like our measurement bananas\nOr you see something in the market and when we first decided to turn city cafe into a little tiny Mexican restaurant called border grill we went to Mexico for three weeks we drove around in a little tiny VW Bug and we\nYou know asked a trillion questions of everybody we could do find anybody if we'd go to the market and do something we'd never seen before we would buy it and then we would take it and ask people what it is how do you use it with this chili that\nI remember we discovered ... chilies and we'd nobody nobody knew what a Chipotle he was more or less a chain of restaurants and it was Nineteen eighty five yeah\nYeah I mean we did you know that that first trip to Mexico we stay well our little kitchenette city cafe was my self and married sue ended\nIn a dishwasher but then eventually we hired like a ... student who came in you know probably wanted like Eighteen dollars now is that no no no we'll hire you for like five\nDollars an hour or whatever ... whatever minimum wage yeah and he said he came to work for his name was ... and we loved him and we ended up going to Mexico City and staying with his parents in\nTheir home and his mom took us\nEvery day for a few days to the market this is our first trip and we bought everything that we didn't know what it was in come home and cook with her all day so it was how we started to learn about\nMexican ingredients and and we fell in love with this cuisine and then we did this driving around\nWhere we just like ate everything we wrote our first menu in the Volkswagen bug when we came back we opened up and when we opened up with this you know Mexican menu and literally we had to take our ... like with the pa new Joe's or with the ... as we couldn't remember what they even were\nYou know called and so we were constantly looking at are now but but that was sort of the beginning of border grill that was the beginning\nWow you know I keep thinking about the time frame of this was in the early to mid eighties is not something that was happening and shut the restaurants and\nYou know people starting today have such a different frame of reference and the and I read when they're probably grew up with you know their favorite Thai restaurant that they went through your with their family and their favorite Mexican place so they went to and all of us all that stuff was built into so many Americans\nMexican place where they went to and all of us all that stuff was built into so many American politics are growing up now right\nYou know when we opened city so the bigger version when we open city restaurant and it was in food that was influence from cities all around the world we put at ton dory of and in and we got that ... from a owner of a Indian\nA hotel he was in India and then we went downtown in a pickup truck and picked up this on fire and tend to hurry up and so it's just rock clay that's been dry and it's like held together with elephant hair\nAnd well we brought it back in the back of a pickup truck hoping we wouldn't hit too big a bomb so that it would crack and then we learned all about how to fire it and then we spent one day like fourteen hours where you have to bring it up to like\nTwelve hundred degrees we wrap their bodies so we could stick our our ... in there because you had to keep\nBrushing the sides with a brown sugar and mustard while in order to glaze it and we played Indian music and incense and then finally you know the night before our opening party and Ruth Rachel was there that night and walls\nWe may we that night like at three in the morning we finally made our first batch of non uh-huh and you can't even looked like a dirty side is kind of out of the oven [laughter]\nWell interestingly you talk about how different it is these days for young cooks I mean we had never gone through an opening right we didn't know what that meant you know and opening it was just completely seat of the pants like\nAnd we ever get out of money we had to open up because we needed some cash we couldn't even buy groceries so\nWe had been in the kitchen with our health department or the okay for about maybe forty eight hours when we open the doors and we were flooded with you [laughter] and we were the only two people who knew how to cook the food at all\nAnd that very first night our hut you know we had to go through all getting the approval of the time do you have an because no one even know how to give it approval we finally get it approved so we opened the door and the hood went out that first night and ... it was crazy hot\nOn the line I almost passed out and we were jammed in right married to and I were the only two that were like running from station to station\nI Francis lamb and this is the splendid table from ATM American public [noise]\nNext time on studio three sixty [noise] I don't think I'm going to tell

about how she gets it gets a policy great to have high Francis if you\nHave a very cruel part of your job and that as you get to go to all the winners of the Julia Child award and bring back some things from them to display in the museum so I wouldn't know what\nWhat's that like I mean what's it like standing in front of someone who's going through their stuff and you know they're thinking\nOh man I'm going to be in the Smithsonian\nFor ever [laughter] yeah it is a cool part of my job I Will admit that it has banned\nYeah it is a cool part of my job I Will admit that\nIt has been different for each of the winter to tell you the truth when I'm\nYou know for ... and it was something that we talked about and then it led from one thing to another um for bail us it was also very different I was able to speak with him and his staff and to really talk about it quite a lot of time\nAnd by the time they came back with a very wonderful list\nI pretty much knew that there were certain things that ah stood out to um ... donated a collection of menu and as you probably know she as an artist and these menu or works of art and\nShow both of course the menu items but also he is women see as well as photographs in documents and a few kitchen tools\nFrom Rick bail us ah we were able to collect his original field notes from his research in Mexico him nine eleven days they are just fantastic because he was a an anthropologist and keeping incredible notes as he traveled around different regions of Mexico and\nThe field notes are handwritten and then midway through they are typed\nAnd he realized that he really wanted to type is notes halfway through the trips we bought a little typewriter and he donated the typewriter as well cool I'm from Danny Myer we collected around his concept of enlightened hospitality that really shaped and and drove his groundbreaking restaurants in in New York\nSo we have again another document this notebook of his conversations with people that he was asking for guidance department are being Union Square\nIt's quite a diverse collection as you can see we're really looking at again the biographies of people and their particular stories [noise]\nUm this year I'm it's wonderful to have been able to go to Los Angeles and to speak with Mary Sue militant and sue the senator about their you know their stuff but we don't really start with the stuff we always start with the story of who they are and\nUm how they got to where they are how they got into\nThe restaurant business and what those early years were like what the struggles may have been what were the challenges\nAnd how did they land on you know this very successful formula that they have so for me it really starts with the story of learning about who the people are what the big themes might be in their in their histories\nAnd then to show up and talk to them about what that might look like what is the\nKind of the the kernel of of their their own history [noise]\nUm so I was delighted to be able to go to Los Angeles at the end of July and to meet them in border grill [noise]\nThey had gone through their stuff ahead of time and had pulled out just boxes and bags and piles of things and\nYou know to a curator that's just you know that's catnip for looking at that\nAnd they had a pretty good sense of what we were after and had come up with some great material for what is it what is it for donors or you're you're from which is yeah [laughter] okay that's where we watching\n'em we are in the middle of collecting this material I'm too big boxes arrived a few weeks ago and in one box was married to now looking nice bag um that she her hacked\nFor competing on top chef masters we'd all she did and twenty eleven and you know this is an object that we don't have anything quite like it in the collection yet and they're at all\nHave anything quite like it in the collection yet and they're at all was um you know all beautifully arranged there are six nights for the bachelor was chopsticks there are there lessons or is it all this stuff is very very cool\nAnd what about Sudan was sued him directly\nYes well the two of them of also donated some of the dishes from their early restaurant a city cafe in Los Angeles and these are just so special they're they're beautiful very colorful and they are um shapes\nThat reflect the cuisine that they were really featuring in city cafe and so we have um a nice iced eight or ten pieces [noise]\nUm and to come to the museum we will have a ... um you know Mary Sue and sue and we're very into color very early on and so we have a pink shepherd vote 'em with border grill embroidered on the cough I'm which again showed how they're very\nCognizant of the fact when they are doing something on television that they can also show that border grill part of the camera angle on which is wonderful um and then we've got you know the archives are always you know very very interesting to go through I mean there's paper and then there's paper and\nFor us there were these little notebook that didn't look like much but of course when you pick them up and you look at that and then you realize oh my gosh this is their first trip to Mexico you know trying to really research some of the corner he roots of dishes that they were interested in for their restaurants\nAre still little no books like that neither one from India and for Thailand so cool and you have to ... where you can sort of imagine as a researcher looking through this and\nSort of seeing the thought process of somebody who is curious about food traditions in other parts of the world and cooks and and people in other parts of the world and to then think about bringing that back for their restaurant in Los Angeles yeah that's a\nCool too because I imagine you know [laughter] or Twenty years in the future no Thirty years and you know the people were going to win and then you're going to be like hey can you tell me the text text reader so\nThat the NRA and torture for but let me out here\nWe are also doing though is you're going through essentially somewhat like as you said someone's life story through the objects that they have held in Britain man is an emotional process for them\nIt is kind of um and in fact you will see people bring that stuff out and then it's there and then when we come and we start handling it gently of course but handling it and and talking to them about it\nYou know that the stories are triggered and when they start telling the story the meaning is made a parent of what this object represents to them and their and their lives and what they care about\nAnd there are these emotional moments when somebody will you know have that look on their face\nAnd we always tell people look you know it's your choice to donate something to the collection and if you're not ready you're not ready and um so we don't force people watch 'em but those emotional stories are the things that we document along with collecting the actual object", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Splendid Table", "city": "Tampa", "day": "21"}
