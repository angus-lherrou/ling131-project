be able to pigeon hole what I mean by that is she can basically work with any script you throw it or I mean just look at everything she's been in over the past twenty five years\nYou throw in her I mean just look at everything she's been in over the past twenty five years there's the next karate kid there's Beverly Hills NATO to winnow the million dollar baby there's PS I love you but why she might be best known for is her breakout role the one that led to her first Oscar shot her into super stardom\nBoys don't cry boys don't cry was released a huge claimed back in Nineteen Ninety nine critic praise Hillary Swank performance as brand and Tina a transgender teenager which was pretty groundbreaking roll\nIt was hard to find transgender characters anywhere in film or a TV I at that time but looking at that film now in twenty eight team it is often challenging to see it in the same kind of light\nMay consider the backlash Johanson faced earlier this year for being cast as a transgender character I have the chance to ask Hilary Swank to buy her thoughts on all of it and a little bit about her new film walk they had which deals with something that every child has to go through at one point or another what to do with your parents when they get old\nWe talked about that what you stopped by the cute studio during the Toronto international film festival [noise] so I read this thing about you I'm a talker I Want to talk about what they had a I heard that when you you do a very simple thing with scripts to help you focus on the character that you're playing is that right you write something on the page\nUm well it's not very simple actually it's really um complex because um it's my character analysis and break down so it's like a\nType of Bible I thought it was like one line per page no okay I Know what you're confusing I got it so what I Do is the script is um I break it down into one sentence that story the story of his stories about into one sentence\nAnd you're going to ask me what I was this one about but it's it was now over a year and a half ago so I'm not going to get the exact sentence but what it is and I take the essence of this story\nAnd in one sentence I say what is the story about and that is on the front of my script but then the inside is really you can barely see the lines what do you do that one line well why do you need to crystallize or like the um because I feel like that is the essence of the story\nAnd that everything should lean back to that essence and if it does and it usually doesn't make the movie\nHarrowing it all it was for my mom and you know but for me was living my dream and and at er about trying to pursue my dream so it was exciting\nI can tell you still love acting I could still I Love it I could

love it I really love it and what's interesting is\nTaking time off to take care of my dad's\nIt was um there was there was no doubt in my mind that that's what I was going to do and I didn't know how long it was going to take and in doing that there were two things that happened one I realized that I'm\nMore than just an actor because you are what you do getting people say oh English when your industry especially but I mean if you really think about if you'd say oh tell me about you the first thing I Will say is I'm an architect ... they say what they do yeah\nAnd I am and I'm so I said well I'm an actor you know that that's what I and that's for since I was Fifteen that's what I have been doing and so so much of who I Am is defined within and taking time off made me realize that I'm so much more than that um and\nThere was freedom in that somehow I don't know I don't know how to say do\nYou think they changed the way you after\nWell that would also happened on the flip side is it made me fall in love with acting in a whole different way because I appreciated all the opportunities that it gave me and it to see the world and a different way to walk in someone else's shoes and I'm\nExpand my ideas of how I Walk in the world you know every character I play from\nBoys don't cry to ... million dollar baby to conviction to Freedom Riders these stories of these women all of them being true other than a million dollar baby\nI'm are just they are in me now and I see the world and a rich away because of them so it's been ... life and reaching it's been um\nIt's incredible to be

every musician uses now\nUm that takes a note that might be a little bit flat ideally take note that might be a little bit flat or a little bit sharp and it makes it the perfect note that you're looking for but you kind of turned up on a lab and turns your boys and it down a little bit look like a robot and you hear that now with you know calling us the bunny there and T pain even be on the news out of town\nI don't think it's a stretch to say the out of tune is one of the most revolutionary inventions and all the music history so one of the producers here on she wanted to track down

that while also working on a massive new record up his own\nCalled a short story about war to contact record that follows three different characters the sniper stone throwers and the fool eight track tape due to the different perspectives on things like greed and the environment capitalism\nWhich might sound pretty dark but as you'll hear and just a minute if you know the guy at all I mean of course the entire message is just underlined with hope\nFor the record drops this Friday here's a bit of a preview of what to expect recorded live in the studio to shed with sniper on cue\nMm Mm\nYeah so um I rode the bus home with no\nWas a young boy than we are not running down the lord\nAnd all around them on the night from the town\nI'm your school only learned that the whole world with the

people\nThe land is dirty their hands dirty man ... already thought that I\nMean really shadwick diaper alive and acts use studio snipers is one of the characters will meet on his new record a short story about war with shops on friday yeah and it's it's all that good jak I tell you more about these characters in just a second but first you know when he stopped by I I had to kick things off a little bit of a catch up with\nBut first you know when he stopped by I I had to kick things off a little bit of a catch up with what he's been up to since he was last here\nHow are ya I'm doing great have you on about being here have you on All right oh I feel good yeah ah this is a new room\n[noise] yeah I should say for listening to this on the radio were upstairs yeah I kinda wish I could see the older I gotta yeah we'll go we'll go after and now you're doing this incredible hip evolution documentary\nYeah Peabody Award winning or how do you how do you find sitting down with these people that got hooked up to your entire life I'm guessing well again you know what it's like\nI guess you know what I mean yeah like a you know you you sit across these people in there and they're really fascinating and uh their contributions obviously to the culture and the music that that I Love and it's given so much to my life\nUm you know are are remarkable and then uh you know the cool thing and it's the same thing I felt when I was doing you know your job is uh\nIs these people are also stunned as stunned that you are by them they're stunned by what they've been able to contribute and be a part of so um yeah they're they're super super fun conversations interesting have you had any moment of\n... can you name the one particular moment of like why can't I Can't believe I'm here right now\nI mean the one I'd have to say stands out the most is cool her who's kinda recognizes the you know the father of hip hop and uh we had the opportunity to interview him or in front of his building in the Bronx where he grew up in where he kinda famously started throwing his party's in this particular style that you know became hip hop so\nThat was very surreal he's not a guy that's very public he doesn't do a lot of interviews you know so\nTo be with the guy that basically started hip hop at the place where he started hip hop you you know and look at the building and and speak to him and hear his story and then kind of gays out at New York and the world\nAnd it all moved to the beat of this music that he has a Thirteen fourteen year old pioneer and\nSo I I'd rather I got to think that some of his mhm like getting to talk to each other like either on this show or or or any type of evolution of getting to talk to some of these great\nMinds ... must have impacted this new record somehow [noise] um no\nThe weird thing is only indirectly but I'm\nNot in the sense of like cleaning anything from there like musical genius oddly enough you know if there's anything that impacted this record I think it's kind of the experience of meetings so many people\nAnd meeting them in these particular situation like you and I are in but I mean we know each other so you know when you sit across from a stranger for example and just that dynamic of\nYou know you're coming with whatever you're coming with however you're feeling that day or whatever nerves you might have to they also are nervous because there are about to be interviewed on the radio you know in front of the country or whatever and that energy and what we bring in our posture that we bring to social situations to\nEconomics too political conversations that is basically what this album is about so very indirectly well not necessarily indirectly but not in the way that people might think that these experiences of impacted the music but they have impacted\nAnd if not like you you you hang out Graham extra flash for the record sounds like ... ... not like that exactly that all these things yet but it\nDoes like it's a very unique kind of experience to meet so many strangers into yeah 'cause I always think that the other person is super cool and and confident and or strangely aggressive you know what I mean this is what the albums about that what's in your imagination about another human being\nYou so when someone comes in and you know when you when you'd be in the studio you didn't have evolution and someone comes in and you haven't been before and they're kind of a big deal to say to someone you know totally\nComes in and you haven't been before and they're kind of a big deal to say to someone you know totally and you don't really know them that well in or the you know there aren't that well yeah\nAnd you are scared a little bit yes and they're they seem a little I don't know the grass was the right word well I mean you met before they walk in I met your word for eight years for the worst and a lot of the album is about\nWhy and why why have you have an answer [noise] um well fear you know like I'm but I'm\nLike this question of is it all illusory because it is because how many people come in to the studio to talk to you that strangers and you're breaking up with words how many of them actually attack you or like zero percent yet like very yet I'm almost nobody who yeah virtually zero percent [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Tampa", "day": "23"}
