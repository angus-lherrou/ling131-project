public radio international\nIf you or someone who reads the loss I bet you've had a list of your favorite author is just in the back of your brain people you return to over and over again just because you love the stories that they write for Rupert ever at the right or that top his last\nLove the stories that they write for Rupert ever at the writer that top his last is Oscar Wilde\nRupert ever had played some of Oscar Wilde best known characters in films like the importance of being Ernest which I found out is not one of the earnest movies and an ideal husband but in his latest movie the happy prince Rupert gets to play Oscar Wilde himself\nIt's something that he's done before on stage but this time Roberta ever it also wrote and directed the project is basically a dream scenario this film to ... takes you into the last few years Oscar Wilde life after wild time in prison\nIf convicted on a charge of growth in decency weights more or less meant the crime of just being an openly gay man\nWhen I talk to a robot every it from a studio in New York I asked him what it is that strong him to Oscar Wilde so often over his life and it turns out it's that last chapter that last chapter of Oscar Wilde life has a lot to do with it\nI suppose because of for me he's a kind of a patron saint or a Christ figure almost um [noise] I think festival overseas I I'm was a very attracted by his brilliance as a right to but more than that um\nI think as a gay man I feel that he's a kind of Christ figure for for the gay movement and um and for that I find him a very inspiring and moving and are generally entertaining character\nAccess a Christ figure not just in in hit inspiration but also the the dying for our sins way to ride\nKind of because uh in one sense I think he very much sacrifice himself a ... for for ... and to create a a the roads are towards gay liberation\nDo you remember the first time you read Oscar Wilde\nA I was read Oscar Wilde a by my mother lives various mobile and she read me the happy prince and uh I must have been ... five or six maybe seven and I remember it very very well and uh it was a great I open up because I think neither my mother nor I\nProbably understood the text but because I came from a a a rigidly conservative family or they ruined the ... the tree or in the navy and ah we wanted to kind of people who who expressed feelings very much and and so to read the story about love and suffering and the price of love\nDid do you think do you think that's changed for actors today I mean you you've talked in in a number of interviews about helping openly gay limited your opportunities in highly but do you see a change today\n[noise] um I think there is a change I think um I think that that I mean everything's up for grabs now this is very exciting time um and uh definitely changes happening and er and er it hopefully things would go on moving um\nPersonally I think uh you know I'm gay I just need to be able to play straight pilots I don't understand why\nAll the straits actors can go and play gay pots and everyone just to see you they know how to do but somehow the mindset that the powers that be this doesn't work or in the other direction or they always blame the audience they say oh the audience wouldn't accept it but um\nI think this is not true is to do with the mindset in in what remains of the boys club of um [noise] the people in power in the executive branch and uh that has to that is the thing that still I feel needs to launch the change\nI'm sure this is something you've experienced yourself\nAbsolutely it does it make you reflect on that I mean when I tell people I was interviewing him today I was kind of talked about Oscar Wilde and and people still ... referred to my best friend's wedding they victim to a lot of the road and you had in the in the nineties [noise] how do you reflect next time now do you like thinking back to that time\nBut it was a very exciting time uh and I'm a number ... time for me it was like it was one of those kind of dream come true type of times in one sense\nThat I could ... myself into such a a successful place for my best friend's wedding and uh that film went so I'm incredibly well for me but in one sense or a\nOr the you can only go so far I'm playing the gay best friend I mean you have to kind of be able to come up with something else along the line otherwise ah the audiences will get bored\nAnd uh I think from to graduate to any other kind of rule was seemed to me to be impossible and then as soon as my gay best friend a road seemed to fail\nThat was when the lights kind of snapped out\nMy I I I don't think that's something we talk about enough we had a Justine Bateman on the show a few weeks ago testing Bateman played played Mallory and the and I think it was family ties I Believe which is a show I I didn't see right ah and she wrote this book most recently about becoming less famous\nUm and I had never really heard anyone talk about that before becoming less famous yeah she was she ... she wrote a book about one at one point people walk\nFor becoming less favorable yeah she she ... she wrote a book about one at one point people walk down the street and yet at our character's name and then one day they didn't and and how unsafe sometimes you feel when you're when you're less famous and all the things you get used to that you that you don't want to admit that he got used to\nWhat it's like being dead and that is the greatest um um opportunity over because in one sense you become like a ghost or ... you still screeching around the ... power but everyone's looking straight through you\nAnd the oldest of the ideas that everyone thought it was fabulous when you were famous uh their boats to buy a new a new um persona\nAnd I think it feels exactly what it feels like it goes to kind of trapped in the world and you really have to die\nAnd I think that gives you a new missile petunias because dying to yourself is a really one of the grapes are possibilities and stuffing over and uh it's happened to me several times and each time I found it\nIs ... minutes the fertilize it actually is going to keep on coming back to Christ river that's what we're doing he's dying and the resurrection [laughter] right [laughter] I can only imagine also that it was nice to work with your friend Colin Firth again in this film it was wonderful and those so called in and Emily until I'm ready with the people\nAre by giving their names are made the financing of the film come together funding because a particular the call than actually because uh he has become so\nSuccessful in the last five years or if he hadn't\nShown up the film would've collapsed and so we knew it was\nVery indebted to ...

Ali barriers and he didn't translate some of the Spanish parts of his poems and he said well you know how many times do I have to look up to Johnny Depp is hello [laughter] I Know I think I met John Wayne [laughter] anything like that you know\nBut I mean that that's accurate and so you just keep pushing and there's just certain elements that you know that people will relate to and if you don't get it you don't get it you keep pushing\nAnd that's what I meant I never said don't you dare watch this white people and men like that's just I was just like I wasn't thinking about that audience when I wrote this and they're watching and relating and that's great\nTo think about the hit you gave it to end you Thomas who said she wasn't seeing stories being told that reflected her and her friends she made it herself first and then she shopped around she made it herself and their way to put people to come to it and ... and I bet you can see a parallel there\nHundred percent I feel like that's the model I think that's a model for so many black people for so many\nPeople have cut the creators like I've seen that that's kind of been the trend for getting people to notice you is like for so long Hollywood has been like this isn't this isn't going to be marketable this isn't going to have an audience and because of the Internet because of social media because the sort of this stuff fishing way we've been able to prove them wrong time and time again\nAnd so now they're like clamoring for content from us\nAnd you're there to give it to him even though you may not use her real name next time I may not he's not on that sounds nice to meet you nice to meet you too thank you for having me\nThese arrays the co creator and star of insecure where she stars as an ether which just
