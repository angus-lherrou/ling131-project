Gonzalez I gotta tell ya musical genius is titled that's well and for him\nChili stopped by the cues duty at a place of music from his stunning new record solo piano three and once you're about to hear a chili Gonzalez breaking down how the piano works and why it affect you the weight does\nThe first time you're going to hear is called Chico and the inspiration behind it tells you a lot about that kind of genius Charlie Gonzalez aspires to be\n... was probably the first non stuck up a pianist I ever saw [laughter] you know my grandfather was all about respect for the composer yeah he was introducing me to classical music\nAnd then when I saw ... play the piano and I think it's a night of the opera you performed on the ship and I thought\nHere's a musician who respects the audience a yet the composer so what specifically can be listening for that you you incorporate a cheat them into this piece I Would just say it's the the playful nature the shifting temple was a that is just sort of\nDrawing out the entertainment value of of musical storytelling I think that's one thing that I can remember when I was watching that sequence\nThere's a lot of sort of false virtual city when I say falls virtual ... means that he's he's playing quickly in any way that seems\nQuite technically accomplished but it's all in service of of the the playfulness when you're a composer performer you write music for yourself\nAnd that means that I can write for my own technique and there's moments where it might seem very very true authentic but in fact all they've done is right for myself rights to my own strengths and that's the way of sort of getting around the idea of admire good pianists or not I'm a good pianists when I'm writing for myself and I think that's what\nTranslates to uh what she called Marx did when he was being a false virtuoso and and what I Do in the speech [noise]\n\nOoh\nAnd that's why they say the piano is sort of the orchestra and ... when there's an opera being worse than they can't afford the orchestra until the last two weeks of of ourselves for those other six months they were her sing it they have a pianist it's the only instruments that can credibly imitate you\nKnow read them [noise] and of course it can do harmony\n[noise]\nHow can any other instrument do that I mean perhaps the guitar in some way and it's portable that's a nice advantage but truly it's perhaps the piano that is that atomic level of music and would understand the plays alone and you are covering all the basis of what music is supposed to be melody harmony rhythm and sounds ... but when\nYou when you're composing it satisfying I only ask because I edited knowing your in your composition whether it'd be in a can do everything you want it to do\n[noise] I don't think in terms of being a pianist I'm a musician who happens to play the piano the piano is the atomic level of instrument that means that if I Want to conceive\nOf complete music the piano is just the easiest way to do it my best teachers when I was growing up were guitarists drummers they taught me about music how to tell a story through court progression how to leave space what is it to take all the ear of the listener these are all skills\nThat if you are stuck too much in your instrumental identity\nYou'll never learned and I think it's dangerous I think for musicians to get to cut up and their instrumental identity\nAnd yes there is different you know parts of the body that are engaged for different instruments and every instrumental is has his or her own map of music viewed through the prism of that instrument\nBut these twelve notes here in all of western music from classical through to today's pop music these twelve notes have still reigned Supreme you know you walk into a studio where they make rap music you're going to see some some drum machines but you will definitely see a synthesizer which has these twelve notes of the piano\nJust rendered on you know the keys are made of plastic and and there isn't an acoustic mechanism to hear those right away but that prism still through which musicians see music at least in the western world\nI Want to talk more about the conservatory or set up sort of a musical boot camp in in Paris tells a\nLittle bit more about it and that was a performance boot camp I feel like\nMusic was performance for hundreds of years and there was an aberration called recording we suddenly thought oh there's a permanent record which is why it's called a record of a song against which all other subsequent performances will be measured kind of terrifying for a musician\nSo I thought how can I get younger musicians who have come up in this SoundCloud era who in a really wonderful way\nAnd this SoundCloud era who in a really wonderful way can make music on their own on their computer posted and feel like they're starting to communicate with their audience\nHow do you make sure that in doing so they don't lose touch with what music really was a spiritual way music was someone in a cave hitting a drum and someone listening and maybe laughing or dancing\nSo how do you get young musicians to understand that that is not only the spiritual\nWay to feel connected with musicians that came before us but pragmatically that's also where you can make a living as a musician so I went out of my way to sort of developed techniques that would\nForce them to trust their instincts just to create a kind of control the discomfort within which they can compose and perform music\nI've done it once now they wrote music during that week under pressure literally with eggs timers going for ten minutes or Fifteen minutes with constraints\nThey had to bridge the gap between coming from different cultures and different musical styles that was a rapper from Texas to jazz saxophonist from Ukraine classical guitarist from Guyana\nYou had a singer songwriter from Argentina that we make thing nicknamed Mexican faced at one point or so you had all these people that were forced to make music together look for that common ground\nAnd not have so much comfort that they feel that they have even the chance at perfectionism\nWe had cameras filming almost every moment of the actual work wasn't reality t._v. they weren't filmed in their personal moments but when we were working the cameras were on them and that was part of it they needed to feel that pressure that discomfort they need to confront the fear of humiliation you know when you go on stage you get an adrenalin rush\nWhich is replicating probably early man\nYou know fight or flight response was when they see their something my exactly and the stakes were very high life or death on stage the stakes are quite as high it's fear of humiliation rather than fear of death\nIf you can make friends with that fear of humiliation and even sort of acknowledge it even sort of let the audience know by taking risks it's a little bit like a magic trick a little bit like Houdini saying I'm going to go into this box of water and uh you know get get get my way out\nI it is kind of an escape routine every time that you go up on stage you have to escape from the box that you put yourself in\nUm you're going to do October third yes lots of significance of the data October third that is a dates\nFor I I Can't really explain the details because it's just too private and and the other I think that there's there's things you need to keep ... yeah I I you know I I Choose what to share with my audience because I Know that if you don't share anything you're missing out on the chance to create a bond and maybe for the music to to have more resonance\nOctober third has been out titled because I wanted people to know that emotionally this piece is different\nThe pieces even dedicated to myself\nI Want people to know this is the emotional core of the album\nBut of course I don't want to say why dedicate yourself yes it's Jason back you're you're ... the real name I dedicated to myself because this is a a piece that I wrote on that day where something very life changing and this one's different let's say I want people to know

I'm basically said you should do something fun next you know\nMaybe throw out of an erotic book you know fifty shades is doing so well I mean if it's halfway decent will publish it and I I took it seriously seriously I Would I Would definitely try that I Would try my hand at that and\nUh and I did I wrote three back to back in Eighteen months to to you did it under a pseudonym yes my pseudonym is actually my manager's name\n'em ... el Marie ... Murray Adeline she was born in the turn of the century um quite a sexual prude so it was a little bit of an inside joke between my sister and me and uh uh yeah that was where I got that name so why the food and\nEverybody was writing them under a pseudonym and it was also I wasn't sure of myself I felt a little insecure and I I thought you know if I fail I'd rather fail undermine and his name\nThan my own name and it's very it's a very different genre it comes from a very different part of my brain\nUm [noise] um and and uh it was a plot driven and I'm not as sort of literary um it didn't come from the part of my brain that wanted to be surprised so much has wants to nail to sort of plot and the point of making\nWhich started doing incredibly well was there a point that you were like on a kind of wish I use\nMy own me no no no no I'm not I'm I'm I'm happy that it has its own life somewhere else the romance an erotic genre and readership [noise] um\n[noise] it's a very particular animal they like things a certain way um and I don't know if they'd be a fan of the stuff that I tend to write for myself you know like the winters for instance\nSo let's talk about the winters as we can fix the Gabriel her new book the winter's came out this week so I mentioned this off the beginning it's based on Daphne ... Rebecca which was a best seller when it came at Nineteen thirty eight at the book is never been out of print Alfred Hitchcock made a movie out of it that won best picture of the Oscars in Nineteen forty what's your personal connection to the original\nRebecca [noise] ah it's fraught and lengthy I I'm Rebecca the book was one of three books that we owned growing up we didn't have books in the house we didn't have money we were library people um the other one was one of the other one was um a collection of poems by Alfred the attendance and\nAnd the chariots of the gods so it kind of explains a lot um I didn't read the book until I was in high school so my first introduction of the story with um with Bill Kennedy at the movies out of Detroit I grew up in Windsor and watch that black and white movie with my mother probably on a loop he didn't have very many movies in a collection but he would play the same sort of Joan Fontaine movies over and over again\nSo I I grew up knowing about the story watching the story\nThen I read the book in high school and was kind of blown away because in the book maxim winter murders his wife admits it gleefully gets away with it and the narrator loves him more so for it and I never thought that way growing up the movie the Alfred Hitchcock had to raise the murder\nFor obvious reasons and so it's a love story\nAnd they get away with it and live happily ever after\nSo let me understand as you're watching the White House you're watching news about the Trump White house you see Hope Hicks a Donald Trump's former adviser and it inspires you to revisit Rebecca am I right\nI Would go further back it was really the fall of two thousand sixteen um the actual election itself I was I'm\nNot working or I was at home trying to sort of ... my next career move 'em my cat had died on the election was obviously fought for a lot of women and so I and I and I am a new job I'm a news junkie\nUsually fought for a lot of women and so I and I and I am a new job I'm a news junkie and I had enough so shut off you know the news and started to watch my favorite movies to see if I could sort of get myself out of the ... and through in Rebecca on both criterion collections of the movie [noise] and ah\nJust was overwhelmed with the sense of you know maxim to winter gets away with murder and had the sense that men are getting away with a lot and ah you know came to me suddenly that it would be a fun exercise to write a book", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "19"}
