Bush had launched war against Saddam Hussein we can tell you that these targets of opportunity has been hit\nSo let me ask you first of all of our crew there are you and uh and I and and all are well\nWe're a little excited David I'm sure is obvious but yet we tracked\nDown the American media in particular had totally dropped the ball they didn't see what was coming they all endorsed it knows a lot of the consequences\nWhen I found out that she was the one who wanted to write a a biography of the day I just am I managed to just say yes\nBecause I adore her as a writer I had read we ought to know which way to her first book on though about women in in a Canadian women in music\nAnd um we had done an interview to for maybe see yes yeah what made you want to do it in\n... well I mean it's about the same arena number one so she is just amazing a number two when I was trying to put together all my research for when I entered Buffy for power in the blood and twenty Fifteen I was really frustrated by the lack of information I could find 'cause I'm a researcher I like to dig deep you know and there are just so many blank spaces that um you know music\nThe traditional places where I Would go to find out about musicians of that kind of iconic status\nOr had it written about her so I felt like she really been kind of like a race for music history if you're not sort of written about ah there's no record of your work we all know of course it she's an icon and amazing uh but I just really felt like she you know her work and and everything she had been quite minimized [noise]\nAnd ah after we had our conversation for power in the blood I didn't want to get off the phone she said to me that she didn't want to get off the phone she's had allowed and I was like\nOh my God that's amazing reach out\nAnd um I really left that injury wanting to think about writing an an authorized biography of Buffy ... Marie\nSo by people that are hard to put the trust and someone to tell your story\nNo not really and I was so glad that I'm I'm\nYou know a couple of years earlier I had read and read his first book we ought to know [noise] um because uh there's ... there's so much that comes through in her writing and she's a beautiful writer she's feeling\nSo much that comes through in her writing that she's a beautiful writer she's real intelligent and she's real funny and she can see if she can just kind of the be between the lines of um [noise]\nUh both the show and the business and that's always been real important to me both of them and there really is a difference between the show and the business and she could see that I kind of been abused and get their own by the business that the show is still a little uh a whole lot of fun for me and I think that's one of the places we really connected on\nWell you're so funny and like your music is so full of hope I mean it's none of none of the things that have been sort of like done to you arguably have damp and your spirit at all and\nI I have one thing I Love this book does is that it does that the record straight on a couple of things that I think people get wrong about ... feet for example you you didn't play Woodstock\n[laughter] [laughter] I Know I had a story there's always been if we would start a Andrea\nIn the book she points that out yeah people almost every concert in the U.S someone will come up join you say you were so good at Woodstock I just love you you knew it was just a best friend\nAnd I wonder what style [laughter]\nWhat do you and if I go I spent some time with Joni Mitchell and may tell her the same thing it was so good at Woodstock and she wasn't there either I don't know I guess I don't know what they were ah smoking that day but you know drugs right and they were there on the\nAssumption is that you would be because you were such an important part of that time I feel like people just create the scenario they wish that had existed\nBut it's interesting that this misses some times bigger than the actual story of ... and ... and ... and it leads me to spend with the challenges you must have had an injury I mean you knew Buffy was born I reserve somewhere around Nineteen forty one but there aren't a lot of records from that time was what what is it like to put together a complete story above your life with such little information to go on\nI like the fact when I'm because I Do care so much research and I really care mostly about sort of people's lived experiences so\nBeing able to like just spend so much time with Buffy like she was so generous with her time we were on the phone constantly so she really was able to fill in so many different gaps where she could and then I Would be able to sort of bring 'em a different sort of lends from the music industry point like the fact that she's\nNever been nominated for induction into the rock and Roll Hall of fame and these other huge wakes up Donovan gets a lot of credit for her song you know just you know terrible I'm very frustrating so these kinds of things are where I can bring my lens to it\nI think this is the I think this is part of the book that I find the most fascinating is Andrea on earth things about you that you have perspective on it and we we I feel like you and I both learn something new about your story ... an example of that is to take a listen to the\n[noise]\nThe nutcracker ballet from talking to a tropical Cracker Barrel or just doing it by the way this was not Saturday afternoon or the opera [laughter] you\nAre speaking with uh the legendary Buffy ... Marie and our official bark for Andrea Warner above your first crush was check off\nA little girl is up here I don't want to invite age three and I fell in love with it the way on the other kids love sports in Barbie dolls I loved\nMusic and I I started playing fakes confiscated at very young age but after you you found something\nInteresting in Buffy the love of took off he ran well\nI you know I think one of the things I just thinking about what it is to um come out of trauma and where you place your trust in people my assessment was that you know it makes a lot of sense for one's first crash to be won a national musician I'm a dead now\nCrash to be won a national musician I'm a dead natural leadership and to find safety and and I'm sort of someone's\nYou know hypothetical arms that isn't there at all but ... you can take a lot of comfort in from their music because you love it so much and I think and that was sort of my assessment was\nThat it makes sense that you know a a young girl who's coming out I was sort of a traumatic situations in her childhood what gravitate towards like a dead gay classical musician and and I think I think it's a beautiful you know there's a lot of there's a lot of hope there but there's also a lot of sort of that darkness that we we moved through is well\nAbove you is it is a challenging for you to relive some of this and the writing of this book to talk about early trauma intimate partner trauma um ... episodes of heroin or these hard things to relive\nNo it wasn't hard to relive and I think but it it\nIt's something that I've held back on\nOffering is part of my showbiz bio yeah um but ... you know the respect really is neutral because I really think that she is a superb writer you know when we first started Andrea said you know if there's anything you don't want to talk about which is wrong but and I don't think anything ever came up that we didn't want that we weren't both interested in exploring\nAbsolutely and I and I feel like from the very beginning you were very clear one you didn't want me to put you on a pedestal and I'm not super interested in that myself 'cause I don't I think actually when you put them on a pedestal you're doing them quite a disservice like you're not actually treating them as a person and I really think that all\nAll of us need to be for treating each other as a as people because I sort of create community crates compassion models ways to live and our environments um and I think that that I just think that's that that's so important I can still be a fan of your work\nAnd I was still obviously deeply sided with you um but I also I also want to see you as a real person and I think that was you know that was pretty vital to the the writing of a biography like that\nSo and I I think I think that oh shit Andrea dug into the songs which made me happy because for me it's never been about being a show business personality so much as the conscience of the songs is what I was trying to get across yeah that's why I wasn't so mad at Donovan yeah [laughter]\nI I wanted to get the message out and the Andrea seem to be responding to those things in the songs that I had really intended and I felt as though we were both aiming for the same target\nMhm but there are you there were issues around that that brings up an interesting point because the the focus on the songs I'm ... and the way to record labels and other people in the business didn't want to focus just some of the songs that something that comes up a lot in this book that I didn't know about it and I found really interesting you describe\nThe feeling of a lack of creative control over your music especially when it came to your first record label on on on on vanguard he told me a little bit more about that [laughter]\nWell it was a little bit on I mean I\nHad just gotten out of college that I was going to India I was playing not trying to lock it folks singing and manage village do pretty good vent got records you want to just signed me I went to sign with them I almost find with Blue Note will do the jazz record label by the way\nUm but I went into vanguard and they said who is your lawyer and I said I don't have one they said that's OK you can use hours\nThey signed me through a seven year deal I mean [noise]\nAnd um you know a lot of the early people in management they ... they just didn't know what to do with me you know they didn't mean to be mean to me or [laughter] you know a particularly colonial about it or you know any of that\nThey just didn't know what to do with me they many of them wanted me to where you know come out like Pocahontas infringes fatty wanted to play that you know there are most of them come from a you know real New York show business thing we got to have a gimmick\nFrom you know real New York show business thing we thought to have a gimmick and they and they still they ... they didn't know some of them were afraid of the fact that I was outspoken I think they didn't know what to do with that they thought that I Would offend\nThemselves and or also I wasn't I was very smart about social things I didn't grow up\nLike in a social climbing environment or in a business environment where the family all has you know they're talking about business at the table and there wasn't a lawyer in the family ... I'd never met any of those people\nYou also didn't party and go drinking after either exactly actor too\nYoung and when you don't when you kind of is when you kind of you know I don't know I go home and write [laughter] one for me and for me to go to a an after hours by our everybody's getting half ... and I don't drink at all", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Tampa", "day": "30"}
