during the show I'm not kidding\nI'm well trod narrative from from beginning a middle and end\nThis game is Seventy hours of just over Seventy hours long and that's if you play it straight that's if you play it just everything you have to do there are options that you are able to choose for every river almost every action you make so far that I've done I've been able to choose which kind of person I Want to be at the game goes on\nI mean how many pages of script are we talking about here\nHe laughed a lot I think I think on average it was about two hundred and fifty pages worth ... ... per week um that's for the the voice over stuff the cinematic was more condense diplomatic sleds I'd say what what do you think Michael take ten part time I think\nSometimes we would get a I mean that the game itself I think somewhere on twenty two thousand lines or something like that um so it's huge and then ah we would get scripts anywhere from a hundred and fifty two to four hundred and fifty to once I I we got a script of nine hundred pages and you're like OK you've got a few days to read this and then go into the voice Bruce\nAnd that was weekly you wouldn't do that for for long periods of time which\nWas a lot to ingest I have to take some of those life just be sort of strange slit their their lines just in case this thing happened or our alliance if you can you remember the strangest lined you had to read [laughter] I live in a game there were so [laughter] um I remember one is like\nA buck and like I was like how do I do this and not do it like you know I'll be back in the bucket and just saying just simple lines that are\nKnown in the world and finding different ways I'm not going there um and we'd have to do weird funny lines like where you're out in a boat going out into the middle of the the sea and you'll be going too far in this incident\nInto the middle of the the sea and you'll be going too far in this incident you'd be like oh maybe I'm going to flush\nThe ship my size and you know like if you sell us talking as as you're going out there so the audience knew what was happening but it's funny to try and be honest and self talk about what's happening or there's a storm coming I should totally bucket of this kind of stuff so that was\nIt was really funny things had to do that you would never really have to do it any other situation\nIf you're just tuning in as few as Michael Anton ... and a myth I'd be ... to start with the new massive video game assassins creed odyssey that\nI just it's kind of everywhere right now and and Michael you mess up the creative to separate characters but each character goes through in the almost the exact same stories we were saying it's it's pretty much the same thing here's an audio example of you speaking the same dialogue to a character named Marcos\nI was what do you think this site slob since he's come to find you I think they need you know I Wish it were just told me that before they hit me but that's beside the point you will the vineyard Michael ... [noise]\nI Wish you would have told me that before they hit me\nBut that's beside the point\nYou want to be in your muscles\nVideo so that's\nThe to be reading essentially the same lines as an actor how do you create a character alongside another actor who is essentially mirroring this same performance\nWell basically because I think what works so well I'm In a very serendipitous sort of way or maybe not with the fact that\nUm the they\nYou'll be soft good pension great job with um casting Michael and I and I and I mean that in in the best possible way and I\nMay sound to people that also seem to have a very similar approach to what they hadn't visions ads Cassandra like seals I don't know how that happened really so\nUm we had we we found ourselves basically first conversation which we both thought was going to be very awkward about okay so how do we have we go about doing how do we first start discussing this without stepping on somebody else's toes and blah blah blah but\nWe both stayed at each other at the end of the first conversation was like wow we completely agree where where this is going to do and how this is going to play out and how we want to shape these characters so I wouldn't say it was hard at all it it it just it just happens so effortlessly and smoothly\nI'm unlike micro said before if there was anything it was just okay let's see how we can make that better but it was thinking as one and not have to separate people and with that but I think how we both felt about it\nWhat what about the idea that I that you can choose within your character in this game a Sesame Street odyssey\nWhether I kind of wanted to be a jerk or whether I wanted to be a hero like Michael\nWould have liked to essentially have to develop a character sort of two characters at once you have to develop a character with Merce multiple personalities and it was neat 'cause I think there was a grounding I had to find for elections myself like okay who would he be for me and what kind of choice path\nI sort of hanging on hand um for me is a ... which is probably a bit more of the nicer guy uh who who you don't mess with the ... when his wife or the people he cares about 'cause then he will destroy a fighter but overall that's to me it was a nicer approaches but then I'm like okay but that's not what some people will choose so\nYou had to really step out of that idea whenever there was those choice wheels\nAnd and go for some really hard decisions that\nYou wouldn't necessarily want to make but you have to so you had those days were hard there were some really challenging scenes that we had to to face um you know with certain family members with certain people in our lives have cared about and how we approach them and what we did\nAnd that is a bit of a a mind trip to have to\nApproach them and what we did and that is a bit of a a mind trip to have to be like okay I went from this happy choice to this super aggressive I'm going to kill your choice and those are really different um and sometimes you have to do it on a dime 'cause you're in a voice bruised and you have so many lines you have to get through the day and\nYou're like but I Want it to feel authentic so you've you've just got to try and take the time to get there I'd be remiss if I didn't\nMention this there's no doubt that if the videogame roads is traditionally so male dominated ... characters or even a assassins creed you know Cassandra is one of only a couple of female leads and eleven major releases from the series mess on the do you feel like you're breaking some ground here\nOh man absolutely I mean the fact that the response that I've been getting and the fact that they've been so many young girls that have reached out saying you know um we look up to you and you know we feel that we have a voice now in this world are that way it's been it's amazing to be given the option\nTo play as a woman\nIt's just I think that the biggest gift especially for me but I don't I don't I don't know if I Would say I would think something particularly groundbreaking but I think the company definitely adds it's giving the opportunity for for girls gamers out there to have a voice\nMichael have you played the game [noise] ah I've only played a little bit of it so far minds in the mail is on its way is it freaky to play a game that you're in it's it is funny it is really you know it's the owner knows which are like the sounds we make like the\n[laughter]\nAt all that stuff and all that could have I I really laugh at all those gestures and and a hearing yourself I'm doing certain things in these fights and yeah it is a fascinating thing I'm looking at you right now and and I liken forgive me for the dog and they give\nI'd be head of the guy with you last night and be a guy last night on my couch [laughter]\n... [laughter]\nBut you know what if it is an odd must\nBe an odd feel it is if it is fascinating and when I was playing and I actually fell out of it ah and I just kinda got into it and then you keep clicking back in really got me [laughter] how about you if you had a chance to play as yourself you're\nAh no but I watched a lot of the same lines in the mail a I have watched a lot of game play and it man it's very strange\nI ... I find it very bizarre and I especially again I say like all the owner than they own Cindy I'm ... and uh I think my my personal worst was I'm pretending to be on fire which I think a completely failed at doing I'm\nMaking your you made it a little sample pretending to be on fire [laughter]\nI've been\nFired [laughter]\nSome of it started yelling at a fire extinguisher [laughter] well I I got to tell you the thanks\nSo much for coming in and I just love playing the game and it's such a trip I don't think I've ever met anyone in the video game I played before oh cool well You're welcome else could congratulations to you thank you thank you man what oh my gosh [noise]\nThe ... and Michael and to knock those are the lead actors in effect create odyssey one of the biggest video games in the world right now you can play the game right now it's available through it will be soft on X. box PlayStation and PC I'm Tom power time for one last song as you're looking\nHead to the weekend you know and this weekend you know maybe sometimes it's three am\nYou're on vacation or you don't have to work the next day and you're having a little bit of a party four or five of your friends are over and you turn up the music a little too loudly for the hour that it is right you forget that it's later than you think it is and you and your mess up and people complain they might file a noise complaint on you\nMessed up and people complain they might file a noise complaint on you they might threatened to kick you out of the air being be that you're staying in\nBut at least you hope that the music that people complain about the music that gets called on you in the least bad as music you know but for me and the host radio two mornings rented Doris or CBC Music mornings rented or is\nIt was playing bare naked ladies too loud that almost got kicked out of an era being and be in Los Angeles three years ago that's not the only anniversary that's on my mind today\nTwenty years ago this week that same song that almost got us kicked out of the United states topped the billboard charts and it would end up being ... ladies only number one single in the u._s. it's banned", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Tampa", "day": "20"}
