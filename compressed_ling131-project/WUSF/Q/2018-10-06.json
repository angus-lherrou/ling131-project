USF news dot org\nThis is a special\nReport from NPR News the Brett Kavanaugh vote I'm Jeremy ... in Washington that name Brett Kavanaugh is likely to be in our lives for decades he will change the balance of the Supreme Court replacing the courts swing vote Anthony Kennedy and he may have an impact on control of Congress and how much President Trump\nIs able to accomplish for the remainder of his presidency this hour how did we get here what does Kavanaugh's confirmation mean for the Supreme Court\nAnd what are the ramifications for the country a country that is in the midst of the me too movement and a month away from the mid term elections let's start with the defining moment on the Senate floor when America found out that Brett Kavanaugh was all but guaranteed to sit on the court\nMr President\nI Will so chicken fire and judge cat and\nMaine Republican Senator Susan Collins with her closing argument in support of Kavanaugh that case\nSenator Susan Collins with her closing argument in support of Kavanaugh that came after a contentious three months that began on July night\nHe's a brilliant jurist with a clear ineffective writing style universally regarded as one of the finest and sharpest legal minds of our time president\nTrump had promised to nominate judges who oppose abortion rights Canada's name came from a list given to the president by the federalist society an advocacy group with the conservative agenda that Kevin I'm told senators that he viewed the landmark roe versus Wade decision settled law\nAs a judge it is an important precedent of the Supreme Court by it I mean roe v Wade and Planned Parenthood versus Casey been reaffirmed many times Casey is precedent on President which itself is it important factor to remember\nAnd I understand the significance of the issue the jurors credential issue and I understand the significance as best I can I always try and I do hear of the real world effects of that decision as I Try to do of all the decisions of my core of the Supreme Court\nHe also promised to be a fair and impartial judge\nBeing a good judge means paying attention to the words that are written the words of the constitution the words of the statutes that are passed by Congress not doing what I Want to do\nIn early September Democrats used there two days of questioning Kevin a to point out that they weren't given enough information about his record but after the first round of hearings Kavanaugh's confirmation looked like a sure thing until a week later when the Washington Post published a story about allegations from Christine Blasey Ford\nWho claimed Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her when both were in high school\nShe agreed to testify about it before the Senate Judiciary committee in one of the most watched congressional hearings in decades\nMain motivation and counting for weight a place to be helpful and fight facts how Mr cabinet accents had damaged my life so that you could take into a serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed\nIt is not my responsibility to determine whether\nMr cabin auditors to sit on the Supreme Court my responsibility is to tell you the truth\nOn line at USF news dot org\nOr back now with a special report from NPR News the Brett Kavanaugh vote\nI'm Jeremy hops in in Washington so what does the nomination and confirmation process we've witnessed over the past three months I mean for the Supreme Court the conservative Kavanaugh will replace Justice Anthony Kennedy who was for three decades the swing vote on the court [noise]\nWe heard from retired Justice John Paul Stevens this week is Ninety eight was appointed by Gerald Ford and said Canada should not be on the court\nIs the things that are all good and he should have been in for when he was another one but I think of his performance during the hearings cause me to change but I'm a\n... an extraordinary moment of former justice saying that about a nominee\nWell what he said was that because Kavanaugh had framed his entire critique at his the second round of hearings as a partisan attack not just on Democrats but I'm liberal groups and I'm like liberal activists that\nAll those people when they come to the Supreme Court\nCould rightly maintained that they won't get a fair and unbiased hearing from him and you saw Brett Kavanaugh today in the wall Street Journal tried to walk back is what he said called his emotional comments but he didn't say specifically which ones in any event Steven's point was that uh\nThat he might have to recuse himself now I think that's and they're highly unlikely\nPossibility given\nKavanaugh's demeanor and how does that happen also that adjuster chooses himself or herself it usually happens when there's a set of rules you know let's say you're supposed to recuse yourself if you have any financial interests if your family is involved in any remote way\nIf you're some very close friend had some financially or something like that\nThere's a whole set of cannons of ethical conduct but\nBecause the Supreme Court is the last place to go and if you recuse yourself there are only eight and they could be tied\nUm the justices try very hard not to have those conflicts\nYou can't take back a conflict like this and and I doubt that he's going to bow out out of a lot of if any cases because of what he said well Tom\nPresident Trump has had a number of rallies where people chant lock her up about Hillary Clinton and Brett Kavanaugh I got up there a before the Senate Judiciary committee and said that this was revenge on behalf\nUh before the Senate Judiciary committee and said that this was revenge on behalf of the Clintons could he be a an impartial judge in a case that involved the Clintons were a left wing group he pointed out left wing groups as well well the Clintons might\nBe a very special case a given also his involvement with Ken Starr investigation in terms of\nThings involving liberals and conservatives and yes there's I think zero percent chance that he is going to recuse himself it would be in in essence an admission that he can't be neutral in the front issues like abortion affirmative action same sex marriage and the like I Can't see him doing that I think that\nWhat he is likely to do is probably try and find some opportunities ah like he has recently with the editorial that he wrote to try and asked for some sympathy from the public and understanding exactly the kinds of pressure that he was under and when he was feeling in terms of how his family was\nUnder the spotlight with these attacks and try and kind of walk back the sense that he has some active partisan and get back into the mode where in his original testimony when he first came before the the committee and really gave us this era of being a truly neutral arbiter of questions that come in front of him\nI Want to go through some key issues here that people are thinking about as they contemplate what Kevin I Will mean for the Supreme Court abortion first of all you know what do you think this is going to mean for the issue of abortion\nWell I think it's pretty clear that at at least\nThere are five justices on the court who now will begin to whittle away at abortion rights they may not overtly reverse roe versus Wade\nBut we could end up in a situation in which in those states where abortion is ... that that abortion rights are are popular they remain and in those states where they are highly unpopular they know there is no longer a clinic there because they can't function under the rules that are laid down by the state law\nWhat about same sex marriage a Justice Anthony Kennedy a who is retiring who did retire or authored that decision Tom Goldstein about same sex marriages that issue going to come up against\nWell I don't think in terms of whether there is a right to same sex marriage it'd be very surprising to see the court\nKind of do a one eighty on that there are areas of the law where there's just playing the joints\nWhere you don't have to overrule something so to take abortion the standard is whether it's an undue burden on the woman's ... exercise at the right who knows what that means you can fill into that whatever it is you want almost and that's why I'm more conservative court can allow more state regulation but there is a right to same sex marriage is a binary light switch on light switch off thing I can see them doing it\nWhere there isn't necessarily a right to is\nAll kinds of things that go with it like a king you require the floor is too is against same sex marriage to design\nA floral arrangements for your wedding or as we saw a at a cake wedding cake or else photography to take photographs or go to the photography studio and have them developed photographs of your same sex wedding\nI mean most states have laws that require\nEqual treatment of everybody you can't just pick and choose who your customers are as long as they behave themselves\nBut their ... you know so far that remains the law of the land as it is but unless Congress were to pass a federal statute requiring equal treatment of\nUm same sex couples for example it's not necessarily true that that would ... that would be true everywhere\nRight one thing but you're likely to see is a Supreme Court that's more sympathetic to religious objections to doing things that for example involving abortion or same sex marriage in light the county clerk who doesn't want to provide a marriage certificate that sort of thing the court right maybe there but the things that actually\nBy the marriage certificate that sort of thing the court right maybe there but the things that actually also helps same sex couples really feel like they're equal maybe more in question what\nAbout the issue of presidential power President Trump is currently under investigation the Robert Mueller investigation is going on to will will cabinet being on the court make any difference there\nWell we we know that he had said things that are at least ... the police questioned uh correctness of than famous Nixon tapes decision which would which required the ... President Nixon to turn over tape recordings that incriminate had him in the end that we're putting into an ongoing criminal investigation\nUh it is true he's also said that it's one of its he cited it in a list of one of the great cases showing the independence of the judiciary\nBut he also said things that maybe it said had said maybe it was wrongly decided that we really don't know where he is on that what we do know is that he's a very very strong advocate of executive power in a wide array of areas\nAnd even proposed at one point that Congress should pass a law that would exempt that President from criminal investigation or civil suits while he's president\nNo on this question he only has one vote obviously but I Do think you'll probably get a lot of respect for this he spent a lot of time the executive branch you spend it in the White House and he was part of the Ken Starr investigation and so his view of how disruptive this can be to the presidency to have you know criminal proceedings in Grand juries like may get a lot of attention from the other justices\nWhere is Kevin are going to fit a on the court in terms of the other conservatives you already have Justice Alito Justice Thomas now justice Gorsuch pretty reliable conservatives and Justice Roberts as he become the swing vote on the\nCourt on Robert in it in a technical sense there probably are some cases like the case involving Obamacare and we she cast the deciding vote but mostly\nObama and the other conservatives in the in the court or at least pretty much in lockstep on the outcome I mean he dissented in gay marriage he dissented in gerrymandering he descended in a whole bunch of other you know ... ... in a whole bunch of other cases as long as Anthony Kennedy was on the court he\nCould move the balance board a little bit when he decided that this was a subject in which he agreed with the liberals to some extent or another there's nobody like that in the center of the court now there are four\nPretty liberal justices I Would call them to most liberals they would seem to be moderate liberals but they are on the liberal side and then five quite hardcore\nConservatives with chief justice Roberts I think really worried about the court institutionally not going too far too fast but\nUh that's probably what's holding him back I think\nYeah and I think that that ... that phrase too fast is probably where\nIt's going to be you're going to achieve the chiefs influenced the most not that he's going to switch sides that he's going to turn it into a liberal all of a sudden but rather that he is going to want to keep the pay slow so that the court isn't being seen as extremely aggressive and partisan particularly over the course of the next say twelve months or so\nOr he may not want to see cases overturned rat quite rapidly but he wouldn't mind seeing the law of ... and a conservative\nDirection there are three cases in front of the court right now asking the court to reverse very longstanding precedents and there's a whole sort of a architecture of conservative legal thought that wants to the court to do that with the whole wide array of\nSlash veterans and coming up tonight on all like jazz or the other nine to five my credit goes back to school for national teacher day on the jazz trumpet ten the adventure begins tonight at nine o'clock\nThis is a special report from NPR News the Brett Kavanaugh boat I'm Jeremy hops in the vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court comes on the year anniversary of the me too movement it also comes a month before the midterm elections which would determine whether Democrats or Republicans\nControl the house and the Senate and how much President Trump will be able to get done for the remainder of his presidency\nNPR congressional reporter Kelsey Snell start with you what does this mean for the key races coming up\nWhile the one thing that we are going to be watching very closely at what it means for Heidi Heitkamp a Democrat from North Dakota who voted no\nUh she was under a lot of pressure to support cabinet because she is running for reelection state that President Trump won but they very significant margin in twenty sixteen polls have shown her slipping recently\nBut she put out a statement saying that she was making her decision based both on the fact that she thought that his performance at that hearing was part is and\nAnd because she worried about the message it would send to women and young girls about the treatment of the way that we're in an America treat that accusation sexual assault\nShe is in a precarious situation here running against a very conservative House Republicans who had strong name id in that state\nAnd she as far as I can understand it from talking to people that know her well made that decision here but that got decision may be a really big ... it may take a hit for her and the polls other person I'm watching as Joe mansion in West Virginia who is the only Democrat who voted yes and he said that he is\nWho is the only Democrat who voted yes and he said that he you know Manhattan is looking out for what's right for West Virginia again a state that President Trump won fairly significantly in twenty sixteen\nDominican much in our NPR lead politics editor ... is this going to impact the races of people who don't have to vote on this I'm thinking of people like that to work uh who's running in Texas against Ted Cruz\nWell he's got his own an uphill battle and uh that's the fact that a Texas is taxes [laughter] so that's a different situation but I think ... rights as arrow in on some of these red state Republican a red state Democrats who are running in places that\nPresident Trump won you know Texas is among those kinds of places but first and foremost you gotta look\nA like a tells you mentioned that Heidi Heitkamp\nYou know someone like John ... says he's no he'd seen in Montana or in Montana seems fine in his race but Joe Donnelly who I really wonder if he would have rather kind of said nothing uh before saying no immediately after uh that Thursday hearing\nUh I don't think Democrats quite realized how this was going to fire up Republican white men in particular this\nUh you know our NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll really showed a big shift among Republicans and it was driven by by men within the Republican Party\nA who shifted very quickly\nAnd you know you have something like eighty percent of the Republican Party right now saying that the elections are a very important and that significant because that's basically a tie statistical tie with Democrats\nAnd Democrats had a ten point advantage on that over the summer now does that remained this high or does that recede given the fact that cabinet looks like he will be confirmed and the fact is\nDemocrats democratic women democratic men they have been fired up this entire time and are expected to stay at that level\nOkay well let's listen we've been talking to a a couple of strategist on each side here this is John braid bend a Republican strategist and here's what he thinks that this means\nWhat we found that in the last week is there certainly seems to be some Republicans come home um the problem we had is that particularly moderate Republicans are not huge fans of this president he makes up for that oftentimes by getting conservative Democrats\nBut at least in a lot of the surveys I've seen in the last week a lot of them about number one that the Democrats overplay their hand that it wasn't even that they didn't believe professor Ford they just were unhappy with a lot of the tactics that they saw the Democrats taking and felt that\nUh they were they were just merely playing politics and I'm so it was interesting so it's so it's sort of by the Republican Party a bit and um\nI I think the question now is can they keep that sort of small momentum going all the way until election day\nOkay so that's a Republican strategist this is democratic strategist Anna Greenberg\nI think it's very helpful for Democrats I think it's going to galvanize women who are already feeling aggrieved\nBut I also think that it away from that will down attacked Dr Ford rallies and I think Kavanaugh eyes ... I think all hands are fairly leaving for him in the end of it I got a pack even more\nTells me I was down on Capitol Hill earlier today are talking with protesters outside the Supreme Court and outside the capital and some of them said to me I think he's going to be confirmed but that's just going to make me more excited to go out and vote for Democrats this November ... what do you think when you hear\nMore excited to go out and vote for Democrats this November ... what do you think when you hear those two strategist who who is going to be more energized\nWell I think that Dominican or the right it's really hard to get people Democrats more energized than they already are\nI Do think that there is a question that has been raised not just by Democrats but by some Republicans about how much this support for the president that we're seeing right now it's conditional on this issue we've seen that happen over and over and over again where a Republican voters in Republican elected officials will join Trump side when he's doing something that they like\nAnd then quickly abandoned him when he does things like how to rally at the end says things that are politically incorrect or offensive\nAnd that's been the story of the relationship between traditional Republicans and this president since he was elected and in fact and he became the nominee so I it will be interesting challenge to see if that changes in the situation as well\nYou know what do you think\nI Want to wait and see I realize that I'm I'm a I'm really not helping you at all here but [laughter]\nI I don't actually know I'm inclined to think that this was a bump for Republican enthusiasm and it will recede at least partially because probably because some of the wives of these guys will tie them up and not let them go out and ... [laughter]\nMet a girl is the thing is when you're talking to Jon Benet bender who's a Republican and Anna Greenberg who's a democratic pollster both very good at what they do they're both looking at how this plays with their bases and like I was saying both bases are fired up over this right\nThe real issue I think for what's going to determine this election\nIs how those swing voters those middle of the road suburban women or do you know go out and vote\nIn this election do they go out and vote in some of these kind of moderate to right leaning district in the house districts now look remember Democrats need twenty three seats Internet twenty three seats to take back the house I\nThink that what we've seen over the past week or two with how the Senate numbers have moved there is a very real possibility\nThat Democrats wind up losing out in the Senate where they lose a couple of seats and wind up taking back the house that's a very real possibility has been a real possibility from the beginning and it's starting to look more like the most likely scenario because\nThe ... the Republican leaning a you know suburban women have really moved very sharply and been sharply opposed\nTo President Trump a all along and there was a huge list of a potential targets in those are in those swing slashed suburban district\nAnd the numbers in the Senate let's ... reprised those or reprint the um there are\nA twenty six to ... twenty six Democrats up\nFor democratic Democrat in ... and and only nine Republican seats and and and that ten of those are and overwhelmingly resonates so ... of the Democratic seats the of the seats the Democrats have to hold onto our and overwhelmingly red states\nIt's a it's a huge uphill climb\nWell it's worse than that it's actually the worst landscape ever for a Senate map that any party has ever faced in the direct election of senators\nI guess Lindsey Graham would say it's it's hell and beyond health [laughter] so so ... for Democrats um we're in the midst of course of the me too movement and even during this entire nomination process for Brett Kavanaugh\nTo executives at CBS News became the latest men to be ousted it because of allegations of of a sexual misconduct let's say President Trump has been accused himself Brett\nConduct let's say President Trump has been accused himself Brett Kavanaugh as we know has been accused they it it appears both have ... so far survived those allegations while so many other uh\nHave fallen Kelsey a one in three women have been victims themselves of sexual assault one in six men I think as they watched everything that went on\nHow does that play I mean they they they have personal experience with the kinds of things that Christine Blasey Ford were was talking about\nYeah and I think that one of the things that we're seeing is that there and women are finding more space to have this conversation and it's important to remember that the conversation about Ford and cabinet is one element of a much much broader hunter like a much broader debate in this country", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Tampa", "day": "06"}
