to a Q A BBC Radio one serious acts and will be nine and from our eyes public radio international\nWhen you think about successful fashion brands you might think about runway shows and red carpets and very thin models and most definitely clothing that doesn't seem to be made for your body or necessarily your life\nWill tell you Taylor has been challenging that ever since she started designing women's where can you make clothing that's really expressive it's sunny it's optimistic bold print geometric shapes bright colors\nAnd just like real life optimism it catches on her clients currently include Taylor Swift beyond say\nFor us a first lady Michelle Obama but these are not the type of clothes that are just made it for the red carpets and models among us time to design clothes for all ages all shapes and I think it's something that a lot of her peers just don't do I'm excited to talk a little bit more about it and I'm excited to have perhaps Canada's most prestigious designer\nRight now tied to tailor in our studio high I thank you for having me get such a joy to hurt or hear or you grew up in Toronto\nGrew up in Toronto I went to high school here and then ... university that person's in New York\nSo when you were growing up in trying to do the world of fashion seemed accessible to you\nI don't even think I knew there was a rather fashion when I was growing up in Toronto I think my world fashion consisted of my mom and my grandma and\nHow much they loved getting dressed up playing with close playing with color but I didn't realize it was an industry and I think it wasn't until I moved to New York and really saw how creative\nAnd commerce can kind of co exist and how beautiful it is to have kind of both of them in a job and in a world together\nBut the other side of you like you grew up painting as yeah\nSo my mom um she we had a rec room in the basement and it probably because I was an only child and I needed some activities to keep me busy she gave me free rein to paint anything I Want it on the wall\nSo doubtful only child stuff there I Know yeah that that's not a family of six [laughter]\nPain or imaginary friend [laughter] so\nI did I recreate it into this retro landscape of like old cars and old um Hollywood actresses and very artistic lotta paper mash a lot of arts and crafts and my house and I think that that was kind of starting point of expressing myself through painting and through creating\nThing foot and forgive me for this because I mean as you I wore my best bomber jacket luxury guy I wore the best stuff I have I Wish you guys could see it I were the best stuff I have for today I feel flattered so forgive me if I'm gonna I'm gonna try this out I feel like\nWhen I see your work I see elements of paintings times you've worked feels like a campus with paint on it\nBut what we really realized about fashion week in general is that with the shows we were having the people that wear clothes weren't coming to the ... it was you know editors and buyers\nBut not customers and we wanted to\nKind of do something totally different so we did an event with thirty women we spent three months looking for founders of companies in the New York area there was\nA wide range of inspiring woman and we decided to have lunch with them where each of them were a different look bad very different body types we let them style it any way they wanted to like one woman more her husband shirt underneath one of our fed addresses and brought her biked the lunch and that was cool like her walking in versus how\nWe would put it on a Seventeen year old model and have to ... and everything would not be able to move like it's just there was a whole different context of how to appreciate clothing and we were really excited with how it was received\nThe Patricia runway shows getting kinda boring\nI think she should do it because they have the budget and it's like the fantasy but I think that runway should be about fantasy and when your brand is based on reality it's probably not the right format\nOr you read like a Starbucks or in like due to Starbucks all the time or ... know started with having a cup of coffee and civil walks in wearing your clothes yes it was a few\nThe coolest that's that's when you feel like you've got a gold star that day\n[laughter] what do you mean like\nWhenever I Would do something good at home when I was a kid I got a gold star on a little piece of paper in my bedroom and it just feels like an achievement it feels like it's quiet you don't need to\nAnd it just feels like an achievement it feels like it's quiet you don't need to celebrate it in a public way but it feels like you've done something where you'd made that person's day better\nIt must be feel so rewarding it's rewarding definitely it was great talking to you I think there's a lot of people listening to this is who like myself sometimes find the world a fashion I'm older scary sometimes I'm definitely getting better at it but if a lot of people who can't afford expensive clothing\nMaybe people when they read vogue when to pick up ... don't see themselves reflected in if you're someone who I was a cares a lot about inclusiveness ... what what are you say to them\nI think fashion as approachable I think that magazines aren't necessarily where you need to look to be inspired for fashion and I think that just being out in Toronto or being out in a city and watching how\nWomen feel confident expressing themselves individually it's probably where to get inspired what do you think of his motivates you\nMaking women happy I Love doing that right now through clothing but I think that we have found ways to partner even recently with\nYou know hospitals and different organizations to start spreading a message of color and joy and that makes me really happy to do the closer but you're doing yeah it's we did one yesterday as sick as hospital and\nBecause we paint all the time we've decided that we want to take painting to pediatric hospitals and we start at MS canned New York\nAnd we host at painting class in their community center and kids can come and joined it their siblings 'cause there's a lot of activities that are\nNot geared for both of them to be able to kind of bond and be kids together and yesterday we does that tickets and it's awesome it's the kid says the technology to actually film you in a studio painting and they broadcast and each of the patients' rooms so it's it's pretty ... it's cool\nIt's it's really cool talking to you well thank you very much for total eighty here it's so nice to meet you too that was Canadian fashions are going to tend to Taylor she's based in New York or you can head over to our website a chicken and photos
