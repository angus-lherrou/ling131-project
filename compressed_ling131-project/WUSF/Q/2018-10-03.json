being really mad at the demons of\nAt the world for you know cursing my wife with cancer I remember that deadly and I was just like shouting screaming in the most politically incorrect things I still don't remember what I said but\nIt was just raw as I've ever been on any set and I just remember yelling allied and and I got this big applause at the end of it and uh\nI went to taught I was like man this is this is this is what I needed so therapeutic so I just remember\nThinking that and I would think about trans cancer ... said just to get me into character plain mister chow as aggressively as I did so they kind of taught me that life is you know\nIt's the whole adage of life is short so you might as well while you're here just make the most to whatever opportunity you got and I definitely

you were young though I mean I'm I'm trying to factor in all of the reasons perhaps you you thought you had to be a doctor do you remember seeing an American television in comedy when you're young\nCat Merida is only one I really remember you know from the karate kid you know and a Henry Joe when I was in college a lot of people don't talk about him but he is a a Korean American comedian or from Knoxville, Tennessee gossip an accent is really funny\nAnd you'd be he was on Jay Leno a lot I remember he was a big influence and then obviously Margaret Cho was really the pioneer into this to this day she is still like\nThe the I don't know she is kind of the godmother of contemporary Asian\nAmerican Asian Canadian comedy she really is just kind of the reason we're all here on the thinking that could take a look at the\nThey had a real problem with me because I look it's way that I talked to track [noise]\nThat was like a problem and they're trying to be sensitive about it they're like Margaret we don't want you to take it the wrong way that could you be a little bit more oh I don't know Chinese [laughter] [noise]\nWell actually I'm Korean [noise]\nOn the show and how

and if I got I'm going to sound like Colombo right now but I'm realizing even though I'm Still in my early thirties that there's an entire generation of adults now who have very little memory\nOf life before the Internet and when you ask these people like to grow up on line to get some pretty interesting answers so take el mills for example\nAs a kid growing up an auditor she always had a camera in her hand she shot home videos these turned into short sketches eventually into short films\nNow not so long ago a kid like Elvis probably destined for film school but as she grew up when she did el meals have something else in mind she started her own channel on YouTube people started watching elder videos\nPretty much immediately these days for YouTube channel has more than ... million subscribers she goes on tour people lined up for hours to meet her after the shows I mean it's a dream come true right\nWhen according to el mills yes and no\nYou're about to hear that all that attention all that fame all that success\nIn a new media space can be kind of overwhelming even if it is something you've always dreamed about\nI always wanted to be in the movie the TV but then when she became a thing when I was like in ... like they find it takes middle school\nAnd like I knew that was I wanted to do because you know a testable to drop out of school to yeah I got that uh I did a semester where out of the year for marketing not cool you know uh but that may easy channels blowing up and I decided I wanted to focus on that show I decided to take a semester off yeah\nAnd I haven't gone back how ... how did that go with your folks both of them were like shocked at first um because I was I was a academically driven and but um my mom was very supportive she says whatever you want to do\nUm and my dad was just a little ... and but now he totally understand that they cause he just didn't understand like the holy to both in that well yeah I mean your parents were ... they there was no you know so to them it probably does seem like staring into a camera\nFrom the older generations perspective obviously I understand what it looks like it looks like just someone making little videos on line yeah but so much more than that does that\nOn social media world has become a whole different thing it's just insane now so tell me how long does it take to make videos than the ones I see you're like between for sick sometimes eight ten minutes how long did it take you to make\n[noise] I'd say a solid week of fake straight work so like every day\nA solid week of like straight work so like every day every hour I'm working for a week it's become a huge production at this point yeah I just keep I keep raising the bar and just keeps getting bigger and bigger\nAnd part of this is is getting so much of yourself in this to you get a conscious decision that you wanted to reveal a lot of yourself and that's yeah I I I\nI just find my life I don't know if this is not specific to say but I found my life a interest [laughter]\nI just find that it's not me it's the people in my life I find them fascinating they're all such characters to me and I find that in any person you mean you could turn them into\nA character I liked the idea of like showcasing that because I found my family's specially very interesting and they're very ... but also just so unique like you've never seen them like that before\nBut oh you do see some of the most personal things a person can do as you talk about in these videos or can I just play one to go into the\n[laughter] feelings are so strong to redress I figure that out in Toronto me see on your person my teen person I had known what the science\nWent out and I may have had a little too much to drink person I was trying to heal plenty of time and I told him he told me\nWho you lose your views or something so I went back to auto within a day out you know [noise] I Know you should\nHave been The Simpsons I came back home in September now you know why\nThe future but he would almost four million views covered by news outlets all over the world of view [noise]\nComing out yeah me coming out that video has a video of me crying and my dad was for a very odd that as almost four million is\nHow do you decide to live but let's start with how do you decide that this is how you want to come out\n[noise] I'm just so bad to being vulnerable which is surprising if you look at my age of channel ... that are being vulnerable in person so I find being vulnerable on camera is kind of loophole to that because when I'm being vulnerable shirt is being showcased to millions of people but\nAt the moment in at the time of me being vulnerable I'm by myself with a camera so I'm like catching the system and being able being vulnerable without having to be honorable loophole yeah love it\nTold me about the moment you made that decision though to do that do you remember was there a time with her space where you some where you're at a table were you in the back of a car like when did you decide I was going to make this video\nIt's when I decided it's one I figured out I was bisexual I was like okay now I Need to tell people because it was something that's been like\nA like a weight on my shoulders for a long time and I was keeping a secret and I know I knew my my mom would that especially she knew I was hiding something for me so I knew it was time to just kind of like really sad pressure and so I just thought\nIt was like I thought making the coming up video will be like killing a ton of birds with one stone like I Would not have to sit down every friend and sit down every family member and tell them how to build you didn't tell personally feel about that [noise]\nYeah I I realized after their ultimate you know I don't know there's some people like I didn't tell my sisters\nI just found out through video because they were raised very religious they are very religious Christian folk yes exactly and so there are ... off the they're upset by that are um they shouldn't find out what the rest of the world\nThey should find out oh just maybe a few seconds beforehand but I guess yeah I I I I learned from that experience so that after that you start getting thousands and thousands of more people subscribe to treat to channel ... or something you noticed yeah that that coming on video blew up like nothing I've ever seen before it changed the videos than you were making afterwards\nIt changed in the sense that I I started putting a lot of pressure\nIt changed in the sense that I I started putting a lot of pressure on how\nGood the videos or they cause I felt like a lot of the ... the coming out video blew up because there was like\nA you know I came out and everyone should try and be supportive but I think a lot of it was they they were intrigued by this story telling and how I made the actual video itself and so I was like really worried that the next video it's not as good or something so that to a change\nReally but it wasn't like oh I Need to give way more myself now know a little bit\n... right after the video I was like okay I Need to do more and he'd go bigger\nAnd and you can play another clip yeah how do you think it was\nJust leave me in on the little ... family makes them look my ... was me being I got a good idea to", "year": "2018",
