man for journey steep periods voice defined the big soaring sound of eighties rock\nIt also transformed a struggling San Francisco grew into one of the biggest bands in North America to fix that took a toll on steep Perry both physically and mentally you stepped away from journey\nEssentially in the late eighties at first and then in Nineteen Ninety seven they got back together for like a little

struggling for her life right now\nAnd um I just thought oh man I don't know what to do now I I just there was something about her when I saw that just went through it jumped out at me I can explain that was a connection\nAnd the next thing I Know I'm looking at probably should send it send email so she sends it so I sit on pins and needles for two weeks\nWaiting for her to get back [noise] I keep badgering poor Patty and she's ... and I you know so finally kill you got back to her in one night she got back to me on the email gave me her phone number so I called her and um\nWe were talking we started about six thirty at night we talk till midnight and then I remember June\nFourteenth I think it was she finally was back in town and we went to dinner and same thing happen from six to midnight that night we closed that plays out we just couldn't separate ourselves from each other we were just so connected I never felt like that about anybody in my whole life so\nWill tell me a

she was looking at the entire arc of her entire life\nAnd and I said I promise that she wasn't talking about you know\nGoing to the fair going to the movies or dinner she was talking about I sweating from singing machine she'd heard so much catches but I was still reluctant to get back in the music business and because it's just not a friendly place you know the music is beautiful but the business is not it's in so\nI think comes with other stuff so I don't know I think I had already emotionally been a little bit to burn out where the before and I didn't want to open up the demons about that so but I did say I promise and then after I lost her for two years of grieving\nMy passion for music came back and a\nMan these songs starting to show up and I'm so glad the record got done now I mean I

they're yelling and screaming and he'd be back to that what was it like stepping out in front of an audience for the first time in two decades\nI honestly didn't know what to think so I I stayed out of any expectations backstage because there was a different time years have gone by I'm an older guy I not been on stage and twenty five years and it's it's an eagles crowd\nYou know which is an indie crowd which every every every generation has her own stamp and so that was an indie crowd and I thought gee you know I'm an eagles fan but you know they're not going to know much about me and so I

ask you I was going to have asked me a couple more you've got some time I was going to ask of stuff about the journey I was gonna ask you whether you were ever ever find yourself going back with them

characters that they play like when a character is really good it can be kind of hard not to\nWrite a friday gotta get down on friday\nYou're singing the wrong job will be going on here you are\nCertainly watch unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt on Netflix you might recognize that voice Eli campers who plays the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt her thing or the thing that's really worked really really well for her is playing characters Lake County where in daring\nForthright but also sometimes naive and a little bit off kilter because in real life Eli camper is enduring and forthright it's tempting to assume she's also naive and kind of off kilter but you know what they say about making assumptions we make a\nYou know what I mean my point is beneath the comic exterior there is a very sharp very thoughtful totally on kilter person if that's a word and if that person that's on display in LA campers first book\nA memoir called my squirrel days Alex ... she really doesn't mind people having these preconceived notions about her in fact she finds it kind of therapeutic and you're going to Harris talked about her role as Aaron\nOn the office the receptionist do replaces Pam you're going to hear us talk a little bit about her role and bridesmaids\nBut first off seeing as how Eli camper just wrote a book I wanted to know what writing gives her an acting doesn't\nYeah which is which is sort of the opposite experience for ... for unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt because this was a situation with Tina Fey basically pair makes a show for you and and you haven't really been a lead before what was that experience like just being chosen with them\nI Know so far as I'm In ancient person so that entire thing well maybe continue to be nerve wracking because I don't know I never know what's gonna happen although I Know now I mean the show is that a sadly ending but I think the experience of going from\nI mention this in the book was number Eighteen on the call sheet which is the piece of paper that actors and crew members get or is it ... it it tells you what the you know plan is for the day and I was number Eighteen on the Catholic which is pretty low down and they do kind of do it in terms of rank so going from that to them being the lead on his show\n'em so scary because I wasn't sure I was completely prepared well qualified to do such a thing and one thing I was very worried about was\n[noise] ... me in a similar way to uh Aaron because they share some characteristics but they're but they're back stories are widely different and also I think they're um\nThey're they're global outlooks might be a little bit different and so um I I ... the first season I was very concerned about that and I think I mentioned it you know once and she said oh I'm not I'm not worried\n[laughter] [laughter]\nShe's really them speaking with a camera on a ship or a about her new book my school days and and definitely it's a\nIt's a lovely fun book to read but there's a quote here in your book you write that your quote an obedient person in real life sort of therapeutic to play women who were slightly unhinged onstage\nYes um [noise] and you know I was thinking about\nYes um [noise] and you know I was thinking about that a lot and that particular line I'm over the past couple of weeks because I'm not going to political women are so angry right now and I've been thinking about you know and people have been encouraging women to\nDemonstrate that anger rather than keep it and and I think that in plain characters who are on hand to do a let their anger\nOut that there's something free in that and I play a lot of characters who are maybe more buttoned up or or just keep those emotions a little bit um\nDown low and and then when they do rise to the service I think that's very um I think it's cathartic for me but it's also fun to see those characters let it out\nOr do do do you ever worry about being considered two adorable are nicer are cheerful are fun I mean these are actual adjective but it but we found and very provocative without mine right adorable nice cheerful funding during warm to ...\n... yeah I well I mean I I did my mom write a letter gee [laughter] you know there's about LA uh certainly I think there's some um [noise]\nI think that if that's a a those qualities are exaggerated you can become you stand the risk of being um maybe walked on or being manipulated and so um I think that you have to keep all of those in check\nUp but I don't think there's anything wrong with having good manners and being obedient when it when when obedience has called for in the right circumstances and um [noise]\nUh I think there's something to being a good worker but you also have to know when to speak up\nFor another unbreakable Kimmy
