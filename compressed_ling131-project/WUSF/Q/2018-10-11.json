when she was just a teenager\nCatherine releasing a new documentary called the song and the sorrow it takes a closer look at her father's history with mental illness and as you wrote back here it really blows open the general conversation about mental health as well so I started by asking her what it was\nBut I'm encouraged her to finally make such a personal documentary it\nWas one of those things where are the director Mila Clark she came up to me and she said do you want to make a documentary about your dad [laughter]\nAnd I was like okay and then it took three years so it wasn't really like uh I didn't really think about it too much and it just kind of happened throughout the three years every once in a while Miller would show up and fill me walking round or playing music or interviewing people [noise] um so it wasn't yeah I didn't really\nKnow what I was getting into when I said yes [laughter]\nI feel about it in a\nGreat you know them I think it's a really a great a tool I guess to be able to talk about mental health and to be able to explore my own history and and all of that\nUm ... were you were growing up did you know that he was this famous songwriter this blooded Canadian phone rang and\nI didn't I had I mean I knew that he wrote songs and he played music um that was about it I I knew sometimes with songs that come on the radio when we were in like it's important or something you know and you'd hear Anne Marie seen when a dad songs and\nUm but I don't know just it was something that kind of wasn't really talked about I didn't really know and you know during my years he was mostly I you know playing not he wasn't really playing each other never complain much except community fundraisers and like school friday concerts\nOr if you don't so much fried like it was your age and yeah\nYeah it was it was really cool and uh he would always really generous with his time as always doing stuff like that\nWhat was the relationship your dad had with the success of like ... to put your hand in hand\nI only know it through kind of research and watching interviews and stuff 'cause we never talked about it never\nNo um no we never talked about that stuff I didn't know anything about my dad's career directly from him so\nPart of the great thing about this documentary was that I got to really go back and see so much about him and there's some really great interviews from the early seventies when things are just starting to happen and\nYou know he's living in a house on the east end of the island with ... you know no phone no plumbing and you know nowhere to just become a massive hit and put your hand in hand is about to be too and it's it's um it's interesting to see him because he really wants nothing to do with the money part of things\nUm and that's yeah I think that sums it up he was very bad with money he gave it all away and uh\nAnd it would ... I think charming but also you know made life very challenging from time to time\nI bet it did so your mom in the film says that your dad was never properly diagnosed\nMhm like he was diagnosed as depressive um but post mortem diagnosed as a bipolar from\nReally digging into his you know what was going on in his life and um\nReally digging into his you know what was going on in his life and um yeah it's a strange funny thing\nReally do the pieces are just going to smack together for you and I'm like oh well now some of that stuff just makes sense\nYeah I took a long time for that it took a lot of reading about mental illness and I'm discovering kind of my own depression anxiety and stuff [noise] before I really\nStarted to even I guess yeah I had a bit of knowledge of what was going on but I didn't really until you experience it yourself or you know waiting in someone going through it I don't think you can really understand it but um we didn't talk about it so I didn't know it would be lying on\nWhat I mean people just kind of didn't talk about it all back then\nYou know and they're so there wasn't language to put around it and I think that's\nYou know one of the things I've learned from reading is that not being able to talk about it keeps people from getting health and it's you know that's the biggest thing the stigma about mental illnesses is the big the greatest barrier to early detection treatment and so that's what my goal is to get people talking\nSo after your dad's death your dad died by suicide um you you become introspective you got to retreat into yourself but he says that's when I get to the film right\nI mean I was always fairly shy um as I became a teenager [laughter]\nUm but yeah I definitely went into my room for a few years and learned how to write songs and um yeah I definitely lived inside of sort of bubble for a long time of not really knowing who I was aware of what's going on yeah [noise]\nUm but I think yeah grief took a long time to unfold and\nI feel like I'm just starting to live a life of my choosing you know where I'm actually making the decisions and not just following\nThe river so yeah yeah what can only even when I first met you Katherine I'm I think everyone settle you know it's best Catherine McAllen I messed me to do you know do you know her dad is you know\nYeah it was definitely challenging to to live under that shadow and I I don't [noise]\nYou know they want want me to to be like him or to do what he did and it's funny because I feel like I kind of I have done that of by accident you know I've followed in his footsteps and now I'm really honored to to be part of that lineage and I really I'm excited to share his music with people and and to tell the story because\nOn lots of levels you know it keeps his music alive which kind of keep him alive but it also was an opportunity to talk about the hard stuff\nUh my name's Tom power you're listening to Q.
