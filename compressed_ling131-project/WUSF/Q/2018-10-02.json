Oh thank you for having me in the forward to the same you talk about Leonard's notebooks your father's ... almost as if they were an extension of the man himself can you tell me more about the new book the scraps of paper that surrounded him\nAbsolutely of course this is a man who was devoted to black pages from a very young age and\nThere were scraps of writing everywhere at all times and he would wake up early every morning and we'll just sort of developed sense of purpose that resulted in there's a tower song and this in these terms in terms of excellent work\nAnd um he wasn't doing it for a for anything but I'm a sense of vocation calling\nNaturally uh it wouldn't matter much to me you know there's just this deep impression that he's left on me and anybody else who's had the great fortune of of knowing him\nAnd so of course my work as an imprint of his or her and my thoughts you know mom also in this peculiar position where I Am I'm this reluctant ambassador of a of the of all things going these days\nSo now I feel deeply embroiled and it's a it's a badge of honor but I Do it with some level of discomfort as well\nLike I can I can hear that and I can I can certainly understand that I mean I I think but everything you've done since your father's passing or just ... father started last I mean his\nLast album do you want to darker than to distribute concert in Montreal last year that we spoke about and now you're here talking to me and you're talking to so many people are out the flame this this final book of poetry\nAdam you've done so much to help us whether that was your intention or not but to help us more in your father and and and to understand your father and to\nTo appreciate your father's work you've done so much to help us I Want to thank you for that\nOr you're most welcome those of gracious words from you and I appreciate them have you giving yourself the same chance like ... how are you doing I I was just curious because I Know that\nI Know even when you say when my father passed you know I I I was so deep and this just you know my data so deep and organizing the funeral and organizing the gravestone and organizing the cremation and are organizing the party and an organizer Irish and [noise] and organizing the you know the music and all that stuff that by the time\nIt was over I realized I hadn't really I hadn't really aggrieved at all you know what I mean\n[noise] I ... what you mean yeah you know it's um it's a curious too curious thing to be\nTo be my father son in this world he's left such a remarkable imprint on sending when he's touched and I'm I'm going through his papers there are still so many matters that I'm dealing with\nAnd\nHe comes to me and dreams still I'm embarrassed to say it's been two years since he's passed almost and\n[noise] you know I'm I'm even\nThat was tasked with finishing a few more songs of his that he that he uh that we'd started together on the last album and so his voice is literally still in my life\nUm [laughter] so it's a it's a bizarre so bizarre and delicious entanglement um\nIt's bizarre and delicious entanglement um make a long story short I I Believe that there are some really beautiful new\nSongs of aren't going that no one's heard that uh that are at some point going to come out oh my God that's been that's amazing\nIt's extraordinary that he has left so many poems um they were actually recorded and many of them um we started on the last record on while we were making you want to darker and sometimes I Would implore him even though I knew he was in a delicate stayed at your dad just\nJust read this just read this home to a to a metronome\nAnd we'll look at it later and there's some of my favorite poems of his are actually\nIn the vault and I was tasked with finishing them and what's also beautiful about them is that unlike a the the very the the gravity and the nature and the tenure and the tone of you want a darker and these have to sort of more missed so romantic a\nIn a kind of tone that resembles his older work something more romantic so that's\nAlso more surprising is a daunting for you to have to to finish your father's work like this it's such a luxury it's such a treat and as I say it's been a meditation because I have a little studio in my backyard and\nI go there with the amount of coffee and and areas again senator is powerful distinct voice who happens to be particularly stirring for me because it's my father and the sense of responsibility and a and at the same time as I say you know with\nThis this feeling like um how wonderful that ah\nThat these songs exist and that I'm going to bring them see them to see them to completion for not just for me because I'm part of the family business but for all the people out there who are organ hopefully delight in hearing his language that in the medical contribution of his\nUm [laughter] you know that there are these there are these songs that exist

Believe Adam even really generous before we say goodbye and the forward that you refer to find you cut a line from one of your father songs I came so far for beauty and I left so much behind\nWhy did that line come to mind when you were thinking about your father's life and legacy it reminds me of a few times um towards the end where we'd sit on his front lawn\nAnd the pause would\nWould occur in conversation and he would reflect on all of the compromises that he made all of the all the romances he left all the family a scene that he felt\nThat he had hit poorly acquitted themselves of\nAnd uh he said you know of all the strategies I tried to employ really nothing nothing really works nothing offered the solace that work blanketing pages being a poet offered me and I felt like he was apologizing\nAnd ah\nOf course that song immediately came to mind which is you know he came so far for beauty he left so much behind but of course that wasn't the truth that all you know the amazing impact that he had on our lives on anyone's life he came into\nAdam I really appreciate you taking the time today my notes\nTo Adam I really appreciate you\nTaking the time to time I know it's a ...

now and I should point out you were in a pretty nice watch Oh thank\nYou it's great to be here you're a bit of a watch guy or a little bit of a washing nerd um this watches interesting it belonged to Richard Nixon space advisor back in the seventies risk yeah so this was probably privy to a lot of\nDrunken rancid the Nixon White House you know or Jews colonizing space or that's the exact what for that's exactly why did you get a ... through a friend of mine was watch dealer and it was originally at Christie's auction oh my God it's got a lot of prominence as they say that's what they say\nIt's a very ... is your fictional character I Know you spend a lot of time with the ultra rich people the ... thirty five thousand dollar ...\nUh what what did you learn about yeah I remember we once drank an entire thirty five thousand dollar ... scotch and I realized that we had just drank too Hyundai Sonata is worth of a\nUps guy dates me better it tastes pretty good but Hyundai Sonata as\nIt was very stressful or these guys are you know they are they're stressed out all the time they drink quite a bit uh there were times especially when\nThey're hedge funds were taking that I end up going home at five AM and my wife was sort of an button ing my shirt for me 'cause my fingers wouldn't work and I was born in Russia so I Know how to drink a few a Dram or but it was you know they're not very happy people that was the big\nThe higher I went up the food chain from you know sent a millionaire a billionaire I was like oh my God these are not happy people when they leave these very moded existence is where they don't really leave their Upper East side apartment there club there Hamptons uh stayed there for their funds and so\nI became sort of the hedge fund whisper and I would take him to things like cheap Korean or Indian restaurants and they'd be like oh my God this is actually tastes great ... what a life you live what were you curious about what questions you have for them\nWell that was the question is I knew that and many of them came from these sort of lower middle class backgrounds that grew up in the edges of places like New York or Naples or Moscow and my my sort of feeling was and I also came as an immigrant so I knew the sort of the hunger in their souls and the idea that\nYou know we grew up with tough parents the only thing that could make up for it was billions of dollars right\nUm so I wanted to see if upon of cheating that wealth if if if things actually did improve\nBut you know studies show that if you win the million dollars in the lottery or you lose a limb and about a year and a half you're basically back at your same level of happiness and that's something that I found true for almost all the people I interviewed\nMe I've heard people say that once you can pay your bills once you can pay your bills and once you're you're you're safe and you're like you know once you get your debt paid off in any money after that it's not really going to make any happier yeah but\nIt also works your perceptions I mean I met a currency trader at a bank and and you know and he said um [noise]\nThe problem in this country to play the middle class and I am the middle class and I said wait how do you define the middle class it's just people struggling earning between two and four million dollars I asked for folks were folks so you know so I think places like Manhattan have just become these sort of weird gated communities where nobody really understands how the world\nWorks and I think that that that because that is our leader in the United states that leads to problems like a certain election in two thousand six team\nI Can't begin to know your time you got to know or is he grew up in Russia I was\nBorn in the Soviet Union or in a dictatorship and now I'm living in the United states so yeah it's just bad news keeps following me around I guess\nWhat was your impressions of American wealth when you were growing out\nSeemed incredibly wealthy you know we were we started out we were on section eight housing public housing food stamps all that stuff and there's a scene in the eighties movie called Moscow the Hudson with Robin Williams the kind of captured that moment where Robin Williams cat the character walks into an American supermarkets these five hundred different types of coffee\nAnd he says coffee coffee coffee and he has a heart attack\nAnd and that's kind of how we felt almost fall\nThe coffee and he has a heart attack and and that's kind of how we felt almost all the time when we came to America so this is a long\nTime sort of obsession or at least interested you've had in the lives of the super wealthy\nWhat would I was a kid you know I remember watching the movie Wall Street and we were the poor the poor kid in my Hebrew school called the ... school of queens that I was wearing\nA coat made out of some Soviet ... or something that had a very unattractive smelling I Would read dribble was my nickname so we were very poor and and and back then at least I wanted to I really did want to make money I remember watching Wall Street thinking oh my God this is a the Charlie Sheen character up until he gets arrested that that's the life\nBut after ... spending time with these guys I'm almost allergic to money because I see just how how how little it does for anybody and these poor families you know um [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Tampa", "day": "02"}
