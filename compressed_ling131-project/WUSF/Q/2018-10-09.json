shallow but come on you're in your sixties camp or how to play the cello right out according to listen to Williams who's pretty much the most important figure in American music or Americana music\nShe be quick to tell you that it is never too late\nShe was forty five years old when she released her breakthrough record car wheels on a gravel road there was one of the first big albums to blend traditional country music with Grady rock and roll and making a sound that now defined as Americana\nTurn\nKnown\nCome on and on and\n\nThat is the title track from the cinder Williams Nineteen Ninety eight record car wheels on a gravel road which was adored by critics ended up winning a Grammy\nCar wheels and a gravel road turn twenty this past June and just before that big anniversary with a new Williams joined me from a studio in the LA to look back at that breakthrough moment and all she's accomplished since ... much like listening to his long rollercoaster career our conversation took some twists and turns\nYou're going to hear her talk about what it's like to start a music industry so lays especially in an industry that values Hughes\nShe also opened up about the recent deaths of some important people in our lives her father the poet Miller Williams for best buddy Tom Petty it's an emotional conversation and like all good ones one that took some time to warm up\nHere at least in the Williams though taking you back to the record that changed everything for her car wheels on a gravel road\nListen I Know this is something you're probably either don't think about or you think about about our ten into that overnight bus ride but do you ever think about why that one had such a big impact on so many people\nWell I mean I think about it when I'm doing interviews like this you know the answer is I'm not really sure I mean I was completely shocked when it's out one or Grammy and all that stuff happened yeah I mean I never\nI mean it was a you know certainly a commercial elite a commercial sounding album for that time or anything marketing laws and all that there was a lot of confusion I remember you know and\nWhen this album came out I'd have to go to these you know conventions and that sort of thing and I was wearing a cowboy hat not done\nYou know I'm [laughter] God Forbid you know they said I don't you shouldn't work cowboy hat because then they're going to take her country and\nYou know we're not marketing as marketing at it as a country and so you don't want to confuse them power a cowboy out you know yeah there is not a good advice you know that was for the some of the heavy metal God's or a cowboy hat I mean you know you do you feel like they record but\nThere was so powerful and dark and primal and scary you know\nUm when you go back and listen to those a lot of the lyrics and those early songs you know they're very dark and mystical you know I'm like banks of the Ohio yeah our barber Allen where\nYou know her lover tapes or ... or the guy takes his love her to the woods 'cause she's been unfaithful and you know as plunges a knife into her breast and the blood runs down and you know\nI Love that line in the banks the Ohio by my dad used to sing it it was and only say that you'll be my any no other arms implying I always thought that was such a beautiful\nMind yeah it's beautiful\nYeah no I didn't ... what I got ya I wanted to get your perspective on this because I I Know we're we're we're talking about death a fair bit here but I wanted to get some perspective on someone else who I met a lot to you which was Tom Petty who we lost so suddenly last year yeah what a tell me do you oh\n\nKnow we were starting to become really you know friends you know and it started with just a mutual admiration for each other's music and art
