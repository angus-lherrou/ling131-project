Scott Thompson\nDoing things no one else was doing at the time they poke fun at corporate culture before it was cool they joked about quote unquote normal families they played women without making them the punch line and one of them Scott Thompson was was openly gay at a time when that was a huge deal in the world's comedy so there's a new book out that takes you through the history of\nThat group it's called the kids in the hall one dumb guy it's written by Paul Myers musician author and I've been worth mentioning brother to comedian Mike Myers um and his is the first authorized biography kids in the hall and excited to tell you Paul sitting across from me\nIn the studio right now ... stuck in traffic going to be here I Am yeah he's he's on his way about a comedy bit so this is\nExactly the shopping costume in a couple of minutes are there any of these here right now and it's funny you should say that because he's actually walking through the don't have that we were planning really perfectly have roots Tom hey man they they just see it how's it going you did a great job here other than on behalf of Canada\nI appreciate my speak for of course he dogs I mean I I I like I represent you so it's one of the thing that stands out to me in this in this book is that um you guys are just\nFriends you guys are just guys you got together and you even what what's the story here that you like you start talking into joining the group that you were driving down the road yelling at him after a show sort of he he actually came to one of our least successful shows\nUm and through jelly doughnut status which was a a bit from the show that we had before oh pry had put a donut under the seat\nUm that was part of the thing and it was a very poorly attended show and he started heckling awesome throwing donuts at us and then later said I'm going to be part of you and we said yeah right and of course he was at the very so you you have ... I should say like you you fall kids in the hall and the early\nDays yeah you're not you're not an outside observer here now I Would say I'm not I'm On the outside groups are so so what surprised you the most in writing and researching this book well just the complexity of their relationships are and also learning about their their um their roots like so you got mark and Bruce who had met out west in Calgary\nUh Saturday Night live people we understand we need it you know is Loren always says you need a home artist need homes and to have a troop it's a beautiful thing and\nOtherwise we're just sort of in the wind flapping in the winter so this is that like I said there's a new generation of people who are discovering kids in the hall for the first time you have people like me watch it on comedy network but then I was you know I was no trouble to try and find sketches yesterday on on YouTube\nFrisbee tell Vanity Fair that the fact that anyone still cares about our material and legacy is interesting what do you mean well I'm you know I went through time early on when people liked our show and it would shut me down and it was the saddest thing because I used to like to drink alone in bars and that that to stop it also related to kind of being punk like was it\nI think too many people that I just I used to have a book and when someone asked my autograph I take ...\nTo ... an it's an exchange I'm just we're just all people um\nBut I think now that I've gotten older and I have to ... I could let down my card I Know that they're going to be playing the days I not my funeral and I'm happy [laughter] and I and I I used to fear are fans because of but now I embrace them so\nYeah the fact that we're still reverberating for anybody is fantastic so called ... where do you then what what is it that makes the kids in the hall timeless\nI think it's that thing that about speaking to like you said corporate culture and social\nThe social sort of thing and there's still a suburban culture a and there's still a sense of who inside who's outside so there that stuff will be timeless and they never dated it to any specific reference there is no references to any particular era in the kids in the hall it it does have a certain through line that is not dated to one era\nWas that intentional by the way it was that intentional at the time I got I guess it couldn't have been ... we just did our thing I mean obviously you know I was really anti parity so we did very little of that\nUm but no I mean I we were sponsored by routes but we wouldn't where roots shirts so you can see us wearing roots shared some of it was just I don't know we just we were just digging around lives but yeah I think that's what I look I think that's what I loved about the book the most that's been a lot of time I've learned since during the show\nThe stop asking so many questions about what does that mean that you did that or what does that have a choice me because I'm learning from from my own experience but just a learning that the best stuff is made when you just make it\nOh yeah and it's like when people say where does your where did you get that idea I don't know it just came into my brain and so I think we were just digging our lives and digging them out as\nAnd it worked out but isn't that something beautiful about that that just like living their lives digging out your experiences try and stuff on not thinking about it too much and then here we are all these years later and still kind of celebrating well he was wonderful it's a great joy in my life I look at my house and I go wow my imagination bought me this nice yeah yeah but Paul this is a beautiful book thank you thank you\nNice yeah yeah I haven't published the beautiful book thank you thank you so many means a lot from you ... thanks I really appreciate a repair she renting it and and ... both coming in well thank you thank you for being tardy you know it was kind of a cool moment for me though I got to be cool radio guy was like hey come on in British no problem you know and we're going to answer that thousand dollars in coming up\nJust kidding we don't have any money to get one guy is the first authorized biography as a sketch comedy group\nAnd it is out now coming up and just a minute to be a really special you're going to hear from one of the architects of popular music Nile Rogers and spent the last forty plus years working with some of the biggest musicians on the planet he produced like a virgin for Madonna he adds\nThe baseline for good times which ended up becoming the baseline rappers delight which really started hip hop all day one of the mount Rushmore of all popular music now Rogers\nYou're going to take you through his whole career\nWith a legend Roger\n\n... good evening I'm Tyler climbed as soon as the U.S at eighty nine point seven your NPR station or hurricanes lightning flooding in tornadoes affect the entire state of Florida and the team a meteorologist from the Florida public radio emergency network keep you informed around the clock\nAll year long we're committed to providing ... weather coverage both on to the U.S up and on the mobile labs Florida storms the Florida public radio emergency network is supported by Wu SF and citizens property insurance on line at citizens F.

I. G. and Will Smith\nWho eats usa pretty famous sampled basically if you've worked up a thread dancing to any of those songs before even if you have to tell chances are you're a big fan of Nile Rogers whether you know it or not he's the music\nMastermind behind a lot of those songs and samples you just heard he spent the last five decades winning Grammys and producing them playing some of the biggest pop music hit ever\nAnd I'll have to own band Sheikh become a huge in the seventies then he helped David Bowie and Diana Ross make the biggest records of their careers you help Madonna create them her earliest hits he helped pave the way\nOf their careers you help Madonna create them her earliest hits he helped pave the way for hip hop to become as big as it is today I don't know if you remember that big record from jak punk a few years back remember get lucky yeah that's now Rogers to playing guitar on that and co writing it\nRecently now Rogers is put out a bunch of new music under his old band name sheik and he stopped by the cues studio to talk about the latest record he's worked on but\nJust so much music there's so much history with now Rogers we had to go through some of it we had a living legend in our midst so we decided to start here\nAnd\nYou know I [noise]\nThat is the Beatles energy in life I think it's only sitting in front of you that I realized how ... they fly a\nLot of time I I Swear to God God I just sat there and we seem\nNice voice leading man [laughter] it was like I never thought about that but I think there's something about being with us maybe go into the that's kind of funky that that's the voice yeah for sure if that's the first one you learned guitar is that right Harry first thing I've learned to play on guitar how did that happen\nUm well I was a clarinet is and I grew up during the hippie movement and um that was the sexy rock and roll thing to play\nA and and I was a sharing an apartment with this girl who had a band that she needed a guitar player will because I could already read music well I've thought how hard could this be you know like everybody in the work and play guitar\nAnd I picked up the guitar I tuned it improperly and she fired me right on the spot\nAnd then I learned to tune the guitar properly and I had a Beatles song book and that was the first song I work my way through but I remember reading about you you were somehow involved in the black panther party point or another big time I was a subsection leader of ah the ... of a a section called the lower Manhattan Black Panthers\nAnd we were part of what they call the Harlem branch um people have a very um\nThey they don't really have a very accurate picture of the way the black panther party was organized at all it's all like yeah ... years say and stuff\nBut the truth is that it was actually quite organized and it was organized on what they called the ten ten ten system so the way it was supposed to work was each state\nWould have ten branches each branch would have ten sections each section with Afghan subsection\nSo I was a subsection leader of the lower Manhattan branch I mean a lower Manhattan a section of the Harlem brat so we grew up in a time where\nIt was the beginning of you know the civil rights movement had really started to ... was really developed um\nSo it was the first time in the black power movement but what was really important is that we were at the beginning of\nOther movements like the gay pride movement women's movement all of that stuff happening online so right exactly so so the Panthers were seen as the vanguard of the revolution so to speak em I Want to hear some more music take a listen to that\n[noise]\n\nAnd I just had to say to myself this is an artist who intrinsically knows who she is and knows\nThe message she's trying to get to the people she's trying to get it to\n'em all I could do at this point now support her and the other thing is that I played it for a friend of mine who I I really respect a lot um and she said now I Swear to you that song is going to be number one for six weeks at least and she was right [laughter] was number one victory [noise]\nIf you're just tuning in this cue I'm Tom power you're listening to a little bit of get lucky from ... featuring for Williams also featuring guitar playing from my gas to the guy who co wrote a Grammy Award winning producer rock and Roll Hall of famer and living legend now Rogers\nJunior and senior [noise] on men would think again you know if this\nCame around and only tell me as much as you want to tell me if it just came around that as sort of a scary personal time for you to read yeah yeah I uh was recovering\nFrom I'm from extremely aggressive prostate cancer and um the doctors were not certain of my outcome\nUm and I was just doing what I was supposed to do what they told me there you know walking five miles a day in a ... you know after I had my prostate surgically removed\nAnd um and of course they monitor you to see if they got all the cancer because that's the problem with cancer is that you know they could still be microscopic part that haven't shown themselves and you know and they think you're fine and next thing you know they go oh my God it's come back\nAnd in fact it really hadn't left they just [noise]\nMy God it's come back and in fact it really hadn't left they just hadn't gotten it or sometimes it does come back\nSo in my case I was in the initial recovery periods\nWhen I got the phone call which is how we sort of\nWound up hooking up together because we had been trying to hook up together for years and every time I Would go to France there'll be some kind of strike and I can never get to where they were they could have made it through Iowa\nAnd I and I used to think that was cool because I said you know when I was a kid we had strikes all the time and now in America nobody's strikes over anything and you know ... whatever do you feel different than that and that scares since that Mm\nI'm no I'm not really um\nThe the ... 'cause I've had I had a second bout of cancers since the first big one um and um [noise] you know I'm ... and I've lost so many really close friends\nUm you know like you you know you think about the people in the Sheikh organization the original ... when I look at that original picture of us would Luther Vandross Bernard Edwards Tony Thompson Raymond Jones I'm ray Maldonado five people in that photo\nEvery male except for myself and Rob um have passed away every guy um\nAnd it just it's so weird because I was the most reckless because I grew up\nWith the sort of most ... type ... parents you know I'm ... I you know I tell people that I've never been given a curfew in my entire life my parents never ever said to me now come home when the lights come on or anything like that because they knew that instinctively I knew to come home when there was nothing else to do\nWe've got we've got one more song for you to listen to this\n[noise]\n\nThat's just a little taste of the new single from now Rogers and she said the world falls right yeah featuring a a ... a big mess and coach that they're going to come and grab you at some point I'm sure you've been talking for so long but that's\nCool man the longer the is better for me as a last question they have an abstract\nOne okay I assume that one of these days I'm going to get to watch the Nile Rogers' story on film you know what I mean I'm gonna get to see that day when they walk the line that they can get really extraordinary life you've led so let me put this to you you were watching the movie the credits are rolling [laughter] what song is playing\nWow that's a cool question I've never heard it put to me like that before I Would imagine it would be good times um and I think the reason why would be either good times or maybe we are family um\nJust because those two songs for us I'm really where life changing and maybe I'm\nSo we're family was really important because we knew that we created\nYou know we created a phenomenon which is just such a Sledge yeah I mean there was like you know like we really proved to ourselves that we could do what we did for ourselves for someone else and maybe even better um\nAnd ... and and good times because of what happened after good times with hip hop I mean it's just you know um I I remember watching um uh an interview with El Al Quds Jay and they asked him they said uh uh what do you think is the single most important\nThing that ever happened in hip hop and he didn't even waste the mini the [laughter] the release of good times he says without good times and media that every MC what do you go home and write ... why why it was a good time soon\nYou do that every MC what do you go home and write well why why it was a good time so important because good times had to break had the long break down ... every time you went to a hip hop has which you know a lot of people who aren't of a certain age\nThey don't remember that at the beginning they would call those events pops right we're going to a hip hop\nAnd I I remember when I first asked somebody about it what does that mean they said well you take something hip and you hop on it I was like oh really they should yeah so good times was really hip and then we thought it and we come what we'd come up with our own lyrics for the breakdown in good times had this incredibly long break down which eventually wound up becoming\nYou know rappers delight and in a lot of other people were inspired matter of fact people most people don't realize that when I wrote good times\nI'm John Deacon from queen was actually in the studio with us when it came a one year to the day with another one bites the dust with clean do do do\nDo do do do they took it to your first hip hop show right but that America's ... she took me to the first one yeah and it was out in Queens and that's when she said now I Want to take you to a ... year wasn't able to show he was doing hip hop catering to a how'd you how did you feel and you got there\nI couldn't believe it because the only song that was played was good that it was just over and over and over and over again for about maybe four hours\nAnd hours like aren't they sick of this song by now um\nAnd they were not sick of it and every MC which just lined up and they had they arrive ready for good times when they would come in and it was it was incredible thanks for coming in you got it now Rogers the multi Grammy Award winning rock and Roll Hall of fame producer sheiks new album ... it's about time it's happened everywhere\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\nAt a sheet and good times now Rogers produced wrote and plays guitar on that track if you missed my interview Nile or you want to share it with somebody we're going to have it up and the coupon cats McHugh coming up after your niche\nAnd you can do the USS\n...
