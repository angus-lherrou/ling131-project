are but earlier this year there was a bit of an upset in the book world had to do with the man Booker Prize which is sort of the Oscar sort of the enemies of literature so the upset was for the inclusion for the first time ever a graphic novel in the list of finalists\nThe book is called Sabrina by mixed or not though it didn't end up winning the prize but it did get people thinking about the boundaries we set up between one form or another and why why we feel the need to differentiate between art forms at all and that's something that Catherine ever met has given some thought to\nIf you want a governor generals award as a poet and came close to winning his second as a novelist for a book you might be familiar with called the break she writes children's stories and most recently she writes graphic novels\nHer first one came out last year at called him making more than she followed up with a sequel at the end of November and if you asked Katherine ever Matt how she manages to

all in there somewhere as as we all are an artist\nAnd they they seem to coincide like its chronology you know they seem to go one after the other like after the documentary the graphic novel feels very close to that because I was working with collaborators and I was ... people who are much more talented than I was\nAnd really kind of directing how things look and I got to do that visual stuff and the graphic novel but you do very very differently and poetry and in prose\nSo does feel more connected maybe than um say the other earlier stuff\nI find through all the all your work a lot of a lot of it focuses on youth or like teenager years adolescence what what do you find so fascinating about that time\nWell I I really started the book of poetry came out when my eldest daughter was I think twelve so it was really kind of coming explain my own adolescence as I was approaching these these two teenage girls who are about to take me through the ringer so a lot of that would be for my girls and from their friends and my nieces and nephews\nBecause they're really of that era but\nYou really remember the things that happened to you as you you came of age she really they're very impactful you as you go forward [noise] um I Know in in studying different like you know education things about the brain and how when we're teenagers we actually hardwired all of those habits\nAre so that we actually do remember things when we're Seventeen a lot better than we remember things that happen say when we're twenty five [noise]\nUm and the way we deal with things in the way we look at life is really made in the course of those those times when our brains are actually forming around our hopefully good habits mostly bad habits when my kids anyway you directed it\nHopefully good habits mostly bad habits when my case anyway you directed\nA documentary called this river you want a Canadian screen a word for it and a documentary tells the story of your brother Wayne who went missing in guide and maybe the reason I'm asking so many questions about the teenage years because I was really struck that you were just fourteen when he disappeared [noise] like why would why would that the right time to tell this story\n[noise] my part in the documentary came about 'em really reluctantly I really wanted to talk about a drag the red and the efforts that are going on right now with people who have a loved ones who are murdered or are are missing\nAnd then I get through that I realized how close was to that story and how much I really felt\nUm a kinship to these efforts in
