I don't know it was really dry and boring and I didn't care that much every single time that they went up\nEarlier honky or to be Armstrong [laughter] roughing star Ryan Gosling had there's\nTons of close ups on him and every single twitch of his faith has been captured for us to enjoy forever even if he maybe don't want to remember Neil Armstrong\nThere's been captured for us to enjoy forever even if we maybe don't want to remember Neil Armstrong a much habit of aiding maybe [laughter] knowledge that surround sound like it's so ugly I guess I guess what the film it's trying to say like oh yeah the sixties this is what it actually look like they also I think\nThat you get a real sense of how terrifying it must have been to take this rattling box up into space and and take people with\nIt it was a great moment if I may say to you and I saw the phone together in theaters last week and a fellow behind us is our phone kept going off\nA from a very amusing because you hear all the time about how uh we have more technology in our pockets than was used to go to the moon so when you're actually watching the sort of rickety old spaceships a metal bar and he's gotten a call from his mom or something I don't know the front of kind of amusing but did you find that the director managed to keep it interesting\nFor the most part yeah I mean there I Will say this when they get to the moon spoiler alert a and the sort of general opens up on this broad lunar panorama I mean obviously it's not really go to the actual moon for this ... there was like an an odd caution the audience which is something you hear very rarely and I thought it was quite\nBeautiful it affecting from is\nTo just silence as well in order to deliver that and and again it ties back to Armstrong's personal story like um the the the beginning of the movie um deals with like the fact that he lost his daughter to cancer of like the daughter is extremely young\nSo there are lots of flashbacks to that um and ... all the way to the end of the movie including them in landing\nAnd want to go to a bit of a controversy that opened up over the course of the weekend first men um doesn't show Neal Armstrong planting the American flag on the moon a huge moment in history that we've all lived and we lived many tires parodies of may have been made of it it's been repeated\nIt's kind of this a steady backdrop for history and that caused quite a bit of controversy online involving Florida Senator Marco Rubio and many other people have chimed in John can you unpack it for us little\nAfter ... I have to be mindful of a public radio standards when I was going to find it so frustrating I mean this movie has American flags all over it there's a huge shot\nOf the camera going up the side of the ship it's as you noted speeds these people are clearly American and everybody knows it you see the flag on the moon you just don't see it being planted so the claim that this movie somehow not patriotic enough\nAh watch why people who are presumed haven't seen it a is ludicrous and I mean it just says a lot about where we are today that everybody wants to sort of make these things political\nYeah like there's just no there isn't as much fanfare like there might have been in earlier movies about American space travel and and and I do think that would be a had not seen the film when he tweeted that so it's coming from a place of ignorance it\nIsn't the only commentary that really tells you a lot of it you can have commentary that go out and then it kind of the fires up it to the point where it may have compromised Oscar possibilities for this film\nI'm so we have this claim that it's unpatriotic I'm I'm Wondering what you think about the\nThe need of a story like this to be so called patriotic especially that planting of the of the flag what was the idea between for for cutting that out literally deciding making it sets a clear decision they must have sat at the creative naval and decided we're not going to have the ethic moment everybody knows all about\nIt's not a story about that moment it's a story about Neil Armstrong's interior life right it's not it's not a story about America getting to the moon it's a story about a scientist who underwent extreme psychological you know pain and and all this stuff in his own life\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou're listening to you on CBC Radio one series and an animal one sixty nine and from ... public radio international I throw away low in for Tom power [noise]\nWell here's a question for you how many times today have you looked at your phone and it's one of many themes you're about to hear about on the new record from Aftab\nYes we cannot say their full name on the radio but you might also remember them because they were the hard core band that won the players music prize in two thousand nine and it probably best known for making music that sounds like this [noise]\nOut there from asked a that was their last record glass boys released four\nYears ago and the band unveiled their new album does your dreams and along with topics like social media and its impact on our culture the record also brings it's a really different sound for the hard core band they loved switching things up for their fans you'll hear in this one it's a disco their sixties pop\nBut like a lot of their previous albums you'll still find a pretty hardcore punk songs in the next they haven't completely deserted who they are they're just trying a little bit of new territory\nDamon Abraham Mike how the check and ... they piled into the studio with Tom power and the story um I just make you think about all that social media that you're plugged into\nThe almost the moment the Damien Abraham sat down in the studio with Tom he\nAdmitted this record almost never saw the light of day once asked up finished their lives\nThis record oh never saw the light of day once at that finished their lifestyle than you thought it might actually be done\nGlass was was really kind of the like and the end of a lot in the end of the band a lot of thought it was like you know certainly the end of my\nNeed to be created in the day and like I think last words is ultimately a compromise you know Mike came to me and he's like I wanted to this crazy elaborate thing and I'm like mom I don't have any interest in doing that I Want to do a strip down shredded park record and with with F. up it's impossible to get a straight up\nStraightforward hardcore record and we got ... which I I Do like that record I Do stand by that being like if I never write another album where the lyrics again in my life\nI said everything I wanted to say on that record you know I think by between all the records but like all the things that I felt I haven't said this yet I think I said the ... they had to had a period at the end of that sense I mean I think so yeah like I felt like a fellow at the end of a chapter in a in a big way like and I think\nYou know it felt like the end of the book for me but I you know definitely another chapter\nAgendas tell me about the first sort of\nAn impulse is to go into the studio after class boys that first of all to go to the city to make those dreams and I would say that there was very little impulse to go into the studio to echo some of the things that Damien saying in a way\nAnd an end to bring in what Mike was talking about glass boys being a challenge it was kind of exhausting to get that done and get that on paper and the idea of having to go back into the studio insurance something out creatively I feel that there was a big void for us it was lucky that we always have these and\nOther projects that we can work on this zodiac series where you can sort of get ideas out of the way kind of them\nAs though you need to overcook a few things before you get what you do get the recipe right and and going back into does your dreams we had absolutely nothing and prepares and nothing plan so the prospect of going into the studio was kind of the same as sitting at home where you where'd you wouldn't go into the studio at all just judging by what Damien just said ah\nI actually I didn't have that worried and\nNot to try and take the the rug out of what what do you think of as the creativity and what he needed to say I just always assumed that there's going to be some project that up is going to endeavor to be a part of ... just in the studio\nReally became a tool for us real conduit for and songwriting ... became an instrument almost and some somewhere between glass boys and and does your dream so I just assumed it would be there to tell you the truth I had no idea in what way but they never ... I\nCan't get over the range of of genres on his record and he really even like to talk about genres that much but I I I Do hear like like I mean we heard a bit of extra disco and under your dreams pop it gets hard core it's just like do up tendencies on this\nMike was was the intention to try out a bunch of different genres or was it just things were coming to you and you wanted to put them out in the way they were they were coming in your head [noise]\nYeah like we weren't really writing an album we just had it was sort of like we had studio time we were just writing music and it wasn't until like a year later that the songs we got started coalesce into a fully realized thing so\nI think me and Jonah just spent so much time together and every one of the band isn't just so many different kinds of music and sort of like scholars of music that we just had a lot in there we want it to sort of flex and just see what kind of stuff we could make\nAnd it wasn't until a lot later that those songs started becoming a after ups on\nDamon ... that's we kind of pointed out from talking to Mike and joined us if you weren't there for all of this what was your reaction when the ... ah well there are like kind of three stages I'm Jonah was there for the first days as\nA I got brought the song we're we download a couple yeah we're definitely other versions of some of some of the song um and it was one of those thing\nAnd some of some of the song um\nAnd it was one of those things where you know like I forget which one it was and I I remember being in there and being like I'm not how can I write to them so I was also admit some kind of producing in in in hosting this wrestling TV show uh so I was travelling like all the time really focused on that and the and it was just so\nDifferent you know and it was just so different ... different ... I think it was different from what I wanted the band to be right you know and I think with\nTrying to write the way I write to those songs I was having a lot of problems like it was not a productive session I think we've got a couple we gotta beside out of it like the four or five days and\nThe leaders are writing were really lazy you know and I was just like what am I going to write about you know I wasn't writing to someone who is before the concept was kind of introduced and we were just kind of like writing in trying different things out\nAnd uh I I just couldn't really find it and I remember going to Mike and being like I don't I don't I don't know why he wasn't really working and uh then my came back and said I wrote everything and that at first was like you know my natural reaction was like Wal Mart saying everything you wrote like I'll eventually run my own songs and then\nYou know he just kind of had it all figured out you know he had this whole kind of plan in place and so for the first time instead of being like well how do I fit into your plan I was like which is something that I think Jonah has done a long time in the band been like how do I eat this plan\nIn aid coming to fruition and Jones did that for me when I was writing songs with the ban certainly doesn't for Mike and so that's what I decided I was going to try and do this record you know yes and it's I heard it's definitely hard like I think I think it's hard to put your ego in check\nFor for anything you know and especially in a band especially being a lead singer in a band I remember Gore told me one time like dang first counties are those like the worst name dropping ever but Gore Downie said too said to me one time there's like a elites here's where it differently\nYou know like the lead singer you have to take in\nAll this energy and that's positive and negative and I think you do that night in a night out you do that every time you write a record and that's that's training and you know as a lead singer you have to have this ego defense that's up in place I on ending empathy for\nYou know people milling music that do silly things none criminal horrible things I should but stuff's fiber like people that do and say\nDumped on Saddam Hussein damn yeah because I think it's just like it does tickle your mind eventually being in in a band\nBut I Want I Want to talk more a little bit about the record or you're just tuning in speaking with ...
