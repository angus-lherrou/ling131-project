John the Riley and the pictures brothers they play to guns for hire in the Old West\nThese two characters that is the worst southern accent in the world by the way the two characters come to you directly from the imagination of a guy named Patrick do add that to do with the Canadian author who wrote a novel the sisters brothers back in twenty eleven it was one of those big instant had it when the governor general ward and the writers truck toward\nMade the short list for the man Booker and this goes to a bank teller pride which is kind of like the ah Grammy's and Juno's of literature and that's about as good as the get for a novel in this country and this was only Patrick deWitt second book\nAll that attention was pretty new to him than I mean this is a guy who before he was a writer\nWith a high school dropout he was a bartender he was a house painter well fast forward a few years and you shouldn't be starting to get used to the spotlight not only does the sisters brothers hit theaters tomorrow Patrick ... new novel French Exit just got short listed for this year's\nGeller prize so when we talked I had to start out with some congratulations\nPatrick welcome to Q. congrats on the nomination Oh thanks very much I feel like a good week to be you man\n[laughter] um yeah I I I have no complaints things are going well with a new book well\nAnd also the sisters brothers movie opens this weekend is it true that the whole idea for this story began with two words you wrote in your notebook sensitive cowboy and\nThat was the very start yeah and that just um resulted in a in some dialogue between two men on horseback it occurred to me I mean growing up with my father I watched any number of westerns with them but I was watching I Believe it was one of the spaghetti westerns and I think it would leave increase food stylist villain in some of these films\nAnd I begin to wonder you know where do you shop where does what does this man by his Cape and and and uh it occurred to me that the interior lives of the characters of westerns it's often obscured so I think that was sort of a where the sensitive part came in you know what what makes these men pick was the question\nSent me an email 'em and John was particularly emphatic that I Would regret it if I didn't come and then I was being foolish\nAnd I went um because of these emails they talked me into it and I was pleased that they had because it was very moving actually to see all of this industry and all of these professionals working towards the similar goal which was to recreate a book that I made up in my pajamas you know\nOther than that and then when you can get somebody came out of your imagination in your pajamas you get to walk around the you get to like you don't touch in an experience that place that you came up with in your mind\n[noise] well I did yeah and that was just so strange and wonderful that I could do this on the set was really expensive and there was all these sort of dead areas where there were no actors are cameras but they\nThey dressed it just in case they used it so I was sort of walking to these empty bar rooms and I'm saloons and and and um [noise]\nYou know stores where people were selling horses or whatever it was it was very elaborate and labyrinth thin and thorough and just a you know what what a treat this was for me and how and how strange to get your experiences\nI had to track the really really would not not not to use non DVD language here but what a trip that must've been it really was yeah at the you've written already written a screenplay for your new novel for French that why did you learn from this adaptation of this done the sisters brothers that you can't take with you as you make more stories into felt\nRight I don't know that it'll necessarily influenced the way I rights I think that my we're generally lends itself to screen play because of the amount of dialogue and so much of a story and the character um progression zone revealed three of the things that they say or don't say [noise]\nBut um I learned through this how difficult it is to make a sizable picture I mean John had the property in his possession before the book was\nPublished I think maybe before it was\nProperly accepted even though this is eight years ago and he's been working tirelessly he announced and to to to realize this\nFilm and it's taken them this long um it's just the um [noise] as far as simpler to write books you know I mean writing books has its own set of problems but you just sit down and do it you know but they're collaborative nature of film is something that I was just really impressed by how much\nUm discussion and and um how many people are involved in the making of a film so I was humbled by it in a way it also made me appreciate my own focus\nUm fourth relatives simplicity but it also you know I mean seeing I'm seeing the sisters brothers film\nYou know I mean seeing I'm seeing the sisters brothers film enjoying it as much as I did it made me team to do it again you know so I think um it was a best case scenario and then I think I could have come out of his experience thinking well I don't want to do that again but in fact I feel just the opposite so\nSo we mentioned that French acted it up for discussion painkiller congratulations again by the way Oh thanks very much how do you find out your shortlist that you could get a phone call that an email\n[noise] well it was a there was an email but I don't have email at home so I didn't get the email till that afternoon and my friend ... who um will direct French Exit she actually called me and he assumed I knew but he was the one to tell me\nSo that was nice but then mum a moment after my father called them he was at the airport I'm heading actually to Paris himself\nAnd he said in his typically ... style he said well you made the shortlist you just ask [laughter]\n... you've been winter big awards before and you've been asked about\nWinning awards before um I I Hope I Hope you take this in the way it's meant but the sisters brothers was short listed for the killer it it didn't when I Do want to ask you because we never hear that perspective why don't you like to be up for a huge pride and and not take it home\nYeah well I think the experience with the dealer and then with the book or as well um my feeling with with these two prizes as if you've made it to the shortlist and there's this sense that you one already and and I don't really have that hyper competitive spirit that\nI'm sure there are some authors who get to this point and then if they don't when they're disappointed or angry or or there's some you know negative response and with both together in the book reading feel that at all um\nIt's an it's a natural feeling to want to take it to the very end but it doesn't override the you know the sort of wonder and and and the brilliance of just being there in the first place so I have a feeling of being pleased that it's on the shortlist and I'm not really worrying about what comes next\nCountry that would have been nice talking to you\nKnow he was well thank you I'll see you

could lose legal access to abortion\nTo some that will be an incredible victory to others and unimaginable laws\nWithout raging in the background a new novel hit bookstores this week it's about a

a spark of light and if the new novel from Jodi Pico one of the best selling author is around right now\nJody joins me from New York City to tell me more about it I Jody high your author's note at the end of the book which was really as a as a resting as any other part of the book you write laws are black and white the lives of women or a thousand shades of gray tell me more about that\n[noise] that's actually why I wrote the book when I was in college I had a really good friend who was seven weeks pregnant or unwanted pregnancy\nVery upset and she and her boyfriend had many cheerful nights and finally decided to get an abortion and I supported her a hundred percent\nYears later I was pregnant with my third child I was seven weeks pregnant and there was a complication and when I went to the doctor they said to me well you know either it's going to stick or it's not and I was devastated because to me that was already a baby and I couldn't figure out how I could hold both of those things in my mind\nThat two seven we pregnancies you know one would be okay to go and have an abortion the other one\nTo me it was already a baby that I wanted\nAnd that to me made me think really hard I think how we define ourselves it's not just a matter of whether we think we fall into a pro life or pro choice camp I think that for the same woman over the course of one lifetime you may sway a little\nWhere do you find yourself right now\nI Am very strongly pro choice\nYou need you talk to people on all sides of this debate in your book what do you think people in the pro choice side might get wrong about people on the pro life tired\nExactly what I did frankly you know I went into my interviews with people who are pro life making assumptions that were dead wrong I\nThought that these people were crazy religious zealots\nAnd what I found was that the people I spoke with were really nice people they were people I Would have been friends with I Would have gone out to dinner with them we have tons of things in common we just didn't happen to agree on this one issue and people who are pro life the vast majority come from a place of deep compassion and deep convictions\nAnd what about the other side did you find the right thing they're pro lifers or people in the pro life time you'd know about people in the ... guide to perhaps they should\nYes people assume that women who have abortion or using it at birth control that is a flat out lie no woman and I talked to a hundred and fifty one of them goes to get an abortion just because it's easy it's not easy it is it emotionally draining it takes a lot of time and a lot of money I\nI should say for people who haven't haven't read the book that when you read the book you you you don't just get the perspective of people who were added abortion ... to get an abortion you could reach through no no no you get the respect of the of of of the doctors working to get the perspective of anti abortion protesters Jodie is it hard to write with empathy about a character with whom you strongly disagree\n[noise] I think it's my job to do that I Do not believe that it's a writer it's my job to tell a reader what to think\nBut I Do think it's my job to present very fairly all sides of the situation lay out all the arguments that as you're reading you can go through them and figure out why you believe what you believe you may change your mind you may not\nAnd yet I bet it may be the first time you've ever really listen to what someone in opposition has to say yes you know we we tend when we know someone doesn't believe what we believe we tend to immediately judge them particularly in my country right now which is really broken and where people are on great divides\nWe've got to figure out how to have conversations and just listen\nJody Pico and your new book spark of light the story unfold during a mass shooting hostage taking that are women\nThe story unfold during a mass shooting hostage taking credit women's health clinic in Mississippi one called just the center I'm you spend a lot of time in clinics like the one in the story in this book what are the people who worked in replacements tells you about their experiences and their fears about the kind of violence that you describe ... book\n[noise] so it's it's really fascinating and and frightening ... even in a city like Boston where a abortions are readily available and there are lots of clinics um when you go in there are guards and security and metal detectors and uh it feels like you're walking into a prison\nIn the deep south it's very different because although they also have security measures there is a gauntlet", "show_name": "Q", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "05"}
