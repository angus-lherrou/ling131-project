USF dot org slash sigh fry an additional sponsorship comes from the H. C. I. group\n[noise]\nYou're listening to chew on CBC Radio one serious acts and one sixty nine NPR Iowa Public radio international\nMy name is Tom power\nCouple of weeks ago on the show you might've heard Maggie Gyllenhaal telling you a bit about her latest film if you missed it she stopped by the cues studio during the Toronto international film festival where her new movie the ...\nBy the cues studio during the Toronto international film festival where her new movie the kindergarten teacher was having a premier so when he was sitting here in the studio as you might have guessed from black bloc in the show we ended up talking for a very very long time\nWe couldn't actually fit the whole conversation into the show the weeks ago so I'm excited for you to hear the second chapter of our interview now the maggots film was about to hit Netflix don't worry you can pick it up here 'cause we're gonna talk about a new film to kindergarten teacher which takes you into the classroom of happy five year olds\nAre but it has pretty dark side to it as well Maggie Gyllenhaal character is this teacher wind up taking things too far with one of her young students not not like that what that means that she becomes quite obsessed with unlocking the secret of a little boys poetry\nThe film ends up being a psychological thriller but also side of sort of a black comedy as well you'll hear Maggie Gyllenhaal dig into more of this unbelievable story in just admitted including how she helped pull this film together on a set full of five year olds\nI could do like to have you here thanks for having me so I'm a poem is at the heart of this film you play a kindergarten teacher aspiring poet and one of your students says these words of the blue and that's kind of the moment that's that's the whole story in the play and a beautiful beautiful enough for me\nThe sun hits her yellow house it's almost like a gift from God like a ... like a sign from God and\nJust something about watching a child say a poem or even just actually hearing us say home remind me of\nHow strange it can be and how little we hear poetry in our daily lives\nI think that's true but I think children you know children live in a kind of a poetic world I mean that's part of an interesting about the movie and yes the child\nAnd they said two ways to look at it either that this child has some kind of gift and out of hand common themes fully formed poems or when you just kind of more of the way I look at it\nThat you know it's about a woman who is a poet\nWho's poetry isn't heard and certainly not appreciated who interprets which he's seeing coming out of the child as poems\nBecause she needs them to the palm because she need because she's starving right\nAnd I also think you know in a way think well okay so how do you tell that story and I just keep thinking about the interview I did some with Trevor Noah from the Daily Show yeah it was about the Deuce but he'd seen the trailer for the kindergarten teacher and as hell I'm\nHe was asked me about it and he was like\nSo is it a horror movie yeah is it a thriller yeah is it an intimate movie about a woman mine yeah you know and I think um\nI loved that steady set that because\nThe truth is it's it's none of those things and all of this thing does even kind of funny sometimes it's a new form and I think it's partially partially new because it's feminine it's coming from the feminine place\nWhat do you think the film says about the value we put on art as a society [noise] well I think one of the things that's compelling to me it's like well who decides\nWho decides what's valuable who decides that leads to poetry is less valuable than the poetry of their son a boy and I think that's really interesting right\nHe was really repeating after us and doing something very very technical and simple yeah\nUm and then and then I think in terms of me acting with him\nIt's funny it's like Lisa thinks she's having a relationship with Jimmy but she's having a relationship with herself\nAnd I think should missing him and so\nIt was All right that I didn't have like a deeply intimate relationship with this little boy it was just really more about a conversation with myself\n[noise] feel like a risky film to you I mean you have a child and key rules very complex lead character that you don't really know whether you're rooting for even when the phone was over right\nEntirely sure of August to disown them feel to risk at all when you were making yeah\nYeah I mean of course of course of course but like wild are we doing it you know and when I sat in the audience and finance and I felt\nKind of while the fact that it has I mean you can imagine that gets people gassed and they laugh at strange thing for it and\nI think it's saying something real about the state of the world for women at the moment I'm\nThis is a woman who is not fundamentally mentally\nIll she's not crazy but I think you're looking at someone who is driven crazy by the culture that she finds herself in [noise] and I think for many women at the moment if we're honest\nFor many women at the moment if we're honest\nI don't I don't know that I could imagine doing things at least it does I mean it's an allegory she goes real far\nReally extreme I really don't want to do more now that it's a good idea to document that are very not related will\nKnow well right if it's beyond a normal behavior up north but up until the point the ways in which she's out of control confused has no help no one understand her um and I think is hungry\nFor some kind of real interaction in the world um is something I really relate to and I know because of what's the cultural conversation at the moment that half of you know the\nPeople in the world the women relate to it I mean basically we made the movie last summer\nTrump was elected in New York anyway there was this kind of feeling of like the radicalism next to his Malay\nIt should there were protests people re spray painting things on Trump's buildings yeah there were it was there were there was a ruptured deported from the street and then there was also a certain amount of [noise] or is it that's what happens\nWe'll know there was a certain amount of oh my God look where we actually are yeah this is not where we wish we were ... and\nYeah I think when you I think what started off all of this and the time's up and everything I Believe was Trump's saying\nYou can grab women's if you want to and you have enough power and they let you mhm and then there being no consequences for it and I think for for me I was like well how\nThings are bad\nAnd I looked at in my life and they left the ways in which I had accepted all sorts of things I couldn't believe I accepted\nAnd um and I think that's sort of what it's about I mean I Do think it's about the real\nConsequences of what happens if you start of a vibrant woman's mind and I think so many women right now are waking up to\nThe feeling that we've been starving that we've been accepting so many things bending over backwards twisting ourselves into pretzels to get the things that we need to survive and that it's not okay right and so I think\nThis is a movie about that made by a group of women filmmakers and so I think our our conclusion and the movie is like well what happens when you start vibrant woman's mind in dire [laughter] you know\nLike a joke than some nice thanks\nYou can see Maggie Gyllenhaal into kindergarten teacher this week it started streaming on Netflix tomorrow for for for a friday night
