Korea wait wait it malaria came out of hospitals than looking haggard way the way they are a very strong company accent\nAnd I became an act to not to become rich and famous I became an actor knowing that I Would never be rich in five minutes if it's obvious you couldn't do it you couldn't make it yeah it may I couldn't do it I became it to be the best that I could possibly be or something I wanted to do which would be an actor\nAnd that's all I ever did and I only had to compare myself to my last performance I didn't compare myself to other people because they will will always be better act as a million ... and and and the point I wanted to get across the young people Bush was to go ahead and do what you want to do\nFighting will take its course if you got it you've got to if you haven't you didn't have any way\nWhy why did you want to do it even though you knew that even though you knew that it would be such a struggle\n[noise] well it's because I enjoy doing it I was an amateur act to when I was younger before I went in the um being a youth club I was on average director Andy alternative wish to work in a factory yeah\nI I first became an actor I was working in ... by some factory packing better but fame never occurred to me only ever occur to me was to be as good as I possibly could be of what I chosen to do which I thought was a lesson\nAnd that idea of persistence or Michael is is is what gets me is even when one of my favorite stories and the book is Christopher ...\nSchool is is is what gets me is even when one of my favorite stories and the books Christopher Nolan comes to you ... playing out for the butler in in the dark night he was pretty persistent to right\nOh yeah I've been one Sunday Morning and I was walking past the front door my house in the country which is ... and last I saw this man standing there with a script in his hand\nAnd I said the door to him and he came in and I didn't know who he was until you say these films that have done they done three it'd be great films are saying and he said he was Christopher Nolan and uh uh ... what\nWhat what what what what you want me to do should this go Batman Begins suffer or should Batman film such as ... said oh I ... I was thinking to myself well I'm I'm too old to fly by a man who am I going to be about going to be to butler [noise]\nSo I said what do you want me to play you said the butler [laughter]\nSo I said oh really ... what a Web site at dinner is served would you like another lawsuit bread mind it but what do I say he said no he said Michael it's deeper than that he said the butler was Batman foster father when his father died\nAnd then he said when you read the script ... does he live near me then in in the country in England\nI sent my driver bringing it to you in the morning you should know want you to read it now I'm taking it with me I didn't realize what I Know now Chris is very secretive about everything that he did\nSo I went and he had a cup of tea with my wife in the kitchen and I read it fell in love with it and came out and said yes oh wow uh and and that's how I got Batman has started my whole new life\nAs an old man is an old I I I've enjoyed as much as being a young actor but I'd say it's more the story of how Christopher Nolan got you again like I don't think it's [laughter] well he he regarded me as a lucky ... kept saying no it's it's the other way around as you all my life your job I mean\nI've been so lucky we are never made a ... movie\n[laughter] and ah Michael Cain and blowing the doors off you're right about how comedians love to do Michael Caine

day and he wasn't in and he also didn't in that boy said Peter Sellars is not made and not many people know that [laughter]\nMuch okay before we say goodbye one of the things you talk about in this book is that part of your process as an actor is just observing people study how people act in their ordinary lives so you can bring that reality to your performances and we talked about that we talked about\nActing on on the inside but I I Want to know someone who's been watching people carefully for decades now do you see something new and different in the way people act now or is it basically the same as it was decades ago\nOh no it it just changed everybody's a much more free now in the way they do things um um did it on on the tube I used to be on the ice to go into to become a

mentioned you're Nineteen when when when you had that moment with your writing songs before that celebrated with I don't think a lot of people talk about this because it's kind of the boring side of
