give you a warning those coming [laughter] and uh you know your your our generation ... you know like it I have to make fun but it's interesting to think of when the show started Rick Mercer the biggest the first big get they got it was a celebrity actually did a show with Peter's asking right who gave them a lot of support\nOr and so I felt it was important to keep the ties between CBC Radio and uh our show by mocking yeah of course I've really you know what are the country are you in\nThat order Canada a marketing a new book is called son of a ... a child is new memoir it's hilarious it's also like heartbreaking it's beautiful mark joins me in Studio ... tell you about it high\nI buddy how's it going very good it's interesting to have this book out because in my\nEye when writing it you're just alone you know and you're typing typing away and you're all in your own head and then last night we had this first kind of an event where these lovely folks in the book club came and they sort of asked me questions about the book and my initial reaction was well how'd you do that and I realized oh wait I published I so but yeah so it's interesting to see how people reacting to it in the world\nIs well that's the I was when I tell you were putting out a book you would have been forgiven for putting out a book about your exploits about you know about you know everything you're done and twenty to everything you did before that but you told them really personal stories here well why does the impetus of that when he started\nGoing down through the the the story of of your childhood I guess I guess is pretty reflective and I think there was like a it's a it's a natural thing is to censor yourself and going on I could put that into oh I shouldn't say that I have a certain point I just decided okay I'm not going to do that I'm gonna I'm gonna write watch what I Want to write what I feel like I should write well I'm drawn to write\nAnd some of that was funny in some of that was sad and and uh and it all came together or hopefully in a way that's enjoyable one of my favorite characters in the book is your mom or\nThis is one of my favorite quotes you write she drove a car or the way someone my fire a starter pistol for the first time eyes closed and facing away\nYeah my mom would go in there\nKind of like back in the seventies it's evil can evil being strapped in and it was like a shot across the ... she would often accelerate and close your eyes and get into I remember once we're in driving down Ken my row which is a big major highway and St john's and moms say oh that was in ...\nDriving down came I wrote to the big major highway and St john's\nAnd moms say oh that was in the wrong lane I said no we're not wearing the bank and then we'll come into the back ... mount these car and he's like I Can't be driving back and\nJust coming to and looking back at that I don't think that was weird well I think was that they just at the end those ages is out of kids not doubt well put them in the backseat Tilly wakes up like there was no different kind of knew for land childcare or he'll be all shake it off\nAnd you didn't you talk about going to school with injuries that Monday pond which I really should not be so colloquial about you were in St traces which is a school in the east and the St John yeah out of Catholic school and area we we know Monday pond yeah a beautiful part of town a bit of a hard part of town\nIt was harder than as it was you know kind of a I guess you'd call a tough school like you know like one of those places that don't go up around their dollar the clouds Monday bond they'll get you kind of a thing but that's kinda more generational going back I had a reputation everybody whether there was a lovely but\nI mean kids who went to school there many of them had been in fights and stuff like that and I had never been around children really because we lived\nFar away from the center city next to a radio station where my where my dad worked\nAnd he was sort of the emergency go to guy uh so we had to live next to the station in case a DJ fell asleep during the night or a translator with that\nSo there were no other kids around so when I went to school it was my first kind of interaction or with other kids so I'd be sitting there ... and then they could smell the fear in me you know so that was overwhelming\nYou were bullied and the most new Finland nerd kind of way which they stole your Pepsi oh yeah not Koch now you're happy yeah ships yeah and your cello\nYes the nuns maybe played cello cause I was the huskies child and they're like we think you could live to ... which is you know as all great my shows are chosen by the instrument fake you know the the the people with ... syndrome a hollow bones they they play whistles and blue and then the husky our children are given cello\nAnd uh yeah so these guys there was a family of them like everybody was like as one of those places where like on the school and my brothers are coming there as before cell phones but somehow at three o'clock\nSeven brothers of varying ages who look just like the guy be weightless oh Hercules shoved my broader at race that's grown mad about what we're going to fight that we don't have children and so these guys stole my cello which is like\nI never got to be jak for a cello sick what are you going to do with the ... like there's a big guitars and you don't even know what it is you're stealing and yeah that I had to get my cello back so that was a a that was a [noise]\nIt's it's hard to feel tough after ...\nBut it led to a really beautiful moment and lead to a moment of great empathy so you go to the bullies house yeah go to ... house\nAnd the cello had been hidden his back yard\nAnd um so we're going through the house and and we had to get there and his father was kinda passed out asleep watching wrestling shirtless or without some cans of beer around and you know that great new Finland version of a thinker and we went down to the back yard and and I find my cello\nAnd I'm lugging my cello back to the house and I was like I had to call my parents like you can't you can't you can't do that you wake him up and I'm like ... I'll be quiet and then it's like uh I I call home and I'm like Oh hi and as he wakes up and they said why they are out on our stealing our phone and kind of like\nGive like was noted that stops me money it's a local call out the bones of the world and it got really\nAnd and then he he ah hit my friend and and when they break for it\nAnd then you kind of realize like oh I see while you're like yeah I I see why you're you're ... you're paying for it and after that you know we became you know kind of close friends and uh and he's kind of protected me a bit yeah\nIs a great story of new Finland is going to get things stolen from there were some of my favorites my brother told me about his buddy who got his dog stolen from his backyard one time and he went down to his ...\nMy brother told me about his buddy who got his dog stolen from his backyard one time and he went down to his house knocked on the door and said excuse me I think it's still my dog and the buddies father when no no I didn't steal your dog and he saw the dog in the back in the kitchen table and really\nYeah I I got I was going out with a lady and a malamute was stolen and and and then they almost our dog was stolen and the guy called saying he wants money for it and this is the name I gave you a name and phone number yet and I was like [noise]\nI Know him and then I had to go to his house and I knocked and everybody was a walk and was it the guy who's got dog stolen that that body down there and I was like okay yeah so I go in there and the opens the door like\nHigh there and he's like Ohio and we went to school together and you got a dog and the dog's name was Scott ... no there's no dog here and I said", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Q", "city": "Tampa", "day": "04"}
