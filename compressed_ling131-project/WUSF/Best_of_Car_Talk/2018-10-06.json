Wisconsin\nAnd do you still in the dairy world he is now a dairy economist at Cornell University and and what percentage of economists would you say are able to milk the cow by hand\nUh we'll probably or you know close to a hundred percent are able to Ninety nine point nine percent wouldn't have before school started\nIn the pantheon of milk related economic disasters there is one that rises above the rats and Andy had a ringside seats to it\nThis is one of those slow moving train wrecks that you can see coming from a mile away\nIt was Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter was running for president and he started flooding this idea\nOf all of them have bomb a\nBomb on our way\nOne of the wave Carter proposed giving farmers and equal break which to raise the price of milk by about six cents per gallon which was kind of a lot at the time\nYeah it certainly was on the edge of that it was a big enough number that it sounded like one of these campaign promises that you really didn't expect they would actually fulfill\nSo a campaign promise so that's what we call the\nYou know there you go this was not just political pandering there is an argument that our country has to be able to produce its own food 'cause if our farmers go out of business and we become reliant on other countries for food and that is a kind of national security risk\nAnd it's our country has a tradition of programs to help farmers but what do you need to talk of its new to this one thing to provide stability is another step into the market in a big way maybe the wrong time because playing with price controls is playing with fire\nNevertheless when Carter got elected he goes all\nIn the retail price of milk is going up more than six cents a gallon SUV going up because the government is\nAnd you you hear of it and he likes back your forehead oh boy here we go it was pretty hard to predict\nThat it was just as bad as God but every instinct I had said ooh this is ... has been workouts\nHello and welcome to

idea was that if you give this food to people who suffer from food insecurity then maybe it is going to go to somebody who wasn't going to buy cheese anyway so you're not hurting the market as much\nBut the problem Andy says was that a lot of this was not easy to give away cheese there were forty pound block than five hundred pound barrel\nSo you can imagine you know you don't just kinda\nThen five hundred pound barrel\nSo you can imagine you know you don't just kind of rules on one of these barrel down a seventh avenue in\nNew York city and say anybody wants to choose which one you just have a big knife yeah there you go to help yourself\nSo instead the cheddar cheese was process that helps to keep longer and then it was repackaged in two and five pound like brick\nAnd this is what people will remember as a government she because when government starts to give away hundreds of millions of pounds of cheese people notice\nThe great change give away began today in California San Francisco was one of three cities in which needy people lined up to get the surplus this footage\nIs amazing spouses massive crowds of people being handed bricks that or she is in a town with the most of the government packaging you will ever seem to like brown cardboard and some black USDA stamps\nOn it and he's a state official estimated three hundred thousand people will get a

government we bought we get we get like a hundred and something some some something and she mentioned but\nMaybe government she's the most surreal moment came on a television show where Martha Stewart cooks that with the\n[laughter] government she\nBecame a symbol of a crappy government handout and to be fair was processed cheese kind of like a brick um Velveeta but remember the raw ingredients word grade aged cheddar cheese some of it personally certified by Bob ... rock\nIt was ten times better than belt I hate the bell vetoes okay it's got it's OK okay we're we're not here to them but I'm not running down bell veto but I'll tell you the the government process loaf was ten times a hundred times better than it was some of it almost feels like natural cheddar I mean it was really really good product\nThis is why there is also a community of people who are still obsessed with government cheese Internet chat board trying to find something comparable restaurants claiming they have a recipe for it\nAt one point Donny Walberg of the new kid on the block said quote there's nothing like it the way it melts for a hamburger there is nothing better [noise]\nParents doing the dance ... doing the dance trained but here is white government cheese has become a kind of terrible of how government intervention in markets can have this like butterfly effect in Nineteen Seventy six Jimmy Carter got on stage and said something seemingly innocuous\nBombers way\nAnd then within five years the government was spending billions of dollars filling came with cheese that they could not get rid of fast enough well\nI think there's there's two basic lessons again economist Andy ... of it\nThere's two basic lessons\nAgain economist Andy ... which\nOne is it's really hard to balance what you want to do socially or politically with what you can get away with economically the second lesson is you got to pay attention to the unintended consequences because they can come back and bite you and budget hard\nEven if that bite just looks like some delicious cheese [laughter] swimming\nThat was the unintended consequences it was fun but the bike came in terms of how much it cost for that I rented a very very expensive she's been be\nGovernment cheese caved started to empty out the guaranteed milk price which had been going up automatically every six months was eventually frozen but that does not mean the government had fix the problem\nThe thing about price controls it once you start then they are really really hard to unwind\nSo we have a you know the cement surplus and now you have the political problem how do we how do we get this cat out of the tree\nThe government asked the economists including ... to figure out how it could get out of the cheese buying business without devastating the farmers they were trying to help in the first place\nThis is a basic supply and demand problem the government was demanding an unnatural amount of milk and so farmers were supplying an unnatural amount of milk\nOne part of the solution then was two jet Li get that milk supply down\nTo persuade farmers to produce less we literally paid them money to stop producing milk\nThat did some good and then on the other side the government tried to replace some of their artificial demand for milk with new real demand for milk\nLike hey people of America wouldn't you like to drink more milk [laughter] we took\nA a small amount of money from every dairy farmer collected on every ... years old and we created the national dairy board but this is what gave us a you know the got milk and the milk mustache and all those kind of iconic programs that we remember\nThat is right Jimmy Carter's campaign promise to help farmers in Nineteen Seventy six not only gave US government cheese but also milk mustaches\nWith a few other programs and sometimes things eventually got under control and the government put the milk support program on a kind of permanent suspension for these days if the government wants to help farmers don't generally hear about our direct subsidies as opposed to buying cheese yes the government has tended\nTo stay away from buying cheese of pollution that is until last July\nThe White House is coming to the eight of farmers hurt by its own hardline trade policies that Trump diminished ration says today it will make an estimated twelve billion dollars in government assistance available\nThe Trump Administration announced that in order to help farmers being hurt by Trump's tariffs the government may be making some food purchases again and then in August we learn some of the details there's currently about eighty five million dollars earmarked to buy dairy and distributed to places like schools\nAnd food bank that'd be fair that's probably not enough to start selling caves which again but there is a chance that the government maybe in the business of government you know [noise] to the cheesecake [noise]\nToday's episode is produced by
