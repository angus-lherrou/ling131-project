W USF eighty nine points [noise]\n\nYou're listening to Planet Money the other day I had an early morning interview and I ran downstairs to get a cup of coffee and ran into the gas so I turned on my recorder\nAnd I kind of invited her with my my maybe we should say ah where are you\nHot cats I I don't know I find you wanting to get my name is yeah [noise] that's probably the easy by Catherine Rampell in town and watching\nThe civically captured writes about the economy for the Washington Post and it occurred to us that actually a coffee shop the perfect place to show this thing setting Syrian [noise]\nSo you're looking at an icy what side you're looking for\nAnd I can see\nHow much the same thing with\nCats on the board Wayne I\nThat are misleading\nOkay so maybe that sounds like somebody buying iced tea and then having to pay tax but it only sounds normal because we've gotten used to it\nWith Catherine seats here is one price on the board and then this extra hidden thing that she has to pay for it and it's not just taxes sometimes it's fees and service charges\nThat seemed to appear out of thin air at check out and drive us all crazy looking rental cars buying concert tickets for like have you looked at a hotel room recently sometimes\nThere's an Internet feed symptoms of the parking fee sometimes there is something called a resort fee even though you're staying in a place that is not resort hit by the highway anyways Catherine brought her iced tea into the studio to explain why these fees and service charges or not just annoying they are bad for the economy\nShould be competing based on price and quality and not application I and the fact that company ... did not create a better economy does not creator got better experience for consumers and Ken\nThat our economy does not create or got better experience for consumers and can in fact raise prices for consumers that are buying stuff that they don't want for every one is a used car so [laughter] I have a very good friend of the you know I I don't want to denigrate that profession specifically\nSo what is your one tiny tweak that would change the world\nMy my one tiny tweak is that we should require more all inclusive upfront pricing including taxes fees particularly in common types of consumer purchases where people like to comparison shop the\nPrice should be the price\n[noise] that is how Catherine Rampell would make the world better with one simple tweak [noise] hello and welcome to Planet Money I'm Nick fountain Dan I'm\nKenny Malone and sometimes on Planet Money we tackled the world's big questions but today on the show\nWe look for small dancers something we've done here before recalled the smartest people we know and we asked them what teeny thing would you change about the world to make our lives better we have a suggestion for how you can get more money from your boss how to make the most boring sport\nLittlest boring Dan how to take down the wedding industrial complex\nSteve can you give us the simplest explanation of the catcher parole\nAnd baseball and works as follows her that if you're the\nIn baseball and works his father who's a that if you're the team my head in an inning and you're a bad then you get only two hunks rather than three out which isn't that inning\nIn other words when your head you get fewer chances to score your opponent who is losing get more chances\nSteve and a colleague tested this out using historic baseball data\nWe looked at a hundred thousand games nominee a hundred thousand we went back\nTo Nineteen sixty seven fifty years okay and we analyzed a each pitch for over a hundred thousand games and asked if to catch a robot been in place how things have changed\nAs an inpatient baseball fan\nHow much shorter with these games so bad and the average game which now has three hours in five minutes would be cut by twenty four minutes so you're cutting almost a half an hour from a game\nAnd a half an hour was the game yes and not only were the games shorter said we're way more competitive which Steve thinks would probably help baseball with declining attendance\nSo how have\nFans reacted to this teeny tiny tweak to America's\nPastime\nWell critically I Would say [laughter] let's just say a there had been a lot of angry baseball fans but Steve is not here to win a popularity contest in fact\nHe told us he's also got a version of the catch up rule for America's actual favorite sport football\nIn the NFL we would give the winning team only three downs rather than for down to make a first down\nSteve you were like you're blowing up every single sport\nOh yeah we have an idea for basketball that we would instead of giving the team ahead twenty four seconds to shoot we'd give them only Eighteen seconds at the end of a game\nLike ah how you are a true iconoclast well [laughter] we'll see what happens we don't want to hold you or any longer thank you so much for coming in yeah thank you professor thanks very much\nAnd don't go to any baseball games anytime soon you might get\nBack to ya long odds thrown at you [noise]\nIs\nThere a tweak that you would

... to ... hippie\nFarmers with no real desire to build a company wind up building a company they start small milking their own cows making their own yogurt and yelling locally to none and then eventually spreading themselves way too thin\nAnd sliding into deep dad you know over the years don't heal that had a little Lulu of near death experiences\nWhat never white guy did in fact it grew it grew into one of the most popular yogurt brand in the United states and one thing about starting killed cofounder of Gary ... is that even though he didn't really\nAnd one thing about starting killed and co founder of Gary ... is that even though he didn't really set out to build a company he knew what it took to run one because when he was growing up in Manchester New Hampshire is dad owned and ran a pretty big shoe company\nYou know it it was a in those days there were probably fifty shoe manufacturers in New Hampshire alone and probably a hundred and fifty in New Hampshire Maine and Vermont and so how many people did your dad's company and play\nIn several thousand I think at their peak they were at a twenty eight hundred wow he's your truth company towns of course in those days manufacturing was a you know the state was built in the region in the country were were built on things that we made\nThe dark side of that is that when they simply because of a cheaper labor from abroad when the domestic shoe industry collapsed [noise] you know all these communities did as well\nAnd what happened to your family [noise] uh well it was really a free a free for uh the family's business uh went bankrupt or my parents got divorced\nAnd my ah\nSort of childhood role model a died suddenly of spinal meningitis so it was a it was a wake up\nHere ... yeah I um my father a got a

at the age of fourteen which of course it's going to have an impact an influence on you did you did you start to think about a business about being a businessman ... at that early I mean do you say your parents were both entrepreneurial\nNo I I started thinking about running as far as I possibly could away from it [noise]\nYou know I obviously the bankruptcy didn't happen overnight it was a result of a steady decline and my my grandfather my father and my uncle we're all in the business and I used to sit\nOr work in there and I would listen to them screaming at each other you know they were arguing you know uh I'm passionately\nOr about what to do about this downturn and so to me business with this thing\nWhere people got people yelled at each other people hung up funds on each other people who are stressed or employees lost their jobs\nOwner of the militias market basket chained ... calls and says ... why are you telling them my competitive than not to me that he had thirty four stores at the time and time and say well ah to be honest Mr demos we don't have enough cows he said well get some\nCows and he slammed the phone down and we took that is very good business advice so we\nWent out and grew are heard even further and then so we now realize we needed to get serious about this until we managed to lease a small refrigerator trucks and started delivering actually to the market basket where where ...\nHow much yogurt were you making at that point we're producing now about three hundred and sixty cases a week of yogurt at a case it like twenty four cups six ... six\nPacks of court and so by the end of eighty four we were are run rate was headed in the sort of half a million dollar range which you\nWere probably spending more money than you are bringing in

running on fumes and they're trying to bring in more money by just finding a few more stores to sell their yogurt\nIn those days a whole foods didn't exist yet but the holy grail for natural products was a little three store chain called bread and circus which eventually became part a hopeless and they had one store in Cambridge on prospect history and you know we were selling now to Jim Lewis market basket just as now I'm Talking July of eighty\nFour and um and we were desperately trying to get down there because we knew that if we could crack bread and circus every other little natural foods co up in New England would then take us in\nAnd we kept going down there and and they said no no no we've already got you know a hippie yogurt made by somebody in Vermont to her in the TPP with their ... do you know they didn't need another you know organic yogurt from some crazy people in the hamster [laughter] ... what you guys do so in July of eighty four I had my thirtieth birthday\nAt the farm and my I had my old ultimate Frisbee team um come up to visit me most of whom lived in Cambridge as you might imagine\nAnd um I said look it's wonderful you've outcome if you want to give me a really good birthday present good under bread and circus on prospects in Cambridge and asked for my yogurt that was on a Sunday on Wednesday Mary Carol skin or the buyer bread and circus called into Garry I don't know what's going on but demand is suddenly gone through the roof\nWere getting all kinds of requests for yogurt get it when when you can you get it in there well I got in my car and I made the first deliberate that afternoon [noise] um about a month\nLater we were her number one selling yogurt\nAnd ah she took us in the other two bread and circus and off we went but it was my Frisbee team I mean you know that's what it takes I you know I always say we can ship the yogurt three thousand miles is last Eighteen Inches that makes all the difference to get people's mouths and then they're going to ask for it and and this is\nA ring around the time you meet Maggie would become your wife right\nYeah so a month after that fateful meeting with bread and circus we had our summer no phone conference northeast organic farming association conference in I I as it turned out I was the keynote speaker and uh right after I finished my speech this very adorable or organic farmer from\nJersey who is running her own nonprofit farm down there I waited patiently to ask me a question will that turned out to be what is now my thirty one year white Meg and her mom had been the deputy commissioner of agriculture for New York state so she had a kind of an ag orientation um\nAt one point she kind of whisper to me that she'd be okay with a if I needed some money with\nTo me that she'd be okay with a if I needed some money with lending me some well of course I needed money so she loaned us a fifty thousand dollars [laughter] I started raising and I got to about two Seventy five three hundred ...\nA sort of a month or so later she said well I think we can increase it so she increase to a hundred and eventually I got across the finish line got the five hundred ... you know venture capitalists are the reason they want\nWhat they called F enough money first friends and family money mhm as 'cause they know that you might as an entrepreneur if things get rough you you might just get up and walk away if it's you know some Harvard MBA with with with a tie but if it's your mother's money huh yeah\nYeah and so now we worked for our moms which must have been pretty stressful\nOh yeah you know what happened in this farmhouse I always had payroll on Thursday mornings\nAt at this point of the half a million dollar business and I never had cash in the bank that night before payroll never just distance became our way of life and so uh thinking ... was a sleep in our bedroom\nWhich was about fifty feet from my office I Would on many occasions tip toe over to the office to call my mother in law\nTo have a chance to see if I could borrow another thirty\nFive hundred and twenty five hundred to make ends meet and eventually make got onto this and one night I heard the click click a call waiting on my mother in law is on and make was calling from the house to say mom don't\nDo this what your wife was telling her mom not to lend you money for the business right because right well 'cause she didn't have confidence and then it will look she's living in a nightmare me she saw how crazy it was I mean we had chimney fires we had the well pump would go out that\nThe power would I mean we are on the hilltop farm a long way from anywhere was make St diligent protests ditch the same with the bag it I mean or or did you get this sounds like she makes you believe in it and well she had no reason to believe in it it was insane but why did you believe in it did you think you know I mean if you are you are what two three years into this thing\nAnd it not only are you not making money you are in that big a big time\nYeah [noise] well I'll say this I'm Meg or you know fortunately loved me even more fortunately probably love the yogurt and we're nowhere else to go [noise]\n\nYou know she had given up for a job down on her farm in New Jersey has signed on to this crazy them enterprise but here's where the story if I Know that you think it couldn't get worse but\nThen as a Lily Tomlin says it it it it ... it it got a lot worse before it got worse okay what happened what happened well\nSo now I'm going to jump a year and a half we've\nNow expanded the plant were buying milk from ten or twelve farms and we have maxed out this little farm there is no you cannot squeezed another drop of yogurt out of this place\nSo presumably you are looking to to work with another factory right so the spring of eighty six we are out of capacity we contracted with a little dairy in western Massachusetts Greenfield mass we were desperate we did not do any of this financial due diligence\nOne would normally do what happened for us with their bank went in and put 'em in the chapter seven padlocked to play locked it up wait a minute your production comes to
