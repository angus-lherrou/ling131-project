theoretically I ever needed someone to pretend to be the knowing caretaker of haunted house or the Victorian child goes\nI Would definitely use voice actor Gen John [noise]\nWhat'd you do did you like run home and and and and sort of like in writing things down or drawing pictures or or did you just kinda mulling over for all for a while so\nI ran down the mountain I got at a new book and I started writing down ideas and then when we got back to Denver but how can I take for not spices and turn them into something really exciting and I would get ideas from pies and cookies cakes and I'm thinking okay how\nDo I take and cherry pie and make it just in my quiz and art and basically a raw raw and processed food\nAnd make it taste like cherry pie or apple pie or banana bread or what have you\nKnow I'm just imagining there's going to do a lot of cooking I'm and you're in your\nKitchen with your Cuisinart I'm thinking you put a bunch of updates and like knocked in there and you're just gonna get this ball rolling around the queen of the sticky like being like Dicky ball of a match and then you would like take it out with your hands in like a roll it out with a rolling\nTen and then um I got to cut her and I would like to look at her and I would cut it out just in your kitchen and and I would make samples I mean batch after batch after batch\nAnd did you have any of your own I'm sure many cash digital sort of ask your partner to help you out in a year while you were not you know we're getting a salary how did you pay your bills um within\nAbout a week I realized oh I had I had a little bit of money saved up and then I thought I'm going to start this business but I have to work I have to get a job you know\nSo whole foods opened their first store in Denver at exactly the same time and I started seeing the building go up in the in the neighborhood I grew up in actually and I thought\nHuh I'm going to get a job with them I'm going to work and their nutrition department doing what I Love but I'm going to figure out the business and how it works\nI I got a job in the nutrition department doing what I Love which was working around all the nutrition products and it was one of the best decisions I ever made so at what point did you think to yourself this is really gonna be the big deal like this people are gonna want want by these\nI'm not sure I ever thought that it was such a gradual progression so I first you know got my recipes together\nSuch a gradual progression so I first you know got my recipes together and I would give them out to friends and then friends would say I would buy them and that that little tidbit of asking me to buy it would make me feel so excited and motivated to get to the next place which was\nHow in the world to manufacture these things yeah where am I going to get dates and almonds and cherries and at the time I started questioning am I actually going to do this or shakes could've worked for a whole foods they don't just do that\nAnd just just to clarify again how are you just like sort of funding this and it's like finding reading stuff this was when you're using your own money\nAnd you know I had a job at whole foods and then I had a credit card and were you nervous or anxious at all I don't know I I Would have moments where I Would be really gung ho and I would get all kinds of great information in a month would go by and I would find out about a piece of manufacturing equipment or just little\nThings and I would be ill motivated at somebody want to buy bars and I make them a batch of bars and these little lock bags in a little Chinese takeout box and and I would they would pay me like twenty two dollars or something for a box to bars and I would think wow and then another month\nTo go by where I couldn't get anywhere I felt like my feet were stuck in the mud and then I Would just get really motivated and nothing happened and this went on for the three year period between my idea fade and when actually launched\nI Am trying to figure out how you maintain your your optimism and confident about all this 'cause I mean you're thirty two you're divorced and I imagine you probably have some emotional ups and downs of his plan and I don't well I was part of\nYou I mean did you ever get the feeling that people look you and kind of think I had a Laura she's got this kind of weird side project a lot of people thought that I mean\nI Would see people I went to high school with and they would come into whole foods and you know they ... they're they're already climbing the ladder big jobs in finance and all kinds of things and they say oh I didn't know you worked here and and people would see me and even if I had those moments with people were ... I Would\nNotice the fact that I wasn't on that trajectory I finally just said this is your path in life and you have to go for it and embrace it and make it happen [noise] when\nWe come back ... embrace the uncertainty and slowly slowly figured out how to turn her kitchen project into a business [noise] stay with us I'm Guy Raz and you're listening to how I built this from NPR and\n[noise] [noise]\nThis week wait wait don't tell me celebrates Twenty years of pointing out how incredibly stupid the news is on Peter Segal and all I can say is we'll stop when they do join us for an all star celebration was all our panelists as right all of them as special again the\nQuiz that's just one year away from being able to buy a drink we desperately need after Twenty years of doing wait wait for men feel you can join his weight weight Dana Shelly is coming out this morning at eleven from W\nUSF eighty nine point seven news jazz NPR I'm Cathy Carter ...
