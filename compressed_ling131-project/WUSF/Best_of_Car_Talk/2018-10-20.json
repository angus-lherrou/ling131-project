stakes dropping off Cato you're buying that thing yeah yeah the story of how Tommy\nSafety dropping out of the Cato you're buying that thing yeah yeah\nThe story of how Tommy started fighting fake they've used against around two thousand sex Tommy was in college at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo at the time he was Nineteen\nAnd it was a bit of a gym rat at its peak he could bench press around two hundred and\nForty pounds Monday Tommy was hanging out with a friend when he says hey\nYou want the rest of this pre workout pre workout it's like a powdered stimulant you're supposed to take before you hit the gym and it just gives you crazy energy and you can lift Moran longer and harder um you know at least those are the claims just to be clear this is not a steroid in case of which are thinking Tommy is very against using those\nAnyway ... friend is really not happy with the stuff that he purchased and he's had to tell me I paid sixty bucks for it and it gives me such bad stomach issues that I it's ruining my work out to you know counterproductive\nIf you're not familiar with the supplement world it's not a the most tightly regulated world and on top of that back in two thousand and six more and more folks were starting to buy things on line like supplement\nThe gears in my head started turning and I started looking up several interviews and I I couldn't find anything that was legit I mean it was all just written by the manufacturer\nThey could just chime in on a paternity he could built an online reviews side but bodybuilder skipped honest feedback about the supplements they're putting into that bodies\nOkay so for this product we feed that over the course of five days this product got Seventy eight percent of their reviews\nOver the course of five days this product got Seventy eight percent of their reviews and on top of that the reviews from those high volume days gave the product a four point nine star rating on average\nThese views of adults five days pretty suspicious and especially when you look at the reviews from those five states compared to the average we use their way more positive\nTime he says the reviews for these cables raised a few other red flags as well there was a one issue with words that were being used over and over again in the reviews of it so the phrase repetition basically what we do is we we built a gigantic list of all of the\nPhrases that are used in the reviews that or you know three words or more um and then we\nGo out for them is able to filter out normal phrases that would show up all the time for example it was the and this way the algorithm can look at weird phrases that you would not expect to be repeated for example\nThe court is very tough and doesn't bend like the court to do but that's probably a good thing that's not you know that you shouldn't do that in more than one review but first year we see it in three reviews [noise]\nUh yeah and and in seven reviews someone wrote it's easy to get it back onto the cord and use again ah I mean I don't know what it means with seven people feel that way [laughter]\nWell seven people also say they performed their duty with honor and respect there is the correct for [laughter] yeah so\nTommy software ran about a dozen different cats than I Am phone cable review and his reports it out and it just aggravating\nUh so it went from a four star out of five with a hundred and Seventy seven reviews on Amazon and the adjusted rating on review Mehta is one point seven stars after Ken reviews\nWhich is another way of saying Tommy side only trust at six percent of the reviews and that trust the way they view say actually these cables that crap\nThomas's generally speaking cable like this are exactly the kind of product that winds up cluttered with suspicious reviews\nAnything with like low manufacturing costs and high margins I'm like what you have the iPhone cables backup batteries screen protectors phone cases weight loss pills pissed off we of\nCourse reach out to Amazon and about that\nAnd they declined to go on tape but they are familiar with Tommy website they sent us an extensive statement about it have you met itself admit that they do not have the safety if you could do this when I was like a you know non weightlifter\nOh okay I'm review itself admits that they do not have the data to know or even stay with high confidence whether a review at stake according\nTo what Amazon is saying it's not necessarily different from what Tommy told us about his own website he totally admit that his site is looking for patterns of unusual behavior and there's a possibility that real reviews get flagged as a natural fire Amazon that as a\nProblem we have hundreds of millions of reviewed on Amazon and of that total less than one percent are an authentic Amazon also told us that it's investing in its own system to catch fake\nViewers in other words the Amazon saying there's not a problem but we're working on it and this makes me like I Wonder a little bit how much should I trust that big sites like Amazon are actually going to go out of their way to fix this\nSets complicate it right because these e commerce sites they make money when they found my product\nRight like it doesn't matter if it's a positive fake review it someone buys a product that's good for the site\nThat that that might come a time where they were just too many fake ... sure like there's a tipping point where [noise]\nThey're just too many fake baby sure like there's a tipping point where [noise]\nEnough trust is lost that we all just

how many times along the way he sees new opportunities or asked to improvise and the data again and again and again\nRon comes to a point where he has to make a big pivot and transformed his business and in Nineteen eighty\nFive three years after Iran acquires a small French bakery in Boston called a ... a business that's really struggling he manages to turn things around with his partner Luke came\nBut you're still a small business in fact Ron himself works at the sales counter during the day [noise]\nLike doing that actually helps him figure out almost by accident his next opportunity\nIn Nineteen eighty four Nineteen eighty five\nI Would be in a restaurant and working and I'd have a customer walk up to ... so they could I have a bad guy I said sure and they say slice it I'd have them the vote and they pull out effect from the local supermarket from local stop and shop\nAnd they put roasted turkey and maybe she's on it and you know you didn't have to be a Harvard MBA\nTo say wow the real thing here\nIs that the that gap is not the end it's the platform to sell sandwiches and so in Nineteen eighty five we\nCreated the first French bakery cafe in the Copley Place mall in Boston so you decided that you were going to make this a new experience for new open pen experience where people could come and eat lunch and buy bread\nYeah we were going to go from being simply a bakery to bake recap Frederick and almost instantly is broken down company became very hot people wanted this I can remember the second day um that we opened in Copley Place we had fifty people in line while before we opened the doors\nAnd what were you serving their own we were serving sandwiches and some soups made on our Britain costs on what they were differentiated kinds of sandwiches they were roast beef in in ... on on a real French back at it would be a\nRoasted turkey brie cheese um and I think with Obama Penn was providing and I don't think we hit the language for back then but with the Baker cafe was was an alternative\nBetween down and dirty fast food yeah and find diet yeah and for people who were working white collar jobs increasingly in urban settings this was the first example of what we later came to cough\nVast casual this was going to do something that was better but in a quick sir\nThis was going to do something that was better but in a quick service mode so once you serve stones idea of creating\nCafes and bakeries it was after the races you just I mean at that point it was clear that you were going to begin a pretty rapid expansion\nWell guy we you know as soon as we came up with this idea of a decree cafe we saw all kinds of interested in how we became hot you know every major office building one of the French the crickets and we found we developed big competitors\n[noise] alright says something something happens early in this period as shortly after you go public which is a long ten acquires this a small chain of St Louis based\nSandwich shops called the St Louis bread company what what's the story there why did you buy this like small chain in St Louis was it was the idea to to turn it into a ... you\nKnow I you know I talk to everybody in our industry and there's nobody I don't learn from that I was asked by an investment bank to meet several gentleman who owned a company called sales brand company and it hit me these were Nineteen stores in St Louis\nDoing ... homeless as much as we did within the bullpen but doing so in suburban St Louis\nAnd it struck me this was an opportunity to acquire St Louis for a company and maybe we could build it into three hundred four hundred five hundred stores in suburban marketplace while oh bump him was our urban stress\nSo in November of Nineteen Ninety three we bought the St Louis brick company was Nineteen stores for twenty three million dollars\nOr so you choir St Louis bread company and you will not going to give it the name of them had it was going to be St Louis red company or did you initially did you immediately realize you're going to rename this thing [noise]\nBut we rename than cut to an air bread in all markets other than St Louis but we renamed it ... bread because as we went to new markets\nPeople often thought St Louis was more associated with guides Dale horses are now than it was with breath right and so we wanted an empty vessel personality we could form\nSo out of curiosity in that by Ninety eight you're you're watching St Louis ... really start to grow do you remember how many stores you had at that point where we could you expand beyond the original Nineteen\nYeah by Nineteen Ninety eight we roughly had a hundred and fifty stores and I was having one of those moments that all CEOs have of self reflection and frankly I was kinda bummed I was looking at\nAn Arab read as one of four divisions in this multi divisional restaurant kind of on pan idle bumping along than international I had been there and I had a bump in manufacturing\nThat I was with a friend and I said you know for every hundred people talk about having a nationally Dominic ...\nTo do so is so difficult\nBut he said this one has that potential ... and my friend looked at me and said Ron what would you do get a narrow owned Obama pen not ... I said you know I take away all the resources we have put it against an Arab becoming a nationally dominant brand\nAnd I take myself and the very best people we had and I go down there and make it happen", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Best of Car Talk", "city": "Tampa", "day": "20"}
