W. J. F. dot org\n\nYou're listening to the inquiry on the BBC will upset with me had an American\nEach week one question for it but witnesses\nAnd denounce [noise]\nJust sunny morning in Texas ... Wang is working to what wondering she's going to find [noise] she opens the door to her nine [noise] insight tens of thousands of one regarding around in different books and [noise] she kids\nInto one [noise] then another [noise] slowly dorms on him [noise] what she's seen can help kills them with the benefit anything condition known to us [noise] aging [noise]\n\nDoes he does relate to to aging ... hundred thousand people every day\nBut a growing number of scientists say it doesn't have to be this way or the ... research that carried on multiple experiments challenging what we thought we knew about how much time filling the buildings are being spent pulled over the world to an end to extend on line\nAnd this week we bring you some of the world's leading was sent it to tell me what they found [noise] you'll find out what ... Wang discovered with one and one scientist was dusty aging process enough sounds as we answer a question that own if you had the U.S [noise] how long can we live [noise]\nParked one\nIt's all in this case\n\nWe're having a tremendous development in life expectancy we have doubled our lifetime in a very short period and we should really be happy to we were born right on the spot in history [noise]\nI'll send text that witness cool Christian [noise] what do the ... and then ... then one day decided he'd had enough of tracing ill people he now runs the Danish aging with that sentiment while he's trying to people getting in the first place\n[noise]\nWe only with aging ... from the outside what is actually due to a ...\nWell ... accumulation of damage from the molecular level that didn't spread to the shells and to issue an organ sent to the whole organism makes kind of\nAll the hits that we get all the time on the molecules and then when we can't keep up with the repairing than a staging\nStarch and when did it all began when do we start to decline that is in the mid thirties they died in the last time such seven seven it began to me yeah now do you stop Oh thanks for the good news [laughter]\nSorry and there's more bad news once we start to go downhill we go downhill fast\nIt's twice as dangerous being forty two compared to thirty five then again it's twice as dangerous\nTo to compare to thirty five then again it's twice as dangerous as being forty nine compared to forty two and so on so your risk of death is increasing eleven twelve\nPercent every year and a damn their mortality risk levels off around one hundred one hundred and five where the yearly risk of dying is about fifty sixty percent\nSo if you're really optimistic type then you could say that it never get any worse than fifty fifty\nAnd when you're thinking about the talent that the lump stacked against team when you age ... molecule tissues and organs get tired and damaged set to go to a whole range of diseases\nCardiovascular disease cancer ... Alzheimer's disease Parkinson's disease or lung disease all the major ones as well as the more kind of non specific you know people get more frail less resilient\nThe studies show actually they are like additional Oregon on to us because they can't even friends how wow way they have\nAnd all that show how we respond to different medications and sometimes they make us sick but on the other hand they also play back in part to keep a house the\nMain one wanted to know whether a micro biome has an effect on how we age she decided to do an experiment and what she needed with an animal with a short life span she chose a particular kind of one\nOnly live about two to three wakes felt that make them water for law does\nThey only live about two to three wakes felt that make them water from all that is a tough subject yeah\n[noise] she wanted to find out what would happen if you go to the worms micro biome would it live longer [noise]\nShe chose one of the kinds of bacteria that lives inside one gun tweaked it seems to make different varieties and the fed them to separate groups of one [noise]\n\nA few weeks later she went to see the ones expecting them all to be dead now they've reached the end of the lifespan [noise]\nI was so excited because when we find in field cases\nAnymore not that they're still alive when we checked them I Would jump up down because he just totally unexpected and how long did some of the ... list so about fifty percent longer fifty percent yeah that's extraordinary\nSo you had the most of the ones who are living for three weeks and there were some that live to fool four and a half for an ... yes I miss that much more than you would have expected\nYes I think scientists sometimes we do research it's kinda like bowling [laughter] so we have some crazy idea that you know wait wait that's ... way to test them but you never know why they are idea is ride around and those moments where you\nFind them reach out that the best moment\nAnd so they went on to test other things would have different ... give one little Tony a longer life but a better quality of life in their final days\nSo they're way way you're right we can look at how well they have when they're older because worm when they're catching older their physical activity it's declined so they move slower and also become a little bit of a card in it [noise]\nShe's got a video of some of these elderly one [noise] and she's right you can tell their own wild younger one's regular ... around and the older ones move his loaning the skin sucking as they go [noise]\nI don't think they showed rank habits that they can tell their body extract ... it's not as good as they used to be\nThe ones with the new like right by a little tiny wrinkles around will quickly and their old age that they were less susceptible to disease to [noise]\nMake wine it's now carrying out today from mice to the weather changing them like ... and then stand lunch and so the jumps that one day don't just might be able to prescribe pills which do the same for us [noise]\nSome of my colleagues say oh hey you know I think people can they've ... they had to ideas out personally I think why inject for me is already a good number [noise]\nSo how long can we live so [noise]\nWe heard about us officials and pick it up to a hundred and Seventy five\nAnd how it different micro biome to give us fifty percent more time on us [noise]\nBases inventions around to dressing the symptoms of aging not the code [noise] well then if we can go straight to the tools [noise]\nTime for a final expert witness [noise]\n\nPart for fighting you're so but I Do [noise]\n\nYou wouldn't believe the number of people have had got in touch with me that slow in a hurry professor of molecular genetics at the University of Exeter in the u._k. scientists and work on aging because a lot of people excited before now it's been a bit of a holy grail actually in our field now\nScientists before now it's been a bit of a holy grail actually and I failed now people are beginning to realize that this is a possibility and not wanting to get them that I think it's going to be huge [noise]\nI Want to call begins with the building blocks of our bodies ourselves\nSo basically the organs might have different type of tissue your tissues tomato different types of cells now cells get hold of some ... and say you live or your kidneys whatever will be dividing to replace themselves with a kind of dying we're getting more when I Know the more time to cell divides the greater chance of becoming what we would call ...\nCitizens comes from the ... which means to grow alone and that's exactly what happened to these cells they've grown old income to the end of that life cycle but instead of dying they hung around I'm putting in a destructive ...\nThey can actually communicate with the cells ran them so it's an excellent Sal will basically throw out to a bunch of chemicals which affects all of the cells random sides it's almost like a self sang I I'm an old south and you guys have been around here about the same sort of a ton of I have so you must be able to say you should be thinking about ... as well\nWow so it's almost sort of contamination with with age\nExactly so it's basically sending a message which can drive the cells around as ...\nAs we grow older more and more of a self becomes innocence until a buddy is overwhelmed\n[laughter]\nDo they make the cells around them age found that these innocent sound stop functioning as they should [noise] which is still to be one of the things that leads to the beach it's like to mention how to type two diabetes\n\nHigh rates wants to know whether she can get the stump don't behaving like a little cells to hate when like young one\nWhat happened that was I had a new is that true in my lap and she was still finding ... seats and we have some old south and I have some chemicals\nAnd she suggested ... percent ship it some of these chemicals only those skin cells and see what happened about a week after she came in with the dishes cells and showed it to me and when you look through the microscope what were you expecting to say\nThat they would still look like old south side they look kind of lacy under a microscope\nAnd we have a particular died that we can put on a cell coaches at times blue if that's the lesson\nSo when I was expecting to see if that's the south would be so blue and still looking old and she ... they went they went blue and they had gone back to looking more like themselves to profess to Harry and said oh no you've got the wrong cells these are young sales go through it again and that\nAnd she did and she did it I think again yeah and and and then we'll have the same thing again people about me and I still I wasn't convinced because we were not truly quite suspicious scientist yeah they went with tool to to basically throw rocks that you're right there and if it's federal diabetics probably ...\nHow many rogue city search oh probably about nine she did it about nine times and finally I kind of look to to ask them to actually maybe you're onto something here\nShe done something that no one thought possible\nShe'd effectively rejuvenate you don't sell them tenement young south\nAnd they said why loan harried just now getting phone calls from scientists and investors from all over the well at the first experiment this reverse aging and human cells they think a discovery could be the secret to a much longer life\nWhen it comes to a lifespan sink low in a hurry it's would be the most ambitious of all our expert witnesses instead\nAs human beings I think we have enough trouble maximum lifespan especially what I Want this research to end up in the new generation of empty degenerative drugs with all the way off yet but in the future for things like dementia and cardiovascular\nDisease what I'm hoping is that this will allow us one treatment which will address several of those at once so that people who would have died at age will then go on to live than not loaded lifetime\nSo how long can we live\nTo live than not to look at life and how long can we [laughter]\n\nWe know the answer is at least a hundred and twenty two someone's already got that song and from what we cut that thinking it's like he too right\n\nWith the discovery of an expert witness at the load one day we may be able to replace the damaged Logan\nTakes supplement to give us a useful micro biome and still plus sounds aging how many years because of the title\nWhen if we go by two Hispanics prediction if you're a millennia like me born in Nineteen eighty one you should be able to get to a hundred and Seventy five by the time we get ten and Twenty one sixteen who knows what else will be put to them [noise]\n[laughter]\nI think Larry was presented by me having a merryman ... best to take a sentence and if you want to listen to more episodes do download our podcast there are hundreds of other
