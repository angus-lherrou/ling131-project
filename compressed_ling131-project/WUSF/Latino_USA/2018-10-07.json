I I Know there was consistent work the entire time what that didn't leave much room to school\nWhen the family needed more money she take more time off school so she could a moon and when the family moved to follow the crops she'd move with them one year she changed school full\nTime she did badly hurt them but Churchill she thought this was normal it wasn't until the filmmaking made a documentary about her\nThat she realized she was different from other kids\nAnd to see a room filled with about Fifteen hundred people and they're all looking at your story\nIs mind boggling\nYour story is mind bottling it was crazy that I Would bring nowhere and it's just something that I didn't even know was a problem\nAnd then that's when I realized that it was a problem and that the way I was living was not the way everyone loved\nThat was the first time she has the tongue challenge labor and she realized it describes a that was seven years ago now she has made it to university which she's an activist on child labor campaigning and supported the ban\nI definitely feel like children shouldn't be able to work and for the ages at least sixteen I think this is dangerous for the safety of these children in their education and I know there's a lot of people like me out there\nAre some people say well surely it's who writes if you'll if someone goes to school and just started a couple of hours in the evenings or perhaps a couple of hours because we can to help get them income would\nNot be All right [noise] uh [noise]\nIt's different every debatable I Know these families want their children and worked to bring some income in but they're just hindering their education and I think that these families also need to find a different way to get around their situation\nDo you think you would have been able to go to school if you and your siblings hadn't watched\nOh absolutely my two younger sisters still live at home they've never felt like they had to go out in the field to work enough because you know my family moved on to a different type of job that provided more for us\nSo it sounds like you're saying it's almost as though you need to protect these children from by choice that they might make for the best reasons\nRight I feel like these children shouldn't feel obligated does that make sense\nIt does make sense\nWhen the lender would literally she felt she had to work she felt responsible even at the age of seven\nAnd so she says most should be done to lift that responsibility of the ... the children like a\nAn onto the parents to find another way to ban talent to do that ...\nTo some of the poorest families in the world that is no other way [noise]\nLook thin\n[noise] hot for well look we can and cannot do\n[noise]\nMeeting yeah\nWe have been able to actually create religious which have been trying to leave a free by a drifting all of the shooting video content to ... to ... to ... to create communities really spoke to do the blood of children seem to be nuts\nCan be to rotten them should be working on child labor issues in India for the ... the year [noise] and she's now director of advocacy and fund raising its consent for wasn't children\nA chance to see the combined glow a charity that said the ban on child labor isn't working\nThere is a lot of fishing in countries like mine to insist that easily child labor any more and more sick to totally in exports victors\nThe idea is to say that these products to clean the not touched by hands of child labor\nBecause if that scene is connected with child labor they wouldn't get any money for them they won't be able to sell them\nExactly we don't do enough knowledge that presidents\nShould win the authorities come across child labor it's she sets that instead of helping them they want them to dissipate in\nAnd you're just using the phones looking the state's response it's come in white ... put them in and take them over ... ... homes were deadlocked up but you know the way from their families and the state called the family and then then the child shouldn't have\nAway from their families and the state called the family and then the child should never ever be seen like bits again\nAnd when they're released most of the children go back to work because the problems that drove him to work in the first place I haven't been solved\nAnd this is what could be threatened organization comes in they meet child labor has an advantage it enough than not that parents why they walk\nSome talks about the whole meal they got to the factory some said they didn't get the support they need it at school others said they had to come to the younger siblings so fetch water all of them had different reasons but they had one thing in common\nThey would not willing to try for the burden on to the family for instance if they were fishing water they would not or give it the thing that your mother fish water and you'd be in school because they will take my my dad the locked door ready\nThey have to find solutions that wouldn't put more pressure on their parents and so I could be threatened is charity tend to what's known as the chance India's local councils\nAnd a lot to do the work of my organization had been to walk with these local governments with children sitting with them and the solution in one case can be as qualified for the child who has no money\nIt could be more funding for ... cat so children don't have to live comfortably younger siblings\nIn other kids of each year for another child and they're not the kids it can be getting electricity for ... which don't have it and that is how\nHe was able to create tried labels free community is that a country like India\nAnd by labor free she doesn't need to communities when no children look what she means is that the works that doing known to interface to\nLike\nTo avoid and she said some what can be a good thing gets children useful skills and money for textbooks for school uniform about making sure they can choose the right kind of work and to do that they create children's councils\nI give you an example is the religious we work with that we talked to children and actually come up with a document called work we can and cannot do for instance\nMilking the cows it's most of our might think it's OK harmless et cetera but these kids said if you're looking what are called ... which are very to implement and which are very happy kicking they said nobody should be doing it because it's harmful look dangerous\nInstead of lists drawn up by international organizations so central governments they find out what the children want some like being ... hours of household chores and provided to spend two hours working for a local shop others might choose factory work as a milking a temperamental Jersey cow\nIt's down to them and it gives them a little control over their own lives\nBut can you really expect children to meet the right decision for themselves\nI'm yet to find a child who really wants to be exploited\nBut a child to perhaps continued to walk because they feel the pressure to help that family\nWe have to give that child that choice in fact it kind of walk actually increases I bumped ability when you're working with children die typically you don't let them take that one decision and then forget them you're still in touch with them you're part of\nTheir life [noise]\nThan ours with children council throughout buying a long time consuming and expensive but it having resolved so is it time to rethink the final child labor [noise]\nThe Iowa and the organization behind the global ban said no children under a certain age should never work we heard about\nThe unintended consequences children pushed into more dangerous was called ... by the authorities debatable content\nIt was called ... by the authorities debatable continue\nBut when you take a step back it cleared the dealing with it isn't just about putting\nSomething real fundamental some kicking when\nA child under a such a name to what is by definition being exploited others say a child should have the right to want\nAnd that's what makes it so hard to know what's wrong\n[noise]\nDown to the line on definition of child labor it's about how we view childhood\n[noise] [laughter] [noise]\nThey think Laurie was presented by me had an amendment and ... and if you
