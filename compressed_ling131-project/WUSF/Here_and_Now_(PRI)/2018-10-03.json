A. M. U. dot org we've been hearing from so many of you Elizabeth tweets why is the minimum wage a specific amount instead of a percentage tied to cost of living or some other figure measured and adjusted annually\nAnd we'll emails us from Cape Cod I have a small landscaping in gardening business with depending on the time of year six to ten employees all skilled gardeners I pay at least Eighteen dollars an hour and I support a higher minimum wage\nWe're going to be talking about minimum wage and a living wage let's have Paul ... on a set the table for a little bit Paul the federal minimum wage\nIs just seven twenty five less than half of what Amazon is paying and what you can make in California starting in twenty twenty two hasn't been raised by Congress since two thousand and nine and its last ten percent of its purchasing power or even since two thousand nine how many states huge to the seven twenty five federal minimum\n... there are about Twenty one states where the uh minimum wage is just seven twenty five [noise] um and then there's another group of about eight states where it's the wages is a little higher but still low or nine dollars are lower\nUm but but uh the other ... you know there's other Twenty one states have um a you know stopped waiting for Congress to act and have have raise the minimum wage including a whole cluster of them that are raising it significantly to the twelve to Fifteen dollars an hour range [noise]\nOne of the the key things on the minimum wage to understand is you know it's a it's been because of of the role of money in politics and you know the congressional Republican leaderships refusal to um to to to allow any action on it um it's really become irrelevant to the federal level it's so low it's not doing its job to rate of raising pay\nAnd this is a real issue right now for you to get receiving increasing attention um you know we're in a booming economy jobs are growing but there's almost no wage growth jobs are barely keeping up with rise the rising cost of living the one place where we're seeing wage growth for workers at the bottom are in those states that are raising the minimum wage and that\nThat actually speaks to the point the important point that Mr solves within the caller raised about hey you know if some companies are raising pay may do we need a minimum wage\nBut hey you know if some companies are raising pay may do we need a minimum wage but the the data shows that while there are some leaders to really raise the floor and ... improve improve improve pay in our economy we need we need fair standards and the minimum wage has to be a lot higher and\nThe um you know things have gotten so out of whack that today close to one in three Americans\nAre earns less than Fifteen dollars an hour that's um you know forty million workers the median age is thirty thirty five\nYou know these are overwhelmingly adults who spend their careers in these jobs and it's\nYou know it's it's not it's fast food but not just fast food jobs you know the jobs to make her economy run about you know one wanted for health care workers one in five educators you know huge swaths of our economy of our workforce you're stuck in these jobs paying less than Fifteen dollars an hour\nAnd ... I I think it says a lot when you say that the minimum wages is laid down by Congress has almost irrelevant to the real economy because seven dollars and twenty five cents\n[laughter] just doesn't go anywhere in most states in most localities are and yet to have Congress advocating laws that are essentially irrelevant to how people really live\nA is a remarkable in ... and notable state of affairs necessary Europe proponent of a living wage and I and I read that tweet from one of our listeners who said why have a minimum wage why not index it essentially to a real life now what is the difference between a minimum wage and and what's become known as a living wage\nRight well MIT has a living wage calculator where you can go on there and type in where you live and it'll be allowed in number that's based on looking at the cost of local transportation food housing and other basic needs\nI looked up on the city I live in the district of Columbia they said the living wage there I was Seventeen dollars an hour but that's for fulltime work\nAnd I want to point out that a huge ... additional problem in addition to the low wages in this country is the increase in security if work how many people are working part time at Walmart at half\nOf their employees are part time workers and then there's the temporary workers and the subcontracted worker at the new Amazon Fifteen dollars an hour is not going to apply to their\nA contractor sets the increased ... precarious nest of work that that's also a big problem it despite are low unemployment we still have so many people working every day for poverty wages\nI'm Paul even though Fifteen dollars an hour is twice the current federal minimum as you mentioned we're it from a lot of listeners who say in this economic climate or even Fifteen doesn't go very far from some of them\nWhen all is higher than the minimum wage to try to better for workers but whenever a heads\nUp a dog a one way of writing a minimum wage and that's never know\nAnd as a college graduate with a bachelor's degree and student loans I already make Fifteen dollars an hour at a fulltime job and have to supplement with at least one part time job at all times\nI think there needs to be some consideration on regional differences because I can assure you that Fifteen dollars an hour in South Carolina goes much further than Fifteen dollars an hour in California\nI work another job besides my full time job and uh so I Am kind of like ... ... by fortunately I have lots of credit card debt and the result and uh actually like Eighteen dollars an hour to twenty four a fulltime job would probably be closer to say Bye bye\nPaul we hear from a lot of listeners there who were living on minimum wage and for many many more this has been a big issue in Congress a workers who work for big companies can't afford health care\nThere's a workers who work for big companies can't afford health care don't have insurance wind up relying on state or federal public assistance to make up the difference and that suggests that all of us in some way are subsidizing low wages\nYou know you're you're exactly right and I mean you're ... or your callers I mean\nActually if you look at cost of living data you see that in all fifty states I'm a single worker will need at least Fifteen dollars an hour to cover the basics and just a couple of years\nAnd in the high cost states the your your your listeners were flogging or workers with children will need even more than Fifteen dollars an hour we have a report on our website by my uh pinto PIN Tio on this with the with the numbers for all fifty states and uh\nIt really highlights how Fifteen is really a basic national floor and we need to even go up from there like a you know you know in New York and New Jersey did this week we're airport workers are getting a raise to Nineteen dollars an hour\nIn hotel workers are are striking around the country in the higher costs cities demanding twenty five dollars an hour or so you know your workers or your your listeners are right about about about what you know as a practical matter if you do the math what would it ... individuals need to to to get by especially in the higher cost regions\nAnd as a result you know a lot of employees of of companies big and small are relying on our taxpayer funded safety net for support you know more than a hundred and fifty billion dollars a year of safety net programs go to a workers of low paying jobs and you know these are good programs and we should have them but we need\nYou know major employers to do their part to pay a decent wage of at least Fifteen dollars an hour and then to supplement that with a with work supports in order to help bring bring workers up to a a basic level\nNow let's hear some of the other side of the Seth writes to us on Facebook when I worked for Walmart we were all excited when they raised our wages to ten dollars and fifty cents but then they cut ours to barely twenty hours a week then told us if we even had to have an open schedule we would get even less I'm skeptical of individual companies\nThat are raising wages and we received also a lot of calls from people who were concerned that raising the federal minimum wage to say\nFifteen dollars an hour could wind up backfiring on workers\nI'm all for making you know Fifteen dollars an hour at that job I'm at now I work at ... or ... in the mall but I find that a lot of people\nAre a lot of employers if they're raising the hourly wage or just cutting down hours which in the end it either arrows I'm from the previous uh wage or in some cases you make ...\nI Am opposed to raising it to Fifteen dollars an hour simply because I don't think businesses will take that last they will raise the price is the standard of living raise and Fifteen dollars won't to anyone any good employer will stay for\nThis is W.

I Want to talk about a fight going on in Washington DC where we happen to be in a one eight studios are WHM you enter the world [laughter] unfortunately increasingly so but there has been\nA very important wage fight going on on the local level not in Washington is a world knows it but D.C as locals know it uh there was a ballot initiative where voters in DC voted to raise the minimum wage for tipped workers a bar backs bartenders waiters and waitresses people who work in restaurants primarily\nAnd there was a big fight a lot of pushback it looks like grassroots resistance and then we found out that a lot of the money for the pushback was indeed coming from organizing interests for restaurant owners of the American restaurant association local chapters and others um voters voted to say yes you have to raise your minimum wage restaurants bars\nAnd now the city council here in the district of Columbia has decided that voters were wrong and they are in the process of voting\nThis very day to overturn the will of local D.C voters on this issue of what does this fight here in D.C say about the state of wages especially for ticked workers people who might get paid by their employer I don't know five bucks an hour because they make up the rest in in ones and hopefully five\n... the way I see it this week the living wage movement to three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen\nTook three or four steps forward with the Amazon announcement on Fifteen\nAnd they took one big step back with the DC Council voted to repeal um that the will of the voters to eliminate and in a gradual way this sub minimum wage for tipped workers\nI'm sad really the minimum wage for tipped workers is two dollars and Thirteen cents it's been stuck there for\nA couple of decades here in DC it's three dollars and eighty nine cents technically if you don't make enough tips to bring that a wage up to the the um the local minimum your employer is supposed to make up the difference\nThat pretty much never happens I used to work in the restaurant industry and I've talked to a lot of restaurant workers that pretty much never happens and so we have a workforce of restaurant servers primarily women many women of color\nOr ... at jobs where people face ramping sexual harassment they're vulnerable because they're having to do whatever customers say to get those tips because without the tips they're back down to really a A N E L a wage that doesn't amount to anything so\nPeople in the district um voted to get rid of this two tier system\nUm the industry launched an incredible\nCampaign against it they put posters up everywhere in the city saying save our tips to try to make people think that this had something to do with banning tips\nIt did not it was clearly beat beyond a local issue this with the national showdown between the restaurant industry and people who are trying to get a fair wage for this vulnerable sector of the workforce\nMichael Saltsman and what did you see at play here I think we're familiar with\nWorkers versus management in a fight like this uh the DC Council voting to overturn the will of the voters it is remarkable but what about the economics of it will actually so I I think in this case you had a situation where the interests of workers and management were actually very clearly aligned I mean there was a sixteen hour hearing\nBefore the council voted on this this bill to repeal the initiative initiative Seventy seven I'm I was at the hearing I testified at two thirty in the morning it went until three twenty in the morning\nUm and the number of employees who showed up to say this is going to be harmful to us you need to repeal this far outnumbered those where they're supportive and I just want to take a step back to I mean it was mentioned earlier that a living wage in in DC is is is Seventeen dollars an hour I mean tipped employee in DC\nUh according to the bureau of Labor Statistics are in with their tips about Eighteen Nineteen dollars an hour or so you have people who are already doing quite well in what happened a few years ago as a business and labor in DC came together and said okay we're we want to go to a Fifteen dollar minimum wage and regardless of what you think on the merits of that\nWe're also going to raise the tips may win among wage in that case up to about five dollars an hour and and they did that because they heard from tipped employee as you said\nWe want to keep the tip credit we want our tips to count as income\nThere was one group of New York based group called rock that didn't like that and so they they came in and they had a lot of money that come in to try and put this issue\nOn the ballot and what happened was yes the restaurant industry um was opposed to this ballot measure but you had a massive grassroots outpouring from employees hundreds of who showed up for instance to an event with council chairman Phil Mendelson to say\nWe don't want this and I think it's part of a bigger movement of employees now you say you say grass roots and I'm I'm sure that you're right but grass roots are astro turf we see so much grass roots in the area of wages in minimum wage is only to find out that the grass roots workers who are fighting against\nIncreases in wages are are backed by business interests so actually I I think it's I think that that talking point I think that's been used by proponents is is is a little bit um demeaning to the workers who who came forward\nUm because of the the testimony they gave you know one forty five in the morning or the people who got up\nOr at Franklin hall and said you know what this is going to be ...\nMorning or the people who got up a at Franklin hall and said you know what this is going to be harmful to me this is going to be harmful to my industry\nDon't try and save me I'm not asking for it I mean I think that the the the the notion I think that these people are just doing that um because they're sort of put up to it or somehow that they're not real employees\nUm I I think it's kind of insulting to what they're trying to do and Phil Mendelson ah the chairman Phil Mendelson mature the DC Council made an interesting point um when he got us to talk about this which is that he said\nI have heard from countless employees who tell me\nThis is not good for them I have heard from almost nobody who wants who wants to keep and and he said people can come to me privately they can email me this was not an issue of their owners being intimidated he said that the grassroots on this in support of it was silent he called them silent grassroots and I think that's that's indicative of where the passion was on this\nIssue let's pull back from the district the district of Columbia the local D.C back out to the nation at large and so many of you want any listeners\nHad been reaching out to us Nina posts on Facebook arm and a precarious position if my wages go up I won't be eligible for Medicaid so it's a wash or worst for me we talked about free riders and how many workers who get minimum wages wind up on public assistance\nAnd Randy in Tulsa emailed advocates are correct Amazon Walmart McDonalds and the other giants can afford Fifteen dollars for a minimum wage but the local donut shop the mom and pop floors those businesses will be hurt it's just another blow against main street\nNotes or I Want to talk to you about income inequality and we're in minimum wage fits into this we hear so much about the growing wealth gap and massive income inequality in this country we talk about the shrinking of the middle class but at the low end of the pay scale can increases in minimum wage actually provide\nAny real equity or is it just a drop in the bucket in a world where the top one percent on fifty percent of its\nMeaningful that in some ways it as a drop in the bucket you know a couple of years ago two of my colleagues calculated that three men three wealthiest men in America including Amazon CEO Jeff Bass though it's Warren Buffett and Bill Gates have combined wealth that his graders and the combined wealth at the bottom half of the country\nAnd today that's an understatement because Jeff ... says well says increased so much but nevertheless to dramatize is just how extreme the wealth gap is and I think there's a lot of interest in\n'em adding to the fight for Fifteen effort to look not just that the low end of the wage scale but also the top end what can we do to prevent the Israeli obscene levels of income and wealth concentration at the top that are so damaging to our economy our democracy\nNot to mention just a moral outrage and in a country that that is so wealthy\nAnd so I'm really excited about a new tool we have for doing this to the air for the first time in history publicly held companies have to report the gap between their CEO and their worker pay\nThe numbers coming out are staggering at Walmart it's a thousand to one at at McDonalds it's three thousand to one and we can build on that information to incentivize companies to to narrow gaps and just one quick example Portland, Oregon\nIntroduced the world's first tax penalty on companies that pay their CEO\nMore than one hundred times their median worker paid this year they're going to put the revenue from that into homeless services and it'll hit companies like Wells Fargo and\nAnd Wal Mart that do business in the city of Portland I think ideas like that are going to start to spread like wildfire now that we have this information about gaps within specific company\nAnd an interesting set of proposals at a time when populism is strong in our political culture both on the left and on the ride and workers voices and income inequality becoming a much more\nRight and workers voices and income inequality becoming a much more important part of the conversation you certainly see a lot of pushback from corporate America I think Bernie would be down uh Alexandria or a Casio Cortez in New York would", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "03"}
