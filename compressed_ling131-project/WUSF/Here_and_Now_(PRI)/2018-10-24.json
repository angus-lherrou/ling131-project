W. A. M. U. dot org Barbara emailed I still talk weekly by phone to your many friends in ... and ... they are living in hell and be asked\nWhy does America hate us so much why does America wants to kill us\nWhat do I say some of before we continue and before we bring in our next voices on the conversation I Wonder if you could just haven't been following the Yemeni civil war very clearly can you just boil down at the core of it what does this conflict about who are the fighters and what are they fighting for\nSo Yemen's conflict is actually quite complex conflict\nA it's a it's a conflict that has many layers to it but ultimately what you hear in the news is that's a it's a Saudi Iranian proxy war you also hear that the government at the who the government in Sana'a that announced itself is actually in fact a a coup government that has drawn by militia\nAnd that the Saudi Government is trying to restore the legitimate Yemeni government ah to power in Yemen\nNow the problem with all of that as this conflict is failing to do all of the things that they're saying it's a it's about for example when Saudi Arabia got involved in this conflict with the Arab coalition the aim is to bring back the Yemeni government the Yemeni government has been residing in jail since the war started\nAnd uh is struggling to go back to places where there is no associate on Bush on the ground\nOn top of that so the English or in a sense has gained so much more since the war started in the sense that at first they had to share power with\nAh the former president of Yemen where you know in two thousand eleven Yemen had a revolution and I'm the president was removed\nBut he ... himself with the who these and was president for some time but I'm the sheer power with him now fast forward three years into the war they had killed them and and now they have their own control of the majority\nHad killed them and and now they have their own control of the majority of the north of Yemen and of course the the scariest thing about this is the Houthi militia had managed to capture the Yemeni military arsenal that belong to the former government is now all in their hand\nAnd so in a sense what the war dead is complicate an already complicated political situation\nAnd it devastated the lives of millions of enemies\nUh for example Seventy five percent of the Yemeni population is is suffering and in need of immediate aid and depend on foreign aid to kind of survive and this is a Seventy percent increase since before the war began um\nAnd I didn't want to talk more about the the population on the ground that needs help I just want to before before we get to our next wars and also just want to be clear there's a sectarian part of his views\nThese who the rebels who kind of came after the government you're Saudi Arabia involving itself but there is a Muslim sectarian aspect to this also is Sunni versus Shia conflict as a proxy war right\nSo this is what's interesting and this is what a lot of the people don't realize first of all the Shiite and Yemen I don't practice the same sect of ... that Iran practices or the Shiites in Lebanon are at all the practice\nThey practice a sect called the DSM and the ideas and is known as fiber shot and it's really different from twelve or ... or the ... form that's practice in Iran\nWhat's interesting is that it's the closest form of ... that resembles Sunday and some are and in Yemen and we the Sunnis there are shot values and the divide isn't you know the the ... are not a minority like in other places or forty five percent of the population\nAnd so what's interesting about this you know Sunni Shia conflict is that it's entirely manufactured in a sense that of course there are differences between these those two sacks of course there are situations where they don't agree but they managed to co exist for many years\nNow the the these are the who the sect of of you know what's happening in Yemen they're no longer practicing as easy as and as it as it seems like they're trying to politicize\nSaid the as them and to kind of a associate themselves more with the Iranian sect of ... and the ... has struggled to maintain\nIts sect as it is with the influence of well how does them and set up as him coming into the country and so in a sense what you're saying is that the most radical elements of those two\nAre fighting each other and so in a sense you have the presence of a new ... conflict but one thing that I really have to point out to the listeners here is that that's not the only thing going on\nI'm a huge portion of the country and the liberated territory from the control\nIs actually demanding secession and that is something that you don't hear about in the news as much you know in the south and ever since Nineteen Ninety four the people their fault that they were under occupation and the cost secession are rising day after day as this conflict continues\nI'd want to make sure we get to a voice on the ground and human but I hear what you're saying some are in terms of all of these very complex fault lines of kind of come together to fuel the civil war today before we came on the air today\nWe were able to get through to Sana'a in Yemen all communication into and out of Yemen is really tough but we did make contact was least grounding she's the UN's resident and humanitarian coordinator for Yemen least laid out what the conditions are like right now for those who are living and working beer here as part of our conversation\nThat we have just a few minutes ago we were all day will come to want to thank you very much can you give me a sense just in a in a larger context how many people the un fears are at risk of famine right now\nPeople the un fears are at risk of famine right now\nIn game and we are worried that if steps are not taken right now\nIn order to stop the spread of hunger that we could see as many as fourteen million ... who are facing famine by the end of the year and this is why the United nations is ringing the alarm bells and telling everyone that we are facing\nPossibly the biggest famine in living memory if we don't do something to stop it right now\nWhat are some of the other health risks that you're looking at their other than just starvation I'm sure with deprivation of be reasonable secure supply of food all kinds of other health problems also come into play right\nThat's exactly right last year the largest cholera outbreak in modern history hit name and there were more than a million people who are suffering either from Colorado or from watery diarrhea there had never been an outbreak of such magnitude in living memory\nNow this year because of the road work that's being done by frontline partners in UN agencies and officials here in game and we've been able to contain the spread of and how the Democrats have similar levels\nThere's a lot of color in the country but it's not spreading at the rate of course last year that being said when people exist for months and months on supplemental rations when they are eating limited amounts of food what happens over a period of time is that they slowly start\nAnd this is absolutely but we are seeing for millions of people in this country their immune systems are weakening and that makes them highly vulnerable\nTo infections and water borne diseases including cholera\nAnd just by way of contacts leaves mentioned that there are fourteen million people that the un fears are at risk of famine the population of Illinois where we are right now doing this program and from Chicago he's Thirteen million people just by way of contacts least give me a sense of what\nA mother a father a parent has to do in Yemen right now to try and feed their child to can you boil down to what an individual might be dealing with just to try to feed themselves and feed their family would they have to do\n[noise] sixty percent of all of the people who live in this country are what we call food insecure now out of that out of those Eighteen million people every single morning there are eight and a half million to wake up and they have absolutely no idea where they are going to get food from that day [noise]\nSo what will happen is a family will use absolutely every means at their disposal to secure what they can they'll go to their relatives and bake\nThey'll go to religious institutions and bake they'll come knocking on doors a non governmental organizations in the UN and ask for our help\nContact Sherry hood at eight hundred seven for one nine zero nine zero [noise] this is W.

W. A. M. U.\nDot org before we continue some al Hamdani let me come back to you for a second I checked in with our audience here at W. B. usually in Chicago to kind of ask them if they were tracking with us and one of the things that I think confuses a lot of people it confuses me too\nIs the nature of this sectarian\nAspect like several of us\nNature of this secretary and\nLike several of us and we have a a ray of of age ranges here students and seniors and everybody in between have heard of Sunni and Shia Muslims\nBut then that like the the sects within the sects I think that's where a lot of it's kind of get lost can you\nCan you bottom line that for us what difference does it make what sect these people are with like why why does the sects why did with sex involved matter to this can you just kind of simplified force\nAbsolutely so when it comes to Yemen like I mentioned uh the majority of the northern part of Yemen is historically say D and the majority of the southern portions of Yemen as historically shaft eye and said these can be called Shia and the chef aides are called for now\nNow the ... conflict a kind of began years ago and then was revived recently\nUm what we see as the political importation of religious sects of what we're seeing it play is political Islam and that's what you're hearing about you know the chefs in a conflict\nIt's not really a religious matter today it's really a political matter of allegiance to what part of the middle east are you going to support and what we're seeing play out is that\nIran is announcing itself as the um [noise]\nKind of the guardian if she has them and Saudi Arabia on the other hand is presenting itself to the world is the guardian of sending them and so as soon as she our it's pretty much kind of people fighting for the interests of who's going to take control in the region\nAnd that's what this what's happening in Yemen you know for instance when this war started we know that the u._s. then under the administration of President Obama had struck a deal of um a nuclear deal with Iran\nAnd the sense they sacrifice dam and by saying here you can fight Iran in Yemen but the U.S is going to try and find this deal with Iran now that was a short sighted move because I think a lot of people that didn't anticipate that today President Trump would come to power and then today you have and a nuclear deal with Iran I\nAnd at the same time also had this devastating crisis in Yemen and so in a sense okay so let me\nSo let me ... I think so let me let me back up and try and repeat back to you what you just said I said I've been granted diagram everybody here ... years and watching you scribble in my piece of paper so we've got these these two sets of Islam Sunni Islam and she Islam it's this old centuries old fight that has been made\nPolitical you use the phrase political Islam to describe\nHow we run as kind of for political and regional power reasons trying to kind of claim itself as the the defender of the Shia Muslim face\nAnd Saudi Arabia has kind of anointed itself the defender of the Sunni Muslim faith and that politicized Islam has spread into other conflicts and Yemen these factions in Yemen\nIran and Saudi Arabia are supporting these factions is kind of a battle in this larger war for the soul of political Islam is that kind of it\nSure yeah exactly and so what I'm saying is that historically and traditionally the sect of Islam that ... have practiced for years are not necessarily aligned with the Saudi an Iranian sects but for political reasons they are now aligning with each other\nGotcha gotcha folks here it'd be easy does that make more sense good we got some up all around if you go and I I appreciate you explain it I think you know part of the complication Jane Ferguson is that this is complicated I mean some words you can't just boil down to one\nComplicated I mean some wars you can't just\nBoil down to one cause but that also makes it hard for\nUs sworn in Yemen to zero in on them and and really think our teeth in but you were reporting has involved some of the people on the ground\nWho are dealing with the results of this larger fight for the soul of political Islam you described the story of an eleven year old girl that you encountered back in June but kind of stuck with you can you give us the basics of what happened to her\n... telling her story is one of the reasons is the most important reason why journalists need access to this because we have to put a face and a name and a picture to the statistics otherwise they're just the tip steaks and I think than we we deal with with a lot\nOf uh of of of difficulty trying to get the public to understand the level of this crisis so I and I was in ... um which is a problem\nWhen sort of in northwest of of Santa and controlled by the who the rebels and uh and it's meant nothing in the town of hijacking the capital of the problem there was a hospital where like every single hospital that I've seen there that\nThe children's ward is now a de facto malnutrition wards and we were just filming there with some women and their babies' whenever a young man\nTall deathly thin\nRushed in with a with a tiny what looked like just sort of like a bundle of closer than it was his eleven year old sister name was ... and for a horrible few moments we really thought may mono might dying in front of us on the hospital bed she was eleven years old and way too\nI think twenty four pounds was what was what what we had to what we had asked at the doctor's with that and it was\nAbsolutely a horrifying to watch her she you know when when a child gets so weak and so a malnourished\nThey also becomes so vulnerable to any kinds of infection and so they tend to get a diarrhea anyway and so even even if you do manage to get through to the and uh they get diarrhea they get devastating they hydrated as a result the whole thing just spiraled\nUntil the child's body just gives in um we spent some time they're filming with my own and speaking with her family\nAnd her mother eventually came the next day we were able to talk to her\nAnd we were piecing together the family story and it is a story that reflects millions of people's stories in Yemen and it is that her father was a schoolteacher and a government school but whenever the uh the government salaries stopped over two years ago\nHe his salary stopped to once people lost that level of income the government was that the the biggest employer by far in the country before the war and that's not just soldiers and police that's people who work in offices that teachers any kind of clerical work or any kind of bureaucratic work in Yemen\nWants those salaries stopped people would then go on to trying to live off of what the aid agencies would call coping mechanism to you and I that's simply do have any saving do I have a line of credit at the local store do have any livestock in the backyard do I have relatives who can help us out after two years\nThose coping strategies run out and they ran an ad for this family and they simply had no money and wanted child starts to go downhill it can spiral out of control like this\nThey were lucky family because they were able to afford to pay a cab to take them to the town\nAnd ... and lots of families are not that lucky and so one of the things that is really important to remember by this crisis is we don't even know how many children are dying for ... or we don't know how many don't make it to the hospitals and ... and you know this one child came from a middle class family that educated father and that's really a ...", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city":
