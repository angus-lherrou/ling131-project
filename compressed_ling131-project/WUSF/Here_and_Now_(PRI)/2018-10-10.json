to this new report and Coral Davenport who covers energy and the environment for the New York times you've already had quite a bit to say we got this message from Andy who was an oyster farmer in Alabama here's what end the left in our inbox\nWhen I moved here in Nineteen eighty there were Marsha ... shrimp crabs and dozens of fears now much of that has gone I've got my first appearance on each well it was destroyed two weeks later by Hurricane Isaac\nI rebuilt a lawsuit again tonight in twenty Seventeen and then again the Gordon in twenty eight team now I'm watching my approach\nHandy thanks very much for writing in sorry to hear about what's been going on with your peers and I know that hurricane Michael is very worrisome\nI Wonder professor liver and if you could speak to part of what Andy\nSaid I've seen a lot of my friends on line saying the climate change and people say there's no climate change and look at these hurricanes that we've been having it how much should the average person be packing things like hurricane Michael\nDirectly to what we're seeing from from climate change there's still a lot we don't know about the cycles of severe weather but what do what what would you say to people like Andy who are worried about this kind of thing\nWell first of all about let's talk writing I had Pete that take hatred Michael\nBut um [noise] we can't say that the American\nDirectly related to global warming what we can say is the tone for these harkens that increasing at the results of global warming because we're all my atmosphere had more energy can hold more water [noise] so\nBut ... said that they thought that the extreme it that whether it's ... or extreme rainfall all heat waves are increasing with three little bits of wanting\nMe to a few more of your comments Sarah emailed I feel overwhelmed by the talk about climate change and don't feel like there is a unified voice out they're letting families no what concrete steps they can take to make a difference for\nOur family this has led to ever present feelings of helplessness anxiety and guilt about the choices we make every day Sarah we will be talking about some concrete options in just a moment but let me get to a few more thoughts that have come in the far\nAnd just a moment but let me get to a few more sort\nOf come in the U.S for ... emailed you should stop framing this as what will politicians do politicians reflect the people that voted for them half the voters in the U.S ... Donald Trump's tweet the global warming was a Chinese hopes and voted for him anyway\nThat just goes to show how important the issue as to the people in this country\nCalled them for I Wonder if you could respond to Joel's email I mean the president has committed to taking us out of the Paris Agreement he kind of questions the provenance of the agreement by saying well who wrote it up let me see who wrote a mental believe it does Joel have a point [noise]\nUh well in in terms of um ... policies being a policy that address climate change on the U.S really isn't a\nA distinctive place right now I think I'm Around the rest of the world we do see an expression of will by leaders\nTo um enact policies to limit greenhouse gas emissions I think that there's a lot of questions on how strong those policies actually are\nUm you know the analysis shows that they're they're not strong enough to limit warming even to that that initial to degrade but do you in the U. S. um what we see is President Trump not only you know essentially questioning that the basic establish of of\nClimate change but but also moving to undo existing climate policies I'm President Trump had already moved forward with policies to undo regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants on undo or weekend um regulations on greenhouse gas emissions from cars\nUm and he had said that it is his objective to promote the use of coal\nI'm burning coal is one of the leading contributors to greenhouse gas emissions\nA President Trump wants to promote the use of coal in the U.S and abroad um one of the findings of this report is that in order to um limit greenhouse limit climate change to\nUm you know to to to the sort of least destructive um level of warming um the use of coal will have to ah basically go down to zero\nI'm by by twenty fifty so ... basically no more on just about no more coal and and and and it is you know that that it that is an extremely disruptive policy recommendation um there's no question that there are industries and people who will be harmed\nWho who will have their livelihoods disrupted by policies um they go in that direction\nAnd and not only just once I started to shore call but I Wonder in terms of the politics behind this I hear you on I I totally hear you on how disruptive it says it's all white colder so interwoven in the network of America's energy grids kind of hard to just yank it all out\nI Wonder though in terms of the voices on the world stage who we we know that there are voices who were saying well coal it'd be really hard to pull out\nDo you get the sense that there's any one of the world stage saying tough our planet is only home you light pole tough we got to get rid of it deal with how to order or California so Jerry Brown the governor of California for sure\nAnd many of the ... on on the president of France has sought to kind of a step in and um\nHe he's trying to carve out a place for himself as as a as a leader on climate change it's it's not difficult for France to take that position because France um doesn't really use call 'em so but but but we I mean we absolutely see world leaders saying you know this is what what needs to happen\nI mean we absolutely see world leaders saying you know this is what what needs to happen [noise]\nUm [noise] in China it's very interesting because um China is the world's largest\nUm greenhouse gas polluter and is now said he's or a call at the same time we're opposite that the Chinese government had moved far and with I'm actually in acting um prices on carbon are at their their their an acting a cap and trade system that would force\nUm carbon polluters called polluters to essentially pay attacks or the um I did in in order to pollute which is designed to drive the markets\nAway from from greenhouse gases an idea that was invented in the United states but it's I'm considered sort of politically toxic here in China they can implement it by ... they don't have to deal with that Congress voting against at Iraq and in the United states\nTo do on a ... or you want to talk more about that idea of carbon taxes we continue in just a moment but let me get to a few more comments uh Brian emailed we have no leaders anymore with the skills or courage to do what's right regardless of the political cost\nWe will keep polluting as long as the price of fossil fuels is low\nWould be interested to hear from some of you listening who you trust who you think some of the leaders are politically in this country around the world who you believe are sincere in their pushed to do something significant about climate change is there anybody that you think is for real and saying that we're going to make this happen or maybe if you're active with\nA politician or a government leader or a government agency it's doing something tangible\nThat you feel people should know more about we love to hear from you what gives you hope\nThat climate change is something that is actively being worked on where you are email is one a at W. A. M.

of liver meant we got a number of messages from you in terms of how you are trying to make an impact with the fight against climate change here is a little mash up of two of the messages we got this is Amy from Chesapeake and Jeff in Michigan listen\nI'm getting a thought to get ... thoughts feeling of powerlessness and that I Can't do enough to stop the path of destruction that we're on\nOur pessimism comes because I Believe that what's happening to the world is happening at a corporate level and I'm Still\nMore companies get on board and share about the environment it feels like we're kind of inevitable I have um two thousand four to you will be here before we know what we will rip the consequences\nThanks Geoff an Emmy for sharing your thoughts with us ah speaking of the corporate path there are some corporations who are taking a position in the fight against climate change including with regards to the carbon tax Melissa tweeted\nChina uses more than twice as much coal as us hard to believe some carbon tax is going to make much of a difference considering their population let's talk more about carbon taxes with one more of our guests joining us from London\nTed holstead is the chairman and CEO of the climate leadership council Ted welcome to want to be good to be with you\nOf the climate leadership council Ted welcome to want to [noise] good to be with you ... what is the climate leadership council\nIt is a group a that is co founded by a white actually the broadest climate coalition in us history to back in national solution is pushing for a carbon tax or all the money is related to the American people in the form of ... of ... of a dividend\nWho were some of the backers of the council where\nDoes the funding come from so um the council is a does not accept corporate contributions but our founding members include for the\nUh oil majors the largest car manufacturer in the United states the largest utility but also the largest a solar company in the United states a very broad coalition it also includes two leading environmental groups and opinion leaders from across the political spectrum ranging from\nBen Bernanke key to Janet Yellen to Larry Summers\nAnd of course our plan is named after former secretaries of state James Baker and George Schultz the Baker's shoulder carbon defense plan but Joshua let me clarify we have there is a separate spin off organization that as a lobbying organization and that now has corporate funding including from Exxon\nOkay and that is connected to the organization or use it as a spin off but it's there's still a connection in any way or completely separate\nUh it is a separate organization that is the advocacy arm of the climate leadership council so the council develops this groundbreaking breaking plan were all sides wind and Americans for carbon dividends which was co chaired by former Republican Senate majority leader Trent Lott and a\nA center bro that group lobbies for this plan and it now has money from oil natural gas solar wind and nuclear power interests\nCurled up in Fort let's take a step back before we get into the plan that the climate leadership council is advocating more specifically defined this term carbon tax for what exactly is a carbon tax\nShores so um\nThe idea of a carbon tax is um ... each ton of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere um you can put a price on how much economic harm it causes\nUm and at an ... an important new on that at the the economist who came up with with that idea his name is William North house he's a professor at Yale I'm with just awarded the Nobel Prize for this idea on Monday or the same day that the IPC came out with this report which heavily sites\nI'm professor north houses work\nUm so he came up with the idea of every kind of carbon um traps heat in the atmosphere and you can put a price on how much\nEach kind of carbon hurt a the global economy on and and there's a range for how much that costs that it it can range from um fifty dollars a time to a hundred dollars a time um you know there there's there's debate about about how much\nUm actual harm it can cost at once you sort of place that price on carbon um than you are ... can essentially um create attacks I'm at a price on carbon or attacks on carbon that you would impose upon polluters have carbon dioxide no no\nNo I haven't I'm Sorry I'm Sorry I just want to be really clear in terms of who the taxes paid on I mean if I Am a car maker do I pay the pollution from automobiles does the carmaker\nPay carbon tax for producing the vehicle that belching out carbon dioxide or does the oil company pay the carbon tax for finding the gas alone that ...\nThe most\nWyoming way popular most interesting there's three to one support among
