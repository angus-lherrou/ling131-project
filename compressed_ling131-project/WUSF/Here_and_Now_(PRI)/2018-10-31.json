A. M. U. dot org me get to a few more of your comments Laura is in Goshen, Indiana\nLaura emailed Trump as a vanguard of our worst angels is effectively sounding the horn to release previously restrained prejudices legions in some Americans\nHate it now fair game and high volume what they call the end the political correctness is the end of civility and democracy missing McCain and Obama now you don't know what you've got till it's gone and it's gone\nHeidi by Eric I Wonder if you could respond to that comment I Wonder if what Laura is saying in a way takes a little of the pressure off of President Trump in so far as he didn't create these views he happened to have tapped into them but you can't tap into something that wasn't already there\nWell I think that's a completely fair progression I mean you know in the United states has had a long problem with white supremacy and racism and legally oppressed you know parts of its own population for centuries\nOf it that it's legitimate to say that this kind of hate has been there\nI Will say that the work we do at the Southern Poverty Law Center found a great escalation and the number of hate groups for example\nOn line hate rhetoric particular lean during the years that Obama with an office as an African American he very much a set off white supremacist who were unhappy with him being elected to the highest office\nAnd the Internet it self has allowed this kind of material to proliferate radicalized people you know it's allowed to be shared in a way that wasn't the case in prior era so we have a lot more of it around and that's certainly something Trump has tapped into\nMick how do you see it ah there's no question that there is a hyper polarization in American politics and I think it's important to\nThere is a hyper polarization in American politics and I think it's important to also recognize that something is going on internationally when you look at Europe a there is a larger\nKind of breakdown of post World war two consensus um you know in general throughout the the developed world and certainly in Western Europe and North America\nA Trump did not create that he isn't happening it and he's exploiting it to his political uh aims\nWe need a a tremendous reset I think in American political discourse and this is not a I'm not even talking about the rhetoric of hate per se um of polarization end up opposition at this point according to Gallup about twenty six percent of people\nIn America identify as Republican about twenty seven or twenty eight percent identified as Democrats these are historic lows as was noted before there is a historically low level of trust and confidence in the government and other major institutions we\nNeed to come up with a a political rhetoric of public rhetoric actually that is\nI'm not a you know that is not based on demonization of polarization and again you know Trump Trump bears a certain core responsibility as president of the United states because he is not simply a politician he is also on some level or he should be leading the discussion in a way that has more productive than he is\nBut he's also not the only one or you know doing this um [noise]\nAnd um the other thing to think about though is\nWhat is the distinction between rhetoric and action um and you know when we we live in a violent the society that is filled with a lot of a fantasy violence whether we're talking about games whether we're talking about rhetoric et cetera but in general crimes are going down and violence is going down so again\nRecognizing that rhetoric is one thing in reality is another I think is you know it was the starting point of any conversation about this but I Do think we need to reset and that it needs to be a it needs to move away from polarization but this is much much bigger than Donald Trump I Wonder though Nick\nHow much power we give the words that are set especially in the political sphere I mean anyone who thinks that and I I Know you're not saying that words have zero power but I think ... who who minimize the power of words needs to go back and read the declaration of independence those words yeah weapons for sure and they let you well war\nAh you know yeah I I you know I I agree completely with that and and I realize that that I you know or maybe it's a slippery position where I'm saying you know simultaneously that words matter in rhetoric matters but also that we need you know what what are we going to do about that so I guess as it is another way of coming to this question of\nTrump's rhetoric is ridiculous it as hate filled it is garbage I mean it is and it you know it's been now uh we we can go on and on that doesn't get us any closer to figuring out how do how do we have a better conversation about politics about places where we need to\nReach a consensus and and then it knocked policies that actually work for the benefit of of\nPeople I Do want to talk a little bit more going forward a little later in the conversation about what next steps my looked like next to ... we will circle back to that Jennifer mochi a number of people\nHave commented on the role of the press of various media outlets that I Will try hard not to use the term as media\nBecause there are so many different kinds of media out there will try to be a specific as we can ... and thanks to those of you who commented who has been specific who've mentioned specific networks or specific people that is extremely helpful so keep that up\nWhen they get to a few of your comments about various media outlets in various press outlets\nCheryl tweeted the largest responsibility belongs to the twenty four seven media and those who absorb commentary an opinion as if it were factual news that President much like Andrew Jackson stands up to the press should he just let the Ninety percent negative coverage go we all need to be personally responsible mud\nOf coverage go we all need to be personally responsible mod asks why does he get so much airtime and Jim Wright's why hasn't anyone address the years of conditioning the public has received from talking heads such as Rush Limbaugh Glenn\nBeck Alex Jones et cetera\nBut have permeated our society and uh finally elected veer leader which only embolden stone Jennifer before you react to that sweet of comments I should note that Glenn Beck in recent years\nHas tried to walk back some of his rhetoric and has as publicly apologized in his words for for taking some of the rhetoric too far but I Do wonder Jennifer what your sense of how much of an oval various media outlets plans\nAt the great question and I think that and there's a little bit of a historical big picture that um maybe would inform my answer here I'm In part of that is a reciprocal ruled that used to exist between the president and the press\nAnd it used to be the case that uh there was a mutually beneficial relationship between the presidency and the press a largely because they needed each other the press needed the president for information and the president needed depressed because the president needed to disseminate that information and get their message out\nAnd that relationship has fractured and that's largely due to um cable news and social media and the fact that we all now have this platform to disseminate and circulate information including the president\nAnd and so information circulates in a very different way than it did twenty thirty fifty years ago um which is really fractured this relationship between the press and the president and Trump has been able to take advantage of that\nAre in a way that that previous presidents had tried to do but Trump has really done much better for worse job depending on your perspective um and so at Trump is completely mastered the news cycle\nAnd the way that ah it especially cable news has been complicit I think in in amplifying his message at you know on Twitter he has followers and many of them are bought a but most of Americans aren't on Twitter but we see his tweets everywhere right\nAnd because those messages are amplified and that is Trump using the bully pulpit the good pulled out of the presidency and also taking advantage of all of these other social media opportunities um and and so in this case a lot of times the press is been guilty of amplifying this message and when they said enough\nHow do you buy like I Wonder how much you put the blame on various media outlets versus the president I feel like at this point we're kind of used to the drum beat of opinionated commentators on television and radio it's also trope in our culture I mean\nJoin us for the CBC is cute tonight at eight o'clock right after the rebroadcast of today's fresh

of the midterms we've heard a lot of concerns about people who should be able to vote not being able to voter fraud has been a hot topic for the last few years some say voter suppression is worse now than it's been in some time\nHow easy or hard is it to vote where you live\nWhat have you encountered in terms of registering to vote or casting your ballot leave us a voice mail eight five five to

quality audio files through our app won a vox pop will share some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Jennifer ... by Rick and Nick Gillespie a few more of your comments Fernando tweeted we are all adults at adults take responsibility for their own actions the media is trying to find a scapegoat and it is truly unfair but then again he is blamed for everything\nDone writes the shooter is responsible dumb question drew tweeted Trump may not be responsible for the violence but the people who are feeling Bolden and encouraged by what he says as long as he remains inconsistent\nBolden and encouraged by what she says as long as she remains inconsistent in denouncing violence and hatred they'll continue seeing him as an ally stripped from a tree or could you respond to that last week from drew ... it is true that the president\nHas denounced the violence I mean the first ... minutes you made after the carnage in Charlottesville was to denounce white supremacy bigotry hatred melts forms then in that press conference that impromptu press conference in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York on Tuesday I think\nYou said there were good people on both sides ... I Wonder how you view this in terms of the the way that the president denounces violence at least at a statement and then makes comments that are vitriolic thereafter how do you see is\nYeah it's a great question and and I'd also like to address the question of responsibility and if we have a moment Jim that after answer\nAnd so Trump will say the thing that somebody has written for him to say he will read from the teleprompter when he was forced to do that\nUm but that isn't his natural inclination and so I have tracked in fact the way that Trump uses denial on in these situations when people do try to hold him accountable and suggest that he had some responsibility for something\nSo for example during the campaign I'm a group of white nationalist at the Daily Stormer decided that they would avenge um what they thought was a bad a article that was written by Julian ... kill\n'em and so they sent her um hate messages and death threats and you know did all kinds of terrible things to her\nAnd and when they asked Trump about it he said he didn't know anything about it so his first strategy was to deny any knowledge and then they said well and you know the sun CNN they said well but you know do you have a message about this now you you clearly know about it I'm telling you about it\nAnd then he denied association with the people right and he says I don't know I don't know those people and he says what fans of mine you know are they are these fans who've done this\nUm and then he does a third thing which is to wonder what um the journalist Julie ... he had done to deserve this hatred you know did she write this terrible article that is full of you know lie about me um and then to um accuse at other people doing the same kinds of things right to an appeal to hypocrisy\nAnd if you look at when Trump is responding to these situations where people are trying to hold him accountable for his violent rhetoric\nAnd he follows that same pattern he denied knowledge of it he denies association of it and maybe praises the people who've done it he wonders what the person did to deserve it and then he finally uses to quote ... which is an appeal to piracy to say oh everybody else does is it's not just me\nAnd and that is classic for Trump he cannot be held accountable [noise]\nThis is why I call him a demagogue a demagogue is an an accountable leader and that's a historic definition deriving from ancient Athens\nUm and and we're talking about whether Trump is responsible and we can say that he's responsible but I'm telling you Trump does not accept responsibility he won't take that responsibility um admit that he in fact has been wrong\nI Wonder how effective the Jennifer's in a situation like this to refer a lot of blaming you for this I'm just kind of wondering what your take on it to refer to President Trump\nAs a demagogue I mean she is the duly elected president of the United states of America he won the electoral college and when you call him a demagogue\nYou call all the people who looked at him supporters enablers of a demagogue at a time when something like this happens but it's got to make it harder to have the kind of debate we need to have about ... about refining the civil discourse\nSure it's an accurate term\nJoining the civil discourse\nSure it's an accurate term\nSo um if you look it up in the Oxford English dictionary ... you'll see that the first I finished end of a demagogue is positive for neutral it says that it's a leader of the people which is that the etymology of the word\nWho defend the rights of the people against the other parts of the state the second definition of demagogue is a leader who uses polarizing propaganda for their own personal gain\nDonald Trump is a demagogue in both senses of the word\nFor his fans for his followers and his voters the ones who won't leave him who will defend him at all costs they defend him because they see him as a heroic demagogue they see him as defending their rights against the other parts of the state that they believe are corrupt\nEveryone else who sees him as a demagogue into bad sense of the word to use him as using polarizing propaganda for his own gain\nFor the use of the word to use the word accurate though it may be is it\nHelpful\nI think so [laughter] it's an analytic point we can't understand what Donald Trump is doing if we can't understand what he's doing an unaccountable leader is a danger in any political community but it's actually in a democracy\nPolitical scientist and historians who are concerned about the health as American democracy people who are charting democratic erosion and how democracies die they point to the kind of language that he uses they point to the authoritarian tendencies of I'm wanting to uh\nYou know jail people or change the constitution to all of these things all of these authoritarian tendencies and which are are grounded in his language frankly I'm as as evidence of democratic erosion\nHeidi I Wonder if you could respond to one of the concerns that I think are a number of people on the political right have raised which is this idea that the rhetoric is too hot all the way around but the political discourse\nHas heated up in both directions many on the rise of points the left saying that they use similar rhetoric to the rhetoric the President Trump has been using but they don't get cold out for quite as much here is a sample of some of what they're referring to\nIt is time for us as Democrats [noise] to me it's probably are dedicated his arms have you on the show always do and you don't when they go you know [noise] they go low we two\nThat you cannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that is why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back\nHouse and or the Senate that twin civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and respect strength\nBut of course was former secretary of state and democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton preceded by democratic California congresswoman Maxine Waters and first was former attorney general Eric Holder Heidi what about the portion is across the political spectrum how does that factor into into our car climate\nWell there's no question that there was of course no as well on the left but I think it's a little ridiculous to try to said sort of like Donald Trump did after Charlottesville but there's some sort of equivalent here\nSort of like Donald Trump did after Charlottesville that there's some sort of a quibbling scare the real nasty nets it's coming from the right and it's coming on the basis of attacks on immigrants\nMuslims global is which many people would argue are anti Semitic theories and there's something else more the violent is coming from the rights we don't have domestic terrorism that's out of control from left it that we used to be the
