A. M. U. dot org we heard from quite a few of you who shared your stories\nAbout exploring your tribal ancestry about what that means to you in the context of your life here's one voice mail that was left in our inbox\nHi Joshua this is Carol elaborately uh I found out about oh four or five years ago that we had a lot of documentation from my mother to uh that we were part of the Choctaw tribe in Oklahoma we applied to be a member of the ... tribe we were accepted\nAnd it's been a real joy to be a member 'cause we um we can vote now we get all kinds of information from them what they're doing with the tried just amazing\nCarol thanks very much for getting in touch with us more ... can you give us a sense of of what the process is for becoming an acknowledged tribal citizen understanding that every tribe has the right to set its own process and they can be be quite different but ... broadly speaking what what does it take\nYou usually a tribe has an enrollment committee of some kind that actually goes through and sets out the process required proving family connections to Simon said are looking for I'm basically I'm a history of involvement with the tribe that goes back I'm a retired\nI mean one of the I think really important ideas and this is that I'm a tribal community is one that's been around\nIn many cases for tens of thousands of years and so this idea of a long arc and being part of that is I think really important ... one of the things I Love to think about is shown is was hundred bastard on\nHunted massive on\nHow to best it I think about that long arc\nYeah I it's I Can't imagine Simon the benefit of just kind of knowing that you're part of a community that goes back millennia you talked about appropriation by whites\nLinear you talked about appropriation by whites of tribal culture are there other kinds of benefits that you find whether their intrinsic or extra benefits of being an acknowledge member of a tribe that are worth\nProtecting that are worth keeping in their proper places I mean Carol talks about being able to vote in the tribe and also just knowing what the tribe is doing what are the kind of benefits are there to being an acknowledge citizen of a truck\nWell I think what you kind of hit it right there with that that word protection I think that's for us it is we are it isn't coming upon us to protect our our our children are native languages are traditions are land\nThe water and the problem I see what these people that are doing these DNA test is booming biotechnology business where people want to know if they're native\nYou know they they the problem is some of them take our culture and they can modify it\nThey take our language and they can modify it they take our spirituality and can modify it and they make money\nThey make money off of something that they just either learn they are or it's been a part of the family lore or they speak with some smuggling titled meant\nLike they've lived the life of a native like somebody's ever called them an engine or a our word the name of the Washington football team and that's where it becomes problematic and we have to check these allies out the door even if it's Elizabeth Warren\nI should note by the way it was almost exactly a year ago today\nThat we did a discussion about the use DNA testing kids the ones that say find out your ancestry and learn what your family's from we did a program today's October seventeenth we did it on October Eighteenth of last year called ... where do we come from where we spoke to a geneticist\nI mean Adam Rutherford who's gone into some of the latest research about what DNA can and cannot tell us about ourselves and what you actually need to know if you were going to do one of these home DNA test\nYou'll find that conversation with Adam Rutherford on our website the one a dot org that's the word the the number one to let her a dot org\nBrittany tweeted I Am a county and kick Hanukkah or mohawk and I'm frustrated with people claiming native as a race and doing nothing to help native issues or thinking that they're uninformed opinion on native issues is helpful\nYou a progressive tweeted what we're not talking about now is North Dakota voter disenfranchisement please focus on this\nYou would progressive she must have known why we both Kerry living 'cause we were going there next because over the past few days there's been this story about Senator Warren but Kerry we wanted to invite you on specifically to talk about what you would progress has brought up there's a lot of focus on what's happening in North Dakota what is going on there\nNorth Dakota has a voter identification law that has been stayed by the courts until now last week the Supreme Court at decided to essentially let it go into effect\nFor the November election so what that means his new voter id requirements are going into force a month before the election\nAs you may know North Dakota is home to a very critical Senate race the race between\nUs and our Heidi Heitkamp who's one of the most endangered Democrats and the Senate and us wrapped Kevin Cramer her Republican challenger\nPolicies have Kramer ahead in twenty twelve set in the high camp one her race by fewer than three thousand votes with a very strong support from Native American voter is she had a very strong support from three counties in North Dakota that that are majority Native American and so they slit her id law\nCould potentially saw heavily upon Native Americans quite had stayed at because they said that that north Native Americans\nAmericans courts had stayed at because they said that that north Native Americans in North Dakota we're less likely to have the types of ID that were required the types of supplemental documentation that was required to get the idea and the first place\nAnd what kinds of ID are we talking about like what does the law requires\nThe central issue here is that the law requires an ID that carries a residential street address that's an issue because on many reservations that most people don't have that they have PO box as they have mailing address it and those addresses are no longer sufficient\nSo if you have ID but it carries a mailing address like a post office box you can no longer use it to vote in North Dakota and the selection you could in the primary when this law was said by the court but that idea used in the primary is no longer good for the general\nElection a lot of these voter ID laws that have come up in the last few years have been justified by her supporters as an effort to root out voter fraud has that been the argument among the supporters of North Dakota as well\nAnd that's essentially correct It's been\nUm talked about it as a measure to prevent voter fraud and also because the the state has argued that a mailing address\nDoesn't necessarily locate a voter in the correct precinct if you have a local race on the ballot someone could use a mailing address and and even added vertically vote in the wrong local district in the wrong local race so it's it's also a vote or die Lucian argument that that inappropriately cast a ballot and the wrong precinct would would\nDilute the ones that were correctly cast if your mailing address it somewhere different than what you actually reside\nWould love to hear from some of you if you live in areas where this kind of voter id law affects you particularly if you are part of a tribal population there reservation maybe you live in an area where folks predominantly have fuel boxes as their primary mailing address rather than a physical street residential address\nWhat are you seeing and how is this affecting you whether you're in North Dakota or elsewhere love to hear from you if you're in North Dakota but email is one a ... W. A. M. U. dot org tweet us ... won a or comment on our Facebook page\nTerry what did you hear from people in North Dakota about how this laws affecting them if it's on people's radar is this kind of more of a a a smaller issue\nI'd say it is and also you have to put it against the larger contact\nOr you see it as it is a big issue or does it smell\nOh I think it's really on people's radar absolutely an issue and I also think there's some context around it when I was reporting from North Dakota from the Standing Rock reservation which is in North and South Dakota but the north Dakota part is affected by this\nI'm a you know it's really one of the things that I was interested in one of the reasons I went there even before the Supreme Court ruling is because voter turnout there is the lowest in the state\n... it was the lowest in the state before this and that's because there are challenges that people their face and getting to the polls so I I think you have this law now becoming a new complication for this election that has the potential to drive turnout even lower and you have people reacting to that their their\nAdditional sponsorship comes from the community foundation of Tampa Bay this is doubled us\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from Subaru featuring the all new three row was sent with eating for up to eight and a choice of secondary captain's chairs love and so it makes us Subaru Subaru learn more it Subaru dot com\nFrom fidelity investments taking a personalized approach to helping clients grow preserve and manage their wealth learn more fidelity dot com slash wealth fidelity brokerage services Al Al ... and from Americans for the arts\nTomorrow we'll continue our conversation about the mid term elections with the national look at major races and issues we booked a great panel but we could use your help to focus the discussion what are your main questions and your main concerns about the midterms candidates polls voter turnout controversies or anything else\nLeave us a voice mail eight five five to three six one a one day which we talk about tomorrow when we talk about the midterms on a national level it's eight five five to three six one two one two\nYou can also send us a radio quality audio file through our app won a vox pop you can download the app that's V.

I I have no context for dealing with tribal populations in politics and you said there is quite an array of diversity among the tribes that would that you would be representing\nIn Congress can you give folks just a sense of what it's like to try to represent the issues of all those different groups do you find that there is a handful of issues the kind of overlap every one or do you really have to be sensitive to what this tribe is asking for versus what that tribe is asking for and and we're the differences are\nSure I mean I think they're some of that ...\n... absolutely there's there you know they'll they'll be some competing issues along the way but but really I'm land water or our environment is all I mean that's sort of a\n... those are issues that transcend um you know tribal lines so to speak to issues that that all of us are concerned about and so um so I I'm I'm a lifelong environmentalist and you know I I'm a I'm somebody who used to go down to the\nTo the failed with my grandfather and weeds and pick worms off of corn\nUm so I Know I understand the value of clean water and clean land to our people and I think that is that's an issue that\nTranscends a lot of tribes across the country um but you know the issues you were talking about earlier with voting that that is that's definitely an issue that all of us care about as well because we deserve a to have a voice set the table that's something I've been fighting for for\nA long time I've I've been getting out the vote in Indian communities for nearly Twenty years because I've always felt that we should have a say in who are elected officials are so\nUm so that's a passion of mine as well\nAnd and I want to work to make sure that that our voices are always heard in that respect\nI don't want to keep you too much longer but I Do wonder what you make of this larger surge of Native American candidates this year ... what do you think is behind that\nWell of course I mean it's a you know it's hard to say exactly but I mean there we can because we've had you know we've had a advocates and and you know we've had protest for centuries there and wait we've always been on the ground\nWe've had protest for centuries there I mean we we've always been on the ground are fighting for I'm fighting for something\nThat we feel we deserve and and that's been true whether it's fishing whites water rights land rights um those have always you know been hallmarks of our of of protests throughout throughout our country's history for Native Americans um this time around gosh it could be a number of things that could be", "show_name": "Here and Now (PRI)", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "17"}
