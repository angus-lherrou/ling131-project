seven educational film we heard earlier\nLife today is too complex people are too dependent upon each other jobs are too highly specialized for us to do business by butter and that's why we depend on money as a quick and easy medium of extreme\nOnly problem is says now we're no matter what we learned in school the anthropological record offers no evidence of simple barter anywhere in history\nYeah so the barter story is uh\nWe're in history yeah so\nThe barter story is a an origin story for money that you know has a a very long history Aristotle actually use that story to try to understand himself where money came from and what the kind of good and bad functions of money could be\nAnd in the nineteenth century as economics was becoming professionalized economists picked up this barter origin story for money and kind of set it forth into the world\nUm the thing is that we just don't see that situation ever happening if\nYou go to a New Guinea village and the highlands and see people exchanging shells for pigs you might think a ha there it is\nThis is for instance you attack a plated string decorated with calories and other precious object which was used by the Danny people in New

being exchanged and I always think of you know Charlotte's Web\nIn this context some\n\nSome pig it's some tickets a special pig that indicates a relationship between families it's not just a commodity that's value can be set by the price mechanism the way that the barter story assumes\nSo how did this barter mythology becomes so nearly universal why is this news to me\nVery often origin stories are serving contemporary interests so if we want to believe that the market as it exists today and that money as it exists today is natural normal inevitable\nThan something like the barter origin story helps us justify it continued existence helps disabled look you know this is a rational response to the problem with a double coincidence of bonds which is what economists call that problem when you know I've got fish and you've got apples and you don't want my fish and I don't want your apple so it's great to justify current conditions\nBut when you start kind of cracking it open and starts that appealing back the layers and realizing that\nThat's not really how it happened in that how it happened was you know actually a lot more interesting in a lot more complicated and involved things like record keeping accounting systems of measure uh states and early state control and shaping of markets and so forth well then you're in a whole other realm\nThe real story is told

and I'm going to give some to you after a period of time and you're raising goats and you're going to give some to me after a period of time we both have the built in sees analogy of those plants and
