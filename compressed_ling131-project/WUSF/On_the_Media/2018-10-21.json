that kind of enlightened reformed progressive society you know regardless of which came which monarch happens to be in power at the time they're always just aspiring towards something but just never quite seemed to get there\nThat is coming up this evening starting at eight o'clock you're on the USS eighty nine point seven\nThis is on the media I'm Brooke Gladstone over the past decade Elizabeth Warren has become a progressive I can\nPerhaps the most powerful voice among the progressive right now I'd love to live with one of my friends I Love her to be anything I Want to be a female those\nBoston but the senator who struggled with them personal issues since she first ran for office in two thousand twelve\nWhich is where I Want to start with questions about your Native American heritage music knowledge that you listen to yourself as a minority in a faculty or directory in Nineteen eighty six you continue to list yourself a in those direct reasons so Nineteen Ninety five [noise]\nDo you consider yourself a minority and if\nNot I have to answer this question many many times and it starts with the fact that from the day I was born up until the day my mother died she told me about who I Am who we are from my brothers are my family\nJust picking up a box personal family lore small set of data points and yeah the ones on which warns opponents most notably President Trump announced\nShe started because they're cheekbones were ... she was in India that she was Native American in July he escalated I won't give you a million dollars for your favorite charity paid for by trouble if you take the test or does your does your there\nThis week Warren responded by way above five and a half minutes pre campaign video in it and she speaks with Carlos Bustamante a Stanford genetics professor who examine to DNA\nAnd the hunger genome we did find five segments of Native American ancestry with very high confidence that we haven't made America the instructor and your credit card\nThe response was probably not what Warren had anticipated\nShe came out and thought she scored at first yeah and so to the media and it's sort of the men and Donald Trump pay off the million dollar bet and then all of a sudden now she is at war with the Cherokee Nation saying that are used to the DNA test is inappropriate and coke undermining tribal interests\nBoth the right and the left appropriate and accusations that she's not native enough that she is reinforcing biological essential Islam that she's falling for a Trump trapped before the midterms\nThat she's trying to claim native identity without ever defending native issues that she allowed a university to use her to bolster its diversity Barnum\nUniversity to use her to bolster its diversity bottom sides a political miscalculation but also a little into controversies that extends far beyond politics\nThere's a running joke in Indian country where people say oh yeah some other person told me that they have a Cherokee great grandmother a Cherokee princess than their lineage and so when we're out in the world and we meet people and they say oh you're native oh my great grandmother was Cherokee our first response was to try not to roll our eyes\nKim tall ... professor of native studies at the University of Alberta and author of Native American DNA tribal belonging and the false promise some genetic science\nThis story for us has a much longer time line that I think many Americans understand\nElizabeth Warren's appropriation of native identity despite her disclaimer it's I don't mean to sound cliche\nBut everything that's taken from indigenous people will be an actual lands and resources or be it you know an image that can be marketed and used for a football team or taking claims to ancestry and making those part of the identity that one is a spouse into the world\nOur understandings of kinship and family and tribe or not govern so strongly by the idea of having distance unnamed ancestry\nWe have a much stronger sense of what it is to be Native American that is governed by our family relationships by lived social relations that matters to us\nWe now in the fifties Watson and Crick discovered the double helix structure of DNA\nAnd ever since talk of blood and lineage chance fate\nHave given way to conversations about mitochondrial DNA and all the rest\nAt the same time there are old metaphors that persist you can still be related either by blood or by marriage so talk about how the contrast between scientific jargon and traditional blood talk\nPlays out in native culture I\nCaution people against equating blood with genes these are pretty different ideas when you weren't looking at tribal citizenship rules even if they talk about something like blood quantum\nThese are fractions on paper that point to very particular ancestors the ... to the turn of the twentieth century distributed hundred and sixty acre parcels of Windsor heads of households and of course only men and settler ideas a family at the time to be heads of household\nThey would get another eighty acres if they had a wife women become economically tied to men that's not how it was in many indigenous communities women were not economically tied to men\nAnd then the man gets another forty acres for each child but in order to manage those land allotments you had to have a register of Indians well tribes and first nations and other indigenous communities didn't necessarily have lists with names of their people in their ... these are fluid kinship groups right\nBut now we live with the legacy of those registers and that's how tribal enrollment as governor and what we care about is proving that you are descended from somebody on the base role that was constructed during that time\nAnd by the base Raleigh you're talking about families that were lifted at the end of the Eighteen hundreds yeah\nYou see on the back of my traveling rolling card that I Am one thirty second best one is sixteen this one quarter of this tribe those are all particular ancestors that they're pointing to that one quarter shy and around the whole blood quote unquote is my grandfather Randy tall there it's not as if blood the physiological substance is being examines\nWe're really talking about symbolic blood and were pointing to named people and so this is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some just\nThis is the problem with Elizabeth Warren taking a DNA test that's pointing to some distance probable unnamed ancestor that nobody knows who they were affiliated with or who they were for us it's who's your mom who's your grandmother who's your great grandfather who are your cousins or your aunt and uncle's\nYou say your daughter doesn't get to be a citizen of the tribe because of these blood quantum rules\nSo in my tribe the system ... they will enroll you if you are descended from somebody on the base role but in my tribe in addition they have a requirement that you must meet a total one quarter Indian blood quotient\nThey will accept the blood there's always scare quotes around that word from multiple tribes so even though I don't have one quarter quote unquote Dakota blood I have shining a rabbit hole blood\nThat's where you begin to see the racial inflection I think\nSo my daughter if you were to calculate all her ancestors because I'm supposedly Thirteen thirty seconds Native American my daughter would be one half of that because her father's non native\nNow if my tribe decides to move to a one eight total Indian blood rule instead of one quarter my daughter and her a couple of cousins who can't get enrolled will be able to get enrolled and we debate this every year we've got you know debates and conversations on our reservation should we go from one quarter total Indian blood down on it\nAnd I think eventually we will you do see tribes across the country moving away from a blood quantum standards more towards winning will defend rules to try to make our roads more inclusive but that's up to us to debate we don't need the rest of Americans telling us what we should do and how colonized we are by race everybody's colonized by race\nTribal governments and tribal communities are doing the best we can to try to tweak those rules to include our traditional notions of kinship but within a structure that has been deeply shaped by colonial power word severe power imbalance with the U.S federal government\nDo you think that Warren was basically played by Trump drawn into this because it doesn't seem that she got any kind of educational or financial advantage by her association with the Cherokee and it may have been part of her family lore\nDo you think that she just got played into a discussion of race and and blood then the women and this is something much she got some set in the New Yorker you know all the things that Trump loves to talk about in order to defend herself against his ... you know\nI don't think he has the intellectual ability to play somebody who is as intelligent as Elizabeth Warren move I mean really I [laughter] she has for her entire life like many people in Oklahoma and the south and in the east of the U.S [noise]\nLived with this mess of an Indian and her family tree and I and that's really important to those people she's probably really invested in defending her family's story I've seen people break down crying when they find out that they don't have a Native American ancestry this is a cherished idea for a lot of non Native Americans\nBut you're saying it's really relevant even if they did\nBut but for for non native people who have a subtler colonial idea of kinship ancestry and family finding that genetic proof is important to them why do you think they do it\nI think they're very much influenced by that one drop rule that it's so prominent in racial discourse in the United states\nI have one drop back there somewhere therefore I can make a claim that it's very racial lines thinking and again native people in the U. S. are not completely exempt from that we struggle with that because it's imposed on us\nAlondra thank you very much to pleasure to speak with uber Alondra Nelson is president of the social science Research Council professor of sociology at Columbia University and author of the social life of\nDNA race reparations and reconciliation after the [noise]\n\nApplication of genetic research and another kind of controversy twins disease on me [noise] on the\nMedia is supported by target preventing future at heart a pod cast on change makers and the projects their championing and communities nationwide future at heart\nAvailable on apple pie casts or wherever pond caster found\nWhat are you watching a movie night a compelling documentary people empower them no ideal\nFor my rear of the Russian or Hollywood hit you think that's what I did your breath\nWhatever's on your watch with join us for our backstage pass with some of the biggest films at the box office weekends on all things considered from NPR News with\nUs for all things considered coming up at five o'clock Tampa Bay area writing project provides teacher led professional development for writing teachers TPA W peas annual conference will be held at USF cabinet member third information is a PBA W.

that\nBecause being a twin is a very important part of one's identity ones knowledge of one's medical history and I can tell you that having worked with hundreds of pairs of twins raised apart\nJust

he returned to earth the vast majority of his genetic material to return to the way it was initially see this is a fascinating finding because white identical twins differ in the expression of some traits that we need to find out I think it'll fascinate your listeners to know that if you take diseases like schizophrenia\nOr multiple sclerosis or diabetes you'd expect that the correlation should be about one they have the same genes but it's close to the forty fifty percent something has to trigger the expression in one and keep it quiet and the other end identical twins where it apart or identical twins who difference I'm white\nAnd help us find these environmental effects that might help us control and managed disease\n[noise] you've profiled other twins that have been shaped by extreme events could you tell us about the subject of your book accidental brothers\nAccidental brothers follows the life history as of two sets identical male twins\nWho are born a day apart in Columbia South America in Nineteen eighty eight one pair of identical twins was born in Bogota the capital city and the other born in a small remote town a hundred and fifty miles to the north\nBut one of the little babies up in the north needed immediate care at a good hospital so his grandmother brought him down to Bogota\nAt the same hospital as he got the twins were born\nAnd somehow an amazing twist of fate got exchange with one of the other twins so the wrong baby was brought back to the small town a week later\nSo they were essentially raised as two sets of fraternal twins when in fact they were unrelated and they didn't know this until they were twenty five when the brothers up north moved to Bogota\nAnd somebody confused a twin and one pair for twin and the other I went to Bogota two times to study them and they are wonderful guys\nAnd there were similarities in many personality traits between the real identical twins despite their separate rearing but you could see that the effects of the different environments had a role\nThe twins in the city had gone to high schools and colleges the twins up north didn't go past fifth grade but I have to say that living with them you could see the similarities really popping out and the medical histories are amazing\nThe one twin born in the city and raised in the city was basically symptom free as was his identical twin brother raised in the north\nThe other twin who was raised in the city was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his\nWho was not born there had a long list of medical complaints as did his twin brother up in the north so even the different environments and the different access to medical care did not make a difference in their medical histories and physical health which I find quite extraordinary\n[noise] so what does this tell you about nature versus nurture it was too small sample I Know\nBut yes but it's a very dramatic case and so we told me a couple of things\nIn terms of the abilities one could certainly see that not having access to education left an indelible stamp on those twins but I Will say that one of the twins who was raised in the small town who should have been raised in Bogota\nWent and got himself a GED high school diploma and is now finishing law school so we always had the drive he didn't have the opportunity but I have also become very appreciative of extreme environments and how they influence behavior I think that this was a very telling case and so many ways", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On the Media", "city": "Tampa", "day":
