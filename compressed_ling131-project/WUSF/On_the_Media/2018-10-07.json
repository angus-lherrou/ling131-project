long rumble again consequences for hurting women that the me too movement strives to apply when we spoke with slate staff writer lily Luther\nLast November she explained several of the logical fallacies used by the culture to excuse or ignore bad behavior we called on her again\nTo identify the new fallacies she's seen lately like the anti bandwagon fallacy\nTo anti bandwagon fallacy it's something I kind of made up to explain that tendency that I've noticed where a new items trees content actually diminishes for people as more accusations emerged we saw for instance with Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nI've never seen so many were print\nCases in my life especially\nYeah so the question is if there was something ... going on what their hypnosis a conspiracy\nYeah more emerged a lot of people I think on the right interpreted that could be a bandwagon that invalidated the initial accusation something else that I heard recently is that ... effect or technique which is the way that a lot of people who are accused respond\n... stands for deny attack and reverse the victim and the fender\nDonald Trump has really excelled at finding a way to carrying every accusation against him into an occasion for his victimization and by extension the victimization of those who associate themselves with him\nWe certainly see Brett Kavanaugh doing something similar we find male anger I think very disorienting because men are told to repress and so when we see somebody in a very high stakes situation and loading powerfully that tends to us just scan as an index of authenticity\nIn front of a nation we saw his righteous indignation your show by\nHis tears and fury not a doctor for rubber on this on for\nConfirmation process which frankly is an embarrassed\nAnd I saw in the aftermath of the hearing a surprising number of pundits describing both his testimony in her it's as equally credible which\nI found it's done is sharing\nIt was a pretty vanilla vision\nHe basically said we have to get along with white people you have to work hard you can't cheat or steal or drink\nIf we do all these things for them we will be reunited with our loved ones in our ancestors and the after world it was almost Protestant and it's and it's insistence on a kind of work ethic as it spreading crew and other tribes interpreted differently\nSome people thought if they did the dancers in the right way and for the red shirts and did all the right things that they would be among the chosen and the saved and everyone else would be wiped away in a in a massive flood or or some kind of catastrophe\nMeaning all the white people meeting all white people and all the native people who didn't do this stuff so that goes dance what's a religion that was growing around at the Pine Ridge agency\nAnd there was a troop buildup out of fear that this religion would lead once again to open armed conflict with the government\nIt was never going to go there but the increased presence of troops put people on edge around the same time sitting bull was murdered when they tried to apprehend him that scared most of the ... native folk at Pine Ridge and so everyone was kind of running for cover\nA contingent of the reconstituted seventh cavalry stopped spotted outspent too as well as some other allied bands and surrounded them\nThe next day they moved to disarm them\nIt's not really known what caused the shooting in the first place but almost immediately the government open fire with ... cannons on largely an armed men women and children\n[noise] the descriptions of the massacre are horrifying you quoted a reporter from the Deadwood South Dakota times who wrote why should we stay or even a semblance of an Indian\nAnd then you have an el Frank bomb author of the wonderful wizard of Oz writing for the south Dakota Saturday pioneer she said\nHaving wronged them for centuries we had better in order to protect our civilization follow it up with one more wrong and white these on pained and came up all creatures from the face of the earth\nBy virtue of being wrong to run our threat\nAlmost immediately after the massacre it came to contain and symbolize all of the proceedings four hundred years of interactions between calling us an indigenous people in the new world this was basically the end and it stood in for everything had to come before\n[noise] now what most Americans know about the massacre they learn from Barry my heart at wounded knee and the HBO film adaptation in two thousand seven how about the importance of this book\n... yet deep around Nineteen Seventy classic break my heart when to me is the most\nNineteen Seventy classic break my heart when to me is the most widely read a book about American indian history ever published and Seventeen languages never out of print it sold over for a million copies I read that book when I was in college\nI was thrilled to be introduced to a book about me and and the very first pages the book he says something like this book is about the Indians planes wars from Eighteen fifty to Eighteen Ninety\nI start at the beginning of the wars in the end of the massacre when Geneva where the culture and civilization of the American Indian was finally destroyed if you ever happened to travel through the modern Indian reservation and you notice the poverty and the hopelessness and the squalor I felt by reading my book you'll understand why\nI I Can't tell you sort of how frustrating and how humiliating it was to be praised and and held up on one hand and then silenced and done away with on the other\nOne reason why you found dairy my heart at wounded knee Dudley dismaying you put it is because your reservation leech lake reservation in northern Minnesota wasn't nowhere place when nothing happened and good ideas when to die\nIt took a great amount of effort to try and see myself the place I was from and my my people as more than simply a collection of eternal suffers you know American Indians are once great people's with a great future behind them\nThat's it I was in search of a different story not just different facts not just a story of hope to stamp on the other side of the coin of despair I thought that the brown despite his passion on the behalf of native people which I appreciate\nMissed the point when did me was a low point we had withstood constant assault and our sovereignty our cultures on our religion on our families so by Eighteen Ninety we were very low but we were not done\nAnd since that point we've been doing so many amazing things with such energy and intelligence to live fully realize and satisfying lives on our own terms\nToni Morrison once said that if there's a book you want to read and it doesn't exist for then you you have to write it and that's exactly what I've tried to do\nThe occupation of Alcatraz that was the year before the browns books came out described what happened there\nYeah Alcatraz suddenly thrust Indians into the national spotlight the declared at Indian land and they camped out there and they had a bunch of demands they hoped would be met and they really weren't met\nWe wish to be fair a novel in our dealings with the Caucasian and having this this land nearby off the following treated real purchase a health Rhode Island for twenty four dollars and glass beads and red cloth precedent set by the white man's purchase of a similar out and about three hundred years ago\nI think it was kind of tune from the start there was a lot of chaos that occurred on Alcatraz and that kind of tolerance for dissent for drama and even violence came along with subsequent activists movements in the seventies\n'cause we got down there the whole the whole court was covered with the FBI agents arrived they all had rifle shotgun and and they and they search\nI don't think it was meant to achieve a direct and but to raise the consciousness of most Americans to not only our plight but our continued existence and also direct people's attention toward the responsibility of the government toward the first people of this country and it did definitely do that\nSeventy two you were a baby when a few hundred Indians led a caravan to Washington dubbed the trail of broken\nPower than to Washington dubbed the trail of broken treaties\nSecure than was the brainchild of both the American Indian movement and tribal leaders from places like Standing Rock my own personal view is that\nThe takeover of the bureau of Indian affairs which in food was in many ways skewed by the kind of unhealthy self promotion of people like Russell Means who was a Lakota activist who is one of the founders of aim and who thought a great deal of himself\nWasn't really an effort to get a meeting with President Nixon\nYes I mean they hammered out sort of a a bill of rights if you will that they were going to present the government\nThey one of the bureau of Indian affairs to be revamped from top to bottom because it had been dismal job it was paternalistic and it was short sighted and\nIt lost billions of dollars of native money that it was holding and trust that were the result of grazing and timber in mineral lease says among other things the government still hadn't talked to the fact that it was ignoring it's basic treaty obligations and this takeover supposed to draw attention to it\nBut then the people who are in the trash the place and did something like six million dollars of damage to the building itself\nAnd the whole occupation ended when these sort of dark agents of government like Frank Carlo chi one of Nixon's guys Batman even then\nAgreed to pay them something like sixty six thousand dollars to get them to leave which they took none of at sixty six thousand dollars or it's not that I can tell made its way into the rank and file and the very poor Indians who put themselves on the line to joined that care of in\n[noise] and then there was another dramatic act of protest and this time it was that the symbol of Indian suffering in in ...\nThat's right in Seventy three there is the takeover in the siege of wounded knee\nI Believe that the current is that we have the virus in order to be heard [noise]\nI don't want to see him when he killed [noise] violence might happen to be committed [noise] there'd\nBeen a number of very high profile murders of native people in in the years leading up to Nineteen Seventy three in and around the Pine Ridge\nAnd another place in South Dakota Custer South Dakota to speak of another symbolic place mhm and people were were frustrated with tribal government the federal government they felt that there was no justice because he's white guys who were murdering Indians were getting charged with things like second degree manslaughter or\nMisdemeanors at best it was it was truly truly awful\nAnd so for Seventy one days in Nineteen Seventy three wounded knee was under siege [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nAre\nYou say you had a very complicated feelings about it\nI did aim activists showed up at Pine Ridge at the behest of a lot of community members to help them solve this rash of murders of native people the troubled government at Pine Ridge was very against the stick Wilson the German the Pine Ridge was interested in mostly in staying in power\nAnd he was working closely with the federal and state government to sort of bringing more and more law enforcement so there's again another military build up everything kind of boiled over and aim activists took over there weren't any trading posts and subsequently took over the entire village of wounded knee at first holding village residents some of whom we are not native hostage\nBut also a surplus of grit and ability and intelligence and creativity to overcome them and to do better so in my mind\nIt's a story of surplus [noise]\nThat's the story I Want to tell [noise] David thank you so much\nThank you so much I'm really kicking out to be on the show\nDavid

Gladstone indigenous people stay on Monday we'll pay homage to all over his ancestors and homelands were trampled with colonial disregard\nThe question of who should claims solidarity with this minority seems straightforward enough but perhaps not because of Germany's a racist far right party alternative for Germany claims kinship with the plight of Native Americans\nGerman historian Frank who's back was dumbfounded when he first came across in imagery and an alternative for Germany NewME biking to pass and fortunately I found it\nHilarious at first it was in a tweet by one of the local branches of ... the alternative for Germany\nTheir tweet showed the photograph of who didn't bowl it said the Indians couldn't stop immigration and now they live on reservations\nAnd that's what is going to happen to us here in Germany if we are not careful\nAnd it's not even unique to Germany in two thousand six and that was used in an election campaign in Switzerland and ever since then\nYou find it in the argumentation an election campaigns of many European right wing party Austria Switzerland Italy Germany\nHungary you find similar arguments in Great Britain and other countries as well\nIt appears that these extreme parties are trying to appeal to Germany's profound fascination with the American front and there's even a term for this phenomenon Indian food the ...\nAnd you say that India and the things he adds them and German nationalism actually share similar routes\nGo hand in hand at around Eighteen hundreds the Germany's were deeply affected by the Napoleonic Wars all these German many states were either\nUnder military occupation or had been forced to become allies of Napoleon so nationalist try to look for a unifying feature something of a creation myth [noise]\nThe French have joann of art the British have king Arthur so these early nationalist went all the way back to the Germanic tribes and their resistance against the encroaching Roman Empire\nInteresting thing is that catheters wonder if the very few sources do cry these tribes as on a loyal her rule week fears and criticized his own society as they could end and over civilized\nIf we go back to the late Eighteen ... early Nineteen century French philosopher Jones who are so used very similar attributes defining Native Americans as noble savages\nFinding Native Americans as noble savages\nThe Germans felt that their temperament was akin to that of the noble Savage\nExactly entered around notions off ... freedom being attuned to nature the forest was sacred homeland\nWhich throughout the nineteenth century became a root off a blood and soil ideology\nAnd around the lake nineteenth century that was a writer who seemed to wrap this all up and I'm guessing if you asked the average German on the street why do Germans love American Indians he or she would probably respond with the name of that writer\nLabs right so everything seems to lead to Carla ... and his famous\nCouple of characters that German immigrant and adventure old cheddar hand and his Apache friend printed who\nIs the farthest west he actually got was the Niagara falls [laughter] way after he wrote his novels in the early Eighteen nineties\nHe claims that he based old shot her hand on himself so named because he could not this fall is out with one explosive punch exactly Apache teeth and then to see him to be little really popular factor among the German public right\nYes he is an ... an incredible Native American chief because he never hangs out with his own people [laughter] he's always out there by himself looking for white people you can help\nAnd Carl my made him ... enough to fit into the frame of the adventure\nBut as some scholars described it to you and it also seems to be a very good German [laughter] because he has character trait that their German bourgeoisie or supposed to strive towards like on the bravery industry is ...\nThese novels had a very long life what's Hitler\nYet it is that that late in the war when there was hardly any paper left Hitler allocated enough paper to distribute a hundred thousand vena two novels to the

there were those people who said German children should only be confronted with area and she rose\nHowever Hitler was a fan and also fragments is that it would cost too much effort to try to suppress German Indian Suzie as them why not ... it's an profit from it [noise]\nPeople like you know how we take a novelist who wrote under the pseudonym ... said preventing Indian novel to German children
