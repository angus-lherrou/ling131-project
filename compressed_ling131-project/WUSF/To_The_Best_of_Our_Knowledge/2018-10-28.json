I mean there are stories of exercises and all of the dark with finances of\nGas just truly uncanny things that happen [noise] here's one [noise]\nI don't know if I Believe in goes but that's the story of\nThe ghost of William Joseph Bradley [noise]\nThis is your app march and she's talking about her father\nMy father died when he was eighty in Nineteen eighty three and it's about a father's ghost and how she appeared in the house they grow up in Michigan\n\nWe kept the house for the first year after my mother went to assisted living and then we sold it [noise]\nAnd in Nineteen Ninety no I'm Sorry would have been Nineteen Ninety five I took a walk down the street where I grew up and the man who had bought the house she remodeled it\nAsked me if I wanted to see it and I said yes so he introduced me to his wife and I went into the house and she was telling me about how they expanded it and she said your father's coast has been here and I looked at her like she was a little more [noise]\nWacko\nAnd she said they were remodeling the first part of the house and this decision or a man or figure appeared and she went running out of the house and to her husband said there's a man in the house and she described what she saw and the neighbor across the street was talking to her husband and he said sounds like Bill Bradley\n[noise]\nSeveral months later her husband was downstairs in the basement doing some electrical work and the same person or whatever there isn't a feared and she went running down the stairs to say he's back and found out her husband had electrocuted himself\n[noise]\nAnd she ran upstairs called nine eleven and they came and treated her husband or whatever it\nWas they do [noise]\nFeel that dad saved him [noise]\nSo when I got back to Michigan I found a picture of my father and his thirties a pitcher my father in his sixties and I sent those pictures to her and she wrote back\nAnd she said my coast is your father [noise]\n\nSo I Would say that you're at Marge is actually one of the more skeptical members of your family I Would say that's true yeah I mean I've heard Wilder stories so yeah I mean there are stories of exercises him after spirit possession\nOf bizarre coincidence is that your mom was it goes to my mom was a ghost hunter in Milwaukee for a while I I grew up with this stuff but here's the family straight arrow I've been around a lot of true believers and I am not what it is probably not an accent that I became a journalist and yet this stuff the uncanny the paranormal\nYou read about this stuff all the time why\nThere's serious questions intellectual questions about what is real without throwing your intellect out the window your rationality out the window\nWhere do you make of that store without just saying oh that is impossible you know there's just there's no way when it was interesting people I talked to was Michael Schober the poster\nWay when it was interesting people I talked to\nWas Michael sharper the poster boy of skepticism who's Michael shear me he is a scientist an atheist\nA regular columnist for Scientific American here the founding publisher of skeptic magazine and he's the guy you go to if you want to you know have someone throw cold water on these crazy terrible stories\nThe strange thing is he has his own story\nWell so my wife is from Michael in Germany she was raised by a single mom and her grandfather and her grandfather had this radio this little Philips transistor radio from Nineteen Seventy seven or so\n[noise]\nThey used to listen to music the meeting meeting her and when he\nDied she kept it and it stopped working you know long ago [noise]\n\nAnyway and when she we met and fell in love and so and she moved to Los Angeles to be with me she shipped her belongings out ahead of time including this radio\nAnd I tried to get a working for her because I knew was meaningful to her and I couldn't put their batteries in and checked the wires and slapped on the table firmly and all the things you're supposed to do to get electronic equipment to work and uh you know I couldn't and and so we gave up and I just tossed in the back of a drawer in the bedroom and I\nDidn't think about it for months and then you know in the day of our wedding\nJust at a particular moment when she was feeling rather sad that there was nobody there from her family and\nFriends a long way from home and we heard music playing in the back of the house when it was like what was that you know and I thought well I'm a slip my iPhone honor my laptop with a tunes or maybe the next door neighbors playing music and it was none of that and then we\nOpen the door beneath the fax machine and there's the radio this plane is blamed Islam so perfectly you know perfectly to a station for us particularly for my wife this was a very deeply emotional experience I mean it meant something\nTo her ... her symbolically anyway like the grandfather was there\nWith us than they ever wedding and make her feel good and it did [noise] they played\nThe rest of the day and night we fell asleep listening to music on the radio and they went there the next\nMorning and the debt ever sense even though I get it to work and and still won't work it's still there [noise]\nTo share my I think that was anything more than just a bizarre coincidence not really but it kind of shook him [laughter]\nIt was like whoa man ... fall down [laughter] call it's okay [laughter]\nUh yeah a little bit but but I also as insightful to me when I talked to other people that have had these experiences makes me more open to what they're talking about are more sympathetic like yeah I get it I totally understand the yeah I had something similar\nHe didn't have to write about this than I mean that's actually one of the things that I think is is great about what he did as this goes against his sort of ... of skepticism\nWhat does it mean I don't know you know I wrote about this in Scientific American just to say you know weird things happen you know my friends not real religious friends with people like the buck to Oprah that think that there's a you know it's sort of a quantum field that inner connects all of this and that quantum consciousness way\nHe thinks that's a sign you know okay maybe but you know again why are the effects so weak my wife said numerous experiences and last year and a half where she felt sad or it\nWas missing home and the radio didn't come on\nA ... but this was this was your wedding day well it was yeah I mean there was something a little unusual because I mean there is another I mean what some people who study mystical experiences say is that\nThe most profound experiences are often once in a lifetime I mean they're not replicable there there there's heightened emotion for whatever reason there's something extraordinary happens and they'll never happen again that\nThe motion for whatever reason there's something extraordinary happens and will never happen again\nThat possible end and it could be you know that science is limited in the sense that we really really need replicable lab tested or some kind of way of getting that the experience again and those kind of one off events don't fit that\nAnd it couldn't be they are real and we just are limited in how we can study them\n[noise] [noise]\nWell I don't think the times can I ask the question of what\nUltimately true about the supernatural the nature of the supernatural is is that it is beyond the natural I think science studies for natural okay so this is the Stanford anthropologists Tanya learning [noise] so I'm the kind of person that people come up to at cocktail parties\nAnd you know I haven't told anybody that's but my goodness I was in the hospital I find myself up in the corner to room looking down at my body [noise] people see things that other people don't see or couldn't see the here things with other people couldn't hear they\nAttempt on their mind leaving their body and within around\nMe these experience happened to people and in fact I think they are pretty common\nSo she has spent her career studying religion sort of trying to understand religious belief why do people have these beliefs and when she was a grad student in England\nShe was really interested in the pagan community practitioners of magic and she joined it so I have not politicians do you do what\nThe field that you come to study does no I'm In I ... I was part of groups of people who were conjuring up power I was I learned to read tarot cards I learned to a little bit about astrology a lot of that type of law and participated in these different groups as they met to\nCarry out their ritual metric did it become real for you or at least at times one of the things I could see\nWas that people experience the magic Israel\nAnd so I I put to this side the question of whether magical force really existed what I could see and what I came to experience is that if you spent time in this world and you did the kinds of things that people did to\nA psychic ability I have this odd ability to step in to other people um the living and begin to resemble them become them without having met them or seen them ended so I'm kind of like a human radio think that's the way to look at me and who argue channeling I have these guys that work with me they say that their teachers\nThey say that they're operating in a different level of consciousness and we're at a higher level of consciousness uh higher octave\nThere was a name that they use occasionally which I'm always a little uncomfortable with names because that seems to bring in\nIdeas of lineage and history that I mean so is that in other words you can distinguish between different gods they have different personalities elective I work with a collective but yeah there's personality that comes through certainly when I work but I don't really see them\nI mean for me the experiences very physical and very auditory I've seen a couple of them and meditation what are they look like the one that I've seen but I I'm I'm able to to distinguish clearly and I only saw him because I was hypnotized and somebody said we like to bring your guides through and\nI was quite surprised when somebody showed up and sat down he was\nYou know quite lovely to look that he was older he were a large hatch and it sort of went up up up and up and there was some sort of flat up the topic was sort of a little bit like you would imagine I suppose\nA Greek Orthodox priest would wear and he held to a sector which was very odd it was in Boston the the weathering was raised and it was higher ... and I didn't know what any of it meant the time\nAnd um he had blue eyes very blue eyes and a long beard and he had a Purple Rose of some kind of when you when you have that image I mean you do take that literally do you think this is what this guy I'd really like that's how he presented himself for me\nTo this all sounds kind of crazy and it can imagine maybe when you first started having these experiences that might have felt like too much but I mean did you ever feel like you were going crazy [noise]\nNo not really I didn't start off believing in any of his stuff I was raised an atheist you know and I wasn't I didn't have a great interest in the paranormal certainly see we're not you did not come out of a religious and not only not at all I grew up in the Upper West side of Manhattan and we sort of snicker to people who believed in things that was a convenient\nAgnostics as him I suppose when I was twenty five I was a year out of graduate school at Yale I'd had a list of things that I had achieved in the world but I thought would make me okay and I got the whole list and I wasn't okay that's really what happened and I began\nTo pray or to embark on what I now know was the beginning of a spiritual path and things\nNo it was the beginning of a spiritual path\nAnd things begin to happen as a result of that ... what started happening well the first thing was I heard a voice telling me to get my act together and I was so surprised that I heard that voice in when I hear a voice it's like a fog comes in and rounds out all of your other faults and it's not your fault it's the only way that I can explain that and I\nHad a bit of an experience and the experience may well had been hyperventilating I really I may never know what it was but it was an experience of energy moving through my body and out through the top of my head\nAnd then as a result of that I started seeing lights around people or maybe not as a result of that but shortly thereafter I sort of seeing these things these flashes started you know going off\nSo when you say the lights are on people with that was what did they look like wells fireflies\nSparks little blue lights over the top of the head so I ended up studying a form of energy healing as a way to get a context for this\n[laughter] I'm sure a lot of people who are listening to us right now are are deeply skeptical already might be thinking you know you're making it all up or even if you're not you're delusional you care about that kind of skepticism not\nIn the way that I used to I Can't you know I had a life as an academic for very long time I was on why you for twenty five years teaching creative writing like writing yeah I talked play running for very long time\nAnd you know initially I was very concerned about what people thought and I kept a very low profile with this but once the first book came out I had to begin to own it\nA bit more and that was a challenge to you're not you're not teaching creative writing and you know I'm not\n... I'm traveling around the world [noise] sitting in a chair closing my eyes and waiting for this transmission to come through in speaking what I'm hearing him and all of this energy comes in and fills the room and people who come are having an experience with it\nYou know I'm not a spiritual teacher I'm not ... I'm not a psychic who's gonna connect you with your dead relatives and I don't like doing predict of work\nBut if you're actually having problems in your relationship and you give me your spouse his name I can step into your spouse speaking to look like her and possibly hear what's going on at the dynamic and that's been proven out in the film when I'm channeling I'm really just operating as a radio\nSo I'm just sitting in the chair and letting the dial turn to the station that wants to come through and then being receptive to take the dictation\nSo play that out from ... explain that farm if you can when you say you're like a radio you know you got to sort of tune into the writing channel and then the guides we'll we'll speak through you see how does that work I mean ... where are you in where whereas pulse that like Dr ...\nI'm president but I'm receded a you sort of in an altered state of conscience and becoming a light traps it's light enough that I can interrupt and in ... and and and say hey wait a minute this doesn't make any sense which I've been known to do and the rule with all of the books is that they could they can't be edited so all of the books or the on edited transcripts of these sanctions\nThey really are you are and you're not going at you know sort of cleaning up the language here saying these books either they're not written by you it's written all your automatic writing and you know no no there's a book and these are oral teachings that are transcribed\nDo you think about the metaphysics of all of this okay what's the architecture of the universe that you are describing here\nI Do and I don't I think I only do when I'm sitting with somebody who asks those questions okay while you're sitting with one right now these are not going to access it myself because I actually don't know\nAnd I would have to recede and begin channeling on your show and I think it was already the way we started off as Congress station has so far out to begin with him and he's still listening I Am absolutely thrilled [laughter]\nYou know honestly when I first started doing this stuff\nYou know honestly when I first started doing this stuff I didn't want to record it I wasn't looking to be known for it that's for sure I was really hiding out I did a group at my part but the met for Eighteen years\nWith about ten people who would show but the most every week and we would sit in a circle and the guides would talk and they would bring this energy true and we don't feel it\nWhat are the guys say you were you've written you know multiple bucks an hour they have to review they are that is they're sort of a common message [noise] yeah\nI think that who we truly are is not what we think we are in Middle East and and I really talk about humanity being at a\nAt a transitional points that's evolution right now and the the opportunity to really is here for us to reclaim with what they would say is I think are true identity and how you identify yourself and your life\nIs primarily based on a lot of collective agreements what it means to be a man what whatever culture you were brought up in what it means to be a success with beauty is all of these things will be collectively ascribed\nGreat value to is really inherited information and it's actually in most cases operating at a cost\nThis is what they've said they've said that humanity is a time of reckoning in a reckoning is facing of oneself and all of the ones creations and what's been created in fear needs to be recreated in the higher way\nHas anything changed in your own life as a result of all this I mean obviously you what you're doing day to day you know the workshops that you give the toxic if that's different or not the university teacher anymore but in terms of I don't know how you think what your values are I think\nIt's all different it's all different I'm a lot less afraid when I was and I have to say that I was very frightened person ... much of my life\nAfraid of what things life yeah life you\nKnow I was a sensitive kid you know when I grow up wary consequently and I suppose in some ways maybe I still am\nYou know there's a quote from\nHelen shook them and the woman who was the channel for a course in miracles [noise]\nShe said I don't believe it but I Know it's true and I can get behind that I understand that I don't believe it either but I Know it's true what you mean you don't believe that you must believe it I don't I don't I Know that it's happening I don't know how it's happening I don't know how I Do what I Do I'm I'm very happy\nTo be able to be part of this but I'm Still challenged by the whole experience\nThat's Paul selling he's published five channel taxed Steve we started earlier talking about your family and all the stories of

of the execution of Saddam Hussein\nHe was hanged in two thousand six following his trial in Baghdad\nAn Adam Rogers from was an American soldier one of the super twelve assigned to guard Saddam Hussein during his trial he's where young men many just out of basic training spent months alone in close quarters\nWith a man the rest of the world reviled as the butcher at Baghdad they were there at the hanging\nAs you can hear Adam is still haunted by what happened oh\nWe'll Barton Webber was also serving in Iraq at the time\nHe was an airborne ranger and he remembers wondering what such young inexperienced soldiers were doing gardening such a high value prisoner and what effect that might have on Charles Monroe came talked with Adam Sandler will just come out with a book about the super twelve it's called the prisoner and the palace\n[noise]\nYou know when they went over there I think they were expecting to tend to do what soldiers expect to do which is [noise] get into combat situations and potentially engage with and and kill bad guys and that's why a lot of these guys joined to begin with\nSure a lot of these guys were hooked up during nine eleven right\nYeah exactly they a lot of them joined out of a sense of patriotism and\nAnd yeah so I think when they got this assignment they had a mixed response on the one hand um you know I think they were intrigued by the idea that they would be with Saddam Hussein but I think some of them were kinda bummed out that they weren't going to be outside the wire sort of mixing it up with the insurgents and that they'd be kind of stuck in in one place\nThat was a little surprised that these guys did no special training to offer some bunch of high level CIA guy\nThat these guys didn't have special training I for some bunch of high level CIA guy should be guarding Saddam Hussein but some kids the kids from like you know higher ... strange to me\nYeah no I mean they were in some cases not far removed\nFrom basic training about Eighteen yeah I mean it was it was remarkable they weren't special operators they weren't you know CIA clandestine service personnel I mean they were just a basic young soldiers um and then that combined with kind of the intimacy of their\nInteractions I think was what really struck me about how unusual this was they were not allowed to tell anyone right\nCorrect um I mean that's one of the things I think that made this mission particularly challenging was that you know here they were that in a few feet away from the most wanted\nYou know during the trial she accused some of the guards of torture it while they were there how did the guard should be starting relationship with this man how did they react to this feeble man they were taking care of now this defiant angry man accusing them of things that weren't true\nI mean there's a an account from one of the guards that he was on the same day he was in court wave in about how he had been mistreated by the Americans he got into the elevator to bring him back down into the subterranean cell where they were holding him and he laughed and he said hey don't worry about that that was basically just for the cameras\nAnd he laughed and he said hey don't worry about that that was basically just for the cameras and how you treat me either be great [noise]\n\nThe trial and we all know with an execution hanging could you tell me about that day what happened at the execution\nYou know I almost remember that day like it was yesterday it replays in my mind a lot [noise]\nI was a ship that night\nAnd we all knew that it was coming close [noise]\nYou know we broke his radio so he can an ear and uh [noise]\n\nWe got the call over the radio it was time to wake them up and\nWe did in the new [noise]\nSo I stood there and watch them get ready and\nFix his hair but his suit on his watch um [noise] he got dragged to the nines as best as he could [noise] once that was done I left him and then we all had the mentally prepare for what was about to go down and that was\nThat was pretty intense because we figured if someone is going to come get him or he was planning to escape he's going to do it now [noise] so that was that was a very intense time just cleaning your weapons and making sure everything was a point with her so [noise]\nYeah once we got there [noise]\nHe said goodbye to us so [noise] I mean [noise]\nNobody when what am I ... I'm Sorry what mhm what did he say to you you personally how did you say goodbye to you\nIt was very it was very sad once the commotion was over and we knew we were in somewhat of a safe zone no one was going to come and get him and\nHe sort of need to before he walked into the [noise] the deaths house in the [noise] he turned around and say goodbye [noise] just said that we were all his friend [noise]\nSome of us were crying and he was sad [noise] but just for that split second just feed him and I'm old shows state [noise] it was a it was crazy with Ben in firefights we've been through IDs [noise] but at that nothing can prepare you for\nThat type of situation [noise]\n[noise]\nAfter that immediately after\nThey work so hard to comport themselves in a professional dignified manner to treat him the way they were supposed to and then it kind of all went to hell and uh I mean execution itself\nKind of just resembled a disorganized sort of mob scene and then in the moments after the execution when Saddam's body was getting mistreated you know they were forced to essentially stand there and watch that\n[noise] I think that I was a [noise] I really didn't know what to do I I've never seen anything like that in my life you know it's just like wow that [noise]\nI mean it was a wild wild west to me like [noise] like I've only seen that the movies but to hear it all go down and it was [noise]\nIt was in ... I really wasn't [noise] I was more protected than I was sad because [noise]\nWhen you're asked to protect someone like that and no one's supposed to hurt him and you just have to drill down your brain and it's easy to influence or twenty two year old [noise] when you see a kicking and spit it out of his body [noise] I just I just had more respect\nIn the presence of death I guess [noise]\nBut in the presence of the I guess [noise]\nAnother one of the soldiers would speak very candidly about any number of insurgents that he had killed and he didn't have any real regret remorse about that [noise] but this experience I had a profound impact on him and so you have to step back and say okay well why was it that he was able to go from a distance and almost joke about it off handedly [noise]\nBut here we are with essentially the worst of\nOur enemies\nAnd playing a role in that particular death really hurt him in a troubled him [noise]\nOuch later reflected I feel like I have to explain why bother me so much for an American to be upset but for us to stand by and let them treat another human being that way I thought that's what we were over here to stop the treatment like that I truly\nFelt that I was just as guilty as anybody else [noise] I've never really had a conscious about anything I've ever done over here as far as humanity goes I've seen some pretty bad things [noise]\nBut my job I had never before said that I had to stand there and watch people have been on a person's body [noise] you know what I'm Glad I feel that way I really didn't feel that way I Would think something was wrong with me\nSo would you say that I mean I Want to use this word lightly but are are traumatized by what happened in Iraq\nOh absolutely a hundred a hundred percent um I live with the though those demons every day but don't get a twisted like he he was tried for his parents and that is the judgment that they came down with and I'm not saying that he didn't deserve it\nI'm saying that as a twenty two year old soldier maybe I wasn't ready for that\nI think ... low I wasn't the one who drop the four oh um sometimes I feel like I did\nOh\nAdam Rogers from was one of his soldiers in Iraq guarded Saddam Hussein will bargain weapons book about them is called the prisoner and the palace and Charles Monroe came talked with both of them oh\n\nHere's my question how can
