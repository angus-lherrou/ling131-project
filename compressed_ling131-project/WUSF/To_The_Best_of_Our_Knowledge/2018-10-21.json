Virginia where I grew up\nI was surprised too and actually I didn't know it until I was on our cemetery tours and one of my coworkers pointed this out and I said I'm Sorry who [laughter]\nThey're all over the mid west there are so family members and Michigan still time\nThey're all over the mid west there are so family members and Michigan self I'm In Ohio now this kind of progressive we moved to the middle and north of the United states just thinking\nAbout the history of this I mean if you have the son of Jefferson the guy who wrote the declaration of independence and then you have a child who grew up in slavery it's like these two rounds of American history come together right here in a cemetery\nRace it's interesting how little of it sort of know about your local history and how it all kind of intersect in various ways and it still affects us today from Jeffrey in it so famous right and he stands for so many things [noise] and I think you can avoid feeling the weight of that here\nUm Mm\nAaron Hogan is an education specialist with the Wisconsin veterans museum here in Madison\nOh\nTo by now pretty much everyone knows that Thomas Jefferson had a sexual relationship with his life\nSally Hemings and that they had children what Twenty years ago the Jefferson Hemings relationship was mostly a rumor that his white descendants denied and then a brilliant legal scholar Annette Gordon Reed proved it with historical records stories pattern down by Sally Hemings children\nEven DNA evidence law she became the first African American to win the Pulitzer Prize for history followed by a MacArthur genius award she tells the policy of this story is a perfect example of the way many Americans have tried to bury and deny the real history of slavery [noise]\nI think most people in the black community did not doubt it because\nWe understand that this kind of thing happened quite a bit and so it didn't seem like it was wild and crazy\nI Would say that most historians did not believe it was true and there were a variety of reasons there was sort of an old view well Jeffrey symbols to southern gentleman and this sort of he ... he wouldn't do this there was this sort of tree Klee treatment of southern life you know moonlight and magnolias and honor and all that kind of stuff\nYou can at least began to locate where people are and then research and find out about them\nSo the big question that people have been asking for decades is what do we make of Thomas Jefferson the\nRevered founding father who wrote the major part of the declaration of independence saying that all men are created equal you know the great document of freedom and equality who's not just a slave owner but ... have this intimate relationship with the slave woman for years and had children together I mean it\nWouldn't be well that kind of thing was a part of being a slave owner I mean the the real problem with Jefferson is the connection to slavery\nAnd we've always known that but I think what is happening now is people are understanding that slavery was not just about making people work for no money or whipping people or whatever it was an institution that ended up with mixed bloodlines and a lot of different ways to rape\nThrough connections that we don't understand and that make us uncomfortable I think one thing to make of it is a Jefferson was a person\nWe should take them down from the mountain those loose revered icon\nNo there are things to admire about Jefferson and we're just going to have to grapple with the fact that a person who wrote the declaration of independence and helped create the country not just Jeffrey symbol Washington and all of them the number of them were slave holders they help people in bondage\nAnd profited from that I think you'd have to take the bitter with the sweet and I don't know that it ever good to revere people\nAnd God in a way because they're always going to disappoint you I think a better way to look at it is to\nSay this is what these human beings did on their time on earth and some of it was good and some of them was bad and what can we live with and what things do we reject how do we move on from that Jefferson didn't think that we were going to stay in one place\nBut he had already mystic view of race relations didn't eat I mean he was he was racist and he thought\nBlack people were inferior we're not as smart\nAs one and that's what most people at that time thought and that's a lot of people think today there's no question about that even though he says I venture it as a suspicion only but not a suspicion he believed that whites were better than blacks that was the currency of the time\nI Do think he thought slavery was wrong but it's like many other things that we believe that we don't live by\nThis was not what really animated Jefferson I mean we're interested in slavery and race and we should be but that's not the main thing he was interested in he was interested in the United states of America he'd been part of a revolution that overthrew king and created a new society\nThat's what he was fixated on that slavery thing that'll solve itself but it's like many things in life you say if I could just fix this that little thing over there it'll be fine but it's that little thing over there that destroys the thing that you love yeah and slavery was he came to\nToys the thing that you love to end slavery was he came to see the walk upon which the union will be split and that was true yeah thank you very much this is just fascinating history Oh thank you for having me

sense\nThat there's something going on just beneath the surface of what we can perceive it it's really what people talk about I guess when they're talking about a a spiritual sense of reality that there is something of an accent and hard to grasp at and very often seems just beyond our reach\nBut there are times that our lives when we catch glimpses of it\nNow and UFOs then identified flying objects also come up on more than one occasion and why did you want you want to include so much us do content [noise]\nNumber one we had dealt with it in a in a very particular and specific way and the second season at the show was that was grounds for a number two it it becomes a kind of a stand in for this idea of the mysterious experience\nAnd as I delved pretty deep into UFO history\nYou quickly realize this is a phenomena that goes back not just hundreds but literally thousands of years\nThere's this very strange tradition in in human storytelling of\nPeople being confronted or or abducted or meeting beings that they have no explanation for understanding I cite an example from the Bible and ... and the the Old Testament these this flaming cherry at in the sky and talk to that meeting these\nSome of these this flaming cherry it in the sky and talks to meeting the giants the L O team it's a whole book of the Bible well that's pretty weird that a very well yeah and then I'd I uncovered in in the nineteenth century there were these\nHuge string of accounts of people all over the west in the mid west\nSeeing what they describe this giant airships floating across the sky and says well before the the Wright brothers had ever been up there but these these stories are legion and not all of them have been debunked it it's a mysterious and persistent\nPart of human existence and it's not just in our culture it it appears to be fairly universal\nYou mentioned that what we call the UFO experience it raises the question in my mind should we have a different name for it like what would you called and said you know going further back in ... the Wright brothers and things they should we come up with some sort of name to describe this kind of experience\nI mean in the ... in the nineteenth century and in England they called it the spirit world they call them with encounters with the fairies or ALS or in Germany they were cobalt or trolls are words that lived in the mountains even when we were up in a Washington filming we were out in some native people land and\nMichael Horse who's a member of the cast and a Native American himself took me aside and said that the native people had told him one of the forest where we were shooting\nWas where the little people showed up so this ideas persistent we Americans have a tendency to think we know everything because we have a lot of knowledge yeah but there's different kinds of knowledge\nYou also lean conspiracy theories in into the secret history of Twin Peaks very artfully in these conspiracy theories really add to the narrative drive of your story why do you think we're so drawn to conspiracy theories\nWhile I've thought about this a lot because you know I was a\nI was ten years old when JFK was shot he was buried on my tenth birthday and for four years I was obsessed with getting to the bottom of this and there's a whole worldwide industry on who kill JFK that became\nA kind of alternative way of looking at the world and that was the first time when I was ever really particularly aware\nThat we didn't just have to depend on conventional or authoritative voices that that were perhaps other ways of of viewing it\nI I think a lot of conspiracy theories arise out of the the notion that something as momentous as say the murder of a young and vigorous and shining example of American political history could be taken out\nBy somebody is small and is insignificant in as\nStupid as a as Lee Harvey Oswald so that gave rise to this idea but it it can't have been him yeah I had to have been something more momentous it had to have been something that that ran much deeper\nThat it can't be random there's gotta be some underlying meaning it's a it's kind of a just as sort of the way our minds are wired right to detect these patterns in and make sense of the world\nExactly once that gets started once the ball gets rolling it's pretty hard to stop\nYeah definitely final question what do you think he's the legacy of Twin Peaks the television series\nBoy it's a hard one for me to answer because other than that it touched in some way on some kind of truth that spoke to a a lot of people\nIf you if you work creatively for a living sure you want to entertain people and you want to you want to make them laugh you want to pick him cry and you want to you want to tell them a story that keeps them in the edge of their seat but\nTo go back to the Joseph cambell idea of the function\nOf a storyteller and the culture is that it's our job to keep mythology alive for people that it's akin to what ... did in ...\nGee alive for people to kinda what ... did in the first world cultures they kept alive the mysteries of the past and that somehow in live in the president and I I like to think that at its best\nThat's what storytellers do for our culture now\n... with mark ... is the author of the secret history of Twin Peaks he's the co creator along with David Lynch the really serious the third season of Twin Peaks ... men [noise]\nThis year's Booker Prize went to George Saunders for Lincoln in the bar down his complex multi character novel set during the civil war President Abraham Lincoln speed limits on Willie dies probably of typhoid fever he'd only eleven years old Lincoln is overcome with grief\nAnd visit to the cemetery Crips many times to hold his boy's body\nThe false and talk with George Saunders when the book first came out and they began with a reading can you explain what's\nGoing on in the state yeah there was a convention in the book that when a ghost [noise]\nSort of Cohen habits of same space as a living person the ghost gets a kind of temporary omniscient the person's thought string becomes fully available to the ghost so they're Lincoln has entered the tune and Willie is kind of watching him watching Lincoln sauce over the physical body\nI mean in a sense it's maybe analogous to purgatory although it's more driven by the use or you could say like the the person who goes to the bottle can get out if he or she is just willing to kind of face the music particularly the music of their own habituate and you know the thing that they brought forward from life\nThat's not allowing them to go on to the next step\nSo the danger of the ... you can get stuck there or you can sort of be trapped there for eternity\nYeah and then that's probably more true of my ... than the actual Tibetan bottle but at some point I kind of had to break from it and and make a\nYou know a whole new concept of what might happen when we die mainly because my guess is not to have you done it but my guess is that whatever happens with going to be a real shocker [laughter]\nAnd ah [laughter] it is not going to be like oh this isn't just what we were told [laughter] so so that was part of the the writing challenge was to make a bottle that had some resemblance to what we think the afterlife might be they'll be different enough that we shared and some of that this orientation that a natural that person would feel [noise]\n'cause this resonate for you personally I mean as more than just illiterate device but it means the Buddhist concept at the bar to\nOh yeah my wife and I having students of of Buddhism for a while I'm just you know a total beginner but it back and flex this life\nIn a sense you if the ideas that when you when you die your mind is basically like a wild force it gets a lot of the tether because now it's not dampen bite your physical body anymore\nAnd the mind in that state they say can do anything it can travel it can be a mission that can experience horrible visions are beautiful visions much like our idea of having\nWell that's the case the way we cultivate and train our minds right now is is really key\nSo you know you could see it as a literal afterlife or if that doesn't suit you you could see it as a metaphor for the fact that we're making heaven and hell this instant by our our habits of mind and then they kinda hopeful thing which is that you theoretically could cultivate a state of mind\nThat was more patient and more loving and more sane and the one you happen to be in at the moment for me that's kind of the big takeaway is that had been how\nOur right now and they're not beyond our ability to influence\nIt seems like there's also a connection to be made between literature and religion and they're they're both exercises and world building and even if you see religion as representing an underlying reality they're both ultimately imaginative exercises\nKnow I think in world building especially in a book like this which is you get to decide what the rules of ghosts are you get to build them and what was interesting to me it was I didn't start off with a bunch of rules I just started out with trying to make\nInteresting lines in the book basically in town dialogue or vivid images and what's interesting is as you do this kind of it are of approach with the thousands of the draft the world starts first of all it starts being very consistent you can see which rules have to apply\nAnd then the really magical thing was that you know about year three\nWith the rules in place the rules started kind of producing weird fruit you know there would be [laughter] turns in the plot that I hadn't anticipated that were really meaningful and and I found really moving\nThat weren't really me doing it it was the rules of the world saying well if a therefore be it's a kind of a cliche but I for writers say you know you're like a midwife the book is there\nA perfect being or you know a very good being it as a strong sense of what it is in your job is to kind of\nManage your daily activities so as not to for the things individuality and I had that feeling really strong in the last third of the book and it was\nThings individuality and I had that feeling really strong in the last third of the book and it was just I'm deeply enjoyable I really kind of miss it I have to know you get out of Eighteen sixty two and come back to now\nGeorge Saunders new novel his parents it's called Lincoln in the bar do and he was talking with Steve ... coming up\n[noise]\nHave told you of
