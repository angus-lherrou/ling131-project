you're walking through a minefield every day but you know that there are a lot of poisons growing all around us\n[noise] they got to thinking you know there are a lot of famous stories in history about\nPoisonous plants [noise] Socrates was killed by hand lock and and on and on and I thought it would be interesting to tell the story [noise] not to write a field guide poisoners plan\nBut to talk about wind plans have actually\nKilled someone or been used in warfare or\nFor some dark in various programs [noise] Amy Stewart is a mystery writer she's the author of the best selling cops history series she is also a serious Gardner with side gig writing about we can\nIntroduce China Henry Potter too few\nAbraham Lincoln's mother was killed by a plant she was killed in a very indirect way the plant is white snake rude poisonous cows would grades on this plant the poison would make them sick but\nAlso get into their milk and people would drink the milk and get sick and die and that was called milk sickness and it was a real problem throughout the Eighteen hundreds in fact the mystery part of it is interesting it took us a long time to really understand how plant poisons work in part because how do you even do those experiments\nThe KGB starts assassinating people with rice and which is an extract of the castor bean seed\nAnd we did not in medical science even know how much rice and it took to kill a person as late as the Nineteen seventies were doing experiments where we're figuring out what would be a lethal dose for a pig that weighs roughly the equivalent of a human\nIt's amazing how much we still don't know about toxins and plant\nI read that you have a poisonous plant garden and that it's been lifted as one of them I think Eighteen most unusual gardens in the world\nBut [laughter] well I live out that I wanted to grow these plants it's weird to write a book about plants that you've never grown and maybe never even seen and some of them are pretty hard to get you can't just walk in\nMaybe never even seen and some of them are pretty hard to get you can't just walk into a garden center and say I would like twelve men drapes [laughter] they're just not for sale but as I'm doing these interviews and reaching out to people in horticulture community\nPlant started getting offered to me\nKind of secretly like you actually yes I really did go visit a farm that grew a lot of very poisonous and strange plants including some illegal plant\nThere was up in the hills and before I went up there where I knew there was going to be no cell phone coverage I remember calling my husband and going if I don't call you back in an hour or something has happened [laughter] what plants\nSo like I watched maybe you've heard of a whose new genetic plan from South America\nThings that may be or not quite illegal but that the DEA is very aware of and that are ... plants but they were going straight up you know it was a pop farm and it was a I mean they were going other illegal\nStraight up illegal plants as well so you're you started collecting collecting so I started collecting them but they need to go somewhere so I planted a poison garden\nAnd I really made it a I had fun making a creepy so like rather than plant markers I had the cement tombstone that identified what the plant does to you\nMadness or blindness\nI found a company that makes resident skeletons for medical schools and they sell their factory seconds on line [laughter]\nI had all these lightly does I Do the schools and hand and and so I had those are kind of Ohio like a skeleton buried creepy and wonderful but not terribly practical was it beautiful I mean opium poppies are beautiful right yeah I mean a lot of these are very pretty plant\nSo I was crying Fox glove did you tell us which is a heart medication it's a great example if a plant that's both medicine and poisoned depending on the dos and who's taking it\nAnd tobacco's beautiful at flowers and it's getting on the which one you grow can be quite large and impressive looking plan so yeah a lot of them are very pretty\nI've heard that some people think plants have a consciousness I was reading something about maybe the night shades have an ability to hate\nYou think that's true well I'm fascinated by this and it is something that we're finding out more about the one way that plants communicate is through route eggs are tips so they exude chemicals out of the roots into the soil and those route exits can attract\nCertain microbes are other living creatures that might help the plant do better or ward off enemies\nAnd they're also plans to do the same thing above ground that if they're under attack they can released a pheromone\nThat would attract the predator of the bugs that attacking them so in other words they can signal for help mhm so that's certainly suggests that they're able to react to stimuli around them in a way that we didn't know was possible and we're sort of just starting to figure out\nDo you think that there's a reason that we have these toxic plants in our world\nOh sure they're just defending themselves and this is something I Try to remind people of is that you don't have to be terrified of poisonous plants\nThey're just trying to make a living you know they're they're trying to protect themselves against predators\nIt's a mistake to think that because some things green and comes out of the ground that it's all natural and it's therefore good for us you know we tend to think that anything that's plant based is\nMore healthy and superior in some way but strychnine is a hundred percent plant based [laughter] what a sewing cyanide ... rice and\nThey're just trying to keep from getting eaten\nPlants are rooted in the ground they don't have opposable thumbs they can't run and hide they can't fight back but you know that's why plant ...\n... they can't run and hide they can't fight back but you know that's why plants have\nForeign spines are stinging adults I mean they're all just trying to keep predators away\nSo they inflict pain and suffering on anyone who tries to eat them\nThat was Amy Stewart she writes mystery novels in addition to books like drunken mountainous wicked plants\nAnd that was shot and Henry cyber talking with her\n\nReally fascinating things about poisons [noise]\nIs it in small doses they can cure\nLarger doses killed\nSo much power in a simple leaf mushroom or a white powder\nSo much potential for the right\n[laughter] we're capturing if I wanted to poison somewhat today what would be the best way to go about it oh\nCentral I asked you that you want\nTo get away with it [noise] absolutely [noise] when that case what do you need to do in a very good study on\nHow they have

which they would sing they hired private detectives to dig up ... when you know they actively lie to them they concealed medical test results and it's just astonishing you watch the comedy that anyone would be that inhumane\nThere's one I remember there's I think you wrote that at one point they tested a lot of the girls for their radium levels they didn't give the girls the test results but they themselves created a list of who's going to die first yeah\nIs exactly what happened they graded then depending on how radio ...\nYeah that is exactly what happened they graded them depending on how radioactive Iowa\nAnd so I saw in the ... when I was researching it's staggering black and white a list of all the women's names and a number next about name you know from one three to five I don't see how somebody could look at a woman a young woman no\nYou've got her name on a list and you know she's going to be dead in a year and a look her in the face and say you're fine\nWhen I I I think it

she had to basically because the righty and had settled in had lack and they said ... with closing tool if given nine years of your life to a company and they fire you for being sick but they've caused a sickness\nThat was a very big mistake because what happened on it he did was that she fought back and it takes years say by the time the Illinois he went in a finding sued if the great

Internet in her new book the people's cry for a filmmaker after trying to argue that our digital life is on the Democratic\nBecause we handed our political and economic power over to a giant tech corporations who are making money off every post and tweet we make I think\nWe need to talk about the way that these devices and these platforms in these websites are actually addictive by design every aspect of a website like Facebook has\nTested to see what gets us to engage the most so everything from the color schemes to wear buttons or place and they need to maximize our engagement to maximize their cliques because they get data from that and that's actually the business model of these\nSites they're advertising financed and so they need us to engage in to give more information into like as many things as possible because that's where the profit comes from so I think it's important to shift that to go this is not just about\nUs being unable to control our impulses it's more like the way sugary cereals or stocks on the bottom row at the grocery store so that you know kids go crazy you can't help it asked their parents for them\nWe are living a life smacks of watching the physical and watching the virtual and I think that's genuinely new and that can only come if you have a device with you that lets you know literally being dinner with your friends\nLooking up and looking down at the moment at your blackberry and doing something in your virtual world doing something on Facebook that your life as a mixture of what you do and the real and virtual\nI was\nAt a funeral people at the funeral party or are hiding their blackberries under the funeral programs they're texting\nAnd it didn't just happen once and it happened several times and many people have spoken to me about similar experiences they had had\nIt's about not taking a moment at the time that we need to be most present to each other\nIt's not just about letting our attention wanders\nIt's about forgetting the point of the exercise which is to be with each other at the times in the county\n\nTo take a time to less dark speaking to someone who was talking about a Fifteen year old birthday party\nAnd there's a point at this party when everybody wants to go home and part of being Fifteen and successfully getting to be sixteen is that Fifteen year olds have to fight through that moment and learn to get along with each other and to make it work with each other\nBut it's just Fifteen year old birthday party everybody could just you know get on their Facebook and be elsewhere\nAnd not have to deal with each other\nAnd this option cannot just ignore each other but to really find an active social place in the world that doesn't include each other I think that is genuinely new [noise]\nWe really need to think about when we need to deliberate when we need to\nJust be with each other I think the question is not turning off our technology and not getting in a way this wonderful technology but it needs to be putting its place and sometimes you really just need to be with each other and give each other are full attention\nAnd that's the sense that I fear that we're losing and we need to refocus on\n\nAn IT social scientist Sherry Turkle she's the author of Alone Together why we expect more from technology and less from each other\nMm coming up media there

and present shock\nWell I guess in some sense that maybe the sensation might be similar the real differences that the future that out and talk to her was describing that we were moving towards is here with us now so wild tougher was really warning us\nReally to learn how to orient to a world\nThat was changing ever more rapidly to basically be able to adjust to change its self I'm arguing that that changes happen that if anything you know as we pass from the nineties into the twenty first century\nWe became less of a society that was just upped best with the future and what's next in what's happening what's the next big thing we're all going\nAnd we became a society that was very much\nIn the moment in a kind of a a an always on real time hyper connected moment so our our focus really becomes less about how do we adjust to change to something much more like how do we adjust to living\nIn a world where everything is happening seemingly at the same time\n... were you break the idea of president to them down into five big areas and little let's talk about the the one you call digital ... what does this which\nIs interesting and it kinda comes out of that video games and stability I mean the beauty of video games is that instead of watching some other character go through a story\nYou're the one going through the store you know you're the one making the choices in real time and you move from choice to choice to choice to choice rather than watching the canned choices in the sense of agency\nBut you know the digital environment\nVery often makes it seem like you don't even have to choose you don't have to choose between this and that you can choose both and we're doing so many things on line where we're choosing both that we've ended up with really multiple instances multiple incarnations of our stuff\nKind of running simultaneously and all these different platforms and it's very hard to live with more than one you know digital technology is great for copying things but\nHuman beings don't copies do well so there's you on Twitter that maybe somebody's commenting on something that you did there's you and your inbox filling up with messages that are waiting for respond to\nTheir view on Facebook who might be being used to advertise a product you never even heard of while you were asleep you know and you'll wake up that you've been in the sponsors stories you know so how do you deal with all of the different use running simultaneously that's sort of that\nDeal with all of the different use running simultaneously that's sort of the essence of\nThe digital ... are just kind of digital confusion\nSo you're basically you're saying that it's enough to make you a little crazy there's almost like a split personality here 'cause we're tending to so many different digital persona\nRight and even if your personality is not split your digital personalities are split and you're single personality is going to have to deal with all of them I got the idea for the digital any a chapter when I was\nIn the lobby of a hotel in Berlin and I kept trying to log into my Google Calendar to see if I can do one talk at the same time as another talk whether I'd be able to get from one to the other in time\nAnd each place I went I couldn't log until I finally got wife I and I'm In this lobby\nAnd I get the message back from Google that they locked me out of my calendar 'cause they said I was trying to log in\nFrom too many places at once [laughter] right so Google Calendar didn't believe I was a human being they didn't believe one human could be an all those places at once and that to me seemed to be the essence of you know the problem we have a digital culture it's not that idea of information overload and\nAll these people have all these problems with digital technology and that's I promise you present shock is not one of these books is just\nWhining and handwringing about the problems of digital charity but what I Do get concerned about\nIs our readiness to really to put our human lives into digital timeframe and digital technologies really don't understand times they live outside time they're just sequences you know your Twitter feed is not in real time it's just trying to catch up with you\nJust because people are sending emails out to you\nDoesn't mean that now you have to respond in real time to them right the beauty of digital technology was that it waited you know the early conversations we used to have on the bulletin boards we were all those smart because we had all the time in the world to respond to these things we founded smarter online than we did in real life\nRight well and and the the irony of course is that this was supposed to make our life better it was supposed to make it easier and it just makes it feel crazier\nRight and that's because then I mean and not to get leftist on you or anything but I I really do believe it's because in dead abusing digital technology got our first black which is what we saw it as right we're all going to be able to work from home and our underwear anytime we want\nYou know 'cause we'll just get our work done and and turn it in as it as it's ready rather than going to work for this eight hours a day and being always on while you're there what we ended up doing instead was kind of taking the time is money a fish and sea values of the industrial age\nAnd translating them onto the digital age where digital technology really if we're going to embrace it the way I think we can\nIt's about really liberating ourselves from need obsolete industrial age priorities and embracing a totally different really way of working in in a much more pure pure fashion where we create value and sell directly to one another rather than going in and having
