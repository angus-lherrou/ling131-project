DUIs and so the parents focus on the DUIs and it we don't focus on the the hurt and the pain that is leading to the to the DUI the questions that are being asked\nAnd we have things for example like you know we have I think it's fixed offices in federal offices of women's health we have no offices of men's health even even though men die sooner\nIf we consider ourselves progressive and liberal we need to see the pain\nIt said er ourselves progressive and liberal we need to see the pain of men as well as women and boys as well as girls and that's our that's our next evolutionary\nMan [noise] more and Sarah [noise] he's often called the father has a man's land and he wrote the classic now power and that was the awesome time [noise]\n\nYou know boys started getting messages about what it means to be a mom [noise]\nYoung [noise]\nSometimes really young\nUncle told me when I was seven years old you're the man of the house you got to take care of your mother and your sister and your baby brother like at seven up I don't want to go play and he told me that I was like what does that mean\nThis is a shanty branch he's a high school teacher and mentor in Oakland, California and when he first started teaching you noticed that a lot of supplies and his school we're kinda checked out\nThey weren't going to class they weren't doing their work and the majority of them weren't graduating so shocked he did something that seemed at first pretty simple he started an after school club for boys and in that club keep pushed them to take off what he calls the male mask\nYou know the mask is it's a thing that we show the world like when we walk out of our homes to work to school to played most people\nThere are clear that they have a massive they show the world and so I think that with a lot of our young men um ... there's an idea like let me just show everybody that I'm happy funny cool athletic intelligent smart hard you know whatever the characters that they show and then there's that stuff sometimes there's like people can handle this stuff people can handle knowing that\nI'm dealing with sadness or fewer depression and also in our society is that I respect for a man Who's Afraid who sad\n[noise] some of our work is helping argument have a safe place so that they can talk about the stuff that's really happening all of it so when they go back to the world they they're not like built up all this pressure that's waiting to explode and that's what I think sometime happens with a lot of our young men\nSo for you personally I mean what was the mask you grow up wearing and how did you adopted at what point did you realize that was getting your way oh man\nI was a middle schools where there's like a lot of transformation was happening you know I knew that in my head I I thought it was kind of smart\nBut in middle school is not cool to be smart\nAnd so my ... was like getting slide and buy whatever I don't care about this in order to do their homework 'cause I didn't want to [noise]\nIt wasn't until there's one teacher pulled me aside and really adjusted my thinking you know 'cause I was really I was dealing with a lot of sadness\nYou know my father died before I was born we cry at too about the fact that you're sad every time you see a father like picking up his son some school ... when you do when you see your father come to back to school night when you talk to about that they do with my friends couldn't couldn't talk to them about it\nSo I just had to hold it and I had to pretend like it and it really exists\nWhat did this teacher said he has that changed\nShe had a speech rights she was talking for a long time I don't remember much of it I Do remember one sentence so uh I was like staring at the corner am I going to look at it right 'cause if she's lecturing me I'm just not ignore her but she said I Know you're sad\nIt's to the best of our knowledge from ... are ...

feels kind of like a home [laughter] but it feels warm and you you feel kind of alone even though they're people standing around but they can't necessarily see you so well\nWant to pick up a little bit on your own personal history your your background because it's it's obviously informed or you're writing\nYou were born and in the U. S. right in Michigan if but then quickly your family move it in a few months to like us and you grow up there for for how long how many are seen Evan seniors yeah and then came back to America and then I came back to the U.S back to the mid west\nBack to Kalamazoo for university we had no money very little but I came to the u._s.\nCity we had no money very little but I came to the u._s. I got some scholarships I got some loans\nAnd then I had to start learning what it meant to be here as an American who is in Niger and it was almost as if for the first time I was also learning that I was black did not need to be stated in Nigeria because everybody else around me was black\nI mean the U.S now I had to learn the racial politics of the U.S and when you first came here it sounds like you did not have the experience of most African Americans I did not and so but then over time you started having those XP while I've you know I've been in the U.S for\nTwenty five years I'm a black guy in America of course [laughter] you know it's inevitable but you know within those first couple of years there many things I did not have a narrative for\nWhat does it mean if I'm strolling around in a small town in Michigan in a car slows down the window is one down and someone shouts the N. word at me I had to figure out what to think about that\nBut also what does it mean even in a social space in a university setting and somebody says to me oh you're not like those other blacks what does that mean you know and all\nOf this stuff has to be understood and you know\nIt took time but my experience of life is as a black person in America or you live in Brooklyn now I live in Brooklyn I live in the u._s. yeah so and you do consider Brooklyn home I consider Brooklyn home\nBecause that's where my wife is my brother lives there um my friends are there my books are there so that's how I consider leaders home\nMy parents live there is where I grew up if I go to Niger my room is there it's a place where the two most spoken languages in Lagos your by an English language is I'm fluent in so there's an at home this\nBut home is also wherever there's Good Wife by [laughter] that sounds [laughter] that connects the needs of the world in a way that is to reduce civil and as essential to my experience of the world\nDo you consider yourself more Nigerian or more America\nNeither split right down the middle or rather a hundred percent of both\nI feel very invested in Niger is feature as a book I've been working on for a long time about Lagos so I think about Niger allowed\nI'm American and um America is in crisis at the moment I feel invested in\nBeing an American who with other Americans think about what this country ought to be I'm a citizen who is not a patriot but I'm a citizen in the sense of being invested in what do we owe each other what do we do to protect each other's writes\nThose philosophical questions are very interesting to me if my money is being used to kill foreigners in the theater war vets my business so I'm very American in that way and I'm also very Nigerian in that way\nSo you said the two cities that you spent the most time in our like us and New York city yeah are they just two totally different experiences for you or or ... or did they have certain similarities I mean obviously two huge cities\nThe commonality of very similar uh it is the experience of cosmopolitan or something which is maybe the fourth definition of home for me [laughter] you're you're you're comfortable in cities I'm comfortable among cosmopolitan people who share some of my assumption is about\n... I've been talking about mhm if somebody says you know engage should be and or Muslim she'd be shot I say well no\nAnd or Muslim should be shot I say well no that's not the conversation the conversation is how is somebody who's sexual these different somebody who's religion is different\nHow is that person able to inhabit the same space and have the same rights and respect as anybody else that's sort of the core value of cosmopolitan and some ... absolutely so what would you say some of the biggest differences between like us and New York New York is much richer\n... might have twenty five buildings of monumental scale and New York has three hundred and never see these will surprise me for the sheer physical scale\nOf New York and then there's that thing in New York of being a world capital Lagos is the capital of Africa don't let people in Cairo Johannesburg tell you different\nYou know it's all live in a a dog the dog I talk a little bit later\nWhere the pop culture of Africa is being made and sold ... ... the capital of Africa but New York is the capital of the world so that New York is almost not an American city it's a city that's a vision of what is a bolt looked like in these borders\nAre not as they are I\nLoved and actually with with a passage from from your book open city\nWhich is set in New York and kind of a novel of New York and where where you are wandering and which is sort of I think that some of the things that we've been talking about the jury that yes thank you for a bunch of these the book of wandering and what I really wanted\nTo evoke over the course of this book was\nPsychological intensity but also a sense of plenty [noise]\nAt first I encountered the streets of incessant loudness [noise] a shock after the days focus and the relative tranquility as someone had shatters the comic book signing private chapel with a Blair of a TV set [noise]\nI was my way through crowds of shoppers and workers to road construction of some of the horns of taxi cab [noise]\nWalking through busy parts of town meant I laid eyes on more people\nHundreds of thousands even [noise]\nAnd I was a customs of seeing in the course of the day [noise]\nBeach neighborhood of city appear to be made of a different substance each seem to have a different pressure and different psychic\nWeight bright light shuttered shops housing projects and luxury\nHotel [noise] fire escapes in city parks [noise] futile task of sorting went on until the forms began to morph into each other and assume abstract shapes [noise]\nUnrelated to the real city [noise] and\nOnly then did my hectic mind finally show some city and still itself [noise]\nOnly event coming to me [noise] arrive [noise]\nHad\nYou call talking with Steve ... new book is

dangerous idea\nAnd learned here because the author of broken monk and my dangerous idea is that we should get rid of genre altogether I Am so tired of the very artificial arguments that their literature and there at science fiction and that there is\nWestern and crime novels and they the the the old somehow different and have different values system as far as I'm concerned we should be permitted to it you know reading habits we should take any them book we like to bed I Love that book is good in bed\nOr in the boss or on the sofa wherever you like to read you probably shouldn't read with your reader and the boss but you know\nSo the idea that we have stories and we have good stories about stories and we have stories that you different elements\nBut to reduce them into these kind of\nLittle boring pigeonholed where they have to set certain criteria it's so frustrating and tedious [noise] I think we miss out on a lot of really good book and of course the bad side fire but it also depends on what your\nIdea of science fiction is it's a very broad church at the same with crime you might have a really tedious little murder mystery which breaks out all the cliche about pretty dead girls and\nThe serial killer creeping up on people and we've seen it before and then you might read a crime novel like on girl which just blows you out of the water\nThese distinctions they're fake they don't exist when he'd mull hybrid novel who need novels which can take their inspiration from the world read what you want to read make yourself happy re challenging adventurous dangerous books across different genres surprised yourself\nLauren ... is author of broken monsters [noise]\nAnd um I heard this guy you know playing piano it's just like us so aggravated or trying to say if I
