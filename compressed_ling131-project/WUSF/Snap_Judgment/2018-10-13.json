in the mountains of Kurdistan to scale famous yellow\nThis location in Kurdistan has been popular with backpackers especially Europeans for a long time not just climbers going there so for about Twenty years before we had gone there there was people traveling there every year but again as long as he got that destination yes\n[noise] the climate for you to Max's pizza and dangerous ... faces but still as their helicopter descended into the care to valley and the yellow a came into view they were blown away\nProbably what impact of this and that we weren't ready for with me the scale of the Himalayas just how much bigger amount and the darling everything we have over here at first it was a little bit difficult to wrap our heads around\nAnd ... came over and I was reaching out my hand and trying to grab a tan and form up with Iraq and he was terrified and it was rocking us laws [noise]\nHe was very hesitant to grab my hand and I was trying really really hard to establish that connection that's just what I wanted to even if you didn't need a hand I wanted him to have to take my hand to get up\nAnd ended up to be kind of a moment of brilliance\nAnd instead he reached out and they gave me a rifle\nI was like fall that's even better [noise]\nInside check his rifle and I turned around and I very intently gave it to John and I said sure John do you mind holding this for a minute\nAnd I think that's probably when John frame of mind starting to shift and I grabbed Abdul tan and I pulled them up and he was just so happy and smiling from the area and he patting me on the back and asking me if I was a soldier\nThey looked at him and that kind of held up their guns and like just triumphant moment and they like padding among the shoulder and they're like ... like soldier\nLike they're like you you want to help our cars and the dynamic between the you know our captors enough completely changed at that moment they they actually believed that we were trying to help their cause and we were totally on their side\nOver the next few hours John the photographer tried to communicate to Abdul asking what the story was here and I do try to explain but he explained it as if he was letting them in on the rebellion\nAnd his story with that that we understood was that there are a group of people who want to have their own little state up in the mountains where they hurt goes and they pray and they might not our business but there is a guy in their country that's been charged for a really bad guy elected himself president for life\nAnd they're not allowed to really study their religion\nThe men were from its Pakistan where things are pretty complicated at the time there was a communist leaning\nDictator type figure several large movements to install a Muslim state and a handful of not from splinter groups with specific demands like the captors\nExplained a John that we were all going to go to this other place and then his boss and he got on the phone and call Bill Clinton and they were going to talk this hour and then we're all going to go home\nThey kept it plan was to focus international attention on ... and themselves ultimately to expose the repressive regime they were forced to live under they had a sympathetic story for sure but Jason's still believe that they could not count on rent some rescue their best shot at living with skate by any means necessary\nI mentioned a job that you know at least one of these guys are going to have to die for us to get out of this and um my partners were opposed to that sort of course of action\nWe sort of split into two groups of thought I remember back in my suffer pretty adamantly against doing anything drastic to escape we thought we should just try to wait it out Jason or John wanted to take\nMatters into their own hands and the idea of killing somebody and and in some ways we we we didn't see our chapters as evil as you might even though we're seeing them murders somebody I very much so\nMany victims of Sirte\nI very much so that the victims of circumstance in some ways a specially\nThe guy that Jason and I were with every day he was like a Nineteen year old hired mercenaries like I could look at him and be like who's to say that I Would it be right there in the same and you know doing the same thing he was doing\nBut Jason would talk all day long every day in sort of code so that they wouldn't know what we're talking about but you would strategize about how we would pick up rocks bashing the schools are\nStabbed their next with sticks to gouge out their eyes and you talk to them is very very gory details but he did it in this voice that made it sound like you're talking about what you're going to make for dinner\nIf you're talking about killing some guys right in front of them you have to very consciously change your tone of voice to like and if you're talking about unicorns and bunnies and my little tiny or something\nIt was it was kind of disturbing\nYou know I had to consider if we had to fight these guys throats am I going to jump on that guy and despite its throat gets teeth are sharp weapon that I've got might be better than the sticker robbed and um yeah of the many ways we might be able to deal with these guys somewhere a little bit more bloody than others\nMm\nThey marched onto the rocky terrain and one of their captors ... split on now with only two characters with guns to Fort climbers they walked and walked for a whole night invested for a day and then did again and they did that for three days starving\nAnd I came up with this really good game to play to pass the time [noise] um where we would see who could go to the longest without asking what time it was and he started imagining exactly what you're going to eat when you get home and\nWhere you're going to go to buy the supplies and then you imagined eating it and then you start trying to count again\nAnd then finally one of his broken after time it was when we take guesses and it turns out it and then five minutes and I think that's probably one Tommy changed completely\nIt was an amount of suffering that I mean it was just on comprehend we're starving to death we were always shivering and you know our chief were super sore from chattering all the time but there's just felt unbelievably long\nThey did have a few things going for them they could navigate this mountain is trained much better than it builds hungry sleep deprived men they can also communicate their plants with each other openly as long as they kept their tone of voice deceptively positive\nDo seem to have no idea that his captors were plotting escape because he came to Jason with a proposal\nAnd he said to her deal I'm going to go back up to your Base Camp and [noise] I'm going to get some of the food and clothes that we left there because we're all hungry and cold and then you guys are all going to go together\nUntil one of the climate to continue up the mountain along with only one of his men and gardening and not one guard was to an Eighteen year old\nHe kind of set in a weird way we would take to safely up this mountain where there was a plateau on top and then he was going to come and meet it [noise] and then we were all going to go together somewhere there was safe and in ... he had bombed the story that I spent a week selling to undo bought a hook line and sinker\nAnd so I grabbed his arm in Baghdad to not [noise]\nAnd I served pleading with him not to go to ... out there there's soldiers everywhere we don't want him to get shot and he was ... away from us we were all grabbing him and begging him to knock out a he has this look like he's I Know I have to do this for everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off they split up\nFor everybody I have to go we're all going to be better off\nThey split up do tracking down towards the Base Camp Jason and his crew led to up the mountain now it was four to one\nTime I felt like my rib cage was going to explode\nThere's just a ball and excitement and there was like coming from my stomach up to my heart and I just wanted to scream out loud because you know one guy got a gun and one guy got to Don and a hand grenade the nice thing here is like all of that and you leave one down kid with a gun with four other kids I completely changes everything\nThis was a very narrowly climate they basically anybody who's not a climber would have been terrified and this sort of train especially since it was the middle of the night and so John and I immediately\n\nCommunicated to each other that it was game on and this was going to happen and we all started kind of moving up that mountain\nTogether and I'm always trying to find [noise] uh\nI'm trying to always kind of direct to away that looks like the easiest way to also put him in the most danger if he falls off or gets pushed off\nWhen you can tell they were there like this is the moment I should I should push him right now this is our chance and then\nAnd then they wouldn't ... I stopped on a small ledge ... with ... and the top of the mountainside was maybe just a hundred feet away or something\nAnd I looked at her and I was like I don't think they're going to do this you think I should do it and she just looked she just looked down she didn't say anything we still didn't believe morally and killing somebody but at this point where like this is this is our chance to survive\nTommy ... kind of came flying over the top of me being in that race and got the class or just\nScrambled up over behind him and she wasn't expecting it at all Mm but as I was reaching out to grab it got strep sense what was going to happen\nAnd he turned towards me and out of close to him I reached out to grab his gun strapping I polled as hard as I could and just toppled over backwards\nHe just kind of weapon that sparks through them and like any turn and he looked at me and he looked at me we made our contact the whole way down\nAnd ... he had the ledge in front of me maybe ten or Fifteen feet in front of me and\nHis whole body let us really horrible uh cracking sound because really loud and then he tumbled off of the darkness\nAnd I sat down and I just started falling um [noise]\nAnd then best showed up you know right after that and she sort of sat behind me\nI like that I can can just go out and just focus on peddling dropped my head down to really like work ahead French revolving just felt like one two one two or something like that you gotta you know you had a source of joy and you're just like find down it\nAnd it's been two would always happy and healthy do\nUntil one day a few years ago when he was Nineteen years old and then through started getting headaches to very terrible headache and he was diagnosed with a now formation in his brain\n[noise] I mean you know what are the chances that we'd have two children with brain now from Asia and\nHe gets huge crazy Spencer Institute brain Mel formation had nothing to do with one another [noise] but it's been through brain to Jewish and didn't seem like a needed surgery\nThe doctor's recommended a wait and see approach because they thought the surgery could cause more problems than it would resolve [noise]\nAnd this was about the time spent you became very adamant with one request\nI can remember driving home from one of the appointments and Spencer bang insistent that when that he never have surgery no matter what\nI didn't even bother to push back I figured we'd just cross the bridge together if the native rose I never imagined that I'd have to face that decision alone or you know I'm without it then but\nI felt very strongly about not wanting to get surgery\nAnd on the other one is and how strongly did you feel this way I Would say that I say about it and do you remember what you might have been scared of\nAh just knock that coming out of the surgery as a totally different person I think is what I was scared of\nA different person center would scare his personality would change which is a phenomenon in brain surgery [noise] sometimes\nPeople experience lots of little changes like different food preferences liking new t._v. genres stuff like that\nAnd sometimes the change in Norman like there's a story of a playboy model\nTimes the change is enormous like there's a story of a playboy model who became a shrinking wallflower and didn't even want anyone to take a picture\nFor is the case of an otherwise kind gentle brain surgery patient who became abusive to his family and ... was worried about whatever it was that made him Spencer he's worried that if you change should green you changed him\nSo I think for Spencer seeing how I turned out and everything wasn't on better familiar\nMade him very hesitant there should be some amount of skepticism\nIn your approach too\nRisky surgery instant connection treasure even if they helped me a\nLot there was a conversation that I had with him at some point [noise] ooh expressing some of my regrets about my own surgery because I still\n... top symptoms even after the second surgery in almost every\nTime\nMade it to him that [noise] one of my\nBiggest regrets surgeries or not and my surgery and it's not it's made me a new somewhat\nBetter person at the time [noise] um [noise] so\nAnd I get a little bit about to go with you\nThere's like ...
