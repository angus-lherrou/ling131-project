thirty seconds and I just gave up hope and just by myself to the fear\n\nThe first thing that struck me about this\nPlace was it was very gloomy inside and I remember counting the windows and I'm saying this so many windows in this place and it's so gloomy it had thirty windows [noise]\nUm but I was desperate and it really was a nice place that had all hardwood floors it had a fireplace and there was a great neighborhood\nAnd I said I'll take it for different that we're going to find you're going through tough divorced and needed a place\nTo live he had two cats make with nine at the time and cat who is stuff and\nWe were living in the top floor there was a two family home and I we had the second floor apartment above the apartment was a full size addict which had its own dorm hers and it was really used for storage\nKid my cats are getting used to a new reality never parents were splitting up to and you will now they had a new place to live\nYou know are just into school are adjusting to our parents being divorce which is an emotional time for everybody\nAnd I remember moving into this place and and it's an older building Manchester is an old mill town and a lot of the houses are a hundred two hundred years old\nShortly after we moved in and my dad actually said to my sister and I hey why don't we check out the addict\nWhich seems innocuous enough in the middle of the day for all of us to go up there and and and poke around [noise]\nUm [noise] I remember distinctly that there would have came to\nHang on the ban is there on the way up to the addict\nAnd when we bought upstairs we kind of poking around there were\nOf old clothes holds dress lessons are old vinyl records\nClose hold stress lessons are old vinyl records and an entire raccoon on the back wall of life magazine dating back to [noise] you know God Knows when neatly catalogued so it really looked like this was somebody holds lights up here [noise]\nI felt like we were in meeting someone else to me\nI remember feeling like I was surrounded by someone else belonging and we did not belong there [noise] that\nWas looking through these life magazines and I remember very clearly that make with becoming more and more uncomfortable with the fact that he was pulling them all out of order and Mike with healing like\nDon't touch that this isn't yours don't touch it [noise]\nIt wasn't just old magazine record up there in the attic looking around I remember\nDistinctly scenes are rope tied to one of the rafters and cut at the not [noise]\nNot only did he noticed the rope tied on the raft or he actually found the new [noise]\nThat's right Mike Senate news on the floor at the addict toss it into a dusty corner tried to distract consent to make light of makes terrific discovery in that she could\nStill [noise] everyone was shaken up [noise] and I think we all kind of\nFeel like that's when things escalate it got worse for [noise]\n\nMike and cat Louis pat on the weekends and with their mom during the week when to catch up with their mom Fred was all alone and how\nI was getting ready to go to work I had a a a daytime or her appointment book which was vital to me [noise]\nAnd I was in a rush and I had to put this book on top of a better or post these were the stairs leading to the front door downstairs\nAnd I put it on a post to simply time my shoes now I Know I put it on the poster [noise] no doubt I bend down time my shoe I get up and it's gone [noise] I went so far to go into the garage\nTo see if I left it in my car I'm I have to find the sport [noise] I'd come back and it says on the postman flipped over upside down [noise]\nAnd I just grabbed it and ran out of the house\nAnd then there was a light in the attic\nAt least once or twice a week when I Would come home the addict like would be on so much so that I Would have to I Will be the only one really to access go upstairs shut it off of course it would creep me out\nYou try to rationalize I don't want to believe that something is here messing with me\nOn the weekend when cat and microwave him friend never mentions the experience he didn't want them to get scared away still\nCat in might can help to pick up on the fact that I think one off about the apartment\nOr you can see things that are the corner of your eyes and it turns them nothing would be there\nI could barely ever sleep [noise] so I'm lying in bed awake\n[noise]\nMy door open hallway laid on [noise]\n[noise] with my door open holy laid on [noise] trying to ignore the uneasy feeling that was always president and [noise] I\nEr here in the sink\nTurn on in the kitchen [noise] ah everyone is in their separate bedrooms and I know nobody turned it on\nFred Mike in cat never told each other they thought something was going on they can barely believe it themselves still about six months after moving in del decided did she get a kitten we got the cat\nAs kind of a warm fuzzy presidents and the house I think we're all feeling like\nYou have so much turmoil and darkness kind of going on in our personal lives that we just wanted something to make us\nTo come home every day and I remember we were so excited to bring the cat homes [noise]\nShe was just such a warm leaf kittens\nIt was really nice to have her around [noise]\nThe kittens seemed to make the apartment a little brighter\nSide could sleep through the night when kids work on kitten with snuggle up next to him and I think it started happening [noise]\n\nMy bedroom was always dark dingy I remember we painted clouds all over my walls to try to break it up and make it feel a little more cheery and but I still had this feeling of drag Everytime I go into my bedroom\nCatch it had to relieve scented recurring nightmares ever be a man standing over my bad staring down at me\nWatching these sleep and he would take his fingers and run them down the flash on my face and I began waking up with scratch at\n[noise]\nAt first I thought the kitten may be scratching it started the [noise] but she wasn't [noise]\nMy dad decided that he was going to try something to see if that would help because I think he was worried that it was a self inflicted\nKind of scratch and\nShe decided to tape mitten to me at night to see if I could stop myself from scratching and still I Would wake up with scratches down my [noise]\nI almost feel like this thing was kind of feeding on our energy we were in a bad state we all were traumatized we had a lot of negative things going on in our lives it was a it was a bad transition for for all of us [noise]\nAnd I think that definitely woke whatever was there and make things worse [noise]\nFred cat and make were closed and he managed to find comfort in each other and things to the apartment got to be too much\nWeekends at the apartment my dad and I would go out all day we would spend the day outside doing fun things just trying to get some fresh air and lighten the mood a little bit and I had one day\nWe came home and we could hear the cat ... [noise] but she didn't come running to add and usually the second we came home ship kind of Trump's the kitchen and say hello and we thought it was odd that she's not anywhere to be found but we can hear her\nSoft little meow so making eye and died we searched all over the house looking for the cat thinking like maybe she got stuck in a closet who knows what happened I'm and I found\nHer in my bedroom and\nAndrew [noise] and [noise]\nWrapped around her neck and she was hanging off of my head coach [noise]", "show_name": "Snap Judgment", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "20"}
