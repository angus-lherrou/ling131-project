don't know about you but I have not even bother to buying a ticket because I'm a total pessimistic about the lottery I don't even try any more they admit I'm actually risk averse to any like does anyone think they're really going to win the mathematically speaking the odds are ridiculously against us\nHow ever our next story is about a guy who flipped those odds over and over again here's Alex school's mark and from our planet money podcast\nIt's Nineteen Ninety two in Virginia the pot was twenty seven million dollars big for the time\nAnd when winter comes forward it seems like something is unusual that someone managed to buy every single combination of tickets to guarantee a win and this totally perplexed as the people who run the lottery system can force in the ... him on TV shortly after\nThe very idea of spending over seven million dollars for a while to share a lottery just seems preposterous\nThe man behind the plane was defined Monday I tracked him down a couple of years ago the last time there was a big lottery jackpot [noise]\nHe was living on an island in the south Pacific ... hello hello Hi this is to find ... yeah\nHe says that Virginia thing it took decades to get to that level the story starts in Romania in the late Nineteen fifty ... has a young family and he wants to get out of the country\nI mean you know I'm I'm a I mean my gym six you lay among which was the good shoes\nDecides the lottery is his way out he's a pretty natural in that way so he goes to the library and he starts reading math paper aftermath paper and he realizes something about the lottery there that if he buys certain blocks of tickets in certain combination he can guarantee himself at least a second prize so we pools his money with three\nYou can guarantee himself at least a second prize pools his money with three friends and he buys the tickets\nWe want seven ... shutdown that made you lay which was about eight years with Charlotte\nRight big score that was on your first try he takes the money and he leaves Romania for Australia he finds more investors he reaches more money enough to buy all the combinations of numbers for the bigger Australian lottery and he turns lottery winning into a business for a while\nYou know I was starting\nEventually Australia passes a law that block them from buying up all the tickets so we set to sites on the big prizes in America he decides Virginia is the place at the time there were seven point one million combinations of lottery tickets\nHe waits until the jackpot is twenty five million or above to make sure that he's still turn a profit even if there's a split pot\nThe biggest problem with buying all the tickets so isn't money it's logistics filling out millions of tickets each one different keeping track of where they are so you can find a winning tickets and then turning them all in so\nHis secret was get the tickets ready ahead of time back then it was legal to print your own tickets already filled out so we set up printers going for over a month making the millions of tickets\nThen negotiated with stores across the state to let him turn in stacks of ten thousand tickets at a time and waited\nArgued that would leave one through six second Brian I'm going to the thousands minded writer\nHe says he couldn't do it again lotteries have now added extra numbers and there are just too many combinations so the great lottery play of Nineteen Ninety two will likely state the last great lottery playing out skull Martin\nNPR News [noise] support\nFrom Planet Money comes from transfer a wide a service that

they've got okay okay yeah and they matched up so it's it's also even though it's it's a historic\nMatch up it's something that in the modern day of two very big baseball team how how they miss each other when they will bend in the world series was never against each other so I Love the fact that it goes back into our claim but also it brings them she she thousand eight teams still lives there\nAlso it brings them she she thousand Eighteen\nStill looking back in the world series after a pretty brutal last last year I mean how how this team going to be different\nI got one word and its redemption I mean we've all had a little bit of that in life right you get your heart\nBroke in this case it just got it torn out and there is something about that World Series last year wasn't just the fact that when seven game but it went back and forth changing lanes extra inning I've met with this spring training I was with them pretty much throughout the season and there is a fire\nTo get back in when the world series but really when you look at the field team in different because they wouldn't got many without a I mean this could have been there often the leader he's at shortstop they lost Corey speaker during the season and now they have a child and then really in their ace Clayton ...\nIts Walker Mueller adding Walker Mueller to be able to be honest and one of the best picture that we've seen in the national wean they have this redemption that they've had all season long they want to get back and they want to when\nThey're burning to prove themselves now okay what about the red Sox what did they have going into that\nThey want a hundred and eight games I mean the pressure is on them and even though the daughters haven't won a World Series in Thirty years you know the red Sox have had that highly Boston is that a lot of reason to celebrate between the patriots and the red Sox but this cheap argument one of the bat\nRegular season teams when you have ever seen okay so they went and it was without a doubt they were the best thing the baseball so when you were the best team in baseball it's like okay well then when at all no one cares about hey you want to hide your mate games yeah you get an award you get a crowd\nYou don't get anything oh you get an you want a hundred and ... yeah they were in the ... they are so good out of it as well you know in the postseason the best you can always when you got to go out and play\nAll right I Want your crystal ball Jessica how do you see the world series playing out who do you think is going to win\nDaughters ... and that's kind of shocked a lot of people because of the Boston Red Sox are the best team on paper there is nobody better what I Love about the postseason transcend all of that talent pitching hitting I don't care for all the numbers out yet is redemption\nIt's passion it fire the Dodgers have because they locked in game seven last year and I believe that's going to kill them to victory

five to nine here on your NPR station democratic gubernatorial nominee Andrew Gillum was in chapel yesterday she appeared at a rally was former vice president Joe Biden to ditch my interviews with NPR before that he sat down with our own Steve newborn you'll be able to hear that coming up in about Fifteen minutes\nThe ACLU has been tracking these children and it was the ACLU lawsuit against the Trump Administration that led to federal court order to reunite these families we're joined now by ACLU attorney leak learnt welcome thanks for having me\nFirst say that the vast majority of these children who were separated at the border more than two thousand of them have been reunited with their families but it has been for months since the court order why are two hundred and forty five children doing custody\nYeah that's the question right you know obviously the should've never happened to begin with and it should never have taken this long for the reunification\nLike one of the reasons is because the government supported hundreds of parents without their children and the reunification process for those parents didn't really even start 'til about six weeks after the court order\nAnd where are these children being held right now the two hundred forty five children that are still in captivity\nThey're being held in governor ... all across the country often thousands of miles from where the parents are I Would say of the two hundred and forty five\nA number about one twenty five are going to remain in custody into a sponsor takes them and that's because\nWe've reached the parents and they've made the agonizing decision to leave their child and the U.S not because they don't love the child stop because they don't desperately want the child back with them\nBut what they're saying to us is it's too dangerous for the child to come back one father said to me look my life is over farm killed on killed and this was a father who seemed to be in his forties or fifties obviously his life shouldn't have been over he shouldn't have been thinking that way but all he said was was I cannot bring chop accurate\nThey've been thinking that way but all he said was was I cannot bring wide shot back you're it's too dangerous we're hopeful that the government will allow some of these parents to return to the U.S and reunite fee but right now the only thing definite we can tell those parents that you have two choices leave your child in the U.S to pursue asylum\nOr bring them back to Central America\nWe heard at various points that some of the family are deemed ineligible for reunification because the parents had criminal background what kinds of criminal backgrounds are we talking about here\nSo they very we have set all along that if a parent is a very serious conviction that bears on their fitness to be a parent even under stand her child welfare law state law\nThey would not be reunited and so those people we've always said would not be reunited but we're also seeing our people not reunited because out of disorderly conduct\nDUIs allegations that they may be part of a gang and that is extremely troubling because we're talking about [noise]\nFour year old kids three year old kids who are not being reunited with their parents because the government's saying it's just too dangerous to put them in a family detention center with their child and we could not disagree more strongly with that\nThese people you have reported that five children had parents who have not been reached at all and what does that mean that the U.S government had no idea what happened to the parents we\nAre the ones trying to locate the parents the government has given up the phone numbers finally they gave us phone numbers these are five that we have not been able to reach by phone\nWe remain hopeful will reach the five um but if we don't we will have to look for them on the ground we have great partners including justice in motion and kids in need of defense on the ground we hope that we'll be able to reach them one way or the other we are not giving up on the five we will find them one way or the other we believe\nWe can learn to

we hit on transportation at all of those are the kinds of issues that I think every\nWe didn't hit on transportation at all of those are the kinds of issues that I think every day Floridians want to know affordable housing what our visions truly are for the future economy of this state\nOne of the issues that's really near and dear to a lot of people is red tide yeah and the effect it's having on our beaches our economy is there anything that you think you could do as governor that's not being done to address the problem first\nOf all we can put some protection back into the Florida department of environmental protection or we literally handed over the keys of involvement of protection to some of the biggest polluters we have in this state\nI think the governor has to take some leadership and pulling together county and municipal elected officials have to talk about growth management and goes management policies for the state all growth is not good growth\nYou don't have a dirty word in politics right well I ... it can be I mean unfortunately for the people who are in control now that's a place by what you don't go\nBut because I've been at the local level now for Fifteen Years had been intimately involved in community planning an outgrowth management policies we didn't want to have to continue incentivizing growth further and further out\nWithout the appropriate sewer system the appropriate urban infrastructure to accommodate it\nAnd when that happens obvious you add more impervious surface or there's more runoff\nA more nitrate going into the ground and to the ground water and it creates the kind of high level of nutrients that we see polluting Lake Okeechobee and other waters rivers streams\nMass transit is kind of a dirty word in many circles a Tampa Bay is one of the biggest metro areas in the country without any kind of viable light rail and one of the first things the current governor did when he came to office was to ... the high speed rail that's the right way and I went to it but what strip well not ...\nI thought that was a failure of leadership I'll tell ya I don't have anything in common with Donald Trump I'm not seeking commonality there but I Will tell you if the president tries to send me to point eight billion dollars to bill high speed rail I'm going to take it I Will smile I shake his hand and then I'm going to put that money to work for everyday Floridians\nMy opponent when asked about his transportation plan of which is yet to produce a mentioned that he didn't see well as a viable option that he only sees more ... more more roads with the truth is that we cannot asphalt our way out of congestion more lay miles to get more cars\nWe've got to use multi mode all forms of transportation rail light rail high speed rail or have you ever tried to plan a trip from Tampa Orlando with any sense of predictability it depends on the day that time a day and you're a trip could go from two and a half hours you know did God

person there wasn't a single poll showing me leading in the primary election and so this and the only poll that matters is the one on election day so folks had the opportunity to get out there but we can't have the kind of stick that we want\nUnless people get out there and vote that being said I feel all the energy in the world I feel the wind at our bags I Believe that we're going to flip this state for the first time in Twenty years\nAnd then the hard part begins and that's the process of governing of reversing what has been Twenty years of environmental degradation ignorance when it comes to our affordable housing prices\nAre twenty first century transportation that needs to be built in this state challenges a really great and the money to every single Floridian that I can muster the

threat of terrorism have been potent rhetorical weapons for Donald Trump since he first launched his White House campaign more than three years ago\nHe believes and there is some polling data to

stretch of the midterm campaign\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nSo third on that Leslie was a tax cuts which I think a lot of mainstream Republicans thought would be the first thing that that tax cut they passed in twenty Seventeen but we haven't been hearing too much about what's going on\nThe ... the tax code has not warn terribly well right now is pulling at about forty percent approval uh a lot of people maybe don't feel like they've seen a big jump in their own take home pay there's also been some renewed attention paid to the federal deficit which has ballooned as corporate tax revenue shrank\nThe president believes he has a fix for this though and it's another tax cut I Want to play a piece of tape from his rally in Houston last night already but I have to warn you take this message with a big grain of salt\nWhere are you going to be a first tax cuts for middle income families is going to be [noise]\nOr whatever you might think about the merits of another tax cut Congress certainly is not going to take any action on that next week they're not even session until after the election and what's more nobody outside the White House seems to know what the president is talking about the head of the house ways and Means Committee belatedly put out a statement this afternoon saying he's willing to work with the president over the coming weeks\nBy the way additional

NPR\nNews this is all things considered ... Chang and I'm Audie Cornish strict voting laws are putting some states in the headlines this election year in\nGeorgia fifty three thousand voter applications were placed on hold because the names didn't exactly match names on IDs and North Dakota law requiring voter id needs to include street address it has also gotten attention\nManner breads considers these examples of policies that can suppress voter turnout especially in minority communities\nShe's the head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project I asked her about how voting laws have changed over the last decade\nOur country has a trajectory of expanding the right to vote but we saw in\nRight after the ... election was efforts across the country to make it harder to vote we saw bill being introduced from coast to coast I'm In state houses that would have put barriers in front of the ballot box for many Americans it is harder to register and vote than it was prior to twenty ten\nAlright so to begin to help us understand the range of a legislation what are we seeing from states in terms of how they're dealing with voting now\nWe have had some states are messed around with their polling locations closed polling locations and move them we see states imposing strict photo identification laws uh\nMeaning that people are going to need to prove that specific kinds of ideas in order to be able to cast a ballot\nThat will count we're seeing states not providing equal access to commonsense things like a polling location near them or around them a twenty Eighteen it's going to be a challenging time for a number of voters but they should not be deterred\nAnother issue I've been reading a lot about is this idea of purging what do these laws to look like how are they justified\nPurging has a practice of removing voters from the role um some of that is set forth through law but some of it it's just the policies and the ways that election administrators conduct their bed nets\nUm what we have discovered is that an increasing number of Americans are getting purged from the rolls that were sixteen million people purged uh between twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen we're seeing some states like Georgia purge up to one tenth of the number of people that are\nOn his role some cases when they're doing this are they saying look this person had been voted and to intervene cycle or look we're not sure if this person still lives at the same address I mean is it described as the administrative effort and\nWe want election administrators to do the regular cleaning\nWant election administrators to do the regular cleaning up our voter rolls\nThe problem with purging is that we see too many election administrators use sloppy procedures and the voters are finding out that they're being purge way too late um critically we're also seeing that purging is happening in states that used to\nBe required under the voting rights act to be able to demonstrate that there are election processors we're not going to be discriminatory and we're saying that those areas are having an even higher increasing the number of people that are being perch from the rolls\n[noise] um even calling and voter suppression um do the courts agree with so many laws in place it seems like maybe there is an open door to all these kinds of laws around voting\nUp many of\nThe strictest laws have been a blunted by courts overtime to London but not overturned or an hour it's aren't seeing it as depression and yet I I think I Would push back a little bit on that I think we're talking about a matter of degree so for example the photo id law in Texas that was a\nAn acted in two thousand eleven looks really really different than the photo id law\nThat is on the books now and the same thing in North Dakota so some courts are stepping in and saying some of these policies are are too much um but they're not going all the way and saying that these policies can't exist in any form\nUm many Americans especially Americans that have traditionally had their rights to vote surprised her very very resilient and very determined to overcome it but having said that these laws are going to depress turn out in a way that we wouldn't have seen if these laws hadn't existed in the first place\n[noise] you know ... is head of NYU's Brennan centers voting rights and elections project thank you for speaking with all things considered\nThank you [noise] there are few subjects that can divide families more quickly than politics can mother against father father against sun sun against daughter well you get the idea\nAnd then there's this kitty wells relatives of Adam ... published an op ed against him saying the Republican is not fit to be governor of now

years I don't think people want to be represented by someone wish will come on horse\nThat's one of many reasons why I voted for Brian style for Congress\nThe ads seems pretty typical as political attack ads go and it is except that the person speaking is the brother of styles democratic opponent Randy Bryce Joseph ... is a democratic strategist in Wisconsin He says the ad reflects a political attitude in the state and across the country that's become more nasty and polarizing\nWe heard about the art of Harvard yeah but what's happening with jobs were divisive politics as literally as a family member tips but I'm a nurse and I went wow you're that is really just started we added cost public where\nYour techie says this kind of ad is bad for candidates and voters because it makes elections less about issues and more about candidates personal life and Randy Bryce isn't alone in facing this sort of attack and Arizona Republican Congressman Paul ghosts are six siblings filmed an ad against him this election year as well\nIs our Jennifer gold star pogo SARS my brother my brother and I indoors\nThose are Jennifer Gulf star pogo SARS my brother my brother and I endorsed Dr ... doctor bill wholeheartedly\nGoes by responded to that ad by calling his siblings disgruntled Hillary supporters who put political ideology before family he said Stalin would be proud\nThese ads may be the most public display of family feud over politics but sites like them are happening more and more across America even when a sibling isn't running for Congress\nDr Keith ... professor of behavioral economics at UCLA and co author of politics gets personal effects of political partisanship an advertising on family ties\nWe don't actually have very good survey data on how often it is that families have kind of like deep partisan splits within them we do know that it's becoming more common\nGenerally to study last year the cell phone data to compare the length of Thanksgiving dinners after twenty six teams breathing presidential election to the link them dinners the previous year\nFamilies that voted differently in swing states actually solve reduction over an hour and a half like shorter Thanksgiving dinner and twenty sixteen than in twenty Fifteen\nTen says the more political ads that ran the shorter the family dinners got and perhaps unsurprisingly the people who seem most hurt by these conflicts aren't the partisans on either side it's the family members caught in the middle\nIn Arizona eighty five year old Bernadette goats are told the New York times that she was shocked and crushed by the things except for children's set about their brother in the attack ad in Wisconsin the price brothers mother Nancy released a letter asking the pack behind the ads to take

Pete dot com coming up this evening at six thirty we hope you'll join us for Florida matters on this week's program we're talking about how the state's film industry has fared since it entered the tax incentive program in twenty sixteen\nExperts say Florida has seen a decline in film and television production often losing out to places that still offers state incentives like Georgia but the industry continues to survive due in part to filmmakers passionate about the states and counties that offer their own incentives\nIn this preview host Robin ... talks about what's working for the state with Jimmy ... published a two part series on the film industry this week but the Sarasota Herald Tribune\nTony stopper in Sarasota based filmmaker and Hillsborough County film commissioner Tyler marked in old age\nSpeaking specifically for Hillsborough County where one of the largest commercial markets in the state and we're certainly one of the larger markets in the United states as far as commercial productions not feature films TV series but commercials you look at our\nHere locally the way it was written was specifically to engage with high impact commercials and TV series that has some longevity to them and the last two years we've incentivized a discovery network's a TV show called St science\nUm we've also had night watch and several other fairly well known TV series shoot here either in whole or in part or we have a lot of reality t._v. series that\nShoot here either in whole or in part uh we have a lot of reality t._v. series that shoot here a party down south I Need a fiance I mean we are so many different reality shows like to to film here as because one why is\nThere a your nation it could be are interesting characters we ... a locally but it's also just a beautiful weather you have to keep in mind that production schedules are very tight and if I'm having to worry about a snowstorm in March when I needed to look spraying happy and fun I Can't shoot that necessarily in Chicago or New York or anywhere in the mid west\nSo I'm going to come here I say this and I wouldn't put this on a postcard but but Hillsborough county's biggest asset is the banality of Hillsborough County we don't have anything necessarily iconic on film that would identify us as being Tampa our downtown to look like any downtown\nI I Want you to Tony follow up on that because you think the weather is a big draw\nA shot five films in Florida and I've relied on the natural beauty and the the weather that allows me to be outside from now until June and that's a that's a production window that's that's pretty rare\nWhat else decides whether um is there a labor pool that you find a track if\nThere is I I'm a filmmaker they've got to tap into maybe five commissions to

interviews\nAnd people were filming here because it was Florida and they were drawn to wait for their creative inspiration I think you had one quote where you said the clash of cultures between retirees criminals beach bombs I'm paraphrasing but I thought it was perfect\nYeah I think Tony would probably met his film is kind of unusual in that most people that are filming here now they're filming because they don't have the budget or something like a Ben Affleck slip by night which could go to Georgia\nAnd could create literally a fake replica ... city like most of these productions do not have those millions of dollars so they need to come here to Florida to shoot what they're interested in whether that's a Liberty City neighborhood and moon line whether that's the strip of motels
