life\nConducted by NPR the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Harvard th Chan School of public health more than half of those surveyed said said the news someone personally affected by suicide\nBut eight world mountain west states are among the pen us states with the highest suicide rate [noise] NPR's Kirk Siegler visited one town Grand Junction Colorado which is trying to do something about it\nAt the confluence of the Gunnison and Colorado rivers Grand Junction sits in a bowl of valley ringed by tall mountains desert masons and red rock lifts you\nCan see how someone who is struggling could feel a little trapped year this is how Seventeen year old Victoria Mendoza describes it\nAnd we can't really fix it because it's nature but the surrounding now and I feel like the people in our valley feel like there is only life inside in Grand junction\nMendoza has battled with depression runs in her family the first funeral she ever went to was a little girl was for an uncle who died by suicide\nThings got really hard a couple of years ago when there was a rash of teen suicide seven over a school year one was a student Mendoza knew from being in band together at another high school student killed himself in the parking lot in front of a crowd\nHonestly it it kind of felt like there was like this cloud around our whole valley [noise] we were just kind of anticipating the next one and it got to a point where we were just like waiting for the next one\nBefore it became such a public crisis suicide was stigmatized in this valley that's long been a problem across the rural west it's that cowboys stereotype of self reliance that runs deep\nYou know pick up a by your bootstraps mentality\nCaffeine evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently\nCity and caffeine evil has worked in the school district for Thirty years most recently helping at risk kids I think that we unfortunately [noise] think of\nMental illness instead of mental health and it's a rural area and there aren't as many resources Grand Junction does have a small mental health hospital but it's the only one between Salt Lake city in Denver I think there's also the issue of\nAccess to guns and I'm not ... I mean that's not a political statement one way or another we have guns in our home 'cause my boy hunt but I think the accessibility makes a difference\nRegardless of the causes ... says that after those teen suicides of twenty sixteen and Seventeen the school district was forced to act the old way wasn't working\nVictorian in doses that first kids were told not to talk about the suicide or publicly memorialize the victims the thinking was that there would be copycats or students might not get good advice if they talk to adults who weren't trained and that was frustrating for Mendoza\nAnd it kind of just made a division between all of us because we were all scared to even say anything about it\nFast forward to today and things appear to be changing Mendoza who's now a senior is one of dozens of pure mentors and the districts news sources of strength suicide prevention program oh she's trained to be a gatekeeper to recognize when fellow students could be in trouble\nBut these are not junior psychologists but the idea is that someone like men do some might be more approachable to a kid at first and also that she may be able to recognize someone who is struggling earlier on and connect them to help\nA lot of this came from the students who demanded action\nWe realize that we didn't really have any mentors to go to um especially if we personally were affected by the two sides\nAlongside the mentors the school district also hired a suicide prevention coordinator to work in the schools full time every employee from teachers to bus drivers now has to have mandatory suicide prevention training every year\nWhat are the warning signs and kids how to respond and talk about mental health and starting in the sixth grade all students have to have a similar training and lately they're starting even earlier in\nClassrooms with a mental health resiliency curriculum beginning in grades [noise]\nAt fortune ... middle school eighth grader ... in the

speaking out about her family's trauma at school because suicide shouldn't be taboo\nIt's got to share that like I've shared it a lot easier and if it helps other people hope I don't mind sharing it what's\nGoing on in Grand junction represents a broader shift in thinking in the public health world\nThe ideas that you go way quote upstream and try to tackle the problem like suicide by focusing in its\nRoots in this case the mental health and wellbeing of every kid and for that matter the entire town in the schools people in the front line down confident that this was going to work\nDown in the schools people in the front line down confident that this is going to work though it could take years one person in the communities watching all of this is Carissa tool she had two daughters and a high school here six years ago she lost her husband as suicide\nThe idea of of having 'em up here or someone who is supporting you who had been through that experience I think it's incredibly valuable because um you're traumatized you don't know which way to turn\nSouls husband grew up here he was captain of its high school's football team valedictorian a pilot in the Gulf War later he was a dad competitive bike racer he was a community leader seems a pillar\nSuicide had no no boundaries I'm even in beautiful places with incredibly successful active healthy people\nSo says her town and others in the Colorado mountains have come a long way and even just talking about suicide since her husband's death\nOh gosh I guess that's a double edged sword I guess it's so common here that hurts so many people in the community who are struck by it in one way or another\nSuicide is most common here among older men likes tools husband or lily leaves dad and uncle and the mirrors and national trend in Grand junction there are prevention programs aimed at this demographic like a project in gun shops\nBut really the bulk and focus of a lot of the resources is in the schools Genevieve Morris has the school districts news suicide prevention coordinator\nWhy are we focusing on you [noise] um well you\nHaven't super powerful voice they have the most powerful voice research tells us when it comes to
