going to return to a difficult and for some people a traumatic subject that's been much in the news we're talking here about sexual abuse we're finally starting to hear from women and some men who've experienced this far more rare though are stories from people who have witnessed sexual abuse and stayed silent about it\nDon ... was in high school when he attended a party\nAnd he says he saw a young woman being raped through a window that was in Nineteen sixty nine and over the Next Fifty years ... says he didn't do anything about it but the guilt stayed with him and after talking to his wife and sons about it he decided to write about it for the Washington Post\nAnd ... is with us now from his home in the Pittsburgh area Mr primary thanks so much for talking with us thank you you wrote this piece after Christie ... testified about what she says that now Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh did to her when they were both in high school is that what made you want to write this piece after all these years\nYes that's what motivated me I watched her testimony and I thought it was genuine you know I felt she was really telling the truth plus ah the things that she forgot wore the same things I forgot you know so I said well I'm going to just write something that my experience which was very similar\nI did something bad I said in the article I committed a crime and I did\n[noise] you know what you wrote it's hard to read and you know for some people are going to be hard to hear about this so this is where again I'm going to say that for some people if this is too much to listen to you than you know take a minute and step away from it but I'm going to ask you to recount for me what it is that you said that you saw and you were at a party right\nLet me start by saying this was an unusual event for me because I never went to parties never so I I don't even know why when\nI I didn't know anybody that all of a sudden a kid came upstairs and said hey\nGo outside and look through the basement window to about ten of us went out there and I happen to be right in front of the window and I'm watching and as soon as I look through the window I see a a girl lying on a sofa she looked like he was passed out\nAnd so the kid went down and he looked up to us any waves to us and he starts smiling and\nThen he starts to take her genes off many he he took her paintings off\nAnd then he he pulled on his than any\nHe took her paintings off and then he he pulled honest than any one on top of her and as soon as he did that he was starting to have sex with her she kind of came to and started hitting him on the shoulders he jumps up right away\nAnd all of us out at at that window was outside we all just started to run ...\nYou also write that you and other boys with the party started touching another young woman who was\nAlso passed out on the on a bad but then you you left\nYet this was later maybe twenty minutes to thirty minutes later a\nShe was laying on the bed and uh what one kid was doing was when the lights were out everybody wants touching her he would turn the lights on and everybody would pretend like they weren't touching her and they probably did this four or five times I touched her leg at one point and and that was all I did but uh it was enough\nYou know you wrote about why you think that the girls would never have said anything about this they would have been blamed in shame they would have been told it's your\nFault [noise] but you never said anything either why do you think that is\nA [noise] you know I I think I wanted to forget about it and plus later on it was just just plain guilt you when you're guilty about something and I was guilty and I admitted in in any article or you you don't want to tell anyone\nOne of the things about your piece a sink struck a lot of us was that you said I wanted to tell this story because I Believe it's time for men to tell the truth about the ways they've abused women and what role has been in creating a culture that tolerates that we've all seen things we've all heard other men\nTalk and you wrote about a couple of examples where you just heard people say these crazy things and you know nobody did anything and why do you have a sense like why do you think that is that why do you think this has been tolerated so long\nI I don't know I I don't know why we've kept quiet I had a quote from somebody some man who said that it would be easier to admit that you committed a murder instead of admitting you committed a sexual assault\nAnd uh I I Can't answer I don't I don't know I I I really don't know why men have been silent on this issue but I think men should be part of the me too movement I think we should come forward in a\nTalk about what we've seen what we've done I think that should be part of it\n[noise] how did your family take it when you told them\n[noise] well [laughter] let let me tell you when I originally told my wife I told her just the rate part that I witnessed\nI did not tell her my participation she didn't know that for this article came out ... let me just say it's a it was tough for her to say let me tell ya but everything's okay now everything's good and how did you explain that to your boys [noise] well\nJust I was truthful with him and uh they were very receptive\nOn their dad you know that can you know we we kinda can't do too much from in the in the eyes of our\nKids are they both told me that my two older boys they don't think it would happen now they said everybody at that window would have had their phones out videotaping it that's what they too but that\nDoesn't mean it wouldn't have had what are they saying they yeah I mean but in that sense that kid wouldn't have done it 'cause he wouldn't have wanted to be on film\nYou say well we film everything you know what they would kind of alluding to\nWell how do you feel now but you got it off your chest\nYou know [laughter] and I have mixed feelings I'll be honest here or there are days when I regret it and then there are days\nBe honest there there are days when I regret it\nAnd then there are days that I'm Glad I did\nYou know my kids showed me some comments on Twitter from people some women have said it's about time someone ... it's almost as if I was the first guy to admit that a lot of women ah said ah they were glad I did it they felt better about themselves a few women who have been actually a\nSalted who wrote notes to me said that they made them feel better and so that made me feel kind of good in\nYour piece was very moving and I one of the things I think I was like every paragraph of it I could call it but the fact that you think about these women I mean now and you wonder\nWhat happened to them like how this affected their lives I mean if if you could say anything to them if by some miracle they were listening [laughter] what would you what would you say\nThe only thing I can say is I'm Sorry I didn't help uh\nYou know few women had called me a he will but no I wasn't I Would have been a hero if either help\nThese women then but I didn't do it done hammering thank you so much for talking with us thank you\nIn recent

Scott thanks so much for talking with us\nThank you so much for having me and my show really appreciate if\nThat's my understanding of the youth you never talked with him after the the murder\nBut he authorized his attorney to speak with you it's my understanding from your reporting that to this day he's still denies that he was planning a murder he said that was a drug deal gone wrong in essence he says that he was a coward not a killer that he thought that van Brett Watkins is trying to kill him\nAnd he left the scene but that he didn't do anything it's about is that about right\nYes van Brett Watkins was the hit man that treats hired to commit the murder or you know drive by shootings sort of situation\nAnd creates yes I have spoken to them on the phone for about twenty minutes but
