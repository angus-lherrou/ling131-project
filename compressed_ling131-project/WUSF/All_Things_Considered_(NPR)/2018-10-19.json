[noise]\nWe should underscore that there's really no evidence to back up this conspiracy theory that that he's been able to offer a but you know the reason that he is talking about this and talking

basically this is just an effort to rally the Republican base to get out and vote yeah and the evidence is that it's a winning issue a there are two new polls from Pew that are out\nA defined that illegal immigration is an incredibly salient issue among those who plan to vote Republican in the upcoming elections they asked about twenty different issues facing the country\nAnd those supporting Republicans intimate terms uh Seventy five percent of them say that they consider illegal immigration to be a very big issue Jocelyn Kiley is associate director of research at the Pew Research center you can see that uh there's energy\nA among Republican voters around the issue of immigration and that energy is most pronounced within the set of Republican voters who are really focused on border security and law enforcement\nAnd so how do we know this is a base play\nIllegal immigration in the way that President Trump talks about it is simply not a priority issue in the same way for Democrats

Cay welcome thank you it's good to be her\nWalk me through how this would work court kind of team would you need to pull together to investigate ... disappearance and perhaps murder\nYou know it's possible to look back at different example of how the un has done this before\nWe've seen in the past the U.N Security council or the human rights council essentially appoint a small group of experts maybe led by a former prosecutor and they could evaluate the evidence they should get access to the conflict they should get access to whatever\nTurkey has and they would conduct an evaluation they could do it pretty quickly\nI think we're talking a team of what size roughly theoretically\nTheoretically maximum five people\nI'm curious about some of the practicalities of how this would work could show she disappeared and allegedly was murdered Seventeen Days ago we said the reported crime scene is in Turkey it's out that Saudi consulate\nAre you confident you would get access to the places you need to go to people you need to talk to to do a credible investigation\nIt's I mean it's a great question of course with you know the two weeks plus that if passed getting access to the consulate or to the um the consul general to started consul general's\nHouse getting access to those places would be very difficult and even with the time passed it might not even be as relevant but getting access to the material that the Turks have collected I think that would all make it kind of investigative report that would not be based simply on leading to the press or on the information from intelligence\nYou're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities\n... agencies you're talking about getting direct access to the tapes that Turkish authorities say they have yes absolutely do you have authority to compel the church to hand over everything they say they have\nWell if the Security Council authorized this kind of investigation that kind of power could be brought to bear I don't expect that will happen and then what happened\nAt the end of such an investigation is it binding could Saudi Arabia could the U.S just decide to ignore or whatever you find\nOf course they could ignore it I think that would be something that you might even expect to happen certainly from the Saudis are there would be no binding quality to an investigative report what it would be I think\nIs a credible independent investigation something that the Saudis can't do because they can't investigate themselves the U.S\nEvidently can't do because it's been a resisting and in a way protecting or the Saudi Saudi officials so if you would have this kind of\nA report it would be credible you'd be independent and then it would be up to the states and to international organizations to decide what to do with the information but as it stands right now we're left with a simply reports in the press and ideas of\nThe Saudis blaming somebody and and the government and it seems that the U.S would be willing to just go along with that and that's not that's not a credible investigation\n[laughter] so you say you can do this to say you want to do those why isn't it happening\nWell that's a that's a very good question I mean it should happen there's a lot of politics around that the human rights council earlier this month adopted a resolution that was advocating for the safety of journalists and was advocating for holding people accountable when journalists are attacked it was sponsored by\nA number of states those included states like France um those are the states that I Would look to first uh to to move this kind of thing forward\nDavid Cay he is un special ... on freedom of opinion and expression thanks very much thank you [noise]\n\nIt is NPR News

F. dot org [noise]\nOf the show that people focus too much on the people calling from Mexicali\nSeparating families isn't the way to do on paper it doesn't look good on the news that doesn't look good\nOne you know I'm I'm a Republican born and raised the tournament parents are from Mexico\nAnd this is an issue where I go side with with my party a little bit and the reason for that is one yes we are a nation of laws but I've been to the country and opportunity but I Know that our party has had somewhat of a bad label but there are Republicans who are supportive of immigration reform there are Republicans of smart in central immigration form and I'm One of them\nI'm One of them\nI ask ... if he thinks the Republican Party's position on immigration needs to change to attract more Latino voters\nI Believe we need a realistic um position on immigration law and that includes border security one that legalized who the people who are here who want to work hard we're looking for opportunities\nAnd wouldn't eat increase the number of these people who are coming here so we're not in this problem again and it doesn't become a political football ten years from now\nThat sounds like a different platform than the one the Trump Administration especially\nI'm a I'm going to continue pushing my tradition in that position it but I just mentioned\nThat independence from the White House is something you hear a lot from Arizona Republican who are trying to appeal to the Latino electorate like you hear it from Republican governor Doug juicy who's running for reelection this year against\nA Latino candidate I'm not here to rationalize what's going on in Washington DC I'm the chief executive of the state of Arizona I Can't be in control of what happens is back east still I asked you see if the Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters you will\nThe Republican Party has a perception problem with Latino voters you will hear me using the word Republican are you in the reelection are struggling to see on the ballot and its Doug ... agenda\nJuicy hired a Democrat to lead his outreach efforts to Latino voters\nA guy named Mario Diaz who's a former campaign manager for several prominent Democrats including Janet Napolitano and John Kerry it wouldn't be as to approach do the for the job because the I think over the past four years the governor's done a lot to move away from the divisive politics of Arizona's recent\nThe governor does not support during language doesn't support certain policies\nThe national Republican mood and may may call for he is not suggesting on border security\nThat we need to stop them when you to keep them out we need to build a wall not one to do that now I cannot vouch for other Republicans I Am voting for Doug juice\nBut under that logic if Republicans want to appeal party why to Latino voters they will have to separate the party from the Trump administration's rhetoric and there are plenty of Latino voters who don't trust them to do that\nLike Abel Hernandez remember him the truck driver who says immigrations that deal breaker for Hispanics here's the key Hernandez says his kids are going to feel the same way he does\nHe was going to see how they treat us and\nSo my kids you got to vote you get a boy you got to vote and they said that we were ready to go where they were over\nIn other words turn out that\nThe Republican Party states may already be field for generations to come and as a sign of just how hard it is for Arizona Republican to separate themselves from the broader party

amazes me for so many people ... and we actually put them in we constantly get emails is\nI've met more people are having Twenty years people are always happy my favorite thing to do is sit on my porch and read a book and watch people from the library\nWhat do you think it was about the little libraries that attracted people when all of us have libraries big libraries that we could go to\nTodd

especially those that had to do with the news for people who didn't normally read getting reading\nTell me about some of the places where these libraries now are too much of the wild or places where I Would not expect to find a little library\nIn some places where there has been either violence or disaster these little free library has come out and sort of a little spring of hope\nAlong the U.S Mexico border there's a hundred and fifty of them on in print in Wisconsin and other states and they can while the refugee settlement in western Uganda at a hospital in Ireland we're schoolyard and South Sudan these little free libraries have\nUp and brought communities together\nPeople of course take books for the little libraries but you also get to leave them I have to say that's what I Love

I'm going somewhere if I feel a little free library and I want to put a book in there you can share that love of reading with another community whether it's your own or somewhere else\nYou were in touch with Todd ... when he was in hospice does he feel like he'd done what he set out to do\nWell I mean there's so much more to what he's doing than being a champion from book or for reading he was
