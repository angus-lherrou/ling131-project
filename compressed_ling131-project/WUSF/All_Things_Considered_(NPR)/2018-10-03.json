thanks\nThis is all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I'd also Chang in the weeks since Christine Blasey Ford acute Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh sexual assault President Trump's response has been relatively restraint\nThat changed completely last night when President Trump mocked Ford at a rally in Mississippi\nHow did you get home I don't remember how'd you get there I don't remember when I don't remember how many do want to go in\nAnd day in the White House briefing room press secretary Sarah Sanders defended the president's comments NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben has been following the president's response to all of this controversy and she joins us now Hey Daniel hello\nSo as we noted the president's tone it shifted dramatically last night and I just want to start out by talking about how his comment last night compared to how he's been talking about Ford up until last night\nSure so late last week after Christine blocks\nUntil last night sure so late last week after Christine Blasey Ford and Brett Kavanaugh testified before the Senate Judiciary committee Trump had taken a much softer tone towards Christine Blasey Ford\nVote or just a motor users can do it for the first woman now he\nSeems to be sort of you into the line that congressional Republicans seemed to be doing to which was something to the effect of Christine Blasey Ford seems credible but you know maybe she's mistaken or I Wish we had more corroborating evidence but a lot of them use that key word credible\nThen last night she got up in front of the crowd and he he was mimicking her and the fact that you know she can't remember every single thing that happened that night so he was really divergent from that line and he was playing it to laugh than cheers from that audience yeah you can hear the tape yet and so that has people really upset today some\nHow their response has been in the Senate because to get Kavanaugh through the Senate Republicans are focusing on two key senators Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine how either of those two women responded to Trump's comments from last night\nRight well they're not happy or Lisa Murkowski has said her words were that it's inappropriate and unacceptable and that Trump's comments could sway her vote now Susan Collins likewise she told CNN that it was quote just plain wrong what Trump said and she wouldn't say if it would affect her vote\nYou know one thing that has been swirling in the middle of all of this is the fact that Trump has talked about how he actually emphasizes with Kavanaugh because he himself has been accused of sexual assault of sexual misconduct\nAbsolutely he has more than a dozen accusations of misconduct against him and like Brett Kavanaugh Trump is denying all of the allegations against him but that's not the only echo here I mean let's look at how Trump has responded to those allegations likewise\nAnd one of those allegations against Trump Jessica leads that woman who said he hadn't groped her on an airplane decades ago he also mocked her after that allegation came out the quote that he said was she wouldn't be my first choice she likewise said that to a crowd the crowd likewise laughter cheered\nAnd you know he was really he really seem to be saying she's an attractive and that wouldn't have happened there for so the important thing that we're trying to get out here though is that we have a pet or not only of how Trump reacts to sexual misconduct allegations\nWell not only was last September the hottest September since records started being kept in Eighteen Ninety it was the hottest months since records started being kept in coming up on all things considered we'll be talking with meteorologist Jeff Hoffman about

will spare carmakers from some of the terrorists but they had feared\nAnd will finish senior vice president of the motor and equipment Manufacturers Association which represents more than a thousand companies and make auto parts you're in the U.S thanks for joining us journal things considered thank you very glad to be with you to begin with what you just described for listeners what you remember companies making and where you are in the auto making supply chain\nSo our members make the vast majority of the content for new vehicles and we also manufacture parts and components for maintenance and repair\nAnd how much was on the line for you in this trade agreement where you're holding your breath to see what the details would be\nWell our industry has actually done quite well injured after we've actually been able to grow our supply chain in North America we've been able to grow manufacturing jobs\nIn the United states but it counts in all three countries being part of the agreement so we are very pleased relieved that all three parties were able to come to an agreement this weekend we're cautiously optimistic that the terms of the Green Belt will work for the industry and for the American public\nWhen you look at the details of the agreement can you tell how it compares to NAFTA for you\nWell there's going to be an increase in the amount of North American content that will be required\nFor parts to travel through the three countries are going to have to call it the U.S Mexico Canada agreement but traveled through North America without having to pay tariffs there's going to be a requirement for more North American steel and aluminum [noise]\nAh so all of that will impact our members and in addition there's going to be some new\nAdministrative costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have\nA ministry of costs that are going to be required one of the concerns we have though are there some new tariffs out there right now on steel and aluminum and we'd like to see Canada and the United states addressed that before the final ISIS agreement and the end of November\nTo one the one hand there won't be terrible for material crossing Canada U.S Mexico border is on the other hand the steel and aluminum tariffs that were of construct your industry have not gone away\nNo they have and I think one of the things we have the mind as they have been a particular burden to smaller manufacturers many of these smaller manufacturers are only in the U.S\nAnd some of our members have seen the cost of their skill purchases ride almost fifty percent so this is their significant increase its for typically of concern between Canada and the United states we'd like to see those two countries roll up the phrase same energy they use to conclude that\nThis new NAFTA and be able to come to some kind of agreement on steel and aluminum tariffs\nI Know that there's a lot of relief from the auto industry now that the uncertainty is gone but how does this compare to the old rules under NAFTA isn't an improvement is worse well\nI think for the United states perspective one of the things the United states they will pull through was an increase in the U.S content and for some of our suppliers and some component manufacturers this is going to be a challenge there is no doubt about that\nI Do think that we're going to see more film or a woman that's from North America and our vehicles the biggest concern our members are going to have the administrative costs\nAnd we're gonna have to work really hard with all three parties can minimize those costs because consumers are going to get any value out of it and that's going to be our next a real challenge fits we move forward that Greenland\nAnd Wilson is senior vice president of the motor on

Trump said was kind of appalling\nOf course all along Senate Republicans have distanced themselves from Trump's comments which we send them back to the agenda is the question is whether this time will be any different Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski is one of those other key undecided vote today she indicated maybe it could be\n[noise] I and taking everything into account and I think that the president yesterday marking Dr Ford were wholly inappropriate and in my view unacceptable for taking\nEverything into account is is the key framing their Murkowski has made it clear she thinks a big part of this is treating women with respect listening tone to them when they come forward with allegations so she is certainly someone to watch if the president keeps attacking Ford head on\nAnd have any of these key senators said anything about the scope of the FBI investigation and whether or not hearing from either Kavanaugh or Ford again is the problem\nLots of sunshine ... about Ninety three

considered ... and I'm Ari Shapiro survivors of sexual assault are sharing their stories money for the first time Washington Post columnist Monica ... has been getting a steady stream of them in her inbox\nAt our latest column has the headline deer dodge your daughters told me about their assaults this is why they never told you\nMany people have been sharing the column on line that I spoke with Monica ... about it earlier today\nI like a lot of journalists probably today had been getting a lot of survivors wanting to share their stories of sexual assault\nAnd what would notable to me is how many of them had a common thread of the one person I've never told if my dad I don't think he could handle this and what did they tell you about the reason they never told their father some women said\nI'm afraid to tell my father because I I Know he would kill the men who attacked me and I'm worried he would go to jail\nSome women said I've never seen my father cry and I know that if I told him that would make him cry the someone it did say I'm afraid my father wouldn't believe me and that's that's a whole different strain\nBut a lot of them were really more I think he would believe me but I'm afraid it would just destroy and he thinks it's in the job to protect me and he would feel like he failed\nIt only fathers or are people concerned about telling their mothers as well\n[noise] I did get responses from people concerned about telling their mothers but\nI think often survivors are putting their parents in different categories a lot of when and said I told my mother and learned that she had been a victim to or I told my mother because I thought she would understand what it's like to walk through the world\nAs a young woman and so they they were really afraid that their fathers in particular wouldn't understand on the same level or might yield squeamish or embarrassed to be talking about these kinds of things\nYou write that a lot of taboos in this area exist because women don't want to make men uncomfortable with lady pain explain what you mean by that [noise]\nYou know it just just thinking about tropes in sitcoms where the dad is sent to buy a pack of ... for his daughters or his wife and it's presented as the most humiliating embarrassing journey to the grocery story that he can never make\nWe do that with ... we do that with breast feeding all of these things that happen on a woman's body are seen as being really embarrassing and inappropriate to talk about and I think that that exist on that spectrum where we're afraid to talk about sexual assault because it falls on the spectrum\nOf gross or uncomfortable things that happened to win and [noise] can you tell us\nOr uncomfortable things that happen to women [noise]\nCan you tell us about some of the response was that you have to call them it was published this week [laughter]\nYeah I've received more than five hundred emails in the past twenty four hours but if you don't mind I'll just I'll read you my my favorite response yep please\nDeer Monica thank you for sharing the story I was very moved by them because I'd never even thought of asking those questions\nI shared your call in with my wife for forty years and asked her head this ever happened to her and she told me a story of herself and\nI just listened and inside I broiled I asked her should I ask my daughters and she said do you think you're ready\nI didn't answer but I'll do it soon not today but the next time I see them right now though I'll have a couple of drinks and I'll think I Hope I can be of some comfort semper fi\nWhile so I've gotten a lot of emails like that a lot of emails from dads who are good dads they're just really trying to think about what it means to be a good dad\nI've gotten a lot of emails from men who say I always told my daughter if anyone tries to hurt you own murder them and now I'm rethinking was that the right message to send\nBecause what if that kept her silence because she didn't want me to go to jail for for murdering someone um so I think that these are conversations that have just been happening in secret for really long time\nAnd good men are trying to figure out how to be a part of those conversations and how to be a comfort in them\nAs part of your argument also that it's important for daughters she told her father's about this so that they have a better understanding of what women go through\nI think so I really do and a lot of the feedback that I've been getting are women who are talking to their dad for the first time\nBecause of what we're hearing in the the Kavanaugh for hearings because their fathers had said something like I'm really moved by her testimony but I just don't believe it because if it had really happened she would have told her parents when it happened\nAnd it's causing women to say that it happened to me it happened to me three years ago five years ago Twenty years ago and I didn't tell you and here's why I didn't tell you\nSo if you were a father and you have a selection of how a victim should behave or whether someone would or would not have told someone I think it's really meaningful to hear from women in your life that you're close to who have said\nI grew up in your house you love me more than anyone and I never told you and this is\nWhy [noise] Monica ...

House has responded to your reporting by attacking the New York times and saying that the IRS looked at these arrangements as they were happening and found nothing improper how do you respond to that well\nWe think that's not true um we know there are cases where there was no audit done like all county building that we spoke about the transaction Trump Palace and then the cases where there were audits there's evidence that the Trump didn't give the IRS all the pertinent information about those buildings and that the appraiser\nGrossly undervalued some of the properties\n... is an investigative reporter for the New York times thanks for joining us today Thanks for having me right\nIn New York Times story you just heard it said that Trump's were able to get away with tax dodging for decades and there's no evidence that state or federal officials ever did much about it and NPR's Jim Zarroli reports regulators were either unwilling to take the Trump on orange simply lacked the resources to do sell\nReal estate companies such as the Trump families are famous for finding ways to pare down their tax bills and some of them skirt the law they can understate the value of a property they've acquired for instance\nBut NYU law school professor Daniel ... says the sheer scope of the Trump family's tax and avoidance puts it in a whole other around\nI don't think this is just like oh this is tax finding as usual as one thing to have kind of self serving valuations that are on the global side but it seems to go beyond it\nYet much of what the Trump did apparently went under the radar for years\nThat doesn't surprise pace law school professor Bridget Crawford she says the Internal Revenue service for decades just simply lack the resources to police tax fraud effectively and years of political attacks may have made it reluctant to take on hard cases\nWhere there's a will there's a way and there has been now with\nOne in a hundred tax returns as now audited and Crawford says it's especially easy to do what Fred Trump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children with that\nTrump is alleged to have done pass on assets to your children without them paying much in taxes\nThe fact is that gift tax doesn't raise a lot of ran out so to the extent the IRS cash resources that are not going to be allocating ... tax enforcement\nThe same is true at the state and local level although New York state officials are now investigating the Trump families taxes Crawford says it's taken them far too long to do so\nThat cares to me that the state department of finances and utterly asleep at the wheel for decades when it comes to a ... on the Trump family\nCrawford notes that questions have been raised about the Trump families taxes for years ProPublica has reported that President Trump sold to Manhattan condos to his son Eric for much less than they were worth twenty sixteen\nBut because Trump hasn't released his tax returns it's impossible to say whether Eric Trump paid federal gift taxes as he was required to do but the extent of the activity alleged in yesterday's times story is harder to ignore\nThe question is what regulators can do about it and why use Dan Shapiro says if fraud was committed it's probably too late for the government to pursue a criminal case because of the statute of limitations\nBut severe is that the IRS can always decided to take another look at the Trump returns\nFraud on or turn means that it's never too late to revisit it\nIf the IRS find evidence of wrongdoing severe as it can retroactively force Fred Trump's heirs to pay back taxes and they may have to pay civil fines as well Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\n[noise] and you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\n\nThis is university beat I'm are trying to earn\nMelvin Dandridge is a senior at the University of South Florida saint Petersburg where he's studying accounting and information systems while he was born in the United states he says a lot of people think he's from the Dominican Republic a place he wants to travel to eventually\nI'd like to go actually see what the costs about so it's just going to be like a life changing experience where\nBut another recent experience made him nervous about the process\nBy parents actually just got their passports not too long ago and I saw the process but they went through and it was really hectic\nPlus there's the cost of a passport and if there's one thing accounting has taught Dandridge it's how to budget\nYou kind of figure out what that is a salary and then you tell them to do away with what you don't meet so being able to save money is vital to actually save up and go on trips\nSo Dandridge was thrilled to receive an email from USF education abroad offering free passports to the first one hundred and Seventy five students who signed up and had the proper documentation\nThat's right someone else in this case the council on international education exchange was picking up the one hundred and forty five dollar processing feed\nThe nonprofit group as the country's oldest and largest study abroad organization it's taking its passport caravan to colleges around the country with a goal of giving away ten thousand free passports by twenty twenty\nEric ... manager of institutional relations for the southeast during the caravan stop at USF in September he said his organization targets students who likely haven't thought about studying abroad\nGiving them this passport hopefully it's going to be burning a hole in their pocket and there'll be thinking about oh I've got all these great options that I can get some experience internationally to add to my career here in college\nSnow White the student programs coordinator for us F education abroad says a lot of those experiences our hands on opportunities\nEducation abroad says a lot of those experiences are hams out opportunities that they can't get to the U.S\nOne of our program students go and

the passport give away\nSo I'm actually taking molecular biology for forensics and that's something I've always been interested in in different countries because compared to America's they have a lot more not leniency but better technology over there if that's something that I personally am interested in\nBut beyond the classroom ... looking at the other things international travel provides from cultures\nIt's something that I think we all could do I mean we don't need to stand our little bubbles here in America I think if you have the opportunity to study abroad than I think we should do it you know\nAnd even if students aren't interested in traveling now white says the facts of passports are good for ten years we used them a lot of available opportunities in the future\nYou might not be interested now that you might be in five years you might be in ten years and you never know what opportunity could come up you could be able to just get a new job try something new save up a couple of
