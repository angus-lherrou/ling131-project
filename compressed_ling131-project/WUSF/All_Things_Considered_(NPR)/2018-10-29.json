all those pay their hello [noise] so the White House is of course aware of criticism of the president's words how are they responding\nNot surprisingly White House press secretary Sarah Sanders is defending the president she says he is working to unite the country and that he is showing leadership uh here's some more of what she had to say at the briefing today\nI think the president has a had a number of moments of bringing the country together once again I'll remind you that the very first thing the president did would condemn the attacks on the very first thing the media did was blamed the president\nAnd she's really going on the offensive here she's saying that Ninety percent of the news coverage of the president is negative or even though the country's doing well and that the media bears responsibility for the divisions in the country\nAnd she's she's basically arguing that the president is going to defend himself he's going to highlight these differences between him and his opponents are and and against the media\nUh and she's a doubling the White House really doubling down on his rhetoric even after a these improvised explosives were sent to CNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president came\nCNN last week out what a Sanders is saying is that the president can't be held responsible for the actions of another person who doesn't know personally\nI the thing is are you sure whether you like the president's language or whether you have the president's language he has been consistent with who he is so is there something different about the way it's resonating this time\nIt really seems to be about the timing you you have these kind of back to back\nEvent happening right before a critical election Trump is not known for being able to play this role of the console learning cheap or certainly not the night or in chief uh that's not a natural fit for him I'm and basically what he has done is or when something's happened he says something directly after the ... the tragedy\nUh that is expected um but after his call for unity on Saturday after the synagogue shooting he held a campaign event where he went back to making personal attacks he called out Elizabeth Warren\nUsing just belittling nickname for her\nJob [noise] I guess she doesn't have any Indian but I Am just she does that I have none\nAnd since that rally on Twitter he once again denouncing the price of the enemy of the people\nAnd calling out the Democrat running for governor in Florida Andrew Gillum calling you must be without evidence in many ways like you said this is what his supporters like we expect from him but what his critics argue is that going out to people so personally and and not just saying they're bad on taxes or something like that is that it's inflammatory and that there are consequences to that\nWell you mentioned the mid term what might the consequences beyond the mid term what difference might the president's rhetoric mc\n... it's very hard to tell A People's views the Trump are as seem to be pretty hard and at this point so\nIt will you really don't know whether this is going to change any votes or the risk of course is that maybe some lukewarm vote supporters of Trump could be turned off by the negativity or that his opponents could get really fired up but we'll just have to see what happens next

all things considered from NPR News I'm Ari Shapiro and I'm Mary Louise Kelly the defense department is sending fifty two hundred active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nAs well as an order from President Trump last week when he said the group of migrants from Central America moving toward that border poses a national security threat here's air force general tyrants ... who's in charge of northern command\nReno border security as national security and the U.S military will advance DVDs capability to harden the border\nNPR's Tom Bowman is at the Pentagon and he joins me now Hey Tom hey Mary Louise says something like two thousand National Guard troops deployed to the border rate is this fifty two hundred active duty on top of those exist in two thousand\n[noise] uh just goes beyond the two thousand and those guard troops are providing support duty soldiers transportation aerial surveillance that kind of thing and the guard is not taking part in any law enforcement activities and these additional\nFive thousand or so active duty army troops will also be at a support role you know law enforcement activity no interacting with migrants we're told\nBut this new group of soldiers will provide more support to border patrol of first still do do what's called hardening border entry points in California Arizona and Texas ... barriers more razor wire fencing you're crossing

enforcement duties or their own leaders support role again\nAnd the plus we've come a time this law dates for the post civil war era in the Eighteen seventies and that was a reaction to federal troops being used and former Confederate States and that law prohibits the military from engaging in any law enforcement activities so officials say they're well aware of the restrictions on these troops\nUm you mentioned that these troops are not are going to have contact with\nHum you mentioned that these troops are not are going to have contact with migrants will they be armed\nWill some of them will be armed do they say those who would normally carry arms will continue to carry arms they didn't specify exactly who but clearly military police would be carrying arms as far as which others would it be carrying arms or any others are we just don't know at this point they didn't specify\nOkay what's the precedent for this job for sending five thousand active duty troops to the U.S Mexico border\nUh I don't recall the president presented the active duty troops have been some sits in the past and again in a support role\nIn this case you know it's pretty large number it's called operation faithful patriot these troops who were doing everything you're getting from constructing camps flying border patrol agents\nSoviet engineers planners military police pilots medical personnel cooks\nEven lawyers in public or the staff and a a good general or showed us he was asked well wait a minute why is this being done you're talking about the ... the same number of troops now in Iraq
