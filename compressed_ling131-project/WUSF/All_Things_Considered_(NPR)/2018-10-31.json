Shapiro President Trump says he wants to force China to stop abusive trade practices by slapping tariffs on billions of dollars in Chinese imports one problem is that the value of China's currency has been dropping this year which is under cutting the tariffs impact NPR's Jim Zarroli explains\nPresident Trump of course likes to boast about the strong US Economy and all the good things it means for the United states\nWe are the economic envy of the entire world when I meet the leaders of countries the first thing they say invariably is Mr President so nice to meet you congratulations on your economy\nBut the sizzling economy also means something else the U.S dollar just keeps getting stronger it's up against the euro the end the peso just about every major currency here is David dollar yes that is his name who was economic emissary to China in the Obama Treasury Department\nThis is actually a worldwide phenomenon the dollar is up about seven or eight percent on average against all our trading partners\nAnd the dollar is really gaining ground against China's you on a dollar would have gotten you six point to you on in late march today it gets you nearly seven it's the lowest it's been in a decade Linda Lim and economist at the University of Michigan says the drop in the yuan raises questions\nWhen you're on falls it's because people are selling it and buying dollar right and so the question is why they selling it and buy dollars\nAnd Lim says there are several answers for one thing the fed is raising interest rates which makes us investments like treasury debt more lucrative so people want to buy more us assets and to do that they need dollars dollars are in demand meanwhile China's economy is slowing and so its currency is weaker\nThe strong dollar means that Americans can buy more from overseas especially from China and they are says David dollar\nSo you actually see the U.S trade deficit rising very rapidly this year trade deficits up about ten percent year on year\nThe strong dollar also has an impact on President Trump's trade agenda the president placed tariffs on Chinese goods to make the more expensive so Americans wouldn't buy as many it was a way of putting pressure on the Chinese economy but the stronger dollar then makes them cheaper says Linda Lim\nThe cameras I'll watch will increase the cost of Chinese goods in the U.S that we couldn't\nBrief the costs of Chinese goods in the U.S [noise] the we couldn't stay well partly counteracted\nTrump has so far imposed tariffs of ten percent on two hundred and fifty billion dollars in Chinese imports but the yuan has fallen that much in the spring which launched their impact Lim says the following you on may also have another impact\nForeign companies that have been thinking about investing in China will now find a cheaper to do so\nIt is now a cheaper for U.S companies to invest in China you know for Tesla to buy land and below project\nTrump has promised to raise tariffs even more after the new year they're set to rise to twenty five percent and if he does that China is more likely to feel an impact but for now China's falling currency is helping it absorb the blows from Trump's trade policy Jim Zarroli NPR News New York\nChina's government is piloting something known as the social credit system like the credit scoring system we have in the U.S China scores use financial information\nBut China system also considers information like\nWhat you buy and how you treat your neighbors if you fail to pay your debt you might find yourself on a sort of blacklist Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia from the indicator podcast brings us this story about life on China's listed on trustworthy people\nLoved one is forty two he lives in ... province in China in

needed says and this person is on the unprecedented Liz from the cart\nLead lined with confused why couldn't he took the train ticket he started looking into that situation and he quickly realize why that's what's happening loved one has landed himself on something known as the blacklist\nJulie ... one thing that comes along with the black lists the unprecedented live that uh you're fired from\nHigh end consumption which means that you can't take a speed train you can fly\nChina started to block with about five years ago as a way to infuse more trust in banking and financial system and part of this has involved cracking down on debtors creating consequences for people who did not pay back their loans\nLoud one ended up on the blacklist because he was working in the coal industry that was his business he would take out loans by huge amounts of coal and store them but then one day the Chinese government changed its energy policy and the market for coal just collapsed\nSuddenly all the coal loud one had wasn't worth anywhere near when it had been and he had all these loans he couldn't pay back\nAnd the Chinese court ruled loud one would go on the blacklist\nAnd soon after when loud one went to his bank he found out that all of his accounts and credit cards had been frozen and one morning when loud one was driving through the center of town he discovered another aspect of being on the on trustworthy list on one of the electronic billboards by the side of the road was his face like up on a big billboard\nAnother more than be electric screened by the side of the plaza\nThere are like huge grants and they're very eye catching you can't really say them from afar and I saw my my pictures on that's going to have a picture of on my ID card and my ID card number and my name\nThe billboard said this man is on trustworthy loud one says these billboards are all over town\nSays whenever you went out whenever he cheated billboard she would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy\nShe would just stop and kind of watch it for awhile scrolling through the untrustworthy waiting to see his face would come up but one day when he was doing that you saw the face of someone he knew\nOr whatever they're doing with all of our own stores and we have to be working in a semi industry as I did ... now they're\nLoud started to notice a bunch of his former colleagues from the coal industry were also on the blacklist you started calling them saying hey I'm On the list to\nYou started getting people together meeting up for dinner he says these are the only people that he can really be relaxed around\nThere were about what was actually a friday the widespread attitude toward the U.S is very resistant people it was like why are you sure been happy widely used to have time to be happy [laughter] why do you not to go out and make money to pay back your loan\nSo far loud one says you're paid back about three hundred thousand of the one and a half million dollars to the originally owed there's still about one point two million to go\nBut even when loud one does manage to path and that's getting off the blacklist could be hard we talked lawyers and trying to deal with this by all accounts\nGetting off the blacklist even if you've paid your debt well it's technically possible but it just never seems to happen we reached out to China's Supreme Court about this issue but they didn't respond to requests for comment\nLoud one says she will keep paying off is that she has to believe there's a way off this list
