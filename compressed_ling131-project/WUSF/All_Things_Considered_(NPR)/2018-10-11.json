something startling for more than sixty percent of people of European descent they could identify or relative as distant as a third cousin most of the people in this database or white\nEach person that debate as a big one that illuminate hundreds of them twisting\nThe it's enough to have your third cousins or your second cousins once removed in that debate that too if you did defy you the same way that a GPS than you there's multiple what's it like to find a location\nAnd when the researchers combined their data with other information like we're person probably lives and our old they are they could quickly zoom in on a suspect\nOf course neither geological record you need to do the war but you have enough power to to get very ...\nAnd early use the same techniques to identifier

that you\nHaven't been able to be solved for decades they're all either homicide or sexual assault and and some of these are just I mean they're her effect you know murders of children things like that and it's just\n[noise] things that need to be solved and grey tech says it's not nearly as easy as this new research may make it sound but others argue that the findings underscore the need to make sure people know what they're getting into when they agree to give up their genetic information Erin Murphy is in New York University law professor\nIf it comes out tomorrow that they can use genetic information for something that feels a little unsavory it's going to be virtually impossible to claw back the information that you've put out into the world and more importantly you've made a decision not just for yourself but for your siblings for your getting cut and for people you don't even know you're related to for your children for your children's children\nSo Murphy and others think better ways are needed to protect people's DNA to make sure it isn't misused Rob Stein NPR News [noise]\n\nTomorrow on MORNING edition archbishop Oscar Romero with it that's needed in El

speaker to play NPR or your local station by name [noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nWell much of the country was focused on the Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation fight last week first lady Melania Trump was in Africa she's just back her first big solo trip overseas\nShe went on a safari in Kenya she stopped by the pyramid in Egypt she also visited babies in a hospital in Guyana and schoolchildren in Malawi CNN reporter Kate been it was on that trip traveling with the first lady and she joins me here now Kate how\nSo to be clear this was an official trip she was traveling as first lady us taxpayers we're footing the bill for the exactly this was her first big sort of goodwill tour so to speak and what was the agenda well I mean she said\nShe was there to spread the message about the best\nWhich has her initiative and the welfare of children and she also worked with usa ID on some of the programs there are putting your ID the U.S agency for international development exactly does she partnered with them on the trip it was also cultural tour she wanted to uh learn more about tourism in Egypt for example\nIt was again sort of a broad based initiative but she and that was her undertaking\nJust awkward because her husband is known for his America First agenda for wanting to slash foreign aid and their shoes on a trip highlighting all the good\nFor wanting to slash foreign aid and their shoes on a trip highlighting all the good that American foreign aid was that awkward\nIt's that strange sort of juxtaposition between the first lady and what she does and the president and what he does write this is sort of like raised eyebrows and also just going to Africa a nation that earlier this year he was accused of\nUm perhaps saying some derogatory comments about what she wanted to do is say here is what this organization is doing in in spite of budget cuts just you know the idea is to help these countries get off of the need for our aid so certainly didn't feel awkward when we were there\nBut ahead of time it was a head scratcher her wardrobe got a lot of coverage on this trip as it often does a and Mrs Trump weighed in on that she said she wishes people would quit talking about her close are\nWe going to find what I Do not laugh but keeping it it's almost like she wants to talk about what she's where I Am in the ...\nThe film that I think was\nUh something that was just an oversight in terms of what she was wearing that it wasn't going to be a scribe what she does she wore a very sort of\nOut of Africa I kept calling it ask outfit on the safari in Kenya and included\nFor the safari portion a white pets helmet which for Africans\nBrings up a time in their history that isn't necessarily um something that they like to recall in Nineteen century Clooney colonial exam ruled by outside forces yeah exactly so we try to look at these non verbal cues we try to look into what she's wearing what she's saying\nWhat she's tweeting it should be wearing a white suit to the state of the union because she's sending a message about suffragette probably not but we have to examine all those things with this very Private First lady\nYou know if I'm not mistaken the only reporter covering the east wing the first lady fulltime how do you think about that and what is the news value in reporting on the first place you know people say well what do you do if you come to the first lady she doesn't do anything\nAnd that's sort of an interesting argument um she does she does it with a smaller staff with a smaller footprint I'm with not necessarily traditional agendas that other first ladies have had for me it's been really interesting trying to crack the code of this woman who\nIronically Maureen Dowd called the Slovenian Spanx they're everywhere in front of the ...\nI'm Still in that way it is very interesting and I think that we we can't I Can't report what did she sinking but at the same time we need to get Fox at that we need to understand her\nAnd this trip I think very much help that [noise] and kicking up keeping it she covers the first lady for CNN [noise]\n\nAnd all things considered from NPR
