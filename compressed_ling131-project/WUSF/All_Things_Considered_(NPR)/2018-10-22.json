appraiser Aaron Murray Wallace has been following the bugs around the upcoming sale\nAnd she joins us now to talk about how the art world are taking all this and welcome you a pleasure to be here\nHow controversial in this in the art world for a painting to be painted by a non human and then auction off like fine art\nWell I think every couple of generations you have something that happened that begins to redefine what we can set our art you can go back to the early twentieth century and you can look at the urine or by Marcel Just chomp where he literally took 'em then you're in on hanging on a wall right\nAnd it's completely shattered what people thought of as art we're redefining what aren't actually is for the twenty first century so I don't think that in in um I went in a lifetime moment I think these things happen\nAgain and again we're redefining what we consider art with in our historical contact\nThat is so fascinating but it does raise the question of how do you price a painting that is not the product of the human because usually I'm no art expert but usually the way I understand if things like ... me and you need ... to the piece of work those are the factors that drive the price in art so\nHow do you price art where those things don't really apply\nWell they still apply but let's add to that let's add to that the market ability or a painting let's add to it the hype that created around a painting or anywhere 'cause\nI really I tend to think that the whole thing is orchestrated from go they knew exactly where they want to ... in comparison with where they

for it\nSo who is the artist in this case is it the ... who wrote the algorithm is it the algorithm or is it the machine\nOh the Arctic tough to be a little bit of all of those original artists ownership I Do believe it's split between the programming the code or the collective and maybe even a little bit of a nod to create these for helping to create the frenzy around it and\nGiven that there has been some deliberate frenzied built around this if this painting were created by human do you think it would have the same attractiveness would it garnered the same price\nNo I don't think so I really don't think so I think in terms of are the things that matter the most are the first and this is the first time and a I generated art work has gone to a major auction house to be auctioned off\nAnd so this is the first is the absolute first time this has ever happened because this is the Kansas print\nIt is absolutely possible that the collective could decide to release it at a smaller
