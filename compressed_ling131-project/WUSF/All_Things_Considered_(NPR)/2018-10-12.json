Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly this is a war zone that's how one resident of the Florida Panhandle described the aftermath of hurricane Michael to us today\nWe begin this hour taking stock of the devastation in two towns Appalachia cola and the neighboring town of East Point they're the heart of the Florida or Easter industry and they are where NPR's Greg Allen has spent today he is with us now Hey Greg\nI'm Mary Louise so tell me what these two terms look like today well\nYou know these are this area is somewhat east of where hurricane Michael made landfall and they fared better than communities that we're right near the center places like Mexico beach in Port saint Joe\nSo when we drove in today might lose your body solving and I we didn't see the massive tree damage that we've seen like in those other communities you know the the trees are mostly stayed standing with shows that they didn't receive the same high when they're ... they're I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees\nThe same high when they're I think there was tropical storm force winds and the trees were started\nUh here in Appalachian coal in East Point storm surge was the main minutes along highway Ninety eight the coastal road many buildings were destroyed and these were businesses that were really part of the seafood industry they're all kinds of businesses were just in rubble I'm somewhat already taken a hit economically\nBut uh there's not as many there as a war there before the storm we also hold them people who live on highway Ninety eight who were flooded a but this is nothing like the destruction that we've seen some of those other communities\nAnd are you able to get around or the roads clear you were telling me yesterday I took him nine hours to make a drive that normally would take to so what's what's how's that going\nRight it it's gotten much better I think throughout the region in this area of the storm surge did a lot of damage to the coastal road highway Ninety eight that's affectionate runs really all along the coast through all of these beach towns and it's been damaged in in several places\nAnd it will be some time before that role will be reopened again because of the storm surge came up and basically just made the concrete buckled under washed them and a half an hour yeah yeah I watched it out\nThere also in that area there's a causeway the links apple electrical in East Point together that was damaged now into single lane but that said there is now a pathway through apple logical or going\nWest it would be toward places like port saint Joe which were really badly affected you have a steady stream of traffic going through with power company trucks your emergency crews and others and the people in a in a Appalachian coal watching these trucks go by saying hey we don't have power but\nThey they know that their neighbors in Mexico beach need even more help so I think they're willing to wait at this point but in the Appalachian coal no power no very limited cell service and no outside help you\nGo out and and I mentioned these two towns are the harder to or Easter industry they've got fishing going on there are a lot of fishing and they they were struggling before the storm how might this affect them\nRight I mean ... there there are but they've had hard times in recent years because of poor water quality and the Gulf\nBut also you know shrimping and fishing or big hear many people moved their boats upriver to a secluded area Heidi hold they call it keep it out of harm's way and so most ... major damage that's good but some of the seafood restaurants and wholesalers worked with a lot of damage are working to rebuild and be back in business as soon as they can\nAs NPR's Greg Allen reporting for us from

NPR station from NPR\nNews this is all things considered I Know that Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly today in Turkey a court ordered the release of an American pastor held for the past two years Andrew Brunson spent most of that time in jail he'd been under house arrest since July\nPresident Trump made pastor Brunson case a priority and tweeted today that he will be home soon we don't know yet but it's possible he could be home as soon as tomorrow NPR's Peter Kenyon joins me from Istanbul Hey there Hi Mary Louise so remind me why Brunson was in Turkey and the first place and what exactly had been convicted up\nWell his pasture ran a small church in is mere in western turkey for years and years a but after a turkey had this failed military coups and twenty sixteen there was a massive roundup of suspected a enemies and brunch and was caught up in that basically\nHe's always denied the charges that he had anything to do with this cleric for to Gulen turkey blames for the coup attempt\nIn the U.S said the charges were baseless but he was picked up any way he's been in jail or house arrest for a couple of years now\nAnd then today in court we had three witnesses who would justify it against him suddenly changing the earlier testimony somehow he was still convicted after that incident a little over three years in jail but then the judge is basically suspended the rest of the sentence removed restrictions on his movement so he's free to go home\n[laughter] All right lots of questions about what evidence they actually had against him why him and why released him now\nIn some ways brunch and was caught up in these bilateral tensions between Akron Washington I mean there were Turkish officials who wanted to see us some Turkish executives who had been jailed in the U.S back in Turkey\nAnd of course turkey wanted the extradition of his clerk for to the ... who lives in Pennsylvania because they charged him in this a coup from twenty sixteen\nA president ... once said at one point give us our pastor we'll give you and yours a disc dumber jumps focused\nPoint give us our pastor we'll give you and yours or this summer Trump spoke with her to one and reportedly Trump's thought he had an agreement to get brunch released instead he was simply moved to house arrest than the u._s. got tougher they love the sanctions and then the pressure kept moaning and then we had this court case and that was released\nSo a lot of moving parts obviously and the U.S turkey relationship but bottom line is the release a pastor Brunson or a good development a breakthrough in us Turkish relations\nIt should be an improvement that the question is how much I mean this has been a high profile issue for the Trump Administration is very important to evangelical Christians in the U.S they tend to support Trump\nAnd we should mention that Brunson is an evangelical pastor that says that's just church that he was running and turkey\nYeah absolutely and so that is the key for the American side of the equation on the Turkish side of the equation and they now expect these us sanctions that were put on recently to be lifted but\nWill for instance a Washington niche and you're delivering at thirty five fighter jets to turkey will lay ... raised this issue of extra dieting the cleric for to Glenn I mean and there's other problems in the relationship this was far from the only one Syria and other things\nPossible murder of a Saudi journalist at the consulate of Saudi Arabia hearing the stumbles taking up a lot of attention at the moment\nThe ... that we've been tracking all of us this week\nDid you mark a showcase right and I think turkey will at least be relieved to have this Andrew Brunson issue\nOff the table [noise] thanks Peter You're welcome That's NPR's Peter Kenyon reporting from assemble\n[noise] what can take the next few minutes to get to the bottom of an economic mystery with ... reaching all the way to the White House or at least to the White House press corps vending machine he\nWas brought to our attention by NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley ts Stacey Vanek Smith and Cardiff Garcia to look into it they are the co host of NPR's daily economics podcast the indicator from Planet Money\nAnd the trail started as Scott Horsley with at the White House working on a story about the following price of corn\nIn the middle of writing that I came up to the employee break room to buy myself a bag of freak does and I noticed that the bag of free throws had gone from a dollar and a quarter the old price to it a new price of a buck and a half\nAnd I had just written that corn futures had fallen twelve percent since may so this was kind of puzzling to me\nSo our mystery why corn chips getting more expensive at a time when corn is getting cheaper clue number one Fritos it's owned by Pepsi Pepsi on street LA which makes read it in fact the machine Scott you did in the White House is all Pepsi products\nAnd all of the products in the machine got more expensive so we see they would not comment they declined to comment okay find out things I Know\nA luckily there was a second clue a no less to the scene of the crime\nTo our valued patrons effective in the next couple of weeks the prices in the vending machine may be\nAdjusted to offset increases we've received in product costs from manufacturers so present with wholesale cost of the free toes have gone off and they're passing those along to us but it is kind of curious at a time when corn prices are down yeah\nAnd you know there's only three things that are free to their search corn\nHow naive to think that's all that ... is Carolyn Dmitri it's an applied economist at NYU who specializes in suits daddy's she says the price of a process food like free does has almost nothing to do with well food prices kill a much bigger part of the cost to the food like free do it\nFood prices kill a much bigger part of the cost of the food like free does is in things like labor and rent and transportation because trucking companies are complaining that they cannot find enough drivers\nTo keep up with all the shipping need that they have which means the trucking it's getting more expensive for companies so that could explain why Fritos and all the other snacks in the White House vending machine\nMight suddenly cost a lot more we just keeping costs were not acting alone so on a hunch we called him ... Sharma below capital markets emit analyzes food companies including Pepsi\nAnd another clue about why the price of Fritos might have gone up aluminum terrorists\nIf you think about a soft drink companies a low minimum um because the parents have gone up as well\nSo because of like the aluminum can yeah\nIf the U.S is not importing cheap aluminum from overseas it will have to get aluminum from us suppliers and those us suppliers no longer have to compete as much with overseas aluminum suppliers so the domestic suppliers in the U.S can raise prices\nOf all companies Mitt looked at coke and Pepsi were a couple of the hardest hit by aluminum tariffs that maybe Pepsi or coke or just raised the price of their drinks do off that is more expensive can but they can't really do that right now they old though to have been falling but you know we are consuming more of what sex\nBacking category alive many of the other hand categories that allow companies that make back potentially more pricing power\nIn other words the power to raise prices and so they charge more because they can so there do trucking prices aluminum terrorists in our love for snacks at your best guess for why you're Fritos went up a quarter Scott Horsley that's satisfying it's not as satisfying as the bag or Fritos I'm going to go get right now [laughter]\n[noise]\nThat's good for [noise]\nThat with NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley speaking with safety Danny Smith and Cardiff Garcia our co host of the pie cast the indicator from Planet Money [noise] for what Planet Money comes from transfer why\nA service that helps people send money internationally three million people and businesses use transfer wise to send or receive and convert currencies and more than Seventy countries\nMore it transfer wise dot com or from their ass [noise]\nThis is all Fritos considered from NPR News who is hungry now you're listening to double your us as eighty nine\nPoint seven well Internet researchers have on mass the identities of the Russians who poison several people in the United kingdom and they're eager to share their methods\nRefer ... believes is going for the more people are aware of how to do this kind of things I'm most of the times it's not too hard\nComing up more on how they were able to track down the criminals\nSupport today comes from our listeners and Johns Hopkins all children's hospital rank by US News and World Report as a top fifty children's hospital in five specialties providing advanced specialized care for kids they are the promise of Johns Hopkins medicine right here in Tampa Bay more at Hopkins N.

sustaining members of this NPR station\nIt's all things considered from NPR News I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I know that Chang early this morning there was news from the Vatican that Pope Francis has accepted the resignation of Washington archbishop cardinal Donald Wuerl\nWorld has been under tremendous pressure to resign and it's a report this summer detailed the abuse of more than three hundred children in the Pennsylvania dioceses\nMoral was accused of mishandling several cases of abuse while at the diocese of Pittsburgh for over two decades\nAnd in Pennsylvania this morning the man who prepared that skating horrific report Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro\nUrged state lawmakers to eliminate the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse prosecution he's on the line now from Philadelphia Welcome to be with you thank you so I'm gonna ask you about your reaction to worlds recognition what went through your mind when you first heard the news today\nWhat cardinal worlds resignation is a necessary step a given what the grand jurors uncovered about his role in the systematic cover up of child sexual abuse\nI actually checking his comments about the need for greater transparency within the church I think what's missing here though is Mick knowledge meant by the Vatican on the extent of the abuse and cover up in Pennsylvania and then bishop worlds role in it now\nI'll I'll I'll leave it to the church is you know the the churches internal politics to them and their preference but I I Do not think that the people of Pennsylvania will accept that anyone proven to be part of this cover up should face no real consequences for that criminal conduct\nThat's exactly what I wanted to address because in a letter to cardinal Wuerl that the cardinal released today Pope Francis actually praised him a letter seemed to suggest that the only thing cardinal world is guilty on in managerial mistake not covering up any crimes what do you think of that characterization by the pope\nI think that it is demonstrably false to suggest that then bishop world did not play any meaningful role in the cover up the church's own secret archives show the active role that bishop world played in it\nOkay I I Want to turn now to your calls for a changing the current statute of limitations you you basically agree with four recommendations that the grand jury report articulated tell me about how you think the law should change\nIn Pennsylvania we uncovered three hundred and one predator priests sadly I could only charged two of them well and if we lived in another jurors\nSadly I could only charged two of them well and if we lived in another jurisdiction where there was no criminal statute of limitations I Would have charged every single one of them who is living every single one of these victims has been time barred from bringing a civil suit\nBut with respect to completely in eliminating the statute of limitations for criminal cases it is true that the longer you wait before you prosecuted crime the heart of the Cape becomes to prove witnesses pass away memories fade evidence grown stale does any of that concern you at the lawyer\nOf course but the burden is always on us the prosecutors to bring that case and yes it is more difficult often times when a number of years goes by but it doesn't mean that we should be barred from bringing a case especially when the data clearly shows the children who were abused\nOften don't come forward right away and in fact the average age that a child comes forward to share their truth is when they turned fifty two fifty two and yet the law here in Pennsylvania says that\nWe couldn't bring a criminal case after the age of fifty and so we believe and the data shows that if it's going to take that much time for someone to come forward we shouldn't be barred from prosecuting\nWhat your offices report laid bare in how a large institution in this in the Catholic Church but there's so many other examples how a large institution can go to great lengths to cover up sexual abuse and to protect abusers\nDoes revising the statute of limitations to get it that we did actually increase the accountability internally at these institutions\nYou hit the nail on the head so much of this is about an institution in this case the Catholic Church arguably the most powerful institution\nIn the world constantly and consistently putting its own reputation above the needs of the people they were there to serve in this case children I think there's a reckoning going on in this country right now about how we are going to or how much we are willing to\nHold powerful institutions accountable\nAnd I think you're seeing across this country with all that's going on with the me too movement the Kavanaugh hearings and The Cosby trial is is you're seeing more and more people stepping up and being willing to hold powerful institutions accountable and law enforcement plays a unique in critical role in that process that's what we're doing here in Pennsylvania\nJoshua Shapiro in Pennsylvania state attorney general thank you very much for joining us thank you\n[noise] some of the last secrets from the Watergate scandal may soon be revealed\nA federal judge in Washington has ordered the national archives to review key documents and prepare for their release\nThe papers helped to advance the
