Christopher Wray announcing the capture NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas joins us now with details and rhyme walk us through the drama this morning and the capture of the suspect\nWrote we knew last night the investigation was focusing on two places New York and South Florida in particular\nAnd this morning authorities arrested say look at an auto zone store north of Miami there was Judy footage

van\nThere's a near an auto zone store their family attorney says that the van is say ox are now a criminal complaint has been filed against him in federal court in New York he faces five counts and all including legally male and explosives and threatening former presidents as well as others can\nCan you tell us a little bit about the clues and the evidence that led the FBI to him\nIt was actually a clue from one of the packages FBI Director Christopher Wray says the FBI was able to pull a fingerprint off of one of those bubble a manila envelope so we talked about a lot over the past week\nThat fingerprint match say ox a race says there's also a possible DNA connection from some of the homemade pipe bombs that were sent in two separate packages those appear to match they aren't as well\nEr and authorities have also identify did a identified a Twitter account that they said belong to him and the clues there are some of the words that were misspelled on the packages match the misspelling on the Twitter account\nWell I Know that you are librarians others that NPR has been looking into his background today tell us what you've learned about um\n[noise] well he's fifty six years old he is a resident of South Florida are you registered as a Republican in March of twenty sixteen he has a pretty lengthy criminal history in Florida that includes charges of\nA felony theft and drugs he was also arrested over a possible bomb threatened two thousand to\nA he appears to have really kind of struggled for a very long time to find a place to maintain a steady income or for

listed as tour manager\nToday had kind of the hallmarks of a climax of the investigation with President Obama the FBI Director the attorney general all talking about it now that he's in custody is that what happens next well\nThe FBI but wants to know whether it's the talk was working alone whether there was somebody who was helping him with this the last one to know whether there are any more packages that were sent but aren't accounted for yet a because remember there were more discovered just this morning there could still be more out there\nAs things stand now a race says that each of the Thirteen devices that have been confirmed had six inches of PVC pipe or a small clock\nA battery there was wiring and a potential explosive material so is that lab analysts are still examining those but he made clear that these are not hopes devices\nAnd of course one big question his motives do you have any information about why he allegedly sent these packages to prominent Democrats CNN

turnaround here in Michigan the rate was close to a Fifteen Percent during the crash a decade ago the auto industry imploded company has declared bankruptcy\nWe wanted to talk with some of the people who were squeezed out of the auto industry about their have through this recovery so we found one family that all worked at the same GM plant just outside Detroit willow run\nThe plant was the world's largest plant under one roof it was a mile and a quarter that way\nI'm at dawn get more in a big empty parking lot at the place where she went to work every day for more than Thirty years until GM shut it down in two thousand ten it's out there\nTo national yeah I'm sure it is crazy what is the phrase will run mean to you at this point when you hear today\nA sick I get sick sickening just order to see it on a ...\nA lot everything\nWhen he started work during the Nineteen seventies he says the plant employed Fifteen thousand people by the time will run closed dumped get more was president of the local union chapter and that made him one of the last people to leave\nIt was a December twenty third was Christmas but uh yeah it was a dark and scary and\nYou know crying all the way to\nLike somebody\nLike losing your life you know\nAt the time to get more lived with his wife and steps on the pounds that each of them have taken since then reflect larger patterns in the U.S workforce Don Skidmore wasn't quite ready to retire he went to a different GM plant in Toledo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the\nSo for a few years commuting an hour each way finally he saw the writing on the wall and\nTook a buyout [noise]\nNow at age six feet he helps maintain a private golf course at a fancy club in the suburbs beautiful here yeah very elevated he writes a lawnmower for hours around the Eighteen hole and that gives them time to think often about the auto industry the days are over and I'm good old days are over\nBetween the golf course and his GM pension he makes less money than he did it the auto plant but he says it's enough\nAre not happy stone a happy still miss the people still miss my job represent the great and then General Motors just bam you know they shut the door and now we all go our separate ways\nBack then Don Skidmore was married to dawn green they both worked at the plant and I went to meet her neck [noise] current workplace policies that eighty so you're getting today Don green is a nurse an urgent care clinic she's wearing a Halloween themed described as\nA little bit of everything a little bit of everything from stitches X rays step is a big thing this time of year than\nThey after she left willow run she learned that GM would cover most of her tuition to go back to school so she spent more than four years training to be a nurse and that reflect the bigger shift in this economy as auto industry jobs went away the health care field\nGroup and was there any part of youth a thought I Can't believe I'm starting over at thirty six and going back to school for a completely different field and on about\nYes very much so I noticed once I was in the actual classes how different it was actually really going to be because they were people who just graduated high school that were there with me\nI Know you were married to ... when the plant closed did the thing about marriage have anything to do with all the people that was going on in your professional life\n[noise] yeah I Would say because um I at that point was used to being independent\nHe used to being able to to depend on myself and pay my own bills and take care of my own self and wants that wasn't there anymore I felt like I had to depend on him I think I was searching for that independence again and just couldn't handle it so\nWhen you think about the word family that you had a willow run how many of them would you say are in the kind of position urine today we're ten years later they have a job they love their happy with their pay they feel fulfilled and on their feet [noise]\nI'm not a big percentage of them in and it gets kind of emotional to be honest I guess I always assumed that when you retired he retired and you enjoy your life after that\nBut I Do see around town people that I worked with that retired working like in small shops and stuff like that so I don't know if that's exactly what they pictured life being like after retirement\nAnd some people who worked at willow run weren't old enough to retire ten years ago like Don green son Peyton he's part of a generation that entered the workforce just as the recession was heading and many of them have never found their foot\nPeyton started working as a clean or on the midnight shift at willow run when he was Eighteen you have that job for about three years\nIt was like a teen's really you know I feel I can kind of like tease me it's like oh hey here's a good job you know you're going to be set you don't have to worry about getting thousands of dollars in debt for student loans and do all that you can just work hard here and you know twenty five thirty years retired and just live a normal life but that was not the case\nAs you say when it went down during a little bit\nHas struggled since he left willow run he's been in and out of school and service industry jobs he moved to Florida and came back he just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts\nHe just got offered a job with a rental car company at the airport until he starts there he's doing seasonal Halloween were far north of\nOfficers are
