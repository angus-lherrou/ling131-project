says that used to drink together that when Kavanaugh drank he got belligerent and aggressive\nThat he wants to Kevin I'll throw a drink and a man's face prompting a bar fight\nAnd that he believes Kavanaugh may have lied under oath Chad letting and joins me now Hi there how are you man I I'm All right thank you\nI your account has been widely reported since you came forward and released her statement this past Sunday I've just summarized it they're so let me touch street to what you did with this information you ended your statements saying you would go to the FBI and tell them what you did you\nUh yes I did um I ah eventually did reach them by phone from the ... than told me what exactly to do first and button tailed sending your request for a form to fill out and then I filled out the form in fact the former run this had been priests\nOut and then I filled out the form in fact the former arrived it had been pre filled by the F presumably the Asian I spoke to a with my testimony in it that took up most of the three thousand a character spaces that they allowed\nSo you felt that this form did you ever than sit down with are having a phone interview with with an FBI agent following up on it\nAllows I did not I was never called back I waited by my food by my computer ah hoping to get an email nothing happened\nTo be clear your your statement boils down to that you saw him drunk back in college which of course does not prove or disprove allegations of sexual assault which is the central question that the FBI was was looking into why is your account relevant to the FBI why do they need to question yeah\nWell I think it's relevant because first of all it was like one should live in front of the Senate Judiciary committee or what has taken an oath and one is also trying out in this case a it's a job interview to become a Supreme Court justice\nAnd when you were saying you thought he lied and testimony this was in regard to the extent of his cranking\nThis is the basic law was that he said he knew unequivocally that there was absolutely no way he ever drink to the point of being unaware of the phrases black you know I think Britain me confused that was passing out but the blackmailed phrase means doing things that you don't know you have done\nAnd what I'm saying is there's no way that he given the state of who's intoxication on a frequent basis can say that he knows for certain that he never got to the condition how can one new\nLet me let me ask you this a central question today in Washington now that the FBI hasn't delivered this additional supplemental report is that that represent a complete thorough investigation\nFrom your vantage point does it do they know everything you feel they need to know about your account what you witnessed\nNo I don't think they did a complete investigation because again my allegations are really about ah what happened in the last week that's where I think the crime was committed I Can't speak to what happened back in Nineteen eighty two I can speak to what I Know about like new three maybe four to eighty five at college\nAnd then how that was spoken about in two thousand and Eighteen so I don't think they're going to very thorough job in that sense at all\nAs Chad Chad letting ... classmate of Brett Kavanaugh's he's now an associate professor at North Carolina State University and you heard him here on all things considered from NPR News\nThe Labor Department comes out with the latest jobs report tomorrow and economists expect to see more new jobs being created that healthy pace\nBut there aren't just more jobs Cardiff Garcia of our planet money team says people are also changing jobs more often and he's here to tell us more about the hike artist hey Ari what shows you that people are changing jobs moving around more\nWell my favorite indicator dynamism is probably the quit straight that's just a share of people who quit to voluntarily leave their jobs each month it's now its highest point in Seventeen years so it shows you that people are confident letting go of their place of work a and looking for something else\nSo you're saying that when people quit their jobs at a high rate that's actually a good sign economically\nI mean individually usually we associate quitting your job with like being fed up you know you've had it\nUh but actually if you look at it from the standpoint of the macro economy it's a great sign when a lot of people are quitting because it suggests that they know that they have better options elsewhere they're leaving for a better job or they're confident that there'll be able to find a better job when they do quit\nAnd when you look at the economy as a whole how much more opportunity for work is there\nActually a lot more uh

should be up there was clearly told to narrow the report the White House and Republicans in the Senate have said the FBI was given no restrictions\nWhen I Know from the FBI is that they are when they're told to be and allowed to be very thorough following leads wherever they are to take them to conclusions and from what I thought today in the narrow scope that they've given um that that could not have been accomplished particularly because we know\nThat the names of people that both ... and Dr Ford gave them were not followed up nor were a number of tips that came into the FBI\nSo

U. S. that comes from our listeners and Duke Energy committed to building a smarter energy future for Florida more at Duke dashed energy dot com slash improvements and support comes from alert today Florida committed to safeguarding no to bike and walk\nAvoiding distractions is crucial to public safety drivers should just drive and Walker should just walk\nThat means that a rocky planet earth it's mostly rock vapor what is rock vapor and and what does that have to do with our moon rock paper and taking the rocks that we stand on end heating it up to the point where it becomes a gas and when that occur as\nThe earth becomes much larger because vapor is much less dense ... and it extends out into this enormous object hundreds of times larger than the earth today and we proposed that arm in Colorado's wins in the rock paper of the earth after a giant impact\nTo the moon actually came from the earth the moon\nGrows within the rocks paper of the earth and that gives them in the same chemistry and see\nHow much of a revelation was that I mean how different was that from what scientists used to think about where the moon came from\nIt was hard to imagine that things could be so different and it was a mental road blocks to realize that China impacts transformed a planet into an entirely new type of object and that could explain one of the biggest mysteries in the solar system\nDid you have to overcome some mental road blocks of your own given what you've been taught coming through academia\nAbsolutely and this is when we had a bona fide eureka moment to my graduate student and I are sitting in front of a computer and looking at the calculations that we had done and Venus\nSitting in front of a computer looking at the calculations that we had done and realizing that owns the assumptions are actually violated\nBy what we were looking at I think in any field there's a degree to which people have to be taught to trust themselves and maybe women even more than men are taught not to trust themselves [noise] was it difficult for you to have confidence that yeah well I've demonstrated here actually is real\nScientists are terrified of being wrong [laughter] of course I didn't want to put something out there that was really a crazy idea and so we did have to convince ourselves\nFirst how long did it take you to convince yourself\nWell [laughter] from the eureka moment to the public paper with for years so I think we had a lot of internal debates\nAre amongst the co authors and a lot of debates at conferences on the origin of the moon\nSo do you expect if ten years from now I pick up a high school textbook it's going to have the results of your research there in the chapter on our moon was formed\n[noise] I certainly hope so I Am very excited about this idea and I hope that it leads to test where we can prove whether or not the moon actually formed in the earth vapor\nWhy are these kinds of questions relevant to ordinary people who are not scientists why does it matter where the moon came from for example\nThe creation of the men was the last major event and the creation of the earth and it was such a violent act it left the earth and the state very different from today\nUnderstanding how earth became in the habitable planet that it is is directly linked to the final event and its creation\nYou're saying it's part of our story absolutely how did you get interested in planetary collisions\nI wanted to study planet formation and in the process I learned that collision were the major physical process to grow planets and I had the opportunity to study them in the lab and I've been doing it ever since\nWe've kind of kid who was always going in the backyard starting at the stars [noise]\nI had my nose in books imagining space travel\nI very much enjoyed science fiction\nSo for you is studying climate to fall back to actually traveling through space laughing\nI might be too terrified to actually go up in space [laughter] exploration and our imagination and through the laws of physics has been exciting enough for me\n[noise] sure Stewart is a planetary scientist at the University of California Davis and two days she

point seven it's by forty four and I'm Lisa ... open enrollment for Medicare runs from October Fifteen through December seventh and there are lots of changes this year that will create more health care options for seniors\nMedicare Advantage plans are not allowed to offer benefits then include meals transportation and in home care health Newt Florida ... speaks with you met a regional president Deborah Galloway who begins by describing some of the changes\nSentence for Medicaid and Medicare services have allowed Medicare Advantage plans to cover a broad array of health services and really look at a Medicare member to improve their health and human ah\nUm have been able to look at seniors from holistic view and understand that if your food insecure you're more likely to have chronic diseases so we added a benefit that will allow a member of the men in the house\nAdded a benefit that will allow a member of the men in the hospital off forty meals with meals on wheels after discharge for if they have a chronic condition they'll have meals that support the nutrition benefits of that members chronic conditions\nAlso within that to get that member is socially isolated are lonely we've also noticed that those members how much more likely conditions of being hospitalized so what we also added to that benefited from a clinician standpoint they recognize that that number is isolated\nWe added a loneliness that that to that so that that member would have a person actually talking to them and meeting them while they're having that meal\nThat this isn't what you would traditionally think of as doctor visits or medical care covered by Medicare\nWe've had supplemental benefits and what's happened is a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services have allowed us to increase the services that we are able to add to those benefits there's also another benefit that that it's been added there might be an opportunity for a member to have\nA in home care services covered along in with their Medicare benefits [noise]\nUm we also have added to our regular court planned transportation unlimited transportation is really so that those members can access their position and also go to fitness centers because we understand having that healthy lifestyle supports the overall health of that member\nThis is only for Medicare Advantage plans or is that right\nThat's correct so what happens is that members plan they would need to look at the benefits of the plan their additives supplemental benefits to Medicare Advantage\nThere also increasing access for tele medicine that can help with a doctor or nurse visit also mental health care can\nYou tell us about that yeah so this year uh they've expanded what we can do from a tele health perspective and for our ... members we've added a tell us psych benefit and not benefit is virtual\nSo not only would members be allowed to have access via Web but also a telephone to visit the amount of psychiatric doctors and physicians in the area is limited and so really having that extra support and help at the time of need and it's really what we're looking at adding\nHas there been a problem providing these services in the past or has there been a vacuum of the services\nFor Medicare it wasn't considered a benefit so we were not allowed to offer those um now through the the new rules and regulations Medicare Advantage has been allowed to support um having that tell us how does it\nSo and I believe even in twenty twenty they're going to give us a bigger opportunity to 'em and proved that benefit\nBy understand there's also an option where someone can choose a plan and if they decide it's not right for them there's a window where they can change that can\nYou tell us about that so they added back this year what we call open enrollment so after the original annual enrollment period they'll have an open enrollment period starting in January so it's a member is on Medicare Advantage\nThey will have an opportunity from January first through march\nTo choose and other health plan\nDeborah Galloway regional president for humanity thanks for joining us\nThank you for your
