state department said last week that it will no longer issue visas to the same sex partners of foreign diplomats\nAnd employees have us based international organizations unless the partners are legally married before the end of the year\nA spokesperson from the state department said that the policy quote insurance consistent treatment between opposite sex partners and same sex partners unquote but critics point out that many of the families affected by the policy come from countries where same sex marriage is not an option\nAnd these critics argue that if those couples choose to get married in the United states they could face persecution back home but if they do not married some partners could face deportation James ... Bruce ... is a former U.S ambassador to the Dominican Republic under President Obama and he has been speaking out about this so we called him\nAnd ... thank you so much for talking with us thank you for having me and one of the reasons we called you is that you had had first hand experience with navigating accreditation policy you are married to your husband and you served as ambassador in the Dominican Republic where same sex marriage is not recognize how did you navigate back\nSo as we were going my husband had to go as a family member not as a spouse\nWe were able to change his status eventually to be a member of household but we never saw him known as a spouse or as a spouse as other married diplomats have on on their schedule is our main objective was to make sure that he had the full\nImmunities though that a spouse has and we were able to get that but he was never recognized completely as other spouses were and there was much discrimination based on that\nYou can you just give me an example of that\nSure I mean the first thing that happened to us when we first arrived was that the people ... who is the diplomatic representative of\nThe Vatican informed me that my husband because he was not recognized officially as a spouse or would not be invited to the reception of the diplomatic corps which he was leading for the reading of the president and the first flight of the Dominican Republic because of that non recognition as a spouse\nOr and so that was just one of many examples where we had to fight\nTo make sure that to my husband was given the same privileges when it came to the social aspects as well as legal aspects of\nThis new position by the state department is a reversal of policy that had been in place since two thousand nine under secretary of State Hillary Clinton the state department allowed same sex domestic partners to qualify\nFor dependent visas now the Trump Administration says it's as I said earlier that this is to put same sex couples on the same footing as couples that compares to different genders how do you respond to that\nWell I say it's one of two things one it's either during out and really understanding the logistics of what happens to gay couples and the challenges they have\nOr to the district discrimination which is what I think it is from the ... and the reason that it's different is after August filled that was essential that landmark ruling the Supreme Court that recognized marriage and all fifty states so that same sex couples who now legal it could be married in the U.S\nThroughout our diplomatic corps no longer had special privileges but this is totally different this is about couples that live outside of the United states\nThat did not have an over filled situation you know there are\nSide of the United states that did not have an over filled situation you know there were eighty eight percent of the countries around the world that do not recognize same sex marriage but you're you're not allowing that person who is a great representative for the United nations or another international organization to come and live in the United states with their partner\nSo you're saying some of these families the partners wouldn't be able to come at all they wouldn't even have the option of leaving the country in order to even try to get married\nThat is one of the one of the things too I mean there's a lot of countries for example we have heard our current president say there's many countries were denying these is from\nThe other thing is if they came they might not be able to work because they're not on a work visa so it creates a hardship and so many different ways and so many unknowns but they're not guarantee that they're going to get these are the only way they would be guaranteed is if they go through somehow in figure out how to get married and I know their country and whether that is even something that's an option\nThat is James Wiley Bruce ... he was in ...

professor police science\nAt John Jay College of criminal justice in New York and she's with us now professor thanks so much for talking with us thank you for having me you know what can you tell us about the numbers I mean we know that policing is safer than it was Thirty years ago but we saw that there has been a slight uptick in the killings of police officers do you have any sense of what's going on\nUh from my perspective it's really what we should be looking at it it's not so much the number switch statistically you know when when you say twenty percent it's significant that said that ... percent but then when you look at the\nNovice we talking about for the something off he says versus sad this something officer so from my perspective it's really what did I Know fender why this police officers were killed in the line of duty\nYou know we don't know exactly what they're Eid al ... and and therefore we don't necessarily always know\nWhether it's some turned that we as saying that the danger is an disturbing\nI Want to hear more about that but I wanted to ask you about that South Carolina case is that an outlier some of the data suggests that actually most on duty police officer deaths happened because of car accidents and not shootings so is this kind of a violent encounter is that an outlier [noise]\nNot necessarily it just to be that most police officers were killed in in traffic accidents on but today it's not the case\nIf you look at the most recent years we're looking more at the embassy is a police officer in meditation and we're looking at an investigative activity um west I handling and all persons with mental illness so it's not the traffic violations and on tactics steps I'm no longer be\nThe most frequent reasons for that [noise] I mean you're saying\nThat they're premeditated by what kind of of ... as it as it were\nNot people who for simple police officers and I'm of the government which of course they are and then motivated by the political beliefs that you know the police out though to press the police or buy a racist and and um with Senate things the last two years\nIn general the climate on in the last few years is on the police and the United states so when when you put that to to get that the propensity towards violent behavior as an outcome of mental illness closet triggering event then you have to cut us off it out come\nSo if somebody's looking at let's take yesterday events and in the sea and the steps of a Supreme Court [noise]\nYou'd think police officer is pushing back then ... threat to us so somebody looking at police officers\nIdentify them is part of this ... this thought that the government that are demonstrating against so it doesn't take much to take your anger out of the police officer because you cannot take your anger out to get on a given police station instead you you're doing it against a preventive thing for the government to the police are\nBefore we conclude here both in cases of police violence against citizens and the cases of\nPolice officers being harmed by civilians off and the question of training comes up now that is one of your areas of expertise or their training issues that you think we should be talking about here in connection with us\nWhen we're looking at those on the investigative enforcement um\nWhen we're looking both on the investigative enforcement town that and the ones that are part of the ambush on top meant that affected the death is definitely a training issue office that's like when they\nSaid in a car and a police car and and feel comfortable and feel safe and secure and this is not something that that\nIt's always the reasonable thing to do given that particular environment even if that ... political development that might be putting their life in danger so this is a technical issue is how you approach in apartment ... go to the house\nA well you know that it's a ...\nWho is armed and dangerous to me that we have a ten thousand police agencies and when you have a thing sounded relieved agents you cannot Institute standards for recruitment and stand up for training which would help I mean the the negative perception of of policing the profession\nBut more broadly do do you feel that there is also an issue of violence directed at police officers that needs more public attention\nAbsolutely I mean to me it's absolutely unacceptable\nThat nine officers in one year are killed in that line of duty an outcome most premeditated activities that was directed against them explicitly another democratic society should accept a nine police officers in one year in separate incidents killed by members of the topic to set up so that can accept that\nIs Maria haven't felt she is a professor in the
