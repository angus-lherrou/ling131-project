how are they tell us more about Jason Kander a Democrat with deep appeal in a deep red state\nRight a he's a lawyer he was a former Missouri's secretary state he did a tour in Afghanistan as an intelligence officer\nBack in two thousand six and came home and got into Missouri politics he made a surprisingly glued and run in a deep red state to unseat Republican senator Roy Blunt in two thousand uh sixteen and if you've heard of him you've probably heard of him from this head\nHunters and Kansas Senate or boring to me and\nHe's in an empty warehouse blindfolded and he was a stumbling on a are Fifteen style rifle and the while he's doing he's talking about gun rights and he said he'd support gun ... supports gun rights but he also support background checks\nHe says to keep terrorists from getting one of these and then the gun is assembled and he takes off the blindfold and he says\nSays I'd like to see somebody to foreign do this and the ad gone national attention he later had a best selling book about lessons from politics and the military he was even mentioned as a possible democratic presidential candidate in twenty twenty so really it seemed like a rising politician of the Democratic party and his\nDecision today to part of the race came as a surprise and I came with a very honest and emotional ... letter message or tell us about it\nIt was just hours ago candor posted a statement that he was tired of denying that he had a problem\nThat he'd been ... that he had symptoms of pie TST had nightmares and you've been suffering from depression and he'd felt changed ever since he came back from Afghanistan eleven years ago\nUm he said that when he should have been celebrating for example a having a raised a record amount of funds in his mayoral campaign he was actually in in crisis and he was on the veterans crisis line the Vietnam veterans crisis line in tears saying that yes he had been having suicidal thoughts\nUm so he decided that he should take a step back from the campaign and from the organization who started something called the let America vote which is a anti gerrymandering an anti voter suppression organization or he says\nTo the anti gerrymandering an anti voter suppression organization or he says he's getting VIP treatment and that he's not permanently retiring from politics he's expecting to be back\nEven with all of a conversation about and support for people who have ... how much stigma is there still today\nWell I mean there's a lot of stigma and and it can also depend for example on what stage are out in the military career if you're active duty military and you raise your hand and get treatment it can make you on deployable so a lot a lot of people will hide it because they want to be able to stay in the fight\n'em and uh I mean I Can't think of a politician who disclosed this sort of thing except usually on the you know\nOn the tail of a scandal that's going to come out involving some of misbehavior but I mean this was a serious crisis just last week the VA release statistic saying that suicide has increased especially among ... generation of veterans and candor said he wanted to do this in part to help others confronted in public that it isn't a sign of weakness\nQuil Lawrence ... thank you are\nNow we turn to Amazon which has become the largest company to commit to the minimum wage uh Fifteen dollars an hour\nThe retail giant which is where it's almost a trillion dollars faced a lot of criticism after disclosing earlier this year at a meeting in salary at Amazon was less than twenty nine thousand dollars that's just a little over the federal poverty level for a family of four NPR's Alina Selyukh reports\nAnd Amazon corporate executives stood today before more than seven hundred workers in California warehouses and told them they are getting a raise\nThe Dave\nClark he told me this was one of the best days at work and the Twenty years it's been an Amazon I should note that Amazon is one of NPR's sponsors I reached clerk at that California where how\nWell we're announcing now is a Fifteen dollar minimum made before any other of\nThe Fifteen dollar minimum kicks in on November first for all Amazon workers in the U.S fulltime part-time temps in seasonal Amazon says that's about three hundred and fifty thousand employees total I asked Clark how much a warehouse temp job might pay at Amazon now\nAre lower in a facility was just under a lot on dollar ranges over Fifteen dollars\nThat's already far above the federal minimum wage of seven dollars and twenty five cents but still Amazon's bay has been facing a lot of criticism as a company ballooned into a global giant with half a million employees many of whom are drivers and warehouse workers\nAmazon is the second most valuable American Company it's run by the wealthiest men in the world CEO Jeff Fager [noise]\n\nTwo weeks ago a group demonstrated outside of beat each and Washington protesting the wide gap between basis as well and the wages for his lowest paid employees\nInside they spoke to several hundred Washington Power brokers and he was asked about the growing intention that Amazon was getting from critics who think it's become too big and too powerful they said scrutiny like that is good for society\nAll big institutions of any kind or going to be and should be examined scrutinize inspected\nToday in his statement about the Fifteen dollar minimum wage be those said the company listened to which critics one of the most high profile ones had been Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders for\nHer to give credit where credit's going a little bit I derive\nStandards have long been campaigning for better conditions and pay for minimum wage workers including at retail and fast food restaurant he\nFor minimum wage workers including at retail and fast food restaurant he has introduced a bill called the ... act which stands for stop bad employers by the ruling out subsidies the bill would tax large corporation whose workers rely on federal benefits like food stamps\nAnd I hope and believe but I'm a college professors will cost of a company for Wal Mart a fast food industry and start reading the world for American workers\nAmazon is not the first big retailer to make a public show of raising the minimum wage target plans to get to Fifteen dollars an hour by twenty twenty cops go hit fourteen dollars this summer but Amazon is now the country's second largest private employer\nI thought it was great news and see how could be other than good news is the\nAuthor is an economist at MIT and he said there are several ways to view Amazon move skeptically won the unemployment rate is low and there is high demand for workers\nOne interpretation is look it was going to have to raise wages anyway Italy marketers tightening uh so it just you know decide to get some good publicity out of that\nAutor says no matter the reason it's important to remember that raises are good for the workers who get them their local economies lower wage workers are so they do tend to spend extra earnings\nAnd there's another kind of surprising way that Amazon made weights today it's saying that it will lobby Congress for an increase in the federal minimum wage however Amazon's Dave Clark told me the company does not plan to Bush for a federal minimum all the way up to Fifteen dollars\nWe think is the right number of relieving for Congress\nBut Senator Sanders said he hopes the ... stamp of approval convinced that the rest of the country that Fifteen dollars an hour is right Alina Selyukh NPR News\n\nAll the news happening every day it can be hard to keep up so check out our podcast up first go get the biggest stories about ten

USF eighty nine point seven could afternoon I'm Lisa peaks [noise]\nForty nine people were killed in the pulse nightclub shooting and twenty sixteen but an investigation from Health News Florida's a variety and ProPublica finds that some people may have survived paramedics had been allowed inside the club sooner\nThis week on Florida matters we hear that story and talk about ... response efforts have changed since the massacre\nIn his review of Tonight Show Robin something have talks with John Montana's he's an expert with the national fire protection association the group released new standards this year for responding to active shootings\nIn the past emergency responders and the fire department or EMTs emergency medical technicians had to wait until the threat was neutralized and an active shooting incident in other words the police had killed or arrested the gunmen\nAnd the consequences of that which we saw the pulse nightclub shooting was that victims who were shot or wounded they had to lie there and wait until everything was over before the EMTs could go in these new standards have they changed the actions of first responders\nWill it's our hope that these standards will force\nFirst responder agencies to work together the standard isn't a prevention document it doesn't talk about assessing people's mental health or gun rights or gun prevention what it does talk about is is these are incidents that are occurring more frequently and more severely\nAnd we need to be prepared as communities and in doing so we won our first responders to train together to come up with tactics and policies and to use those tactics and policies to access victims as quickly as possible\nSo the big change would be that the paramedics would go\nThe big change would be that the paramedics would go in and try to save people before it's a completely secure situation\nCertainly that's a goal it's a goal for responders to access victims as quickly as possible so you can say okay\nYou know the bad guys in the back of the building we have a wall set up between the bad guy and the good guys and we can get in there and help everyone in the front of the building while we address the guy in the back of the building that takes a lot of coordination communication that's not easy and that's why you have to work together and practice this far in advance\nIt sounds like part of the changes would be that paramedics an EMT and perhaps they would be asked to wear special vast send protective uniforms\nThe standard says if EMTs and paramedics that aren't law enforcement based and not part of a specialized team are going to go into these war zones intentionally the expectation is that they wear a level three a National Institute of justice rated vest and that's a bare minimum\nThe technical committee that wrote the new standard and FDA three thousand felt very strongly that they need to be provided some protection if they're going to be going into the zone similarly like law enforcement wearing the vests as well [noise] they also recommended helmets they recommended other things as well our protection\nBut they needed to set that minimum because the understanding is that we're moving in that direction and that expectation across the country is shifting\nHas there been any pushback from paramedics any empties who say you know I didn't sign up for this I thought I was going to be going to a person's home that was having a heart attack and saving their life I never thought I Would be going into some sort of active shooting hostile event like this\nOh I'm sure there is and it makes a lot of sense you know day one and he in the school the first lesson you learned is seen safety body substance isolation scene safety means that you you only go into secure scenes and body substance isolation means that you protect yourself from blood borne pathogens wearing gloves and protection [noise]\nYou know that's the first thing you learn as an EMT\nAnd this is new and different and certainly there's going to be complications with departments doing this around the country and an ambulance services for example they're going to need to have\nVery serious labor management discussions for those that are unionized they may have scenarios in which it's a volunteer base thing because it they may state legislatively not be able to force them to do these things as agencies do this they need to be very careful and plan this out ahead of time\nYou know what their policies and procedures are no what what's within their collective bargaining agreements work all that out and then immediately start implementing it\nYou can hear more about this issue coming up at six thirty on Florida matters [noise]\nWell there are gains by a
