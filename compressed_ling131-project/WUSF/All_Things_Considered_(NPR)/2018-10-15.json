was killed a CNN citing to unnamed sources do we know anymore\nI I've heard the report certainly but I cannot confirm them at this time\nOkay so that's something to keep an eye on it to the question

element to this as well certainly Trump has been leaning on Saudi Arabia to keep gas prices low particularly ahead of the mid term election\nAnd there's a multibillion dollar arms sale on the table as

because she'll gee\nThat went terribly wrong um but that would contradict the Saudis claims that the journalists had left the consulate safely\nYou mentioned President Trump today said maybe this was

his name is Carlos was to mind day and he found that a vast majority of warns lineage is of European ancestry\nBut he also wrote that her results strongly support the existence of a Native American ancestry\nYou know in addition to this DNA Analysis warning also released a campaign style video clips of President Trump mocking her mocking her claims of Native American ancestry and some vignettes from her family history she had this one scene in particular where she called the ... the DNA researcher and puts him on the line\n... five five segments from Native American ancestry with very high confidence where we believe the error rate is less and what about\nNow the president wants to call my mom a liar\nWhat are the facts and we have the Native American ancestry or in your bedroom\nSo you you know you can hear that she's also again pressing the point that this is part of her family's history is at the history that she says has been passed down for generations\nCan also here or at least

again on Twitter saying you know asking him if he had memory problems and if they should all call for a doctor and and really you know she's kind of been poking him all day on Twitter\nAnd my cynical to ask about the timing of this does it have anything to do with a B aspirations we mentioned the cheese on a run for president herself in twenty twenty I think that's a really realistic\nEyes at this point I mean you know this isn't a campaign ad for the midterms Warren is expected to easily win a second term as a senator this November this\nIs really about what what's next right and she has talked about potentially taking a hard look at what's next after the midterms and she really does want to kind of quiet these these questions they had been trailing her ever since she first ran for the Senate in Massachusetts and twenty twelve\nAt that time her Republican opponent accused her of being dishonest about her\nHer past and you know President Trump of course had his taken to calling her Pocahontas so this is really hitting attempt to to try to kind of quiet all of this because the twenty twenty race is going to kick off pretty much just in his mid\nTerm very briefly has quieted all of those ...\n... no not at all I mean I can tell you real quick the Republican National committee said that the test revealed only a miniscule percentage of Native American ancestry that still
