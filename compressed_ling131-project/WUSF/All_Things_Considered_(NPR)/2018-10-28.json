from people who were far away but still felt the need to respond but we're going to start the program with Pittsburgh Mayor Bill but you know Mr ... thank you so much for talking with\nAge much closure and of course I Want to offer my deepest condolences to you and to members of the city and the community and you just lost eleven people and how are you holding up and how is that can be holding out\nUm it's difficult or our hearts are broken collectively which were issued a community is small a small city and what happens to one part of it affects all of a\nWeed out the number of people to describe this community to us and I'm like you to describe it to us what is what are the squirrel hill all about\nWell it shows um I live far watch more of the events took place ... um\nWhere are the event took place um it's the most diverse neighborhood and all of western Pennsylvania and it's I'm a very tight knit community that is the historic\nA base of Pittsburgh's Jewish community for over one hundred years\nUnfortunately um event like there\nAre no longer rare in American Life and I wondered when you have seen other community faint something like that\nHasn't been running through your mind like what would I Do in the situation I mean as you first got the call and that's the first calls were coming into this with this event with taking find myself wondering what were you thinking and how'd you how'd you thought to yourself who I think that you would have to face something like that\nSo I have a um strategy with my chief of staff on weekends or if he calls I I'm may not pick up on the first time but if he ever calls back\nTwo times I'll know that it is something that is a crisis it was the first time he's ever had to do that\nAnd during that period I realized that something was very very wrong of within five minutes he was at my house and\nWe were on the scene I'm within five minutes of that so I'm looking at different cities of course there's always tried to learn from other cities and uh one of the examples and I\nHad the opportunity to talk to them era Walsh today was Boston in the Boston Marathon and I'm trying to realize how to get not only the strategy of the police in public safety but also communications\nAnd you know obviously the early days and you're still dealing with the immediate aftermath and there are many there are going to be really difficult days ahead when you think about where you would like to take the community going forward\n[noise] do\nSupport for NPR comes from this station and from battle a European made

I I go to our soldiers\nAnd I heard you ran into an aunt who has been hitting with her niece and they also had a personal connection to the area\nThat's right I talked to Lisa flasher Jackson enter nice Eli Fleischer who's sixteen uh Lisa has a lot of friends and family and has for many years around the neighborhood of the synagogue and she spent a lot of time there as a child\nI don't even know what to think I mean I this is my grandmother's backyard my grandmother's in line with us but I mean I I spent a lot of time in the Senate guys at the door I went through my family belong [noise] I'm just I'm horrified what what happened and I hope that we could somebody says some changes it's not just an attack on the Jewish people but at the attack on\nOn everybody in a community and recover strong and we're going to make it through\nAnd I said she was with her knees to sixteen alley they both so you know that there's many generations of his family have ties that his neighborhood they brought a bouquet of flowers to lay down at one of the memorials [noise]\nWell I wouldn't be the\nTree of life so I Know a lot of people there and I feel like it's only right to show up and get the force of the families that were\nSo so what did they make of all of this and the fact that this has been called a hate crime well I just heard so much sadness so much shock and you always hear any situation than in Lisa the the\nSadness so much shock and you always hear any situation than and we study the aunt she mentioned President Trump's rhetoric she she feels that he's partly responsible for sort of heated political climate in the country and rising anti Semitism that's been reported she also expressed a lot of frustration with violence and with the nation's gun law\nI think it's not about me definitely need to have on line so we definitely don't need to have you know security guard at our schools at our temple at our church as\nRussian too I mean summer it's like everyone's saying how you know thoughts and prayers are to that but where we go to ... not even safe so how are we supposed to do that that's the main question I think here right now [noise]\nWelfare you also getting reaction from other places in the city today and so we're going to hear more from you later in the program so thanks so much yeah thanks tucked in\nAnd ... other Pittsburgh faith community strict time during worship services today to acknowledge the tragedy at the tree of life and I got the ... United Methodist church across town open their Sunday services to an interfaith group of worshipers\nAnd the church sanctuary there were eleven white roses displayed at the front one for each of the people killed in yesterday's attack and during the service each name was read out loud and candles were let in their memory a pastor wrestled sugar so Lugar said he that he held a special ... to show his congregation support for the Jewish community and their time of need\nOur intent was to express our solidarity with our Jewish brothers and sisters ... those who were killed on to offer prayers um but as I mentioned in my my Sherman to also find our voice you know we often say that we offer our prayers and bonds\nAnd that is funny but we must do more we much put those prayers into action we must give them all age and with our boys with our actions we can ensure that the hatred is not the new American way you can not be\nDo you have a sense that there are some people who might have been afraid to come out today I did yeah\nBecause we are and open and affirming congregation um some people are afraid to put to target on her back\nAnd I open and affirming you mean that everyone everyone's ... everyone is welcome actually writing everyone is welcome and and normally welcome but to be celebrated what was the attendance like today was it more than you expected we had a couple of folks from the Jewish community come at the beginning\nAnd to offer the words of Thanksgiving they did not speak to worship but they do to come and to say thank you for doing this so it makes a difference\nIf I ask you don't seem rattled by us maybe you are on the inside but you know this community is not that far from here and I have to wonder you I mean you hear you\nMy daughter my youngest daughter turned into four roses in on the\nPolice officers that were injured her husband is a police officer and was directly involved in yesterday's events because he was a police officer in white hall ... where the ... a perpetrator lives\nSo it was very frightening pros personally um but I I Try to allow God ... the urge to give me the bull moose that I Need\nI I Do know if you're from ice shelf I guess if I'm On his life you're from my my children my grandchildren but yet I can allow hatred ... me\nWe also met Laurie half she is the nursery attendant at the church responsible for caring for the congregation littlest members during worship and for her yesterday's attacks on the synagogue where a baby naming ceremony was being much being held in the presence of children hit very close to home\nWell the churches rates me kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of a situation like that and of course\nMe kind of been coming up with plans what to do in case of a situation like that and of course it's the nurturing attendant that has always been something that's been on my mind to start here because I'm responsible for\nEight or nine children at a time and how I Would evacuating from the building or hide them in a situation if it were to come down to it so I switched running through my head penance planes that I've come up for\nYears really and is that what occurred to you yesterday and when you heard about what happened where you're thinking okay what would I Do in that situation\nYeah I grew up post Columbine so as a child um even in first grade we had drilled even back then what to do if there was an active shooter in school and my whole life I grew up in public school and constantly hearing about stuff like that tiny hook happened when I was in high school or things like that\nJust always kind of words in the back of my mind and it's kind of a shadow that I guess a lot of American Kids are growing up with these days\nI don't know whether to be happy or sad you know that you have that somehow it hurts me to think that you have to think about that instead of thinking about what fun games to play\nYeah it's not it's not a plant anyone want to have but it's become a reality that you to be in that situation not have thought of something or to be in that situation and to have you know you you are the last protection for those children and that's what you have to be thinking that\nWe also met a father and son odor and Matthew ... who were in attendance at the special services today and ... said his own life experiences allowed him to feel empathy for Pittsburgh Jewish community\nAnd African American beer and ... and there were no rock out of his friends are there is you walk through or a certain ... ah people look at your front

with me\nI'm also walk and sort of South Carolina she was around me because it was people who are religious and they got killed because their their religious and this residents with me because
