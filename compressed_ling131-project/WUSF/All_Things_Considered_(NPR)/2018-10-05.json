some people that would have preferred that Brett Kavanaugh in the midst of an incredible onslaught\nAgainst him his reputation as a family that he would have acted like and what Thomas on I had\nBy the way he acted like Tom and Tom I think the response what had been well clearly he must be guilty because he truly innocent man would have expressed righteous indignation at them at the charges that he was facing so I think that Brett Kavanaugh was put into a position where he was damned if you did and damned if you did at the American bar association of course\nInterview well over a hundred of his fellow judges and lawyers\nAnd said that he has announced standing judicial temperament and he will as a Supreme Court justices well\nPeople wing and then continuing to weigh in on both sides of

to say about Donald Trump before he went on the ... you know became president I don't hear too many people questioning her integrity and I certainly won't either\nBut to that specific remark he went on to say that the victim of a calculated an orchestrated political hit I mean do you have confidence that he will be able to operate in good faith on cases involving politics\nAbsolutely I I think there is no question\nThat he found the tactics of the members of the Democratic senators on the Senate Judiciary committee to be appropriate but when it comes to rolling on constitutional statutory

moment\nIn his or the op ed that he published last night in the wall Street Journal um he didn't really apologize he offered an explanation for some of his testimony he and he said there are some things they shouldn't have said what ... what should you not have said\nWell he he gave some examples of that actually during the hearing so for instance when he came back after a break he apologized to senator ... uh for asking her whether she had a drinking problem there is no question that he was hot under the color but my God I think anybody who had been accused of spiking women's drink and

Kavanaugh for the court and one of many voices we're hearing on this story throughout the\nProgram [noise] you're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nThe U.S unemployment rate reached an important milestone in September it dropped to its lowest level in nearly fifty years it's now three point seven percent according to the government's monthly employment report today's news is a big positive for many workers but a challenge for businesses NPR's John Ydstie has the story\nSarah house a senior economist at Wells Fargo says it's hard to overstate the significance of this super low unemployment rate\nI didn't get that huge\nAnd houses the lowest unemployment rate in half a century has businesses scrambling\nThat top concern or hearing from employers they can't find work that\nCould limit their ability to grow their companies and put a drag on the overall economy but how says does historically low jobless rate is a positive for many workers\nIt off of course has sent ... could implications for wages\nThere are signs that wage growth is finally picking up as employers are being forced to boost pay to attract and keep workers\nEconomist Dean Baker says low wage workers are among those benefiting partly because many cities and states have raised minimum wages to September jobs data showed average wages growing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower\nGrowing at just to point eight percent over the past year but lower income workers experienced much bigger gains\nFor point three percent over last year so some of the minimum wage was but I think some of that is the tightening white Americans\nAnd Baker says the super low unemployment rate is helping those at the bottom of the economic ladder finally get a toll hold on the first wrong\nWhen you start to get the unemployment rate down load people benefit disproportionately those bottom so you're seeing people that historically not been able to get jobs are least recently not be able to get jobs the markets opening up to them\nBlack teenagers are a good example the black teen unemployment rate hit record low in September that's the good news bad news is that it's still above Nineteen percent\nAnd that's why Baker believes the Federal Reserve should not panic and start raising interest rates more rapidly to keep the economy from overheating\nSo who should get the credit for engineering this low unemployment rate\nThe White House took some credit today touting President Trump's policies on deregulation tax cuts and trade former President Obama also gets some credit for reducing the unemployment rate by more than half during his administration\nBaker who's senior economist at the center for economic research and policy says both administrations have a case but\nThe fed is really a hero\nBaker says remember that just four years ago the consensus among fed policymakers was that once the unemployment rate fell below five and a half percent inflation pressures were built\nA lot of them wanted to raise interest rates said you know what I'm getting too low you have a problem with inflation\nBut former fed chair Janet Yellen said let's wait and see what happens and that's what the fed did finally it began raising rates gradually and has continued that pace under the Fed's current leader Jerome Powell\nIf you followed the view of many people on the fed and many other economists they will start to slam on the brakes the unemployment got around five percent and they never would've allowed it to get this low\nAnd Baker says that would have meant millions of people might not have gotten the jobs they now have John Ydstie NPR News Washington [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News this is W.
