for joining us thank you and Dan ... is a Republican and New Hampshire running for reelection he's the only openly gay member of the New Hampshire state Senate\nThanks for being with us pleasure to be here well you each first just tell me why you think this year has attracted a record number of algae to people to run for office\nYou know I think we're seeing is that as we get broader acceptance candidates are more comfortable running and I say that as a Republican are states motto is live free or die and I believe in that and I believe in equality for everyone American\nSociety is is evolving and that gives a better opportunity to run a million ... what do you think\nYeah this is Gina I think that frankly I don't know who said at first but it it continues to apply right if you're not at the table you're on the menu\nAnd I think you know we we've seen what happens when our voices are are not at the table um and and you know it's hard for me to separate being an algae be the woman being a first generation American being a veteran\nI think you know in in so many of those identities I think we just had to stop making assumptions that people were going to carry on water for us and we have to step up and and be part of this moving forward\nWater for us and we have to step up and and be part of that moving forward\nAmelia I understand in your race your opponent has refused to respect your pronouns or call you by the name of ... it sounds as though gender identity has very much been a part of your campaign whether you want it to be or not\nYeah I Would definitely say my opponent has wanted to make that the big issue of the trade wants to try and get under our skin wants to try and play my games at the end of the day I continue to encourage him to just look at the issues that are district is facing at this time Montanans are definitely don't want to see discrimination happening at any level of our government\nUm we actually had a ballot initiative on our primary ballot that would have a regulated where trans individuals could have gone to the bathroom and use public facilities and it didn't even make it onto the November ballot\nYet the three of you not only represent different parties and different parts of the United states you also represent different generations Dan you're fifty five dreaming you're thirty seven Amelia you're twenty four given how much the country has changed in the last few decades and the way it relates to algae beat the cue people do you think that shapes your experience\nDifferent Gina I mean most certainly um I served in the air force intelligence officer and I served under don't ask don't tell\nI remember that and I've got you know some wonderful fellow than and turned on the team and they don't know what I'm referencing when I say don't ask don't tell so it's that's a good thing and and kind of a bad thing because people sometimes don't appreciate just how far we've come in so in the little time um\nBut it's also a stark reminder of just how much we could lose in a short amount of time\nYeah I Would definitely agree with you Gina and you know I I Would like to thank folks that like you and Dan pave the way as as a young twenty four year old I'm getting into politics\nIt's hard to say you know exactly what the world looked like Thirty years ago for someone that's my agent to uh\n[laughter] and I I mean if it wasn't pretty especially up here in Montana I mean just down in Wyoming you know on on the anniversary of Matthew Shepard the murder um it definitely kind of takes us by surprise and we all do feel vulnerable\nBut as a young person I recognize how much ground has been\nMade altogether for folks my age\nYeah this is Dan I'm\nWas in college when HIV was really hitting the Reagan Administration there was a lot we didn't know a lot we didn't understand and it provided I think an opportunity for people to put us all at a further distance\nAnd we were oftentimes demonized and to me and but when you consider where we were back then\nAnd how we've made gradual progress over the years I think what it says is this is a long term\nProcess the Trump Administration has rolled back algae beauty cue writes in some areas vice president Pence address the values voters summit which is hosted by the family Research Council the Southern Poverty Law Center called that anti LGBT hate group do think that in the Trump era it is more challenging to gain Republican than it was\nNo I don't I'm President Trump is the first\nPresident to send a letter to the log cabin Republicans he's asked for advice on some judicial appointments we've never had that happened before\nAnd I think that speaks to where the full administration is it's easy to look at one or two incidents to say oh this person doesn't like the ... community and I I Would say that there are certainly in both parties\nFolks who maybe aren't that supportive of us but again\nWe're not going to change that until we work within the party ourselves to bring that change about\nI mean a million and Gina how do you think bipartisan algae beauty cue candidates fit into our national political conversation which fields so starkly divided along party line\nYeah I'm a first I Want\nStarkly divided along party line\nYeah I'm a first I Want to say how how interesting to hear from dance perspective um you know I think that at the end of the day the overall ... both parties as Dan was saying um they don't necessarily feel good when someone of the ... community stepped up and wants to run for office\nKind of like Dan I dealt with a lot of a similar situation there um were immediately the state party was a little bit hesitant to want to run a trans woman especially a trans woman of color into their political scene\nI'm so it's not just happening on the Republican side it's definitely happening on the Democratic side too and the only way that we can combat that is by continuing to run people and we use of all the overall national landscape for future algae GQ candidates as well Gina\nYet I mean I can tell you a you won't believe it I Know but there are some folks in Washington in Texas that did not think a lesbian that could do how do you what we've done a but it goes back to exactly what Amelia discuss which is um you know what can you do\nFor the people what can you do for voters what is your track record 'em into your point about bipartisanship you know I've got fourteen years and national security and none of that did I ask ever ask anybody what party they were with do\nIt at the end of the day I think it's less about identity and more so about the issues and again the moral courage needed to fight for our community and our country at this point\nOne of the things that has really struck me is young gay folks who stopped by or email and say I just want to thank you for what you're doing\nOne fellow even said it gives me hope for the future to know that I can follow in your footsteps and do the same thing because what we're doing I think is bigger than we realize often times and the impact we're having a young people is more significant and deeper\nThan we can conceive so I feel a great sense of responsibility and I'm sure gene and a meal you do as well\nTo those young people that are following behind us I Want to thank

called up tomorrow Kaufman with us she served as State Department under President Obama and is now with Brookings she says Trump is following through on a position he took more than a year ago\nOn his first foreign trip when he went to the kingdom of Saudi Arabia he said explicitly we're not here to lecture we're not here to tell other people how to live what to do who to be or how to worship\nAnd

that's going to lead someone like president ... think that he can get away with doing the same thing\nThere were a lot of instances during the Obama administration where the president condemned the actions of foreign leaders whether that was one of them are putting in Russia or the shuttle offered in Syria and it didn't do much to deter them so is it really possible to say that this was happening more because President Trump is in office\nI think they're both direct and indirect ways in which President Trump's blonde attitude about human rights and democracy it translates into behavior abroad\nThe first of course is if dictators feel like they have a green light from the American president and that's pretty rare but the United states doesn't always criticized directly or one on one sometimes it works together with other western governments\nAnd they all do a day marched together or the issues simultaneous statements so that no one government gets the backlash all by

control over how they look at how they present themselves\nNominate putting in place of practice called gender response of corrections it's the idea that there are important differences between men and women in prison\nEvery corrections officers being trained that women take different paths to prison they're less likely than men to commit violent crimes in prison are less likely to be violent

can you tell us about Jared Kushner's relationship with my ... been so long\nWe know that they've had at least five meetings in person uh since Trump took office\nTheir first meeting at the White House was in March twenty Seventeen and they seem to have hit it off they're both in their thirties and there I was obviously and both both in very powerful positions it was Christian or who reportedly convince Trump to go to Saudi Saudi Arabia as his first foreign trip that's unheard of presidents usually go to\nCanada or Mexico first uh and he doesn't talk much in public but in a speech\nTo celebrate the opening of the U.S embassy in Jerusalem this year he named check Saudi Arabia as one of the countries in the middle East that is looking for reform\nFrom Israel to Jordan to Egypt to Saudi Arabia and beyond many leaders are fighting to modernize their countries and create better lives for their people\nAnd so it was a relationship that he really cultivated and he promoted this idea that the Saudis were moving forward in a positive way\nYour question I have a big portfolio at the White House how did he come to the point person for Saudi Arabia specifically for the Trump Administration\n... it's a bit surprising because he doesn't have much foreign policy experience he was obviously in real estate before this but President Trump when he came to the White House he didn't have this wide uh this large pool of diplomats on his team and during the campaign he really relied on Kushner a and that continued as president\nAnd so a big part of criminals portfolio is Middle East peace peace in the middle east it coming up coming up with this deal in Saudi Arabia could play a big role in that\nA U.S ambassador to the U.N Nikki Haley within the oval office recently and she talked about ... role and working on that peace plan and other trade deals\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared enough that there is such a hidden shame yet that no one understand\nSo Haley had nice things to say about ... and about Trump or but there have been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state\nUh but there had been reports that former secretary of state former secretary of state Rex Tillerson was not happy with questionnaires are influence on foreign policy and both ... and ... they really approach international relations in a different way they focus on personal chemistry personality pretty much above all\nTurned out with this controversy where the White House was getting daily questions about it and for secretary of state has flown to Saudi Arabia where things stand today with Christian or on the ...\nWe don't really know it's not clear at this moment Kushner was one of the White House official who was reaching out to uh Mohammed bin some on a after could show gee went missing ... went missing the White House said he and other officials\nAre pressed Saudi Arabia to make sure their investigation is open and transparent a but right now the crown prince is denying knowledge of this disappearance uh one of the criticisms of cushion there has been\nFrom an experienced him diplomats\nIs that because he lacks experience that it may be easy to manipulate him a and for foreign leaders to manipulate him I talked to Brett brewing who was a director of\nGlobal engagement for the Obama White house and he said he worries that Christian or could act as a back channel out to Trump for kind of outside leaders and go outside the national security chain\nAnd then there's the question of financial ties between the cushion her family Trump and the Saudis\nAnd a lot of that is not clear because we don't have a President Trump's tax returns and some of that is not clear at some of these dealings are are not transparent\nUp but we do know that President Trump said on the campaign trail that he liked the Saudis because they had bought forty and fifty million dollars in apartments from him and there have been reports\nAre that Kushner a Christian or a backed or associate it a firms may have been trying to get money from Saudi backed a fun\nNPR's Ayesha Rascoe thanks a lot thank you you're listening to all things
