I. and Kaiser Health news\nThe deadly limousine crash in New York that killed ... people last weekend is raising questions about safety regulations little makers do not have to prove that their vehicles meat that seems safety standards that other cars on the road and they never have NPR's Camila Domonoske reports\nAny ordinary passenger cars sold in the U.S has to meet federal safety requirements small buses had different safety rules here's where the limousine loophole comes in if you take a car and modify it stretching it out to fit as many people as a bus you don't have to prove it meets either set of standards\nLimousines are treated almost uniquely when we think about motor vehicles\nJason levine is the executive director of the center for auto safety he says Leno's should have their own standards because they're neither cars and our buses\nRegulators you've talked to a gym in between the two of them out and have come up with that thing\nLimos are regulated by a patchwork of state and local rules for instance a large jak came into effect in California it requires additional rear exit on stretch limousines a few years ago a bride and four of her friends died when they were trapped in the back of a limo that caught on fire\nThe local limo industry fought hard against the bill crews and find has the c._e._o. of dreading locks Illinois' company in Southern California he says the cost of the new law was difficult for operators especially those using older Lincoln town car stretches\nThe ritual of these modified Lindsey at the exit and be anywhere from a few thousand dollars up to and twelve thousand dollars that amount is sometimes I'm the value of some of those Linda's\nBut in San ... also says he personally with support more safety regulation\nThere should be a nationwide certain jumper regulations that make sure that these vehicles are up to date and age to certain point\nSome stretch when those are safer than others\nTwenty some stretch when those are safer than others he says companies can do pull test where a powerful machine ... seats to see if they budge\nIf you get something before the impact in other words if it was not when we installed shortly underneath the vehicle in on the jury or the vehicle\nBut not every company does those tests there are other risks safety experts say limos often lack side impact reinforcement and they don't always have to have enough seatbelts for every passenger you can look for ... for a limo and find tastes as\nSome of the public last year about ... they seem to care about price\nRose Mary Shay hand as the president of consumers for auto reliability and safety she says the owners shouldn't be on customers to figure out if a limo is safe\nI think it's just really grossly unfair people aren't they always care about safety I just think most people assume that if they're in the business that that their minimum requirements that they have to be\nOn the federal level there's never been a major push toward regulating limos safety\nIn twenty Fifteen there was a deadly Leno crash on Long Island afterward Senator Chuck Schumer of New York issue to call for a federal agency to investigate such crashes the agency came up with recommendations but the national limousine association says it never even heard about them\nLiving of the center for auto safety says federal standards would be ideal for the sake of consistency\nBut uh if we're going to continue to see a lack of of moving out of D.C having streets will lead the way I wouldn't be terrible\nInvestigators are still working out exactly what happened in New York last weekend when the two thousand one for just stretch limousine crashed and kill twenty people but they already know that Leno had failed

John\nI also so what part of the market started today\nWell a tech was particularly hit hard it's been the foundation of ah the market but ah all of the um all sectors really were down um [noise]\nUh the the fall virtually wiped out all of the talk gained since mid summer but the tech sector has been the hardest hit and and as I said I just wanted the foundations who mark and in fact the tech heavy NASDAQ lost four percent of its value today and the ... which also has a lot of tax\nLost three and a ... percent so it was a tough day for everyone but particularly for tech\nUm no I understand that the fed usually raises rates to stave off inflation rate on the Federal Reserve has said they will continue to raise rates gradually it suggested I Would stop raising two at the ... the benchmark rate between three and three point five percent but are there inflation fears\nFake the benchmark rate between three and three point five percent that are there inflation fears going on\nWell well there aren't but interest rates are fears contribute to do this outrage on government bonds have been rising rapidly over the past few weeks\nThat's made the market nervous in fact I this is the fifth straight day of losses for the U.S and the five hundred and rising interest rates make stocks less valuable a and there's concern in the market about just how high rates might go to the Federal Reserve\nHas said it will continue to raise rates gradually and as soon as you suggested it will stop a between three and three and a half percent so it\nStill has a way to go there are some inflation concerns but they're related to the very very strong economy we've had a unemployment at a fifty year low so there's concern in the markets to their wages will begin to rise more rapidly and create more inflation pressures\nOkay so you're saying the economy remains strong student ... good for the stock market what happened well\nThe economy is strong in the U.S and most comedies are saying today Solomon is not the end of a double marketing stocks\nSo a while the U.S economy remains strong um Europe has cool to bed and so I've emerging markets or the IMF gave a less than going assessment of the global economy this week than it had just a few months ago and of course there are these concerns about a global trade war a disrupting\nA the global economy a trade war between the world's two biggest economies are the U.S and China so\nWhat we saw today is this could this be the beginning ... long downward trend well\nMost analysts I heard from today don't think so some said the selling toward the end of the day which took the Dow down from around five hundred points to a eight hundred and thirty points down was due to machine trading driven by algorithms that reached levels that called for selling\nGiven the strength of the U.S economy and the likelihood of continued high levels of profit it's it's difficult to believe that the market will continue to melt down but there are a are points where investors are looking over the horizon nine months\nOr two a year and wondering whether the fed rate hikes will head bring us into recession All right That's NPR's John Ydstie

Chang and I'm Mary Louise Kelly a team of Fifteen Saudis flew into ... last week drove to the Saudi consulate and then deported that same day on private planes headed for Cairo and goodbye\nAnd it's just according to the Washington Post which has been tracking the disappearance of Saudi journalist ...\n... has not been heard from or seen since he entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October second it's not known whether he's alive or dead Shane Harris is one of the reporters working this story for the post and I asked him\nFifteen Saudi sounds like a lot to do we know what their alleged operation was\nI don't think we'd fully know the intent and I think you're right that feed is Fifteen people is a lot to to kill an individual in a a former U.S official I spoke to about this but it actually bears a lot of the hallmarks of rendition or a kidnapping operation but we still don't know but what we are understanding\nIs that the U.S government was picking up intelligence that the Saudis wanted for some time to capture could show you're not clear whether they wanted to capture\nAnd prosecute him or whether they want to interrogate him or kill him but that there was some high level interest on the part of the government of getting him in some way okay let's\nLet's unravel that a little bit just to U.S intelligence that allegedly picked up communications of what Saudi officials discussing ... correct\nThat the u._s. intelligent picking up the conversations of Saudis discussing a plan to to lay hands on a show of you to capture him or the initial plan as we understand that was to try to find a way to lure him back to Saudi Arabia and capture him there I think probably could show you felt that that was not a safe option to go home to Saudi Arabia\nAnd it's possible that this what you're seeing here happening stumbled could be sort of a plan B\nOr for that to send these teams to go out there there was one group laying and wait for him we believe\nAt the consulate and then another group that came in after he may have been captured or met with his faith or at the consulate but it shows the Saudi officials were very keen on getting him and going to we assume you know whatever lengths necessary to do that\nDo we know what U.S intelligence do you do with these ... did they warned Chris choking\nWhat my sources of told me is that this information was circulated in intelligence reports what's not clear at this point is whether anyone from the U.S government Warren ... and there is a standing policy on what's called the duty to warn US government believes that someone is about to meet with harm\nOne is the U.S government believes that someone is about to meet with harm or whether the person that US citizen or not there can be an obligation to reach out until that person we don't know if that happened and we don't know whether the U.S government or the White House called the Saudis and effectively said we know which are up to back off a\nCough [noise] why do you think Shane Harris your source wants you to know about this in my experience U.S intelligence officials tend to have a reason when they talk to reporters like you're right I think\nThere's a real concern on two fronts one that this was a journalist and a prominent critic of the regime in Saudi Arabia who now has gone missing possibly some harm it's come to him and there's a real concerned about that but more to the point I think there is a concern within the U.S intelligence community that visit administration in particular\nHas become very close to the ruling groups in Saudi Arabia particularly the crown prince Mohammed bin ...\nOf who to be Frank is not really viewed as a trusted figure within many parts of the U.S intelligence community there is an affection for the old guard of it he replaced that he's sort of ousted and I think people have a lot of concerns about the the closeness between people in the White House and the current leadership in Saudi Arabia\nWhen you talk about closeness between the U.S in Saudi Arabia you're talking in part about the relationship between Trump's son in law Jared Kushner and Mohammed bin Salman\nAbsolutely jerk ... have been some honor MBBS as he sometimes known in the intelligence community have developed a very close personal relationship in that I think is very much at the heart of us Saudi relations right now or they've met with each other and a number of occasions\nAnd there's a personal bond there that is translating into policy\n[noise] that's the Washington Post Shane Harris updating us on a couple of the many moving threads of the investigation into what happened to Saudi journalist Jamal ... chain thank you my pleasure thanks\nBrett Kavanaugh's confirmation to

the conservative group concerned women for America which supported Kavanaugh\nWe're taking a moment here to rejoice and the fact that he was actually confirmed and at that very quickly then after the swearing in we were talking about starting to get together and think about you know the the best cases and therefore I can sit in front of the court\nSeveral state laws severely restricting abortion are already making their way through the court system including one from Iowa that would ban the procedure as soon as the fetal heartbeat can be detected\nOften before a woman do she's pregnant Kevin

abortion\nPlanned Parenthood executive vice president Don McGahn said in some ways the last several years have been a training ground for what could be coming she said that many states have passed laws that force women to go to great lengths to get abortions\nAlready women across this country half to access funding they have to access transportation they have to access housing that have to access support networks that is going to be a greater need\nIf they're further restrictions when row is attacked by this\nCourt those efforts will now be super size\nIs attacked by this court those efforts will now be supersized ... said she said Planned Parenthood will lobbies state legislatures to strengthen protections for abortion rights and expand services in states with more liberal lot\nDr any Whittaker is medical director at Planned Parenthood of Illinois she's expecting to see more women coming from more restrictive states across the Midwest\nWe know that we're going to need an iron clad network that dates and providers across the country or abortion will still be legal and accessible no matter what happens on the Supreme Court\nIn the past few years the organization has expanded surgical abortion services from two to five locations in Illinois nationwide Planned Parenthood also will work to increase access to medication abortion and use technology to connect women with information about where they can get the procedure\nBoth sides are also preparing for the mid term elections next month the abortion rights groups ... pro Choice America has launched a million dollar ad by telling supporters to vote out Republican candidates this November this that opens with an image of Kavanaugh's face\nRight now women are wondering\nNay rallies also launching a separate campaign to educate suburban women in eight key cities around the country about the impending threats to row for abortion rights opponents like Mallory Quigley of the Susan B. Anthony List the cabinet fight has also served as a reminder of the importance of elections\nThe cat on a confirmation battle kind of exemplified why we activists to begin with you know why we've been engaging in Senate races across the country since last summer and that's because you know precisely the Senate is aware Supreme Court justices are an armed\nWith Kevin on the Supreme Court advocates
