things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin broadcasting today from member station W H y y in Philadelphia we're here because we wanted to spend some time today talking about the mid term elections which are just a few days away\nBut we are going to begin our program with news of another horrific mass shooting this time at the tree of life synagogue in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania eleven people died at least six people were injured according to officials\nA public safety official in the city describe the synagogue as a horrific crime scene President Trump addressed the shooting at a political event this afternoon and said federal authorities have been dispatched help to help investigate he condemned the shooting as a wicked act of mass murder\nThe vials filled voice of anti Semitism must\nBe condemned and free from everywhere and anywhere for years\nThere was no tolerance for answers images and in America\nFor for any form of religious or racial hatred or prejudice\nReporter Sarah Schneider of member station W E s ... is covering this tragedy and she is with us now Sarah thanks so much for talking with us I think if what we know about the identity of the victims police officers we know were among the wounded can you tell us anymore\nWe don't know anything about we haven't identified the eleventh people who were killed today we do know that none of the uh people who were killed works\nWho were killed today we do know that none of the uh people who were killed were children we do know that there were six I'm injured victims and a two of the injured victims or a sixty one year old female a Seventy year old male and then also uh for police officers those officers were\nFirst responders and I'm too were swat officers\nCan you tell us a bit more about the synagogue and the community where this happened\nYet the synagogue is in um squirrels hell it's this vibrant you know active Jewish community in Pittsburgh and um today when I was on the scene we saw you know many people who were concerned about friends and family members who they knew where in the building that day\nOr this morning and a lot of people just confused trying to figure out where those people are\nCan you tell us a bit more about the alleged gunman and I understand that he was taken into custody alive\nYeah we do know the government is alive he's in fair condition with\nA gunshot wound um that the director of a public safety and Pittsburgh says he believed to be from police officers they haven't given any other um details about this person but we do know that\nUh there will they they assume that you know charges will come down possibly today\nCan you tell us a bit more about what type of weapon or weapons he use and can you tell us any more about how long it took to subdue him\nOut we know that he had three handguns and an assault rifle but it is unclear if he used all of them in the shooting um we were told he's been in the building he was in the buildings day for about twenty minutes an app he was\nExiting the synagogue um officers confronted him and that's when the two swat officers were injured um that heat retreated into the building\nYou know how many people were in a synagogue at the time and if there were any security guards posted and the reason I raise that as a President Trump rejected the idea that this has anything to do with gun laws but he said that if the synagogue had had an armed guard inside that the government could have been stopped so can you tell us any more about that yeah\n\nTheir\nSupport

today from WHYY in Philadelphia we are of course following the shooting at the synagogue in Pittsburgh today\nWe will have more later in the program but first let me tell you why we're in Philadelphia\nYou may have hurt other colleagues from NPR on the road this week like them we spent the week traveling and talking with people about the mid term elections just ten days away now visiting pivotal states and counties\nWe decided to come here because Pennsylvania the Keystone State went for President Trump and two thousand sixteen breaking a winning streak for Democrats that stretch back to Nineteen eighty eight\nAnd Pennsylvania was supposed to be part of the blue wall from Pennsylvania to Michigan to Wisconsin the Democrats thought would secure the White House for them and all of those states went for Trump on election night\nNow though Democrats are banking on a comeback here in Pennsylvania in their quest to retake the house so we've been talking with candidates business owners students working folk people we found because they are really into politics and people who are really not and\nWe've been asking all of them watch and are on what's on their minds this election year\nAnd help us understand but we've been hearing we ask WHYY Dave Davies to join us he's covered politics in this region for more than Thirty years and he's with us now and thank you so much for hosting us and thanks to all the people who offered a pumpkin bread and cookie insider which we were not expecting so thank you for that is great to have you all\nSo nationally they've Democrats need to take back twenty four seats to win the house and Alan's say they could pick up a quarter of those seats give or take in Pennsylvania and a lot of that has to do\nWith a new congressional map here in the state can you just tell us how that came about and what that has meant to this election\nYeah this is a seismic shift in the politics of the state I mean for the last six years pencil then you'd have had congressional maps that were pretty bizarrely shape and generally acknowledged to be a gerrymandered if even favor Republicans we have eight hundred thousand more registered Democrats than Republicans in Pennsylvania Democrats have only one five of Eighteen seats\nThis was challenged last year in a lawsuit that was aimed not at federal court where some of these gerrymandering suits have stalled but at the state court\nAnd in Pennsylvania the state Supreme Court five of them elected Democrats not only ruled the map or an unconstitutional gerrymandered and ordered new districts but said it had to happen immediately for this election and it created some confusion and controversy but it really opened up opportunities for Democrats\nAren't big themes playing out in congressional races across the state\nFor Democrats are they're big themes playing out in congressional races across the state and I asked because we've been watching the ads all week and I get the sense that both major parties are trying to push specific themes in these races so do you see that\nSure sure I mean for the Democrats they're telling people that Republicans are tools of corporations and and the wealthy who will strip away protections for people with preexisting medical conditions are up the Democrats or Republicans are casting the Democrats as friends of Nancy Pelosi they can't say that name off\nWho will spending recklessly raise your taxes and a lot of it is you know Michelle just character assassination if you have ever missed the tax bill if you have done or said anything controversial it will be exaggerated an apple fight on television and hopes to to undermine you\nWell one of the races that we've been focusing on this week is the first district in Pennsylvania it has attracted an enormous amount of national attention it's drawn huge amounts of money it's been one of the most expensive campaigns and the country and a lot of that has to do\nWith the fact that it's one of the twenty three districts that went for Hillary Clinton at two thousand sixteen but what's also carried by a Republican congressman at this case Brian Fitzpatrick\nHe's being challenged by a millionaire philanthropists named Scott Wallace who's never run for office before and he's poured millions of dollars of his own money into his campaign and I asked him why\nWill because it's an extraordinary are\nNot just the policies that are being twisted around and and turned toward the one percent on the corporations and away from the Ninety nine percent but just a moral tone of our country I've got three kids are going to raise a kid in this atmosphere of this influence coming from the White House\nIt's destructive of the fabric of our moral core in America\nAnd destructive of democracy the assaults on the media the assault on the courts and the rule of law and the FBI or intelligence agencies on the very notion of truth itself\nIs under assault and I've never encountered at a time like this and I just couldn't sit on the sidelines anymore\nWhen do you think the campaign here hinges upon it you know I was watching a lot of the ads last night and all very negative [laughter] so what do you think is the lynchpin of it here\nThe on a specific level the big issues here our health care and clean air and clean water we have local issues with water pollution from a military base and air pollution but the overarching issue\nThat ties all of us together as money in politics my opponent has taken a million dollars in corporate tax money I refuse to take a dime he's got seven and a half million dollars in superPAC contributions a huge amount of corporate money in this\nAnd I think people are fed up with that because that's what is blocking the people's business\nFrom getting done and you think people are noticing that when I explain this is why you're not getting clean air and clean water when you want reform of Wall Street predatory lending when you want gun control the amount of money that flows in from the big corporate special interest\nStops every single thing that the people want you know frankly the situation with the money in politics is outrageous\nThe amount of money it takes to run in the district like this in a suburban district and expensive media market like Philadelphia is ridiculous nobody can raise Fifteen million dollars without going to the corporations and begging them and of course their money comes with expectations comes with strings attached\nAnd so that's how the candidates votes\nSo yes I Am blessed to be able to do some soul funding here I don't know how anybody could unless they take corporate money so we have to fix that system you know the largest voting bloc in America that understand this problem is the people who don't vote at all\nThey are not crazy when they think that their vote\nThey are not crazy when they think that their vote their voice is going to be drowned out by the voice of the big special interests how big is a factor as President Trump\nIn your campaign 'cause he's huge I mean I don't bring him up when I go door to door\nBut people blurt out that they want to change they cannot stand the tone coming from Washington even Republicans not that they want to throw him overboard but they just\nHate the tone so he's not on the ballot but is he on the ballot in a way I mean do you see your campaign in a way or this election as in a in a referendum on Donald Trump\nIs becoming and largely\nThrough his own urging he goes around the country saying vote for blank is a vote for me he is saying this is essentially a presidential election and of course interest is much higher in the presidential election\nAnd the reality is this is the first chance to voters in this district and everywhere in the country have to express their feelings about what they're seeing\nAnd the last thing I think anybody wants to see is Trump doing a victory lap around the rose garden on November seventh\nSo let me see babies let me ask you about both of the things of that loss just brought up first of all the money going into the race tell me more about that well\nScott Wallace has put at least eight million dollars of his own family fortune into the race probably more when the final tallies come in about eleven million dollars has gone into the race from outside superPACs most of that Republican superPACs to help fitzpatrick because he doesn't have the family money and all of it for negative\nAnd most of it and what about the Trump factor we talked about that is is is the president a factor in this race across the state\nIt's fascinating yeah I mean when I talk to voters and ask them what are they thinking about they might mention jobs or taxes but pretty soon you get down to some version of I think the other side in this country has gone nuts and they have to be stopped and that really is about Trump\nOr the feeling that the Trump has to be stopped or that those who oppose him have to be stop I think it really is what's it's the most motivating thing I see\nSo as we said Democrats got while it is challenging the incumbent Republican Brian Fitzpatrick fitzpatrick is a former FBI agent the only form an FBI agent currently serving in the house but he's also been a vocal critic of President Trump on certain issues such as the way the president has handled the investigation into Russian interference in the two thousand sixteen elections\nAccomplishments as Patrick invited us to meet him at his parent's house in a suburb of ... town where he grew up as the youngest of eight siblings and despite being the beneficiary of a lot of this so called independent expenditures the Davis just talked about flowing into the race on his behalf it's Patrick said that he agrees with his Democratic opponent that there's too much money in politics\nI could not agree more that money in politics of the problem I was a supervising the FBI political corruption unit\nIn April of two thousand and one of the Citizens United decision came down ... my boss I got caught up I had to speak to him about this issue is question was what was going to do to our corruption cases less it starts going increase the corruption because money's the root of all evil and money in politics is about corruption cases\nSpectrum menus and meteorologist Josh

Pennsylvania the FBI is on the ground there hoping to investigate the tragedy authorities are treating it as a hate crime NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas who's here with us now to tell us more hello Brian farther\nFirst of all what can you tell us about the gunman at this point ah well\nWell what can you tell us about the gunman at this point [noise]\nUh well we don't know a whole lot about 'em at this point he's been identified a as Robert Bowers of Pittsburgh resident in terms of how this investigation is going to look the special agent in charge of the FBI field office in Pittsburgh a man by the name of Bob Jones laid out a bit of that today a here's what he had to say about how this is going to move forward\nAnd over the next several days and weeks we will look at everything in his suspects life is home his vehicle is social media and his movements over the last several days\nAre Jones says officers recovered and assault rifle and three hand guns at the scene a when a agents are going to search is home they say that they'll take precautions that case there might be any sort of explosive devices there\nHe says the FBI does not believe at this point uh that the suspect had any accomplices or he was not known to law enforcement for today says uh and he also says that the suspects full motive at this point is unknown but that of course is something that the FBI is going to work to find out\nWhere the president has called this an anti Semitic act and authorities say that they are looking at this as a hate crime investigation what does that mean and what does that tell us\nWell first off us attorney general Jeff Sessions says set in a statement that the Justice Department will file a hate crime or hate crimes and other criminal charges or in this case he says that there's no place for hatred of violence on the base of basis of religion\nOr the U.S attorney for the western district of Pennsylvania Scott Brady he says that prosecutors could file those charges as early as this evening but we're gonna have to wait and see what all those sort of charges are going to entail\n'cause you just tell us a bit more about what hate crime charges would mean\nRight in in some cases a federal hate crime charges would bring a stiffer sentence or to take into account that particular nature of of the crime in a case like this a a former federal prosecutor tells me that it's likely wouldn't change that much\nBecause this sort of crime with eleven people killed uh the the sentence is likely to be significant anyways but federal hate crimes could bring into play a possibly the death penalty Pennsylvania does have a state death penalty although it hasn't been using in quite some time\nBut treating this shooting and prosecuting it as a federal hate crime does send a message of the seriousness of the crime and that the federal government treats it as such a you'll recall of course the case of Dylann Roof\nOf who was convicted in the killing of nine black parishioners at a church in Charleston South Carolina the federal government in that case brought hate crime charges against him even though he was already facing state charges and ultimately a federal jury convicted him a and he uh he was sentenced to death\nAnd just as briefly as you can to the degree that you know what happens next\nWell the FBI is just getting to work on this there's a large crime scene that will have to go through a half to collect evidence there uh there's lab work to be done and then of course there's digging into the or the alleged shooter's social media history there already accounts reportedly linked to him that appear to show a fair amount of anti Semitic sentiments\nA and the alleged shooter in this case is of course eleven in custody so possibly uh looking to question him\nThat if NPR justice reporter Ryan Lucas Ryan thank you so much for talking to thank you [noise]\nAnd once again we are broadcasting today from W H y y in Philadelphia that is where we were when we got a terrible news of the shooting at a synagogue in Pittsburgh this morning\nAnd this week when two people were killed in Kentucky apparently because of their race and pipe bombs were sent to a prominent figures apparently because of their political views\nBut even before those awful events we were hearing people across Pennsylvania tell us\nThey are frustrated with the tone of this country's public discourse the lack of civility they told us they hope for more unity and then the message that might have special resonance in Gettysburg the site of an ethics civil war battle in Eighteen sixty three when of this country the bloodiest from within fifty thousand Americans were injured or killed over the course of\nOver the course of three days but now in two thousand Eighteen a group of residents there had been leading up in a historic church to practice what others preach\nBringing people of different political views together it's called politics tax and stability Democrat car Thompson a former college professor founded the group and twenty Seventeen Darcy ... also a Democrat joined a group through her friendship with Tom sent and Republican Chad collie it's also a member and he told me why he got involved\nIn twenty sixteen in previous years before that was very politically involved I was vice chairman of the Republican Party here locally\nDuring the twenty sixth in campaign or saw a lot of instability a lot of anger a lot of resentment and saw that coming to boiling point in many ways\nAnd uh it encouraged me to stop and think about what was going on in the nation and so I resigned from that and made a vow to myself to get more involved in the community and talking to people who were on the other side of the aisle\nIt sounds to me like this was something that was in you like I Need that you had I it's interesting that there are a number of\nNational political figures who've been calling for something like this lawyer John ... Ohio or I Know maybe Joe Biden you could you know the same argument on average tolerance of venue former governor of Pennsylvania for sixty of homeland security\nBut you it sounds like that was something that was kind of in you and it was and thankfully car came up with a structure for that Darcy what about you\nIs this something that was kind of a hunger within you and now no life and really\nI um I have always done a pretty staunch Democrat I that's where I live pretty much come down on on the left on most things call myself a progressive I never really thought about how important it was to bridge the divide until I got involved\nI think that realizing that that there is a valid\nPoint to be made on both sides and that there is a balance that we can find in has just been a real eye opening experience for me\nWhat did you envision when you started this group like what were you hoping to accomplish\nI was hoping that we could come to understand each other more and I I'm very ... and then as Darcy just said\nThat there are valid points on all sides like Darcy I I'm a very blue blue odor but I think that the red voters have valid points that it will enrich all of us if we can listen to to each other it's sort of like the\nStory of the ... the the elephant\nWhich um I don't know if you're familiar with Philip ... book\nExpert political judgment in which he actually test the theory that the more you investigate various points of view\nThe more likely you are to be correct in predicting what will happen in the future for example to Darcy\nNot that you were saying I don't want to talk to those people many ... but um [laughter] what you know I'm hungry for this experience as others were what made you finally decide to come well it really was cars invitation and cars and courage meant that got me to come to the ground\nAnd then it was the surprise at civility as a conversation that made me stay I tend to be a fairly quiet person who doesn't express myself very well and a group situation and so I don't like\nOf going into a place where there's going to be arguing and fighting and and I feel like I'm going to just shut down I Will just shut down show [noise]\nAnd and I feel like I'm going to just shut down I Will just shut down show this kind of environment where everybody is expected to have something to say really helped me and knowing that people were not going to argue with me or shut me down", "year": "2018", "show_name": "All Things Considered (NPR)", "city": "Tampa", "day": "27"}
