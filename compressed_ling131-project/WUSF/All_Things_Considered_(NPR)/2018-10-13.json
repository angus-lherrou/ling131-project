you are who you say you are and the delays the potential voters from becoming active registered voters in Georgia where did this law come from it was a policy of the secretary of state's office for several years to\nUm put voters on pending list until they could be ... come fully registered\nAnd then some of the same civil rights groups that are suing the state now sued them previously over this law that resulted in a settlement in February of last year\nAnd very quickly after that settlement with the state the Georgia legislature passed it into a state law and so now we're in round two where these civil rights groups are suing the state of Georgia and secretary of state Brian Kemp again but this time they're suing over something that's already passed\nInto state law now the secretary of state's office\nSays other states have this kind of law including Florida and in Florida any way of federal court upheld the law\nAnd activists are saying that this lies disproportionately affecting

voters just in the may primary election what's\nThe mood in Georgia right now so close to the election\nThere's a lot of interest in it and this particular case is motivating Democrats who feel that

reaction to what laying down on Thursday\nIt was so surreal dislike I'm excited to not being friends from get out or something I don't know I wouldn't want the on the time you noticed downward spiral what kind of been happening for a couple of years so what happened this week especially after the ... you would not that much of a surprise\nBut as easy as it is to kind of laugh about it and imagine

haven't been taking ... seriously you should start taking him seriously now um I agree with everything right and he just said this is not performance art he's not doing this to be provocative he's not doing this to sell albums\nIt's very clear at least to me that this is how he feels um he even said that racism wasn't a deal breaker for him and\nAs a former ... myself that's really sad coming from the guy who said that George Bush doesn't care about black people after the fallout from Hurricane Katrina so I completely agree with Rodney we need to take this seriously this is a man who has reached\nHe has fans his fans follow him they're influenced by him and he is supporting a president that is arguably just blatantly races\nBecause I'm going to do this next question to you Taylor Swift also got some heated reaction to her backing to Democrats in Tennessee up for people who haven't heard\nTests can you can you tell us what happened what she did on Sunday night she posted a photograph of herself to Instagram and and the caption\nShe talked about the fact that she was coming out for the first time\nAnd vocalizing her political beliefs she endorsed two candidates in Tennessee\nPhil Bredesen who is a candidate for the Senate he's the former governor of Tennessee\nAnd Jim Cooper who's a sitting congressman up for re election in November but the main thrust of her answer and post was about why she's not voting for Marsha Blackburn who's a female candidate in the race she said she likes to support women who are running for office\nBut she couldn't support Marsha Blackburn\nBecause a lot of the policies that black fur and has supported in Congress\nUm she said they're not hurt Tennessee values and high profile Republicans were not happy with her right Mike Huckabee tweeted something about her fans being too young to vote so oh well so what\nBut I mean there was a lot of like negative reaction from high profile Republicans there wasn't negative reaction but it wasn't as strong as for instance Trump has been to criticism in the past he said I liked Taylor's music twenty five percent less now\nUm which is really like not that damning of a of a combination and Mike Huckabee said you know she's entitled to her political beliefs but it's not going to matter and less Thirteen year old girls are voting in which was very dismissive of um Taylor's reach which is a lot broader than just Thirteen year old girls at this point\nBut what about her ... her fans who are Republicans just regular fans not high profile\nSpectrum eighty nine meteorologist

[laughter]\nAnd Sarah Jones is with me in Studio welcome to the program thank you for having me and us and we're running out of here [laughter] I Know you don't want to give away too much but is there a character in this play that you identify most with\nAll of these characters have some element of me in them whether I'd like to admit that or not there's a ... there are a couple of ... types in here there are you know there's a a man who object to find women with a former cop who admits to using you know prosecuted women\nOr as he said never on the clock though you know never well I'm actually on the clock but yeah\nYou know to realize of course I'm looking at him he's objectify women I object to find myself and other women obviously it's on a continuum and it's a different conversation but every time I look at myself and think oh my body's not okay or my worth in value are determined by my\nParents and my marketability\nI'm kind of engaging in one form of the same narrative so ... writing this work has been really cathartic and humbling\nFor me what is forced you to start looking at yourself in relationship to this why are you beginning to do this now\nOne of the things I'm discovering in performing this piece in different places than in connecting with people one commonality is engaging after the show whether it's in queuing day or with social media and I found myself being really you know open about my own me two experiences that predate the hashtags\nYou know when I was in college I thought about\nStripping as kind of a you know the it was sort of cool it was like oh this is my pre beyond say feminism like yes I have bell hooks on this side but I have begun smelled on this side and you know what does healthy sexuality look like as a woman at Bryn Mawr college where you have to you know kind of ... just sort of Bryn Mawr\nBut who also you know I Would go home from school from Philly to New York and party with rappers and you know what it looked like to trade on my appearance and being a woman in a context that was\nObviously just as Texas as the rest of the culture but in hip hop there were definitely this space that I was trying to occupy as a feminist as well and so looking at all of that I'm On a continuum of women who\nAre negotiating their relationship to sex and power\nIn a male dominated culture\nMhm yeah I was wondering if people come up to you after the show to talk about these characters that human body whether they say to you oh my gosh it's totally saw myself and that person or whether they say to you\nMaybe you didn't get that quiet writer I'm not sure if I felt comfortable with you using this accident which is my accent which was my real accent\n... can you talk about some of these conversations that you have after the show that may be comfortable and supportive and maybe not as comfortable\nI Would say for whatever reason the gods and goddesses in trans gods of the theater and of accent and you know kind of persona I really don't think of my as these characters as just having an accent you know there's a woman in the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud\nA woman in the show she's from Dominican Republic she's Puerto Rican Dominican all proud and it's very important to me that people to understand that I have a direct connection to the Dominican Republic myself through my family but also that I Want you to hear her accent and if you have a problem with an accent I Want you to hold up a miracle yourself\nBecause actually there's no indignities of having accented English actually just means I speak two languages or what you know so I Love\nKind of doing a deep dive into people's experience and then presenting it to those people first I always take every character\nYou know I can remember hide that my name is probably more so individual ... went to United Nation schools you also comes from a mixed cultural background so she was growing up with different people from different places from for so long\nBut then when she came to India she was kind of working on some of this material on during the different places that are lots of conversations about sex walk or prostitution ... sexual exploitation that we can have all over the world so she came to India and we said\nVery good cracking good job she's a very nice woman a bit dog but other than that she didn't quite let so you know I really\nTry to ... my material with people from those communities first and then try to engage directly in the conversation if someone says I feel like this isn't dignified why are you doing this I'll say well why do you think someone who's involved in sex work is inherently not dignified\n... what is it about how you were raised and how you were brought up that drew you to different people with the with different experiences and drew you to wanting to bring their stories to life\nYeah well I think like so many of us in today's culture I come from a mixed\nUpbringing experience my family was black and white him on my mom's side my grandmother was Irish American and German American and we have both Christians and Jews on that side of the family and my character Lorraine would say it's a long story filled with intrigued and interfaith guilt [laughter]\nBut you know of you know my black relatives my white relatives the peoples who you meet in my shows are these amalgamated versions of people I really knew and\nI had to learn to Code Switch as we call it now just to like get dinner [laughter] you know growing up it was very normal for me to identify with\nThe kind of the pluribus unum within me and to see that as very normal and it wasn't until I went out into the world where people were like what is it which is in Utah white you this that and I heard a lot of that\nAnd gradually I learned to stop fearing all of those many what felt like these different shards of myself and instead see it as one whole you know I Am I'm a mosaic of a person and that's authentically who I Am\n[noise] that's Sarah Jones talking about our place sell by date Sarah thanks so much thank you ... oh my pleasure our pleasure and finally today we are going to take a listen to a pod cast I host along with Gene Demby called codes which is all about race and identity in America and\nIn our most recent episode we talked about adoption specifically trans racial adoption\nMost adoptive parents in the U.S are white and a lot of them are adopting children who aren't as according to the Institute on family studies so we put out a call to those of you who are adopted we wanted to know how did adoption form your sense of racial identity and your sense of ... and here's what you told us\nHe spent the first of all the years of my life thinking that I was a little white girl and when I found out that it wasn't it wasn't just revelation it was ...\nSo really I think it's kind of a lack of identity that ties transnational
