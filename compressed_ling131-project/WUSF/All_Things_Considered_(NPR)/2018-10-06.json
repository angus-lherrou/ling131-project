minute let's talk about the Republican view for him and it's got because because many senators have said all along that they've found Christine positive for sincere incredible and yet they effectively discounted their testimony that they talk about\nThat they did Republican after Republican was making that same argument often and strikingly similar wording almost the exact same phrasing that Ford was sincere that's a word that kept coming up they said they believe that something happened to her but either that they didn't believe that Brett Kavanaugh was the one who assaulted her\nOr that they just didn't see any evidence backing for it up on that claim that was the final view from Susan Collins of Maine when she made that speech yesterday insurance Kavanaugh would be appointed a confirmed

things considered from NPR News I'm Michelle Martin as you've probably heard by now the Senate has voted to confirm DC circuit court judge Brett\nKavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court as you likely also know this has been a trying period for all involved earlier this hour we heard from someone who knows and supports judge Kavanaugh\nNow we're going to hear from Lisa Banks she is one of the lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford the woman who told the Senate Judiciary committee that Kevin assaulted her years ago when I spoke with Lisa Banks yesterday I asked whether Ford a psychology professor was aware of all of the women\nWho say they had been inspired to share their own stories of sexual assault as a result of her testimony\nI think the impact that she has had on this country is tremendous I'm not certain she has a a sense of that yet this the full impact a and I'm not sure we've seen the full impact but\nBut certainly what she has done a has unleashed something that is going to move the country in a better direction and women across the country across the world for that matter a have found their voice to come forward to have the courage\nTo come forward and say I'm a survivor to or to tell their story\n... ... what does professor Ford wants to happen now on which makes you told my colleague Rachel Martin when you spoke with her shortly after her name became public that her goal has been and and now that the information be provided to the people making the decisions so that those making this decision could make an informed decision\nWith all the facts that's happened so what what does she want to happen now\nWell I think she didn't want the senators casting a vote to be fully informed and what would I Would say is that they're not fully informed\nBecause what we did not get was an FBI investigation\nAs FBI investigations are typically conducted\nThey did not interview many many many witnesses who are identified both by Dr Ford buttons Ramirez and by others who would have had important critical information and even corroborating information and so the senators frankly are not fully informed and casting their vote\nThere there is some evidence that this is having a galvanizing effect on both parties I made it there is some evidence that\nRepublicans are now much more interested in the midterms than they had been previously Democrats are showing similar things that there's there's some evidence that it is kind of energizing both sides if that's the case what do you or what is Dr Ford think about that [noise] I think\nWhat do you or what is Dr Ford think about that\nI think what she has done is in credibly important in that she has given a voice to hundreds of thousands of women across the country and throughout the world and so I think that that can't be underestimated and this is going to\nBe an important moment we're going to look back on it and we may be looking back on it in November it may have an impact on November and it it may not I don't know I think it will because it has\nRaised a lot of passions and concerns among the American people and it's a debate we're going to continue to have beyond this weekend and beyond November\nThat was Lisa Banks one of the attorneys for Christine Blasey Ford I spoke with her yesterday before the final confirmation vote\nMm Mm\nThis week Amazon announced a minimum wage increase for upwards of three hundred and fifty thousand workers starting in November first the paid will start at Fifteen dollars an hour\nIt's a bold move for the nation's second largest private employer but it's a new cells in some Amazon employees have started to consider the other side of the equation the loss of monthly bonuses and some stock benefit\nWe just have to check in with some Amazon workers from across the country to find out their thoughts\nMy name is Emily buyers I'm forty three years old\nI work at Jefferson ville Indiana at at Amazon so on a day to day basis I Will work on a computer and just to make sure that our bends match\nUp physically and virtually so I've been at this a film it center since it opened up about six years ago and I am making fourteen forty but after the pay

thing so for myself and my family I Would rather have the money on my paycheck now then the weight the two years for my stocks to vast\nI don't want to get my name but I'm a Packer fulfillment center on the west coast and I've been doing it for about a year iron Thirteen Seventy five an hour and I will be earning Fifteen or five\nAn hour oh let's concerning us mainly is were given a monthly bonus and when our holiday season comes around that bonus essentially doubles and we're worried about not getting or pay out and making less\nManning's first emerging as have the words in Spanish on for the last three weeks or wars in the ... I started working in our store is approaching the company that you received a merchandise [noise] to bring the immigrants were\nStarted making them ... hours and no one would be true you were going to be made sixty dollars an hour or rubber first\nFeel better about it very hard to decode other providers narrow it can be better quality shortage and there's been more time with my family because I don't have to be looking for short guy since our job is going to change my life\nSo we wanted to hear more about this we called NPR's Alina Selyukh for more information about Elena welcome thank you so much for joining us thinking who tell us a little bit more about how this Fifteen dollar an hour wage will actually work in our which Amazon employees are affected\nAmazon says that about two hundred and fifty thousand of their existing fulltime part-time temporary and seasonal workers who are hourly will get this race to Fifteen dollars an hour in addition they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season\nDish and they are expecting to hire another hundred thousand employees for the holiday season and those folks will also start at Fifteen dollars an hour most of them believe that we are talking about our warehouse workers\nDo want to read some of the points that were raised by the workers that we spoke with them you can hear that some were very excited about it but others were concerned about their bonuses so particularly during the holiday season that you've been speaking with Amazon executives what did the company say about how the wage increase is a better deal right\nSo there have been a few reports and a number of anonymous employees who have stepped up and said we're really upset about the law specifically about the monthly bonuses\nAnd the stock options are a little bit more complicated essentially used to be that some employees would get vested into the company and they would get\nThis big massive bumped from stocks two years later two years with a long time for somebody who works in a warehouse so the company on that front of the company says pretty much majority of the of our workers told us they would rather get the money now than wait for two years for the stock options on the monthly bonuses it's a little bit more complicated\nThe company's response was pretty adamant they're saying it should not be the case that you are making less money would this Fifteen dollar minimum wage than you were before\nSo I took part of the confusion might arise from the fact that this wage increase to the other changes to compensation were announced very suddenly a lot of the employees to know that it was coming any idea why why why did they announce it suddenly and\nWhy no one is kind of known for making really big announcements kind of out of the blue they keep a lot of really big things close to the vest up at the top of the company um Amazon executives that I've spoken with did tell me that the conversation at the top level of what's happening for quite some time and they just decided it wasn't worth waiting for anything they might as well just roll with it\nBut one really big thing to keep in mind is that Amazon has been under pressure for quite some time to show that they do treat their workers well there have been a state of stories are highlighting some of the more um questionable activities at some specific warehouses around the country and overseas\nThere was that big a criticism that Amazon got when the company released their median income number\nThe median income was released as twenty eight thousand four hundred and forty six dollars this is just above poverty level for a family of four now that is a worldwide number is what the company will point out that said this is the second most valuable company is run by the world's wealthiest man\nSo the contrast has been put in quite a bit of pressure for Amazon to to do something\nHere before we wrap up your part of the Amazon announcement also mentioned that the company plans to lobby for a higher federal minimum wage and I'm asking you to speculate but do you think this was going to have an impact beyond Amazon itself\nI think that was one of the most important parts of their announcement at the very rare for a corporation especially for Amazon to take kind of a very political stands and in this particular case I mean we're talking about federal minimum wage right now it's seven dollars and twenty five cents it is an extremely low\nI'm Janine hurts with these headlines European Commission

testified that he felt threatened by McDonald\nA podcast called sixteen shots from member station WBFO easy in Chicago and the Chicago Tribune has been following the trial it's included riveting conversations with people from all walks of life or connected to the story including with officer Van Dyke and there was tape from the courtroom when the jury returned to ...\n[laughter] [noise] [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYou'd be easiest Gen Y is host of the pie catch sixteen shots we spoke with her at the start of the trial a month ago and she's with us once again tonight welcome thank you so much for talking with us once again thinking so let's start with the current state of things and then we'll talk more broadly how would you describe the reaction when the verdict came in and what's the mood of the city now\nThe reaction was one I think of overwhelming relief um there was some disappointment among people who have been following the trials especially activist who believed Jason Van Dyke should have been found guilty of first degree murder\nBut there's also this sense that this is just one case you know in in the seven years leading up to Van Dyke shooting were climbed McDonnell fatally CPT shut nearly four hundred people and all of those shootings were found to be justified and so there's this sense\nThat this was one officer one case but that did not indicative of reform\nWhat are the police saying about this and other people who continue to support officer Van Dyke\nWe heard from the head of the F O P than fraternal order of police who said that really this was a problem of of a lack of officers on the street that officers didn't have access to enough tasers but that Jason Van Dyke was essentially responding to the training he'd been given so that's the overwhelming sentiment\nUm but there has been a stronger response as well from some circles people saying you know officers are going to stop policing act differently if this is how they're going to be judged when they're on the street doing their jobs\nWhat would you have some of the resident moments of the trial\nI think the big moment of course when when Jason Van Dyke took the stand and testified chew you know how that they started for him waking up and spending time with his wife and children and\nStarting your day not with an expectation that he was going to have to fire his weapon that day but also hearing from the psychologists but defense team put on the stand um who brought actually a piece of evidence that was damaging for Jason Van Dyke um in in his conversations with Van Dyke\nOr the officers that that driving into the situation he said to his partner something to the effect of we're gonna have to shoot this guy or why are they not firing on this guy but he's not responding to command\nThe jury took that to heart and and to them it said when Jason Van Dyke arrived on the scene he had the intention of pulling his weapon of firing a shot and and that was a bit of damaging testimony\nNow you've mentioned in the pockets of reporting on the fact that this opened up some strong feelings in the city about policing and a number of other issues to have a sense that this is going to bring closure to some of these restaurants adjust to keep them kind of laid open\nIt it certainly doesn't bring closure we're looking at decades' worth of history of abuse of\nPolicing practices or after the video was released to the shooting\nThe department of justice came in and investigate it CPT thoroughly and and came away saying listen there is a policy in practice when it comes to especially black and brown communities in Chicago where police are over policing where there are abusive practices\nCongo where police are over policing where there are abusive practices and someone talking to activists who are pushing for police perform again they say this is one case that we think some degree of justice was done but when we look at the police department as a whole you know what his reform looked like\nYou know what is it going to look like moving forward is is consent decree in the city is in the process of\nEnacting a consent decree to reform the police department but isn't going to be effective because they've been promises in the past that the police department was going to be reformed there have been different handled for him to try to hold police accountable for their actions and none of that it's worked so what's going to happen from here\n[laughter] ... she's the hostess sixteen shots a podcast from WB easy in Chicago and
