the person or persons who sent at least ten suspicious packages to prominent Trump critics this week\nHere in Washington attorney general has condemned the bomber and said he is determined to ensure justice is done in New York police and elected officials are briefing the media here's police commissioner James O'Neill\nAre concerned with certainty that we will identify interested person or people

investigation stands the FBI has confirmed it's investigating ten suspicious packages these are bomb like devices contained in manila envelopes and\nSent to a who's who of well known critics of President Trump\nMay include former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden\nPresident Trump and they include former president Brock Obama former vice president Joe Biden\nFormer attorney general Eric Holder former CIA director John Brennan former secretary of State Hillary Clinton and congresswoman Maxine Waters and this morning we learned that actor in prominent Trump critic Robert Deniro had received one of the package at an address link to him in New York\nAnother common denominator is that these all are people that President Trump himself has called out and campaign stops in speeches and tweets\nAbout the packages themselves and the fact that none of them actually exploded or hurt anybody which is great news of course but does that tell us anything about the investigation authorities are tight lipped about whether any of these devices may have exploded\nA air had the potential to explode them in your health are at the FBI lab in Quantico, Virginia for a review they're an FBI official says part of that review was already under way they're going to be looking for things like fingerprints or DNA\nFor insights into how these devices were made\nAnd the FBI's assistant director William Sweeney says that powder and at least some of these aren't elopes does not appear to pose a biological threat important clue they're a former official at the ATF the bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms and explosives who was reviewed some images on these devices say they don't appear to work\nThere is some hazardous material there he says but the images that he's seen seemed to lack a second power source that would produce an actual explosion and there's also a really big underlying question about the motive here if these devices were not meant to explode did the bomber just want to scare people and intimidate them and did that was that\nHappening for political or personal reasons all of that has a big focus of the investigation All right so if we don't know the motive do we have any clue as to who we are talking about who the who the suspect is at this briefing in New York investigators we're not talking about individual suspects here's what we do know\nInvestigators are focusing some resources on New York and some others in Florida\nRemember these packages had to return address in Florida\nSpecifically to the office of democratic Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz shelters not actually linked to these packages she didn't send them but whoever did made her part of the story and there's another reason why authorities are focused on Florida at least some of these homemade pipe bombs may have been mailed from Florida besides the FBI and the ATF\nPostal service investigators are involved here to trying to trace that and a postal service representative has just told us and the last eight hours or so they've seen no new packages run through to stop and just briefly carry Wilder's person or persons are still on those\nJulie mark

we reached him in Racine, Wisconsin today senator Johnson welcome and good to speak with you ... are you doing I'm All right thank you but I Want to start with the immediate situation on the border\nWhich as you know President Trump is calling a national emergency in your mind is it\nWell it certainly troubling that we have created incentives in our immigration system a nutrition partly because we really rewarding illegal immigration we really need to have is the legal immigration system that works and where there is there are consequences for illegal immigration I Want\nTo get to some of your ideas for for fixing the system writ large but just to drill down on what exactly is unfolding\nIn Mexico as the so called caravan makes its way north Mexican officials say we're talking three to four thousand people but they are a thousand miles from the U.S border so let me press you is it a national emergency as the president says it is\nA A R R nobody called the national emergency but again what is a national emergency is the multi year flood of individuals coming from\nCentral America is on a couple of children and I was traveling units set of eyes by laws were passed by legal precedent and loopholes that again reward people coming into this country illegally because once they get your our legal system allows them to stay\nIn the interest of sorting fact from fiction or a

was there that were that that was back in probably about twenty fourteen twenty Fifteen\nI'd never heard the term special interest alien and really did refer to middle Easterners or you know other than Mexican other than\nCentral American immigrants and we've been tracking that now truth boy it's a relatively low number it's it's in the hundreds it was a poster we're dealing with tens of thousands of people coming in from Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nYou would not disagree though that it's important to deal with the facts as they are in twenty five times so I I\nI'm definitely a very fact based individual apps\nWho of course yes or no any evidence of middle Easterners in this are and that's how I got I\nI Do not have any specific evidence in this chair bad but it it wouldn't surprise me if there were some\nEffect check out a second claim with you a President Trump has suggested that Democrats are somehow involved with instigating this caravan might let me tell you what he said\nDemocrats [noise] want caravans they liked the care of as a lot of people say\nI Wonder what started the caravan [noise]\nAs President Trump speaking five days ago senator is there evidence to support that Democrats somehow started this caravan\nWell they certainly are are not helping us change laws so we can and these incentives I mean let's face it some of them there's which is supporting sanctuary cities which is another incentive for people in this country legally and a lot of them want to abolish ice which would be completely counterproductive\nI Do want to get to the policy changes that you feel are needed but but let me just before we move on from the ask you the direct question that has on some people's minds that this so called caravan is a manufactured controversy drummed up to energize Republican voters before them in terms\nI have no evidence of that whatsoever again to what I've read about is this a curtain Honduras or people opposed to a prison Rand is down there and in some way shape or form that's how this all got started but that's just what I read news reports\n[noise] let me ask you about Congress's role in trying to fix this are you optimistic that something will happen in this next term when Congress wasn't able to get it done these last two years\nWell part of my product strip of homeland security most of these laws aren't

considered I'm Mary Louise Kelly and I'm Audie Cornish Megan Kelly and her NBC morning talk show may soon be off the air Kelly was hired away from Fox News and twenty Seventeen with much fanfare and a big paycheck\nHit her time at the network has seen some controversy including comments she made about black face just this week yesterday and emotional Kelly apologized\nShall I Megan Kelly\nAnd I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry now NPR's David Folkenflik is reporting her employment by NBC appears to be over David joins us from our studios in New York City hey there David patriotic so describe exactly what Kelly said that caused this latest controversy\nWell Kelly a obviously a host of the nine AM our ... she was having a chat a couple of days ago with several panels about Halloween costumes and talks about how she is not PC and then started to talk about what it was to dress up as somebody of a different race here's what she had to say\n[laughter] it's really you do get in trouble if you are a white person who was like on Halloween or a black person a facade of white flight that was okay as long as you were dressed like a character\nAnd that of course they're tapping into a rich vein of pain or in terms of the course of American history depiction of African Americans by ...\nHow did her fell NBC colleagues react to all this\nPretty sharply a is a notable in two ways one which was these significant coverage that was given to the story of both by a on the NBC nightly news\nUh obviously it's anchored by a Lester Holt the only African American anchor among the big three broadcast to American networks I and also on the today show in the hour proceeding her own show a tour for African American colleagues really way to end up first let's hear from our broker a he noted that she'd apologized colleagues but said she needed to do more\nShe always a bigger apology to folks and color around the country because there is a history going back to the Teamsters minstrel shows it to mean and denigrate uh arranged wasn't right\nAnd then also uh Craig Melvin to prep the newest co host of today's show he weighed in as well\nThere was some criticism yesterday on line but this was political correctness run a mom I'm such a nurse and junior as soon as it is just as in recent statements himself\nA NBC News Germany any lack at a a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refused to defend her as well\nAt a meeting with staffers this week on the subject I refuse to defenders well this isn't the first time making Kelly a taste criticism while at NBC um why do people think that's what's the last straw [noise]\nWell I think there are a couple of things going on a first off it kept in as well to our own history in terms of remarks on race or from her days as a Fox News host much sharper edge parks these host she insisted that both Santa Claus and jeans is quite Christ wore white\n... back in twenty Thirteen she said she regretted that last year when she was at NBC but also her show is been ailing a it's a guide rather tempted 'em a ratings are and she had a relationship and called with executive that she had really embraced at times me too movement including accusations of sexual harassment\nAgainst some of NBC's biggest stars not only Matt Lauer who was fired but uh the former ah NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw much blood figure who were tainted tied to the network what have you learned about what's next for her\nI Want to be very clear about this source would direct knowledge of the matter says it's clear she won't be returning it seems impossible to imagine but these things aren't quite concrete yet you know Andrew lack has been a her biggest champion a despite the fact that she had a fairly a\nCool and conflicted reaction and and a welcome from a employees that NBC she displaced a couple of popular figures in that town hall\nAnd I ... at that nine AM our and her rating didn't do a heck of a lot for it in addition she was paid an extraordinary amount of money for a uh for the thing and she really took on a lot of fires a figure who brought on ideological baggage who brought Fox News baggage and it turned out didn't bring a whole lot of success at the box office\nThat's NPR media correspondent David Folkenflik thank you you bet\nBegging Kelly's comments on black face or not the only reason she may be on the way out at NBC but they're definitely a big contributing factor they're also not the only reason we're talking about black face right now the subject teams to come up year after year Halloween\nAfter Halloween I'm joined now by NPR's Gene Demby from our Code Switch team hate Jean Louis why do we have this conversation year after\nYear would um we do every year in ... which in fact we joke\nThat October is black and Halloween adventure Halloween and Christmas at all culminated in this one day of the year when all the recent costume and come out and maybe the annual conversations should be less about whether blackface is bad but why so many of us have so much historical illiteracy about as bad as well\nWalk us through some of the history of this when did we first started saying blackface and America\nWe first start things like ... in the early Eighteen hundreds may become central to minstrel shows on which why people would dress up like by people by talking to this game with polish and with court\nAnd of course you mazel tov depicted black people would leave the animal is to play on caricatures played the caricatures of course and that sits next to obviously this broad humidity and that allows slavery to happen at the time and so these caricatures linger and the American consciousness for a long time in fact by the twenty century ...\nIs the most popular entertainer in America and he's performing it loosely and black\n\n[noise] kind of\nThere's a whole history of you know read the paper trail the Native Americans and yellow fever portrayals of Asian American the rank of Mickey Rooney character in breakfast at Tiffany's um but it does mocking depictions of people of color that they use Halloween controversy set against it\nAnd to be clear was black face always seen as offensive by the people who were being caricatured\nWhere the people who are caffeine caricatured often not in a position to push back showing some historians point to the fact that there were black performers who performed a black face but that was in part because white audiences did not want to see black people and mental shows coordinate\nIn part because white audiences did not want to see black people and missiles hoard not wearing black trees because that would go much of the visual language of the minstrel show\n... to Turkish back to this week in her apology Megan Kelly said she didn't know about the history [noise]\nWhat do you make of that [noise]\n[noise] I mean she can claim ignorance but employers often say ignorance without a defense\nNone of that history and particularly deeply hidden and Kelly what you were talking about this and the pedal but all white paint over to the port and\nShe seemed to be primarily concerned with defending the innocent people who may dress up in blackface and that happens all the comedies conversation about race in history and power they always become conversations about intent and not about to lose broader conflict we always start in a store backing\nDoes intent matters to raise it more is just something we should just agree it's like the N word it's offensive and we're just not going to argue about it\nSo I'm Glad you bring up the N. word because there was a good example of the ways in which the context of things change depending on who you're delivering something and who's receiving it and when you controversy to happen if you read when a person you know shows up at a party at a Halloween party\nDressed in blackface usually there's not a black person in attendance and no one at that party made bad an eyelash but then a video from that party or picture from that party slips out into the broader world somebody posted on Facebook and exactly and then that video has to contend with\nA different conflicts with an audience of people who have a different relationship Tibet imagery a different relationship with the consequences of our imagery for me to be in your conversation will be better served if we spent less time parts and go what's going on in people's goals and whether they're good people were not when they put on black face\nAnd more time thinking about why so many social circles continue to insulate people including apparently prominent talk show host from understanding this history and its consequences\nNPR's Gene Demby of our Code Switch team than

different types of violence prevention programs helping youth at risk programs\nHelping people start small businesses anti corruption measures trying to strengthen the rule of law police training trying to make life better it particularly in violence or difficult neighborhoods\nSure if I hear your uh your basic argument boils down to if the U.S cuts foreign aid to these countries life their conceivably gets worse and therefore people will be more inclined to want to leave\nYes so if we cut aid if these programs and or diminish life will get worse on the ground and many of these places and so people will search for an alternative and one of those alternative is to head north\nWhat about the problems at home here in the U.S when I'm hearing I can imagine people yelling at the radio is right now wants to some of the programs you just mentioned police training programs and Central America violence prevention programs in Central America saying hey we have those needs here in the U.S why\nShould the u._s. be responsible for fixing those problems in other countries when we need those resources here\nYou know each country in the end should be responsible for their problems and Guatemala Honduras El Salvador in their governments are responsible in the end um but if we want things to get better there and if we want people to stay in those countries so that they don't end up on our borders so that we don't end up in dealing with a larger problems of\nViolence or drug trafficking or organized crime or terrorism or other things that do affect Americans at home day to day\nThat we need to be active around the world and these are places in our hemisphere nearby and with a lot of ties between people and commerce we spend billions of dollars in other places around the world to try to stabilize those places to make them safer and so we should be looking here near to a home\nFor places that do affect a day to day because of these linkages and here we're talking several hundred million dollars not billion dollars\nThat speaks to another point we should acknowledge I guess which is to the U.S has some responsibility for the problems in these countries I'm thinking of gang violence um a lot of these gangs started in the U.S one gang members were deported back to the Central America\nA lot of these gangs started in the U.S and gang members were deported back to the Central America United States has a long history of involvement in Central America it's not just the AIDS the United states with a big player in the Nineteen eighties in Central American wars that were happening the contracts were there and we were big supporters of of those groups\nAnd then we also have been a big part of the rise of gangs that are now transnational in nature they're in El Salvador and Honduras Guatemala but also in the United states and they started here in our prison than in our communities and so those linkages\nAre not just coming from these countries they actually started here in the United states and came from here to these quite troubled nation\nSo if you could wave a magic wand until the president how much to spend and what exactly to spend it on that would be most productive what would you told her to tell us presidents have doubled down on these kinds of policies that we have in place things that are trying to\nReduce violence improve governance approved the way things work in these countries provide economic opportunity\nBut I Would also ask him to hold these government accountable in Central America make those government actually work for their people and invest alongside the United states because it's in the end is the responsibility of the Central American governments to\nProtect their people chanted O'Neill of the council on Foreign Relations actually much my pleasure [noise]\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News\nIt's five forty four I'm Robyn assessing ham with W USF eighty nine point seven
