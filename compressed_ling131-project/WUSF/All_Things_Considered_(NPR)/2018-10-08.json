recently vetoed a law that would help open one saying it would enable illegal drug use [noise]\nIt's a position shared by deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein who told NPR in August that the Justice Department will not tolerate the opening of a supervised injection site in Philadelphia\nRemains illegal under federal law and people engagement activity remains vulnerable to civil and criminal enforcement\nMeasurements roses but I'm In a corporate or save injection site nonprofit him coming arrest me first\nRun del says his brazen physician takes him back in time to the early Nineteen nineties when he was mayor and welcome Philadelphia's first clean needle exchange during the AIDS crisis but offering clean needles to drug users is one thing inviting them into a building to use illegal opioids is a different matter entirely\nRound the gold find with the AIDS Law Project of Pennsylvania is another board member of safe house the new nonprofit she agrees that it's a controversial idea but the model has saved lives in Canada in Europe\nThe idea is if today we can prevent that fatal overdoses and we can build that relationship of trust then maybe tomorrow or even later today we can encourage that person to get into treatment\nAlthough city officials are not directly involved with a nonprofit fill it\nTo treatment or their city officials are not directly involved with a nonprofit Philadelphia's mayor and district attorney support putting that site in Kensington the heart of the city's opioid problem\nThe nonprofit is already raised two hundred thousand dollars but the city council woman whose district includes Kensington Maria Sanchez is still on the\nReform via tires free services\nComponents before we can talk about our favorite injection

just crazy raise wearing a pink shirt and shorts and have a baseball cap\nHe said he'd go to the supervised injection sites says right now he uses and I just wish confident in our way back yard or anywhere where they felt officials won't stay up when they hope to open the doors for one thing is clear they say if getting people like ray\nOff the streets and into a medical facilities means defying the Trump Administration so be it for NPR News I'm Bobby Allyn in Philadelphia [noise] it's time now for all tech considered\n[noise] this month we're looking at our bodies the way technology sees them here in the U.S we're gradually getting used to facial recognition technology that's in our phone in some airport security system on social media\nBut how good and and how the cure is this technology\nTo answer some of those basic questions we're joined by Alice O'Toole she they facial recognition expert at the University of Texas at Dallas welcome thank you now I feel like I'm seeing facial recognition pop up a lot more recently not just on smartphones but\nIn airport security and for example law enforcement has also experimented with it\nWas there some sort of technological breakthrough that allowed white or use of the software\nYes there has been a breakthrough or in the last five years or so there's been a new algorithm and it's modeled after the human visual system\nWhereas older technology would you really quite well with well controlled facial image is the one nation as good and the viewpoint is frontal\nThis new kind of algorithm is much better at being able to generalize identity across variable images so that crazy facial expression or that you know changing age and so on these algorithms really have the potential to be much better at the task\nYou one recurring issue though we keep seeing is facial recognition technology that missed identified people of color\nMuch more frequently than it missed identified white people uh there was that one pretty embarrassing incident where Google tagged faces of black people at ...\nI'm just wondering from a technological standpoint why do mistake like that happen\n[noise] yeah this is a really excellent point\nThe current algorithms learn by example and examples are basically many many images that for a particular person and an accurate labels and so you get what's out there and what's out there may not be equally representative of different races\nSo you're saying there's a lot more photos of white people in the database to these pieces of software read\nA lot more photos of white people in the database to these pieces of software read that's exactly right so how do you solve this problem technologically how do you make the Web I guess less racially biased you just flooded with more photos of people of color\nYes oh the answer to the question technologically is quite simple if you had equal representation of faces of different races we would expect it would be equally accurate how you make the Web on race biased that's a harder question\nThough either win facial recognition software does work when it is accurate\nThere are some troubling implications when it's linked to a database of images for example civil liberties groups worry that law enforcement could use the technology to target undocumented immigrants or to track protesters\nAs someone who really understand where the science is today how do you think about\nThis um is face recognition technology abused um that's certainly a possibility any technology has the potential for abuse whether or not the potential for abuse of this technology outweighs its utility\nIs something that has to be decided by societies and carefully looking at how it works then making decisions about what the right ways to use the technology are\nAlice O'Toole is head of the face perception research lab at the University of Texas at Dallas thank you very much thank you [noise]\nWorked for all tech

USF eighty nine points heaven coming up on all things considered education and the Florida governor's race still\nCommon Core definitely resonates among people who are critics of President Obama so I

IRA more information is available at ground capital advisors dot com\nAnd Duke Energy committed to building a smarter energy future for Florida more at Duke dash energy dot com slash improvements\n... no one surprise if you feed people formaldehyde or snack or lead they will get sick and when you demonstrate that why does it still remains so difficult to outlaw formaldehyde arsenic or lead in food why was it just not an obvious thing that everybody got on board with right away\nAnd doesn't that sound like the most logical response do look you've ... you've poisoning people let's get that out of the food supply to the food industry\nHad been organizing itself to fight regulation probably at the point that widely starts these experiments and night you know to he had been advocating advocating advocating and working with Congress men to try to get some kind of basic consumer protection ... regulations out there\nAnd if nothing else labeling and as he does these experiments and ads they catch the national attention which they did they were from page near there were\nSongs and you know musical numbers about them every one is suddenly realizing that there was a lot of bad stuff in their food that's just a lot of bad stuff in their food and\nSo there's the ... media push back\nRight to in which suddenly congressman or on the side of food business or getting offered more money and the food industry actually organizers they create a food Manufacturers Association\nAnd and and coalesce against making sure this doesn't happen and they were phenomenally effective\nAnd yet despite these long fought fights of spam decades today there isn't lead and formaldehyde an arsenic in food the way that there was a hundred years ago progress really was made\n[noise] yes one this\nFirst food safety law that passed in Nineteen oh six two years after a while a finished his famous poison squad experiments wants that law went into a place we'd started pulling stuff out formaldehyde lent out salad so look outside went out bore acts went out we or is it clear that out\nSal will still look out the went out ... went out we or is it clear it out right you ... the government stepping up for some of these outlook extremely dangerous compound misspoke just one big argument in favor of government regulation [noise]\nIn part because it certainly should be a reminder of the before government regulation food was a constant\nUnknown and often terrifying risk to American consumers and put our lives at risk but it's still I Hope just a good story it's a story of something that I Love\nI Love these kinds of stories it's a story of a single person who changes the conversation right and I think that's really important to we need to remember\nThat someone who is focused and even obsessive and and who you stand up relentlessly for an issue can actually make a difference so I Hope it works on all those levels\n... new book is called the poison squad one kind of a single minded crusade for food safety at the turn of the twentieth century thanks for talking with a thank you so much for having me on [noise]\n\nTomorrow on MORNING edition Jerusalem has long been a pilgrimage site for people of many faiths after the U.S embassy in there a few months ago some religious American bought another reason to come they say the embassy represent something biblical\nThat story tomorrow on MORNING edition you can ask your smart speaker to play NPR or your local station by name [noise]\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News this is Wu SAD nine point seven five forty four and I'm Lisa peaks\nBoth major party candidates for governor have announced education platforms that appeal to each of their bases earlier we heard about democratic candidate Andrew Gillum focus on teacher salaries\nNow education reporter Jessica baked and joins Lewis Hernandez to look at Republican Ron descent as his plan to get rid of the common core standards in Florida\nThis is going to set a rally with President Trump and job ahead of the primary\nWe can improve our education system by stopping Common Core [noise]\n\nMongoose how Common Core works in Florida\nOkay so the common core is a set of academic standards that determine what students should learn during each grade in English and math\nSo for example that says students in third grade should know how to compare fractions kids should read at least one Shakespeare play some time in high school so those standards become the basis of curriculum and lessons and testing and everything that happens in the classroom\nAnd it really came out of a concern that there were huge disparities in terms of how well prepared students for college in different states Florida was one of many states that did adopt the common core during the Obama years\nBut then subsequently made some tweaks to it and then renamed it the Florida standards ward of the differences in Florida standards the major differences are Florida editor requirement that students learn per se of writing\nAnd also added a set of standards for high school math that includes calculus lawyers who still controversial and Florida President Obama's education initiative it's called race to the topic was a competitive grants program and it came at a time when states really really needed the money Florida was one of the states that won the money\nAnd when states really really needed the money Florida was one of the states that won the money and one of the requirements was that states adopted academic standards that were designed to help prepare students for college or careers and at the time that was pretty much the common core so a lot of people said it was federal overreach into classrooms\nAnd so why all these years later why is wrong to say just going after the snow\nI mean you heard the sound from that rally when he talked about ending humming corn and he had to stop the crowd applied so still Common Core definitely resonates among people who are critics of President Obama\nSo I don't know specifically why round Santa has a problem with Common Core because you know we weren't able to ask Ken but here's one take from a source I talked to his name is Sherman ... he's an education policy expert now at Arizona State university that previously he was at the University of South Florida what\nMr dissents which was doing is using this primarily as a rhetorical claimed to shut up his base and that's pretty common for a group in the tornado candidates\nSo it again it seems like it as you said because it's linked to Obama which we had just wants to use that if he's elected how's he going to go about ending of though how do you stop them and toward now\nOkay if he really wanted to absolutely get rid of it it would be expensive and it would be difficult because he would have to replace it with something else and at this point pretty much everything that's happening in the classroom is linked to come in court the lesson plans tests\nAll the state test teacher certification exam even the SAT has been redesigned to be aligned to the common core since most states adopted it\nSaid going in a totally different direction would be really difficult however since the primary election when Ron dissent has elected to be the Republican candidate he\nHas slashed out his plans and now he's saying he wants to direct a complete review of Florida's curriculum standards to ensure that we are not quote rubber stamping Common Core\nSo he kind of pulled back on that claim a little bit and some of the people I talked to said you know they expect us to actually be a lot less dramatic than he has made it seem\nWhere they'll look at the standard they might make a few more changes and then they'll probably move on\nThat was education reporter Jessica Bateman speaking with Lewis Hernandez\nYou're listening to double your USF eighty nine point seven\nTo Americans won the Nobel
