by Michael Lewis looks lower down the food chain parts of the government that don't get as much attention like the department of commerce and the department of energy\nThe book is called the fifth risk Michael Lewis welcome back to all things considered thanks for having me in each part of the government that you look at you tell the story of what happened during the transition between election day and the inauguration\nAnd in each case the story it's pretty much the same what happened\nWell what happened was before the election the Obama administration has spent the better part of a year and a thousand people time creating a\nEspecially the best course ever created on how the federal government works and what the problems are and you should these departments with the idea that the day after the election hundreds of people from the new administration would roll in and get the briefings and learn ... what the problem was were and how they dealt with them\nAnd the Trump Administration just didn't show I mean across the government a parking spaces were empty and\nNice little finger sandwiches that have been laid out went on eating and briefing books when an open to the point where when I roll in a few months later I'm the first person who's heard the briefing that the Trump Administration was supposed to get\nAnd when the Trump Administration ultimately did send some people or one person there was a pattern and the kinds of people who showed up well\nThe real pattern was everybody who showed up was a Trump loyalist and very few of them had any kind of qualifications for the jobs they were being sent into and the spirit with which they approach was a kind of vague hostility to the enterprise\nGive us an example of what happened when people eventually showed up at a place like the department of energy but you write about so the department\nOf energy could just as easily be called the department of nuclear weapons I mean that's where the nuclear weapons are tested it's where they're assembled I mean they stockpile is overseen in the department of energy\nSo they're shocked there when the day after election noon shows up and they're shocked when the guy who's in charge of the nuclear weapons packs up his boxes and goes home and nobody says anything and there's nobody to replace him eventually kind of a month after the election\nThat Trump people staying in one guy who was a fossil fuel industry kind of lobbyist who when they're mainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate\nMainly to root out any interest in the department of energy and climate change and in developing alternative energies but he he comes for an hour listen politely and leaves\nAnd and so the the whole conversation that might have happened about how we manage the nuclear stockpile didn't really happen and then\nA little while later an odd assortment of young people who are kind of personally connected to the Trump or friends of the Trump's sons for example start to turn up inside of the department\nBut they the people the outgoing people\nGenerally had the impression that\nA ... from the district you didn't have any idea what they did and be weren't terribly curious to know\nWhy should it matter to most Americans if an agency that they rarely think about is run by people who either have a benign just interest in the agency or or an active opposition to what the agency it's supposed to be doing\nI mean let's take an example or inside the department of commerce there at the national weather service\nThe national weather service has over the past few decades got extraordinarily good at predicting the weather I mean it's just gotten it's gotten better and better and it saves lives lots of lives every year with hurricane in tornado forecast\nThe person that the Trump Administration has appointed to run this operation is CEO of accuweather\nWhose campaign for the last couple of decades to prevent the national weather service from communicating with the American public so that accuweather can make more money doing it this is a catastrophe for anybody who is in the path\nOf dangerous weather so it matters it matters a lot who's in these places and it's a problem when the person knows nothing it didn't even bigger problem in the person as an incentive to screw it up\nAt one point in his book you right there is an upside to ignorance and a downside to knowledge ... what is that upside to ignorance\nSo if you want to do things like eliminate investment in alternative energy to generate short term benefits for the fossil fuel industry if you want to eliminate the national weather service ability to communicate with the people to make profits for accuweather\nIt really helps not to think too much or know too much about the long term cost of what you're doing because you can just focus on the short term gains and I think\nThat's like a big theme in its administrators and the way it's running the government that it's looking for lots of short term wins at the expense of the long term and assuming we all will just not pay very much attention to the long term\nAnd I think the deal to do with their conscience is easier to do because they just don't understand about the long term [noise]\nOr these problems that a new administration would be able to easily fix after four or eight years by putting experienced professionals in these jobs\n[noise] you know we have an interesting problem right now because in the first year of the Trump Administration twenty percent of the senior civil service quit\nOr so and those are people who have made a career out of ... and people who really know really know the jobs and the importance of the jobs and on top of that Trump still hasn't filled half of the top seven hundred jobs in his own government\nSo there's been a grain of expertise out of the federal government and the question is how hard would it be to put back together I don't really know the answer I harder every day\nEnded his book in ... City Oklahoma with a woman named ... Finley and she says for the last ten years I prayed for a tornado to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house too\nDo to come and take that bar and I didn't think it would take the house to explain why you ended on that note well\nFirst let's explain why mistakenly wanted airborne going ah\nHer husband killed himself in Oregon and she imagined this act of destruction would come and kind of ease are paying you wouldn't have to stare at the bar any longer\nAnd which he does in the ... with the same tornado that's going to come take her board is going to destroy your out and she didn't want that\nAnd I thought it was kind of a lovely metaphor for what Trump voters imagine or how their imaginations worker how the human imagination works\n... imagines the destruction it wants and imagine the destruction it wants Trump to inflict on the things that doesn't like about the government\nIt doesn't imagine all the collateral damage she doesn't imagine the damage it will actually do and I think this failure of the imagination is somewhere near the center of what we're going through right now [noise]\nMichael Lewis whose new book is the fifth respects for trying to have to say\nTomorrow on MORNING edition California Governor Jerry Brown signed tough net neutrality regulations into law\nAnd the Trump Administration has filed a lawsuit that California's new law clashes with federal policy tomorrow here from the professor who came up with that term net neutrality you can ask your smart speaker to play NPR on your local station tiny [noise]\nAnd you can hear MORNING EDITION every weekday from five to nine with Jessica Missouri's right here on W.

correspondent Nina Totenberg was that the court today and has this report\nThat they played out like a Hollywood movie with the action moving back and forth between the three branches of government\nAt the White House today the president held a Sunday apple press conference to talk about his new trade deals but inevitably he faced Kavanaugh questions\nAmong them given how partisan Kavanaugh's performance was last week could the president a sure the American people but Kavanaugh would deliver impartial decisions if he's confirmed to the court\nThe president never really answered the question was you'll have to ask him that question but I can tell you who's been treated horribly meanwhile behind the scenes at the capital of the Republican leadership was trying to limit the FBI investigation\nThat was forced upon them last week when three key Republicans said they would not support Kavanaugh unless the FBI background investigation was reopened\nBut what that investigation entails remains an open question with a Republican Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell stressing the limited nature of the investigation and President Trump saying he wants a comprehensive but short investigation\nWell all these machinations were taking place the Supreme Court opened a new term and began hearing arguments once again as in twenty sixteen the court has only eight justices back then Senate Republican leader McConnell blocked any hearing for President Obama's nominee to the court for almost a year\nBut back then Justice Anthony Kennedy a conservative who sometimes sided with the court's liberals was still on the court\nNow he has a retired so today for the first time in well over Thirty years there was no justice like Kennedy or Sandra Day O'Connor both appointed by President Reagan\nWho sits ideologically at the center of the court and today the liberal conservative split was a parent in the first case to be argued a\nChallenge to a regulation under the endangered species act the central player in the case is the ... go for a frog which sounds a bit like this [noise]\n\nThis she lived in only one place in Mississippi and is in danger of becoming extinct when the ephemeral pond that it lives and breathes in is gone\nWhen the ephemeral pond that it lives and breathes in is gone a federal ponds dry out periodically and have no fish so the frogs legs don't get eaten\nAt issue in the ... case is whether the fish and Wildlife Service can designate an area in Louisiana where the frogs once lived as a critical habitat so that at some point in the future the frogs maybe move back to this area where there are more ephemeral ponds\nWarehouse or the timber company which leases land has challenged the designation as a potential threat to any future development plant after the argument on the steps of the court Noah Greenwald the endangered species director at the center for biological diversity\nExplained why Congress enacted the endangered species act in the first place\nThe Web of life that we ourselves depend on it built of species you know you'd go systems are made of species we all depend on species for food for medicines for clean air for clean water\nWarehouses lawyer did not come to the microphones\nBut inside the court the four liberal justices pointed to language in the endangered species act that allows reasonable actions like this one and the court for conservatives complained that the fish and Wildlife Service doesn't say what reasonable is\nA four to four tie would mean the lower court rulings stays in place meaning warehouse or loses\nHow fast the court gets a ninth justice depends on how quickly the Senate can hop along\n[noise] Nina Totenberg NPR News Washington [noise]\n\n\n\n\nYou're listening to all things considered from NPR News this is W. us at eighty nine point seven good afternoon it's five forty four and I'm Lisa peaks\nSchool had only been in session for a couple of weeks last year when Hurricane Irma arrived in Florida and the brunt of its damage focused on the keys took weeks before all the county schools reopen a year later reporter and anti Clinton or talks with Monroe County superintendent mark Porter about how the district is doing\nDo we have a teacher shortage now because of the housing situation in the case is so difficult especially after Irma [noise]\nEvery principal can tell you a story about individuals who they have recruited interviewed selected it a new teacher for Monroe County uh only to have them back out of that offer or decline that offer and very openly stating that the lack of affordable housing was really their number one problem\nSo what is the district doing to address that issue well\nWe're kind of dipping into in the water first of all with a a a potential uh\nEmployee housing effort on our property a true below school that it happens to be a piece of property where we have perhaps\nMore property than we actually need for the functioning of the school at its current capacity in so we're trying to develop a relatively small employee housing proposal that we'll we'll see if this is the kind of thing that employees are interested in I think that's always the the other part about it\nI don't know that employees always want to live in the housing that's provided by their employer we continue to emphasize programs where we can grow our own teachers because we know that sometimes bringing people here doesn't work as well as we might hope or think guys I always say to people the reality of living in the keys is a very different than the dream\nWhat are the big lessons you think the school district learned from Herman how will you prepare and respond differently next time definitely\nYou can always get better I think we we did\nHair and respond differently next time definitely you can always get better I think we we did some things you know pretty well I think the staggered start reopening was a it was really a good thing we we kind of had a a finger on the pulse of our communities and we didn't reopen our schools until uh until they were ready\nOr perhaps even more a time for staff or prior to the to re engagement with students are I think we we probably rushed them people back into the the schools that really didn't quite have their home circumstances as as well resolved\nBut but again that's really a tough balance you know uh how long are you going to keep your daughter's school ah\nWe had communities like marathon who were saying to us we want our kids back in school because that way we can attend or the other things that we need to do\nYou know so uh it's kind of a delicate balance that way probably one of the biggest lessons learned is is just how difficult it is to in challenging it is to use your schools as refugees and again these are different in shelters okay refuges or at the end there's supposedly know personnel\nYou know supervisory personnel available fortunately our law enforcement agencies did have people on site but also the clean up after a being used as a refuge is a is a real challenge and something that we have to have a\nA little better plan in place for saying okay here's who's coming in and going to do it and get it done as quickly as you possibly can there was some confusion apparently over a who had the keys or who was going to be responsible for for doing that I think we have very clearly\nA clarify that uh it still is do a very difficult challenges to who is going to be quote assigned to be there uh everybody is very reluctant to to say to anyone that you need to stay in a life threatening situation that everyone else is being told to leave\nWhat would you tell somebody in your position in the Carolinas right now\nOnly some of your people are going to be able to to help you but it's just a reality of life that certain people are gonna just reach the threshold of what they can or can't do and that doesn't mean they're they're bad people doesn't mean you should get rid of them and so you need to be ready for the fact that you're going to operate with less than a full complement\nOf your teams and the other pieces or be ready for the long haul you know don't don't exhaust yourself in a sprint because it is definitely going to be a a long haul and you need to take care of yourself and others accordingly so that everybody is there for the long haul\nNow with Monroe County school superintendent mark Porter he was speaking with Nancy cleaner and listening to that billing us that eighty nine point seven news jazz NPR\nWell
