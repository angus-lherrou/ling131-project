journalist was killed after a fight broke out between him an unnamed people inside the consulate\nNPR's Peter Kenyon has more from Istanbul\nThe Saturday acknowledgement ... died inside the consulate did little to satisfy critics who say the kingdom is still trying to deflect blame away from crown prince Mohammed bin Salman they note that the Saudis took more than two weeks to confirm what Turkish investigators have been saying all along and didn't allow authorities to search diplomatic buildings for ten days\nOfficials have also said the theory that a brawl broke out doesn't fit with the evidence that the Saudi forensics expert was sent to ... the same day to show you arrived at the consulate there are also demanding that the Saudis produce the body President Trump said he found a

better really than Saudi Arabia is when it comes to suppressing dissent suppressing a media criticism so first of all is it fair to assume that the details that we've been getting so far from the

concerned about deaths of citizens particularly unarmed citizens during police encounters in a few minutes we're going to hear from attacks us lawmaker who's trying to address this by requiring that high school students take instruction on how to behave during a police traffic stop\nBut first we want to tell you about another police encounter earlier this month that ended in tragedy\nOn October third according to the San Mateo county sheriff's office she needed a Kobe was observed walking in and out of traffic on a busy street in ... California when police stopped him according to the police account he allegedly assaulted the deputy\nAnd then he was taser several times are Coby later died at a hospital and it might not have reached public attention but for the fact that his sister Bella a Coby as Facebook for public policy director for Africa\nAnd she and her colleagues have been drawing attention to the story and she's with us now from London Kobe thank you so much for joining us and I'm very sorry for your loss thank you so much for having me now I have to ask do you think that race with a part of this encounter that this was there was a racial aspect to this\nIt absolutely was I mean even in the original descriptions of my brother is and he's six three three hundred and thirty pounds it fits the general reporting on these kinds of things when you're talking about people of color in particular in black men um I think it has been shown that police officers\nAre able to arrest even armed white men even white men who have killed I mean I think of the classic example ends\nUm Dylann Roof who who murdered and he went into a church and murdered people and yet the officers managed to arrest him without harming him it's pretty clear if you look at statistics of arrests from\nBlack men in particular versus arrest for white men that very clear racial disparity\nYou noted though that he had been described at six foot three and three hundred pounds of those those those are factual details though aren't they I mean if you were to yeah I bet if someone would you describe those things you\nMight not different ... do you know how tall Dylann Roof is you know how much the ways that was never mentioned often their market that designate black people as other so as easily as Savage as intimidating as particularly threatening\nIt's been reported that your brother struggled with some mental health issues with that is that accurate\nYes that's absolutely accurate do you think\nIs that accurate yes that's absolutely accurate do you think that that is a factor as well I mean it's been reported and that there is also data to\nSupport the fact that people who have mental health difficulties are often disproportionately harmed by police or they are often disproportionately the target of police encounters in part because believe people call the police to to deal with them in ways that they are not willing to do you think that his mental health issues or a factor and this is well\nAbsolutely and I think here you see the impact of interest actually nowadays so he is at the intersection as being a person of color a black man at the intersection of having a mental health and the daughter and I think since ... and I think I Know statistics show academy between police and people with mental illness tend to go poorly regardless of race but they are worse\nIf the person at a black man so I definitely think mental um how has something to do with and I think there's a huge question about what policy should be when you're dealing with someone who clearly the mental health crisis it's clear that they shouldn't be the same as when you're dealing with someone who's just committed a crime or someone who is clearly violent\nI noted that you work for Facebook as the public policy director for Africa and I think one of the reasons that this has come to the fore is that Silicon Valley is often seen as sort of a bubble and I wonder how the tech community has responded to this\nWhenever you have areas where ... privilege in power intersect in the United states they do tend to be bubbles and they do tend to be ... that aren't as connected um to issues of poverty that aren't as connected as she does mental health in certain areas and connected it she does raise\nIn terms of how people reacted I haven't been overwhelmed with ... with support and even the fact that I have the opportunity to talk about our story and tell her story is a direct result as colleagues and Facebook COO thought there is an important story and who shouted out every conference and started they needed to be told\nThat's about a a coping she's the sister of naidoo oh Kobe who died earlier this month after being taped by the San Mateo county sheriff's deputy um she's the public policy director of Africa at Facebook and we reached her in London thank you so much for talking with us and our sympathies to your family once again\nThank you so much for having me\nAs we said earlier police conduct toward civilians particularly when someone dies has become a flashpoint in American Life this happened in Texas last month when an off duty police officer shot and killed an unarmed man in his own home claiming she mistook it for her home and of course amplifying bit is that the officer is white and a deceased man was black\nBut according to research by the Washington Post that had been at least sixty eight police killings in Texas this year alone a Texas state center is trying to address this with education he drafted a law that just gone into effect requiring that high school students in the state watch a video about how to deal appropriately with police traffic stops\nLead you know I don't like that my [noise]\nWhy are you [noise]\nKnow obviously had all his\nVoice West is a state senator from Dallas who sponsored the legislation requiring to video and he is with us now senator west thank you so much for talking with us much how did you come up with this idea\nFrankly we have an over epicenters of African Americans and Latinos it up and volatile confrontations with law enforcement door traffic stops are just ... to put iceberg\nPhilando Castile deal he was an African American man who was shot by police officer in Minnesota\nAnd I wanted to do something about it in order to justify behavior traditions and police officers ship which last year\nSome citizens and police officers at what's lost here\nIs that people are thinking the legislation just focus on citizens will it doesn't it doesn't just focus on a video that was really a kind of sets the stage for additional course content for both the citizen and also police and police academies what\nWill be expected of the police officers at the academy\nWhat we've done is to find the objectives of a what we want police officers to get while they're in the academy and the fact that the length of courses at a minimum of two hours the video is just a part of it's sort of a primer\nThe video that we saw at least the video aimed at the students the tickets to appear to be two white teenage girls and they're pulled over by two African American police officers that is not the demographic that we're talking about here and in fact nationally cannot Seventy nine percent of police officers are white\nUh let me just say this the purpose of the video\nIs as a primer you know if we need to go back and mix mix it up that's fine we can do that but the purpose is to make certain we the fire behavior expectations police officers and citizens and the citizens know what their rights are\nWhen you have a traffic stop if someone wants to get down and picket who was cast in yoga tried I can\nGive me why is that irrelevant when this very issue that use that spark your concern here is an African American man and I can encounter with a person who doesn't look like him if that's the source of the tension why would you\nMeasure let me ask this question you can pick out and that's fine because anything that I Do\nShould be able to withstand scrutiny and if I Need to improve on that I Will but the objective was to find a mechanism by which we could have ... behavior content\nFor everyone and I thought getting a driver's license was a perfect place to put their behavior expectations of citizens and make certain citizens\nKnow what their rights are thought put it in schools and making a mandatory was a great place to put it also\nAlso driver's license courses and also the police department of police academies and by doing that you have a great deal of repetition and hopefully that repetition will ultimately save lives\nWell but the question I think some people might have a chance to question the conduct of the drivers or is the question the unconscious bias of the officers\nOthers combination of both how do we make certain that there is\nContent that deals with that biased piece how do we make certain that and police departments that they have psychological examinations that Fred out that unconscious bias or an edge to just try to erase as best possible the buys ...

courts as a candidate Donald Trump promised to do it as president it's been one of his most touted successes\nAnd while you've probably heard about the federalist society is Rolin during that that's a conservative legal group who's a list of potential judicial nominees has produced two Supreme Court justices another group has also played a key role and the project and that groups tax\nAnother group has also played a key role and the project and that keeps tactics are now raising ethical question we're talking about the Heritage Foundation that's a conservative think tank based here in Washington DC\nThis week the New York times wrote about a secret training program being launched by the group targeting recent law school graduate who had secured clerk ships for federal judges\nIn exchange for participation and they all expenses paid program these clerks were to keep the training secret and signed something up a loyalty oath [laughter]\nNew York times reporter Adam ... wrote about this program earlier this week which the Heritage Foundation says it has now suspended after his piece was published Adam's with us now Adam thanks so much for joining us it was going to be here so what what the stated purpose of this program how is it advertised\nSo the program was a three day kind of seminar they called it a training academy in which they would teach these potential law clerks about legal concepts seemingly tilted in a conservative direction\nBut you spoke with some legal scholars who said that this race ethical concerns what were the concerns\nWell they said there may be nothing wrong with a seminar they may even be nothing wrong with it all expenses paid seminar\nBut there was something problematic about requiring the people who attended to keep what they learned secrets probably even from the judges that they were going to serve\nAnd something deeply problematic about having to make a promise that whatever they learn will be used for and then they'll get a quote from their materials for any purpose contrary to the mission or interest of the Heritage Foundation\nAnd dig into that but like the the ethical concern here is what do you take it to the ethical specific ethical question here\nSo it it looks like in the words of some legal experts kind of indoctrination a law clerk is an employee of the federal government and the judicial system door clerks loyalties ought to run to the judicial system into their judges\nAnd not to a private organization that describes itself as a bastion of the American conservative legal movement\nIt ... it's a concern here that they were indoctrinated people into sort of placing an ideology above their commitment to do justice\nThat yeah that that that's exactly right so it's it's probably an affirmative good things for law clerks and others to learn as much as they can about all different kinds of legal concepts including ones that come from a particular ideological direction\nBut not a good thing to promise to keep it secret and not a good thing to promise not to act in a direction different from what the Heritage Foundation wants them to act and\nAll kinds of groups that exist to create fellowship among the like minded as well as to create pipeline for half of the purpose of think tanks in Washington DC to create pipelines fraternities sororities they all kind of create\nPipelines um Heritage Foundation has been particularly successful at that they've been particularly intentional at that\nUm creating a shadow government if you will and frightened people on the other side of the I'll do the same thing it does this represent kind of a new strategy for heritage\nI think it's a it's a next step in a program that's been very successful as you say\nIn cultivating in identifying young conservative lawyers who can then be placed on the bench\nAnd heritage will say and there'll be right about this that they're counteracting the American legal academy where the fancy law schools the professors and students are overwhelmingly liberal so they're trying to counteract that but legal experts say they may have taken a step too far\nIn trying to get into the world of law clerks who have obligations to the justice system and to judges and to not only exposed\n... to the justice system and two judges and to not only expose them to ideas which is probably ... but also to make to make these pledges to secrecy and loyalty which legal experts say is not for us\nAnd what does heritage say about this I Do know that when you're a piece published on the on line Thursday that heritage put out a statement said that they were actually suspending this program what else did they say\nThey have been very close mouthed about it or it's tried them repeatedly before and after\nThe article was published they said it was a private program they didn't want to see who was paying for it you know their materials say the generous donors were making a significant financial investment in each and every attendee they wouldn't say who the donors were these said sitting federal appeals court judges were among the faculty they wouldn't say who those judges were\nAnd when they decided to suspend the program which was supposed to happen in February\nThey just issued a brief bland statement saying they were reevaluating it\nWhich suggest that perhaps they may try to reconstitute it in a different form\nIt's entirely possible you know\nThat's Adam ... he covers the Supreme Court and legal affairs for the New York times Adam ... thanks so much for talking to us it was great to be her\nFinally today we are going to head into the barber shop that's where we talked interesting people about what's in the news and what's on their minds today we want to talk about how Hollywood it's putting the opioid crisis front and center in one of the networks fuzzy uh shows\nAnd let me just say that we realized that the tens of thousands of families who are dealing with this every day I cannot stop thinking about it\nBut for others the issue was brought forward in a rare way as the subject of the premier episode of the Roseanne ... this week\nThat you might remember the ABC canceled the ... of the popular nineties show after it start Roseanne Barr tweeted racist comments then the network decided to try a spin off called the Connors which mere this week and we learned that spoiler alert the Roseanne character die by way of an opioid overdose\nI just got a call from a friend in the coroner's office ah autopsy found that it wasn't a heart attack Roseanne oh deed on opioids\nPossible we knew she had a problem she was only on pain pills for two days after surgery then it was just I'd be pro [noise] it's got to be wrong\nWe when I could talk about so we called Sam

joining us from NPR West in Culver City California is Jeff Yang he's a CNN contributor and columnist for the wall Street Journal online Jeff welcome back to you as well always welcome to be back and we're going to start with you because critics had very different reactions some people thought it was very well done some people thought it avoided some of the kind of tough\nSocial commentary that made Roseanne Roseanne how did you see it\nYou know it's really interesting because any time a sitcom has to actually address issues that are frankly a black can and dark and\nA looming and a lot of ways in our society there's a tension between the comedy aspect of it and the harshest the real world circumstances\nOr that provide be inside right and the ... case one of the things that was really strange to me is that one of the excuses Roseanne gave when she did that sort of\nRacist tweet the got her fired was that she was on Ambien at the time that\nThat you know medication and essentially led to this behavioral change so there's a weird tension in some ways uh in in terms of what's on the screen and the reality of her behavior Medicaid or not in the real world is our culture guy though what did you think of the episode just as briefly as yeah\nI I you know it was it was actually I thought really fascinating I thought they did a really good job of a touching on the ways that people use humor sometimes to push back against the darkness and the\nPeople use humor sometimes to push back against the darkness and the presence of the absence of Roseanne was was powerful [laughter] so I
