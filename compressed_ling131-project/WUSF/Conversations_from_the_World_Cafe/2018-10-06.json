I'm from Detroit Michigan\nBrandi drew has a story that may sound familiar to you a story of poverty and that\nIs the kind of story that may lead people to quit conclusions she'll pay attention to your own round is now in her late thirties [noise] a few years ago her life unraveled at the time she around the dining services department at a senior living facility she'd been with a company that ran it for more than a decade one day\nShe made a mistake college just in a rush\nTo get home that was our because daycare close as I say I get off at five it was like maybe ten mile drive busy traffic areas and I knew I had to pick up diapers and easiest thing for me I thought would be to pick 'em up a fire picked the baby up\nSurrounded stopped at a store run in and grab the diapers you swipe took credit card at the self checkout station had reached out it turns out she used the wrong card not her own by the company credit card\nWhat's crazy is I didn't realize at that moment I didn't realize it sound my supervisor come in and said hey let's just perches had she not said anything I don't\nThink I Would have realized that Randy carried the card in case you needed to buy dining supplies or what we should never had a problem before never been reprimanded she thought an apology and an explanation would do in her response was well you know we\nHave to terminate you [noise] and I'm like no I didn't know that like can I just pay you back it was only like twelve by and she said now in cases like that you automatically have to terminate them play\nAs this crime and crime and like all day because I couldn't believe it\nI didn't want to go home and tell my kids and what happened I didn't want to tell my has now and then have them I just didn't know what to do at that point I felt like a ... I felt like a failure as a parent because I didn't provide a a good example\nEven though it was a mistake brandy on more than her husband so the last of the job hit hard she found like a loser she tried to bring in money doing odd jobs like cooking takeoff meals but the stretch group brandy and her husband began fighting\nBut the stress grew Randy and her husband began fighting she had supported him when he'd be laid off a few years earlier and she'd expected he'd do the same for her but he felt he said tuition was different [noise] he'd been laid off brandy\nWas fired he was mad that she'd made a stupid mistake\nThe final argument was that um I left the house that morning I was going to job interviews I had two interviews that day\nAnd I didn't ... toilet paper son when he got home from work that day there was no toilet paper when I came in with the kids who just immediate started yelling [noise] you can't keep yourself together you can't do this you can't do that so I walked right back out the door and I never looked back\nSomeone who is poor is often consumed with finding solutions to immediate problems how do I get food on the table today I'm not thinking about problems that are a few weeks away like the utility bill or gas money or a credit card payment\nAs your as your checking the prices and remembering the prices and figure out if you took charge will you have enough money for breakfast you are for getting things you're paying less attention to your rent your kid's homework till the of the other things that make you know life complete\nThe thing is as a result of doing this the underlying problem can become worse if you don't pay our bills you'll be even deeper and the whole next month\nScarcity in other words is a truck\nScarcity in other words is a trap the scarcity trap for us is\nAll those ways in which scarcity today begets behaviors which leads to even further scarcity tomorrow [noise] and we think it's something that poor people do people do is another example we think the lonely do this\nSo people who are lonely will often engage in social interactions in a particular way which actually makes it harder for them to make friends\nJust as the poor focus on the money they do not have the lonely tend to focus on the\nFriends they do not have the result\nIs they try too hard to be like in a conversation lonely person might be so preoccupied with making a good impression that he can't pay attention to what's actually being set conversation falter\nInstead of appearing likeable he's seen as awkward are flat footed what happens as a result people know voice the aqua conversationalist [noise] and the only person becomes even lonely [noise] this lands offers a new way of\nThinking about white people who find themselves from scarcity seem to do things that to an outsider look stupid when you're in a whole why would you take yourself even deeper Sanders says we're asking the wrong question\nWhat if it's not the poor people are somehow deficient but the poverty makes everyone less capable\nThat it's the it's un I tomorrow will be to become poor or what all of a sudden have the same effect the poverty is in some sense changing our minds\nHow do we know this isn't some leading a ferry to excuse irresponsible behavior and down in San Diego wanted to test that hypothesis\nOf all this is true one thing that ought to be true it's the same person when they're poor should have very different cognitive capacity than when they're rich\nSo how would we test that well unfortunately we don't have the kind of money to go around making poor people rich but a sugarcane farmers actually create a natural experiment for us\nYes sugarcane farmers specifically those in India who are paid only once a year right after the harvest\nThe month after they get that income they're pretty rich but like anybody who gets a huge windfall all at once that the money gets spent a little too fast and so by the end of the harvest cycle they're relatively poor\nNow we have the same person a month before harvest poor in a month after harvest well off\nAgain you have the same group of people who are poor one moment and rich the next central and now that are tested the farmers on their long term thinking when they had no money and when they had plenty of money the results were stunning\nWe found a huge difference so we found that post harvest when they're well off and they have much more impulse control\nFarmers who are rich tended to think about things that would help them over the long term this matched\nOther research that shows for example the farmers who are well off tend to read that feels more regularly and farmers walk for\nFire marshal were poor mostly focused on how to make it to next week short I'm thinking\nTo be clear it's not that poor people focus on immediate needs because that's all they want to think about it's all they can think about scarcity captures the mind like it did with those charming men in Minnesota in fact scarcity can actually knew or how you perform on an IQ test\nPut simply being poor is like having just pulled an all nighter\nNow if you've been very lucky maybe you've never experienced what it's like to be poor or hungry or lonely but they might be another former sketch today\nYou have experience on Sunday we get creative at four pm Sunday and we don't have [noise]\nExperience on Sundays we get to leave at four pm Sunday and we don't leave till one AM [laughter] and then\nUsually the next day or night thirty or six in the morning it usually work eighty hours a week\nWhen we come back we'll find out how being overworked and exhausted can produce its own form of scarcity [noise]\nI'm Shankar Vedantam and you're listening to hidden brain from NPR\nGood

a line Austin believe that when something you desperately need is in short supply your brain tends to focus on that thing this focus can be so intense that impede your ability to think about anything else\nWhat happens when the thing you're missing is time when you're so busy it feels like you don't have time to brief\nLet me tell you the story of a young woman named Katie she asked us to use her middle name for reasons that will be clear in a moment\nFor as long as she can remember Katy has been driven really driven\nUm when I was in high school I was determined to be valedictorian so I took a sophomore level on our biology course as a freshman in high school and I studied around the clock I had no cards I walked through the hallways with a note card if there was a holiday party I bought the new cards and I also studied until two or three in the morning\nShe says she wanted to be perfect at school she eventually got to medical school where she ... she graduated at the top of her class and quickly started her residency didn't use ... was grueling\nYou can get in at five thirty or six in the morning and you round on all your patients and then you you round with the team that means you go to all the patients and check in on their plan and adjust medications that are necessary\nAnd then there's usually a lunch conference where we have education and then in the afternoon we might take new patients in and keep following up on our patients\nAnd on Sundays we get to leave at four pm someday if we don't leave until one AM [laughter] and then you usually start the next day at five thirty or six in the morning and again [noise]\nUm and you get one day off a week usually work eighty hours a week\nAs Katie's workload grew she started to feel she couldn't afford to waste a single\nThese workload grew she started to feel she couldn't afford to waste a single moment instead of spending anytime relaxing she started to focus only on things directly related to her success at work\nWhen I first started it was just like really busy so I Try to come home and I felt like you know I just don't have a lot of hours so I Need to make them all of them was like okay I Need to make sure I'm exercising keeping my body healthy and they need to read and stay on top of things so\nI come home after pretty long day and I might go walking for half an hour and then I'd read and then I go to sleep um but then as time went on I decided to\nTry to get in more exercise than like I never know and I'll get enough exercise and so I started sending all my free daylight hours [noise] walking or running outside are\nGoing to the gym [noise] up to three hours a day plus like working Fifteen hours and trying to read and then go to sleep\nAnd uh she focused intensely on to things she believed was key to her professional success [noise] Judy lost sight of things on the periphery [noise] she didn't know it but she was entering the tunnel of scarcity [noise] in her case it was scarcity brought on by a lack of time\nThough I wasn't going to the grocery store my house wasn't impact yet and it was stressing me how [laughter] it was just the math and um [noise] I've my clothes and piled up I had a lot of dirty clothes\nAnd coming home just so overwhelming I didn't want to be there and the other part of I think why I was walking so much just to get out of the house and get away from all the things I haven't done an ounce of forgot to pay a bill in the mix of all of the [noise]\nWhat did you forget to do what did you forget [noise]\nIt was my energy bills and\nAfter the break we're going to switch gears and move from scarcity [noise] to access\nIt turns out that having too much you\nCan have its own set of problems and when you're really wealthy it's not uncommon to have the experience that everyone is out to get a piece of him until it breed the kind of suspicion why you being nice to me or you just trying to give me give you something\nI'm Shankar Vedantam and you're listening to hidden brain this is NPR\nThere are less than five weeks until the mid term we've talked a lot about how women are energized but in the cabin I hearing the attention had to turn to

would on my farmer private jets your island the state of the Caribbean rich\nI mean it's one and then what could have gone into\nMost of us would never know what that's like [noise] but if you've ever seen at least a little curious about the lives of the river will face this next segment is for you\nBroke Harrington is a sociologist at the Copenhagen business school in Denmark several years ago she decided to explore the secret lives of billionaires\nStrategy become a wealth manager [noise] Brooke discovered that in order to manage money for the super rich wealth managers learn a lot about the private lives of their clients and they're very different set of rules that govern their world [noise]\nParenting welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on\n... welcome to hidden brain thank you for having me on the show\nFor wealth managers to do their job broke I understand that they need to find out everything about it clients life not just appliance\nFinancial life but everything about their life give me some examples are the kind of compositions people have with wealth managers and the kind of issues they bring up about that personal circumstances that might affect how their wealth is managed\nWell usually starts with what's called know your client activity so if he were to come to me I was me I think it's the wealth manager\nI Would first asked to see some proof of identity like your passport and then we would talk about um what goals you had for your wealth\nAnd that begins a series of increasingly delicate an increasingly intrusive questions\nThen usually we get into whatever real reason is bringing you to me um maybe you want to avoid your taxes maybe you really don't like your family that's surprisingly common among wealthy people\nFor example if you have a um a relative or if you yourself are engaging in some activity that might get you started it may not be illegal but it might be socially shameful that's a financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about\nIf you have a son or daughter with a drug problem that the financial risk that your wealth manager needs to know about there can also be issues like I think I'm headed for a divorce but I don't want my spouse to get half my assets how do I hide those assets\nPreferably offshore so that whatever is is legally provable as mine is such a small amount that it's not worth fighting about\nSo it's really interesting because these professionals in some way to get to know their clients better than the clients own family or friends or even their own spouse\nYes it's it's apparently something of a cliche and the offshore world that\nThe average client is a a man in his fifties with a secret family somewhere might be a gay lover might be a common law wife and some children\nBut they're usually all sorts of secrets that these wealthy folks wish to keep hidden and that they have the additional privilege of being able to hire people to take care of in secret\nSo I understand you've conducted about sixty five interviews in Eighteen countries for this book I'm telling me a little bit about the people you're meant to be a wealth manager you have to understand financial the law but this kind of wrote also calls for a certain psychological makeup about what kind of person becomes the wealth manager\nWill several to people I spoke to describe themselves and only somewhat joke in terms of social workers for the rich [laughter]\nYou you have to have a empathy and a desire to help people but also a very high tolerance for people who would otherwise seemed to be so extremely privileged that you might be otherwise inclined to smack him around and say snap out of it you're lucky\nYou write in your book about the extreme lengths that some managers go to ... or to provide services to their clients or you write about a manager named Eleanor in Geneva who said that one of ... called her from outside a restaurant in London tell me that story\nSo this is one of the first story\nThat I heard that really made my eyebrows raise it was a while I was training to be a wealth manager\nEleanor told the story of for lunch of receiving a phone call\nFrom a client who was in another country saying I've just lost my bracelet outside of a restaurant helped me find it\nAnd the client didn't identify the restaurants by name [laughter] so imagine having someone call you from another country I mean obviously the country with identified but not anything remotely approaching a location\nSo you have to sort of marvel at the immature\nHaitian so you have to sort of marvel at the maturity of the client expecting someone else to help her fix the problem like this but Eleanor somehow did it she she determine where the client was\nAnd what exactly had been lost and got the local authorities on the case found the bracelet and build the client for all the time and apparently the client was happy to pay\n... there are some times ah clients do make request like this not because you're acting childish but because they actually have an ulterior motive they actually want to test the loyalties or ability off the wealth manager you tell the story of wealth management Hong Kong named David\nYes he he got a call early on in his relationship with the client in which the client said that he was in Japan and he was meeting with a Japanese gentleman who had expressed the desire for smoked salmon and that this client had promised him I think a thousand five just smoked salmon straight from the factory in Scotland\nAnd was now calling David saying get me the salmon and David said on on your wealth manager not your fish monger and the clients I'd well today you're the fish monger and so David happens to know someone who knew the head of the smoked salmon factory in Scotland and he he fulfilled the clients wish\nAnd the client later told him I basically made up that story it I wasn't sitting across from a Japanese fellow who\nWanted to thousands I smoked salmon I just needed to see that you had the connections and the will to do what I wanted one I Want it and not ask any questions\nOne thing that I got from your book is that there are important ways in which the very rich are very much like the rest of us and ways in which they're not up so wealthy people unsurprisingly turn out to have troubled marriages and way what children just like you know everybody else\nBut wealth you argue Ken compound those challenges\nWell apparently it's it's not uncommon for the wealth manager to be asked to find a recommend rehab facilities for kids or parents will ask the wealth manager to break some bad news\nTo the next generation to to his or her own children sometimes the the wealth manager has to broker a truce between shooting family members say one family member feels that they've been done done by unfairly\nIn the inheritance plan and has to be somehow brought back in so that they don't sue the family the big risk here is if you have a disgruntled family member who sues\nThe lawsuit process and many countries makes public many many private documents that would reveal the extent in nature of the family's wealth all of which has had been carefully guarded secrets [noise]", "show_name": "Conversations from the World Cafe", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "06"}
