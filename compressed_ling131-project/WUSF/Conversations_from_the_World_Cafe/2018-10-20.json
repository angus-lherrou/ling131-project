the other conservative\nI Want you to get [noise] which is where [noise]\nThe fools with stress [noise] patriotism and respect and it would be a very rural face a educational system how\nThis would be fairly similar salons would be a very nicely kept in a beautifully green and mode or the town of be quiet for lots of churches and that's down one\nHere in town to the schools would be based more on started all kinds of things rather than [noise] than real memory\nPeople would prefer older houses with wooden floors or rather than wall to wall carpeting um they keep the yards natural um lots of bars and community theaters and foreign films are more of those and churches\nThat was easy right conservatives like order liberals embraced ambiguity now you may be rolling your eyes are even getting angry at these stereotypes but we all know there's more than a grain of truth to them so how did these two towns which I guess today refers to as liberal bill and conservative and\nGet this way when most of us think about how we came to our political views we tend to have a straightforward explanation we use our upbringing in life experiences as a basis for a political beliefs we imagine that our parents teachers and friends\nShape our views on everything from taxes and the economy to immigration and\nNational security [noise] but what if I told you there's something deeper those attitudes drives that shaped the music we listen to the food we eat the politicians we elect\nThis week on hidden brain how the partisan divide in our country might arise not just from our upbringing and lived experiences\nFrom biology [laughter]\nA regular basis right before an election someone was Sharon article with me about how science proves that the brains of liberals are stunted or a post on Twitter live say Republicans are less intelligent than Democrats\n[noise] these claims obscure something far more interesting and far more accurate there are genuine psychological differences between liberals and conservatives understanding these differences can give us fresh insight into our political conflicts\nJohn hitting is a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln he has spent many years studying the psychological and new are lost\nLincoln he had spent many years studying the psychological and newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives he is co author of the book predisposed liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences\nJohn welcome to hidden brain thank you Shankar pleasure to be with you\nWhen most of us think about how we came to our political views John we have a relatively straightforward explanation that has to do with our upbringing and background how does that theory go well\n[noise] would ever ask my students where their political views come from the first thing I say with our parents oh man I think we have the sense that those views that our parents have passed along or supplemented by those you know from a clergy member I trust the relative\nAnd here's Democrat Nancy Pelosi\nWe are constantly reinvigorated by immigrants coming to our country and their commitment and courage and commitment to the American dream like shoot down here in the first ...\nNow it's important to stipulate you know John that it's entirely possible these politicians they might indeed be saying things that are just politically strategic but how my differences in threat perception shaped the way liberals and conservatives in general things about the subject of immigration\nI really think or you know immigration defense or police law and order but I think that's what's really at the core of of who we are not the core of political differences so you know if I Am a person like Wayne LaPierre who ah who feels these threats and thinks they're all around us then it seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that\nIt seems to me I Would want a set of policies put forward by our government that helps to reduce those threats and how am I going to do this\nI'm going to do it by allowing people to be well armed I'm going to do it by spending a lot on defense I'm going to empower police or I'm going to have the death penalty and I'm going to not allow immigrants to come here or if they do they're going to be extremely vetted as the president wants to [noise]\nSo you know those I think to a threat sensitive mindset are steps that you know the ... they only makes sense I Can't really understand why anybody would be opposed to those kinds of things because of this would help us to be a safer place\nWill\nNow there are all kinds of confounding factors when it comes to studying how politicians speak in the actual live a little considerations that are difficult to disentangle\nFrom psychological and biological traits but John another study these differences in experimental settings John one showed liberals and conservatives positive and negative pictures\nAnd he found they reacted very differently a positive\nPicture it'd be something like a beautiful sunset or somebody enjoying themselves on a ski slope I'm happy child a negative picture it would be things like I'm a house or just been leveled by hurricane um or a guy eating worms or children who are malnourished\nWe had people hooked up to some physiological devices I'm the most obvious one is a electro journal activity or skin conducting which is a common way of seeing if somebody's just having a reaction having a physiological arousal to that a stimulus\nAnd what we found is that uh people do have arousal when they see these kinds of images that they're they have some emotional content but we tend to find that liberals were more reactive to the positive images and conservatives are more reactive to the negative images\nI understand that in one brain imaging study that you've conducted volunteers was shown disgusting images and brain activation from even a single image was actually pretty good at being able to tell who was liberal and who is conservative\nThat is true then a three or four studies that attempt to see if the brain activation patterns of liberals and conservatives is different and the one that we did a goes back to kind of our favorite thing was to show them these these different\nKinds of pictures actually we had the most like with a picture of mutilation uh and and your rights when we did that it was very easy to categorize people you know without knowing anything about them all of a good look at what is the brain scan results and we could be incredibly accurate knowing whether they're liberal or conservative just on the basis of that\nLiberals brains when they looked at\nA mutilation images were much more active in a part of the brain called the U.S to matter of sensory to part of the brain that will will be activated if you suffer pain so if if I take him in the ... century tree with the active\nBut it's also active if you see pain and others and so if you would see a movie of somebody's stepping on a rocky now goes right through their foot you're some added sensory too it'd be active\nAnd what we saw in these in these brain scans was that liberals were more likely to have activation and it's a matter of sensory too conservative\nDoesn't mean that conservatives are hard hearted or just means that that things are happening differently when they see these different images\nYou could argue that a lot of this research is ... you could also argue that a lot of the patterns that John and others find consistent with the power of upbringing in shaping political preferences\nHere's how let's see I'm raised in a conservative home I learned to be politically conservative from my parents but my family also influences all kinds of other things about me that have nothing to do with politics to shape the kind of food I like to eat the kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy by just\nThe kind of movies I like to watch the kind of sports I enjoy by this line of reasoning the fact that liberals and conservatives are different on all manner of things is it about biology it just shows you how your family environment can affect lots of things about you [noise]\n\nThere's a really interesting way to separate the effects of biology from the environment and think about fraternal an identical twins identical twins have identical genes fraternal twins have similar but not identical genes and if you follow a group of fraternal an identical twins\nEach twin parrots raised in the same household each ... each the same food listen to the same conversations watches the same movies\nNow if you find differences between identical twins as it grew and fraternal twins as a group that suggest that biology not environment is a driver I asked John what such studies revealed about political preferences\nWe were fortunate to have access to a data sets a very large loads of thousands and thousands of of twin Paris collected by a guy named Linda Neves\nHow long ago it's fairly data data set\nA but it was a valuable one for us because it included lots of information about their political views\nAnd when we subject these data to the standard twin design approach we did and did a fine that their political views were quite heritable um although people oftentimes misread that's our results suggested that maybe thirty or forty percent\nOf our political views or come from a genetics but known that bothered a lot of people and this was quite a controversial study and political science so many people didn't like that at all\nUh and they tended to over interpret those results and make it sound like we were saying that everything was was genetic but you know if it's thirty four percent\nGenetic that obviously is you know fifty sixty Seventy percent comes from the environment so all we're saying is that that genetic component is not zero but apparently that was enough that that some people were upset about that [noise]\nAnd so you you basically you're able to town in some ways that there is a loser laying in the political orientation of identical twins then in the political orientation of fraternal twins and that tells you that there is some element of the biology some element of genetics that is driving political preferences and\nExactly no that's well put an end again it's nice to compare political views with other kinds of things height for example turns out to be about eighty percent\nA heritable when you see these you know when you subject to the same kind of design personality traits are about fifty six percent political views thirty to forty percent I Would say [noise]\nOne of the big implications of all this this work besides just being interesting in itself is that it helps us I think think about the political conflicts we have which fresh inside a and and you've made the case that in many ways the more we are able to see the difference is between groups of people as inherent\nOr biological in some ways it changes the way we think about those differences talked to me about that idea Jon\nYes when other traits have been understood to be biological I'm thinking of something like handedness you know we used to think that uh if you're a left handed that was just because you got into a lady habit\nMy father was left handed and the teacher or you know this long ago would beat him on the on the hand with a ruler whenever he wrote with his left hand train them to to write with his right hand so we do that are at the ... something that need to be driven out\nUh of course now we understand that being left hand it is very biological this is something much deeper than just a a lazy habits\nOr or course you know the big one today would be sexual orientation when people realized that sexual orientation is a indeed biologically driven and not something that they just have decided to do a then people are much more tolerant of that\nThey just have decided to do a then people are much more tolerant about so we were wondering if perhaps the same thing happened with regard to politics if we realize that our political opponents were not simply being a lazy but rather what oriented to the world in a different fashion that maybe we would be a little bit more tolerant of them\nThat this was the only way we're going to get anywhere for at least understand where they're coming from even if we still might deeply disagree with their\nConclusions what would you say to critics who would say you know the the argument that psychological traits in biological differences are beneath a deep political conflicts doesn't make sense because\nWe didn't always have this deep divide in our country between liberals and conservatives there was a time when\nWe had many many more people in the center of the most liberal Republican was often to the left of the more most conservative Democrat and you know there really has been a sorting of the political parties in recent years what explains this change especially over the last twenty Thirty years [noise]\nWhat I Would say to that argument is that I Believe we have always had this very same division this very basic difference between people who are fairly sensitive to threats\nI think we need to be vigilant and those people who are more into experimentation and try new things [noise] um [noise] Ralph Waldo Emerson has a great quote I'm Sorry I Can't give it to your verbatim but it's basically that ah the division between those people who are supporters of tradition and those people were supportive of innovation is very old and a structure the world since time began\n[noise]\nJohn hitting as a political scientist at the University of Nebraska Lincoln\nHere spent years studying the psychological newer logical differences between liberals and conservatives along with Kevin Smith and John ... he's the co author of the book predispose liberals conservatives and the biology of political differences John thanks for joining me today on hidden brain [noise] thank you Shankar it was a pleasure to be with you [noise]\nAnd a fence the southerners those who are are going to favor the fashion\nThey're more committed to the institution of slavery than to the national democracy and so when Lincoln is elected and he poses the expansion of slavery interestingly he didn't oppose slavery per se you wasn't calling for abolition at that point but he didn't want to see slavery expand and that was a very controversial issue\nAnd many southerners who believe that the only way to maintain slavery was for it to continue to expand to maintain political balance between free states and slave states\nThey couldn't really tolerate the idea that the president the United states would oppose the expansion of slavery and so although he was elected and I think they recognize that he was elected in a science fair and square\nThey just couldn't accept him as president and so what you see if they're putting a policy issue in this case an entire world view and way of life revolving around the evils of slavery they put that\nHead of the democracy so now the conflict just descent into rancor and violence and so I think it's an important lesson of how our differences can be a source of strength but they can also be in a credible source of weakness and the\nQuestion is do we have something in common that's holding us together most in most of American history the answers been yeah and that moment in history the answer was unfortunately absolutely no [noise]\n\nI'm Wondering is one of the things you're implying when you talk about the difference between productive and destructive conflict is that when people have productive conflict there actually willing to say I believe very strongly that I'm right\nBut I Want to at least concede the possibility that maybe there are others who have something about the old ... maybe that history will show\nIn the future Twenty years from now there is something that I don't know and I'm Wondering if if this is potentially one of the implications of what you're talking about which is the difference between productive and destructive conflict\nIs that an productive conflict people say there's a chance that I could be wrong sometime in the future\nI think that's correct I think that's true but even if they don't think they could be wrong there's this fence that if you believe in democracy so much there's only so far you're\nWilling to go and so you know if you think another analogy would be in a family rights of family we have every family people fight they quarrel they disagree about all sorts of things but if there's loving the family the conflict only goes so far the love breakdown than actually the conflict convict the family apart\n[noise]\nAnd the twentieth century the bonds of democracy what tested again when we come back the political upheaval of the Nineteen sixties and they're echoes today
