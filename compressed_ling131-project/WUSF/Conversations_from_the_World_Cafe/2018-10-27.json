hidden brain I'm sure I'm going to be done in order to drama of current politics in the United states there is one truth that has endured through the first two years of Donald Trump's presidency just kept the support of the core group of voters who propelled them into the White House [noise]\nThere's only one part in that the dollar vitally someone that's not a politician and not one way or how the brain washing [noise]\nThe approval of these waters off in white and often working class has meant the Republican Party as a whole has stayed loyal to Trump view Republicans running for high office can expect to win without the Trump base as Trump's himself once famously said\nI could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any voters okay it's like a credit [noise]\nThis week on hidden brain we explore two competing perspectives on Trump's supporters and their motivations one paints a sympathetic picture focusing on class divisions and economic pain this\nIs a group that feels belittled and ignored and you know what some level they write\nThe other is more critical race as we all know it's such a fundamental cleavage in our society I think Republicans are using it to their advantage\n[noise] June Williams studies gender class and work\nIn the United states just currently professor of law at the University of California Hastings College of law she's also the author wrote a book like working class overcoming class clueless miss in America\nJoan welcome to hit and bright delighted to be here we've heard a lot about the white working class since the twenty sixteen election or I'm Wondering if you could paint a picture for me Joan of who you include in this group and how you distinguish them from the very wealthy and the poor\n[noise] um in order to understand American politics really for the past forty hears you need to find three different group\nOne is the poor on within meeting annual income of around I'm Nineteen thousand dollars that's the bottom thirty percent of Americans buy household income and then that topped the professional manager of the elite is the top twenty percent by household income\nUm and I had to find that as top twenty percent in my household income with one college grad\nThe group that's being called the working class is the group in the middle east\nThe group that's being called the working class is the group in the middle it's the middle fifty three percent with the median household income in the in the seventies that's the group that's called the working class although they actually are the middle class\nYou have some startling statistics about wages in this middle group over the last half century or what's happened to them economically uh starting let's say Nineteen Seventy\n[noise] since Nineteen Seventy the wages and economic prospects of this group have absolute be tanked I'm actually more recent\nStatistics have come out since the book and the most dramatic is that virtually all Americans born in the Nineteen forties did better than their parents virtually all but\nJones says blue collar families feel resentment not only to the people above them on the social ladder but sometimes to those beneath her she told me a personal story about her sister in law who comes from a blue collar background she walked at a daycare that serve low income families and she found herself getting frustrated with some of the mothers\nOne of them had showed up with a shopping bag from Macy's um and she was furious because she felt you know she's on public assistance and she can shop at Macy's and hike I Can't even afford to shop at Macy's so that was part of it um\nEven afford shop at Macy's so that was part of it\nI'm also ... she was very angry when the the shoes in head start she was teaching in the head start teacher some of these um ladies were late and she was furious because she had to pay a dollar a minute\nTo her daycare which she paid for when she was late picking up her kid and they were making her late and they weren't paying white American white blue collar Americans tend to have quite a judgmental attitude towards the poor\nAnd they're judgmental attitude stems from their own self image of themselves as\nKeeping their nose clean keeping on the straight and narrow hard work everyday forty years straight whereas the poor are seen as kind of hard living drug sex rock and roll um didn't have the self discipline and now I have to pay for them [noise] Mm\n[noise]\nJones as working class people have come to us you led government benefits and government programs are not for them\nWhen her own walking toss father in law started to suffer from dementia [noise] Joan suggested to her mother in law that you apply for somehow [noise]\nWhole reaction was striking\nIn her reaction was oh I'm not even gonna bother to ask the government doesn't care about hardworking people like us to just cares about the poor\nUm and in fact you know we urged her and she did get um government help when my father in law had dementia and they\nDeliver it to help and they deliver it quite efficiently but it was that was not her option you know it doesn't hurt job to know that it's the job of the people or designing the programs and of the political elite\nTo make sure that Americans know that and they have seriously dropped the ball\nOne of the things that people have often noticed is that there is a political gap between urban areas in rural areas but one of the things I took away from your book is that the gap is really between people who are cosmopolitan and their outlook and people who are not\nGoing to be people who are very much at home working in Washington or New York or working tomorrow in London or Shanghai but they're also people in the u._k. and in the U.S who are routed to the community in a way that's very different and in some ways they resent the people who are costs will politician because they can pick up and leave and they don't have sort of the same\nTies are the same obligations to local communities that they feel that they do\n[noise] um that's very very true I mean there's there it does map on to class but breaks it and Trump's election we're both a revolt of the areas that had been left behind\nFor example if you look at the ... the counties that voted for Clinton roughly five hundred counties did\nI'm twenty six hundred counties voted for Trump but the five hundred counties that voted for Clinton represent two thirds of GDP\nThat twenty six hundred counties that voted for Trump represent only one third the people who voted both for her I said and for Trump where those people who are left behind economically\nAnd left behind culturally as you point out because these are people who have these small very localized very deep and rooted um clique networks of family and friends they've known forever\nDay actually social science studies show that this group is more focused on um community and solidarity in contrast to the professional managerial lead toward more focused on individual achievement and self defense\n... or more focused on individual achievement and self development\nWhen you think about the ways a blue collar America and the elites relate to their work uh I I Want to go back in some ways to the the exchange does your husband had way of his former classmate\nIn some ways by asking what do you do a elites are asking what another yes it's a it's a form of social display but it's also a former saying work is really how you define who you are it's an important part of your identity whereas as you point out in the book for blue collar America work is really a means to an end\n[noise] work it's what you do to support your family\nUm so it's complicated hard work it's valued among both groups and that's one of the key ways we should begin to forge a bridge between these two groups but the hard work is a matter of of of persevering\nAnd staying in that job despite the fact that you make kind of hate it in order to support your family and provide them with a settled family life\nUm elites are completely defined by\nTheir jobs you know what am I I Am a lawyer I and a techie\nDeath total self definition in terms of your job is one of the emblematic elements of the elite many people maybe blue collar folks think um the elite is just a bunch of sort of pathetic power hungry pencil pushers who spend their whole life\nSucking up to each other and confused their jobs with their lives [noise]\n[noise] [noise] and\nThere's also a huge class divide when it comes to the value of education many residue people believed that education is the key to a better life that if you want to get ahead you need to get a good education but as you point out of the book Joan this idea is a much more controversial idea among the white working class white [noise]\nGoing to college is really really risky for these groups um first of all of course college debt is what could tripled I'm In recent years so it's very risky to start to go to college or many of them ultimately dropped out there's very much higher dropout rate among class migrants people from\nNon elite um backgrounds I'm so often they end up\nPaying back large college debts on the wage of a high school graduate and they see that they see it as very very risky in addition that they they typically don't get in to the same colleges and social science studies show that\nIf you give people an identical school record\nAnd one from an elite family in one from a of a white working class family the white working class family has a kid has to actually be about three times as good as the delete family kid in order to get to be seen as equally strong\nIt doesn't end there in one study Jong says researchers sent out to satchel resumes to employers the resumes what identical except for one difference\nOne set off a blue collar signals like pick up soccer like country music the other set off elite signals water polo classical music a mixture of water polo ... sixteen times the number of call backs at Mr country music\nSo you may go through all of this process and ... all of this debt and then because you know so to speak you don't know what four to you\nAnd then because you know so to speak you don't know what for it to you you may not get I'm a ... a professional job anyway\n[noise] June Williams argues that these class differences rooted not just an economic hardship but in psychological shame and cultural humiliation play out in politics when we come back we'll

U.S census predicts that by twenty fifty one out of every four Americans are going to be of Latino or Hispanic origin I mean that's that's quite astonishing\nSo while there are these large numbers of immigrant families in the United states do use families as you point out account for a relatively small share of the voting population and in some ways this is the source of the friction intention that's at the heart of your book\nThat's right and you know I think part of it is that is an issue that is easily understood by the public uh the fact that undocumented immigration is a very easy issue in the sense that\nIt for the average American voter you can understand somebody who breaks the law and enters the country without proper documentation and that is a violation of our laws in orders that that can easily animate people\n... and it seems to me that's closely connected would walk polls show more it's a hassle white Americans seem to believe that immigrants or a burden to us society and a black majority saying that Latinos out to the\nCrime problem that's right and again if you actually look at the data itself right those those perceptions are not the reality particularly when it comes to crime so\nJust like many things that's happening right now in politics what people perceive what the truth is and what the facts are are very different from what the actual evidence is\n[noise]\nRapid demographic shifts ... and high not argue have created feelings of threat among white voters especially the white working class [noise] these threats come in different forms [noise]\nCultural [laughter] economic\nThreat as far as I'm concerned they're stealing draws political track\nWhy do Republicans on the hill understand if the threat advanced volunteers posed to the country and to them\nYou have multiple trends happening at the same time on the one hand you have\nThese rapid demographic shift you also have views increasing feelings of threat to among many white voters and simultaneously you also have a situation where one political party is seen as being more responsive to the anxiety of white voters than the other one\nThat's right I think the Republicans have really\nTaken all of these multiple factors into consideration and used it to capitalize on a central message and theme that can really again mobilize their voters and the fact that their base it's overwhelmingly white means that they can have\nA central message such as immigration that can activate and mobilize voters into not only supporting their candidates but also supporting the kinds of issues that they want to advocate for\nThere's been some criticism that well this was a short term strategy in it they're gonna they're going to suffer in the future and that may be the case but for the president it's an extremely successful strategy as we've seen\nYou won't you looked at what happens in states as the demographics of state start to change so as the Latino populations in states starts to increase for example what are you\nAs the Latino populations in states starts to increase for example what do you find in terms of the behavior of white voters [noise]\nWell what you typically see is that as the population of\nLatino voters have increased you start to see that shift in the political behavior of white voters to support the Republican candidate and uh\nThat would be consistent with the theory that immigration is explaining the voting preferences of white voters you know we wrote this book before the twenty sixteen elections so\nFor better or worse some would say that it was ... to the ... of the outcome but it was just remarkable to us that when we were putting together than this book and our analysis and fat\nFrom all these different angles not just of\nYou know I'm cool white voters supported but also the kinds of policies that they favor that it was really just that immigration was such a strong and important predictor and all of these different a political outcomes that we were exploring and so\nI think that's where this idea that it was really this white backlash towards immigration that currently the political climate we live in today

Smith says that Trump with and trying to attract all voters across the United states he knew exactly what demographic and what base he was speaking to and so again with these kinds of\nEmotional appeals that are tied to a specific group of individual that pitch that message resonated as we all know now extremely well with his supporters and I think it was compounded also by the fact that we had eight years in Obama presidency and so if immigration\nAlso tied in with the issue of race and Simpsons why the subtitle of our book is immigration race and politics because the two things ... if they at least in the context of the United states they go hand in hand with one another and so you have eight years\nOf oppressing and see the first African American person in the country coupled with\nAt the specific campaign message of immigration a altogether tiny in a lot of that racial resentment that happened in the past eight years I think we're just as what galvanized his campaign and its presidency\nSo one wonders chopping implication from your thesis Morris says heading to a situation where we have different political parties for people of color and people who are white or an an increasingly what this means is that our political divide become racial divide\nIndeed and that [noise] ah I one of the ah again more pessimistic outcomes of this research and that really\nYou know race as we all know it's such a fundamental cleavage in our society but I think also Republican willingly took on that strategy and are using it to their advantage clearly [noise] there's an interesting tension\nHere it seems to me for both the Democratic party on the Republican Party you know we we alluded to there is some time earlier but what might be the interest of each party in the short term might not be in its interests\nIn the long term can can you talk about that from the point of view of both the Democratic party in the Republican Party\nShore I mean for the Republican Party right now they're an overwhelmingly white party and as we know with the way demographics are shifting in the United states we're going to become increasingly\nA majority minority country that at some point that strategy is going to be short lived right so but again for the time being for the next five to ten years it works so I I I think they are censored it's well let's just go with it right they're not looking further beyond\nTwenty Thirty years from now on the other hand the problem the Democrats faced is yes they're the most diverse party that more diverse than Republican", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Conversations from the World Cafe", "city": "Tampa", "day": "27"}
