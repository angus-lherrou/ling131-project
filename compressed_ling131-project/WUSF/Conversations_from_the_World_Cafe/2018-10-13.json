vacation to some far flung look how and met someone who lives down the street from you know many of us are drawn to coincidences like this they make us wonder how would the world at that happen\nWhat does it mean\nToday we explore a deep fascination with these moments of serendipity new research suggests to reveal important things about how our minds work and they have a far more powerful effect on our lives than any of us imagine\nA couple of months ago we are hidden brain listeners to share coincidences to date experience a lot of people called in with amazing stories we didn't do stories we found two that themselves formed a coincidence\nFell I was a student at the University of Rhode Island and we were in the writing class\nThis is Amanda birch she was talking to the teacher of her writing class and the teacher mentioned that she lived in a small\nTown in Vermont [noise] the same small town and it turned out what Amanda's mother had grown up [noise]\nThe teacher asked Amanda what her mother's maiden name was\nAnd Amanda told her she just kinda dropped or pan and she goes you're not going to believe that but I live in the house or your mother drill up\nThe other listener who called us ... rough she called us on a scratchy phone line from Paris Saturday as an American but it's been living in France for several years she was at a house party and someone had told her that there was another American in the room so she went over to say hello they started talking and\nSo it turns out that that has already in Paris I stay out a New York I either [laughter]\n... we thought we might find out on today's show we'll talk about the mathematics of coincidences and why do we find them so intriguing will start today with a story about a whisper which is an app that allows users to connect anonymously online\nPeople can post that secrets on the site and strangers can respond with their own whispers the messages are short about the length of a treat and they range

fascinated by coincidences and could listen for hours to stories about them but what is it that is so fascinating about these moments in life at the University of Chicago psychologist Nick Epley thinks he might have one answer\nHe's the author of the book mind wise\nTo understand how he thinks about coincidences I Need to take a moment and explain his broader work to you first\nAt least book exam and how we read the mental states and intentions of other people [noise] this is a remarkably useful to kill some time Smith apply it we sometimes attribute intentioned allergy to things that aren't even living especially when they're out of the ordinary for example we don't personified\nEspecially when they're out of the ordinary for example we don't personify as tiny day but we give hurricanes I'm name Katrina Sandy Andrew [noise] after Hurricane Katrina the mayor of New Orleans said God must be mad\nAt America [noise] no this isn't new for centuries people have described intentioned ... natural forces we think storms Johnson earthquakes must have a mind of their own\nThis general tendency to explain behaviors in terms of purpose or intent or\nOr meaning is often quite a successful thing to do [noise] turns out we live with other people who do have intentions and goals and foresight and planning and meaning behind their actions and so by and large that tendency to make those kinds of attribution to other people\nIt's a good way to learn about each other is a good way to explain why are the people did something in the past\nTo predict how they're likely to behave in the future but the problem with\nAny kind of good tool is that sometimes we use it a little too much and that's what happens in these cases where\nYou're trying to explain the behavior of something\nThat doesn't really have\nA sensible explanation for some random events some chance occurrence some physical an anomaly some weather pattern or that crops up that might not in fact have have a mind behind that\nThis is why they're fascinated by robots that move in unpredictable ways\nWhat we found was that when people were given a description of an object that made it sound unpredictable like you couldn't just to pay its actions\nThat when people described it reported that it had more mental states they were more willing to say that the object has a mind of its own that it has been tensions for instance and I don't think this is totally counter intuitive that that is a mind if you if you see for instance of billiard ball sitting on a table\nAnd other ball comes along and hits it and that ball rolls off and that predicted direction where you don't you don't need anything to explain that but if you've got a ball sitting on the table and suddenly starts rolling around randomly\nWell then you've got something to explain in these cases\nSometimes people look to the inside of an agent give it in mind maybe the ball is possessed maybe there's a demon controlling it a moving it around the table sometimes people attribute in mind or something when it's not there but they do that as an effort to explain\nWhat's going on in this uh autonomous and autonomous agent and they're more likely to do that when an agent behave somewhat unpredictably\nI was over at a friend's house and uh my friend has a wonderful pool and um he had set the\nThere's underwater Roomba for lack of a better term to clean the bottom of the pools that sort of rolls around the bottom of the pool and it goes into completely random fashion right so just runs a couple of hours of cleaning the bottom of the pool and I find myself fascinated just watching it because the fact that you can't predict what it's going to do next\nMakes it just more interesting and more a lot even away then something that moves in a very predictable fashion\nAbsolutely something that moves robotically very predictably that is just a mindless machine but when you're rumors going around randomly well\nNow it wants to go over there a little bit not wants to move over here and now it realizes that didn't clean that side of the pool over there are things that we have randomly ... start to get a little sense of a mind that people are crazy you don't\nYou don't think it's like your mother writer or your your your uh you know your spouse whose vacuuming or the living room but it starts to look to them they don't bit more mindful in fact the rumors are good example people\nActually do name their room but as you can buy outfits to dress it up\nOr if you Google this uh online you'll find all kinds of examples of\nPeople thinking of their room buzz having perhaps\nExamples of people thinking of their room buzz having perhaps a little bit more of a mind than it really does\nI Want to talk to a little bit about the subject of coincidences and I sort of you and your work because it feels to me that when something unusual happens to us and we stop and we say\nThat is weird I was just reading this word in a book a second ago and someone in the room around me mentions the very same word and and it makes you stop and look up just like I stop and look at that underwater Roomba\nAbsolutely that's a case where something unusual happened was unpredictable and you try to explain it you can explain\nThese kinds of random coincidences in lots of different ways there are lots of many different kinds of causal structures we might be able to put on it um but some of them involve giving it more meaning that it actually has\n[noise] this is what underwater room but I have to do with coincidences [noise]\nLike a robot that does something unexpected coincidental cry out from meeting or explanation because they're out of the ordinary which talked to seek patterns even when they aren't any\nMy favorite example of this in a world of psychology there's actually phenomena first documented by my PHD advisor\nTom Gilovich having a brilliant psychologist famous traverse the illusion of the hot hand in fast [noise]\nTo miss that basketball players get on a roll\nPeople believe the basketball players get hot and that there are times when they're on and the chance of making a pastor is higher after they just made one then after they've just missed one\nLike having an affinity for someone with the same birthday or someone with the same name or even going into a profession that sounds like an echo off your name\nSo we originally looked at whether people name Denis or Denise gravitate toward dentistry but we learned pretty quickly that it's really hard to get data on those things so you know there aren't great direct rays of medical professionals\nThere is a guy named able who was able to document that was a review on his paper and all that now every time you say this I'm going to just jump in and say a guy named able who was able to do something he was able to do a lot of things he showed that people whose last name is Dr or whose last name is the word lawyer named lawyer\nGravitated toward those two professions\nThere are lots of other examples Brett looked at a massive database of millions of Americans names from the recently released Nineteen forties senses joined salmon if they were brought patterns like\nCarpenters working in carpentry bakers working as bakers butchers working as poachers\nMiners working as minor masons workings Mason so we looked at every surname there is a currently the top two thousand surname that happens to be a career name and we looked at all of them they're eleven to them that are pretty common I just listed a few and for every single surname in the Nineteen forty cents us with something like a\nI think it's a hundred and thirty million people we were able to show that for every single surname there was at least a week tendency for people to gravitate toward careers that perfectly matched their last names\nSo the obvious thing to say of course is that the reason you have a slightly larger number of carpenters be carpenters is that the name ... probably originated from families who were in carpentry and so there is some kind of ancestral connection to the profession that is driving both of names and the choices\nQuite possibly but if you do the math you pretty quickly say it gets to be a pretty tiny percentage of people so if you assume that even over ten generations\nThere's a fifty percent chance that you did what your dad did and the fifty percent chance that he did what his grandfather did which is probably higher than reality you're talking about a a probability of less than one thousand already over ten generations in other words surname are so old\nAnd they change hands you know when a woman named carpenter married a guy named farmer for example that that's really it it really just can't account for the fact anywhere near this magnitude\n[noise]\nRent Palin has looked at large data sets in public records like the Social Security death index or state marriage records databases with information about millions of Americans and he and his fellow researchers have seen all kinds\nOf funny effects like for example one listener called in to say she and her husband we're both born on the twenty fifth day of different ... this isn't as on communist you might think beyond what you might expect by chance\nThere's about seven percent bias in that direction so if you should have a thousand people doing that you have a thousand Seventy people doing that if that doesn't sound like a lot you're right you should think of the city has them as a tiny invisible nudge it won't shape for everyone does all the time\nBut it does shape what some people do some of the time it's when you multiply these smaller effect over hundreds of millions of people that just\nIt's when you multiply these smaller effect over hundreds of millions of people that you start to see lots of examples rich says that if you really love your butt day he effect gets even larger or operational\nDefinition of really loving your birthday was getting married on your birthday number but if you got married on the thirteenth of the month you weren't quite a bit more likely to marry another person who also had the number Thirteen as his birthday number [noise]\nAgain Brett calls this an implicit bias for a reason you may not be consciously choosing things as important as your spouse or your profession or the place you call home based on arbitrary factors like your name all your birthday he thinks the bias comes about simply because we like our names in our butts days and have positive associations with that\nAnd so you just associate your name with all the wonderful things that come along with that uh and the the best bit of evidence I have but I've never bothered to publish this there's one part of people's names I don't like that much and that's their middle names you know the the joke about that as the sole purpose of a child's middle name it's a no when he was really in trouble\nAnd my additional come to know if he might be a serial killer Sunday right in the middle name is not nearly as love this the first or the last name people feel very ambivalent about their middle name\nThey can be other reasons for a living it's sometimes we dislike it with another person has the same day if you were born on April twentieth you might hate the fact Hitler was born on that day too rich finds that if a consumer product happens to have your name on it but as poorly belt\nYou are more likely to hate that product people dislike seeing something inferior in the world that has that name on it\n\nAs Britain and I were talking I realized something a little uncomfortable that I myself had fallen prey to him that he is you know as you're talking right now I'm realizing something about myself from the very first time there is a there was a philosopher in India whose name was Shankar out my name and he actually taught a\nPhilosophy that is known as a dancer and I I've always being drawn to the fact that I find the philosophy\nOf event that would be very interesting and the fact that Shankar I taught that philosophy I thought was just charming but now as I'm listening to you say this I'm realizing that this could just be implicit eagle\nI've read his work very well and it truly is wonderful it's brilliant so I think in that situation\nAt the same time it does make you think though that absolutely yes has this ever happened to you ... do you ever think about yourself in a vehicle to them is affecting we're getting a little personal here but uh I I I Can't resist being a little bit personal I Would say the probably the most dramatic examples that my son Matthew\nI'm his his last name as Poland his mother's last name was pulling my lesson was Pelham\nAnd I entered a relationship with her before I developed this not after I developed the theory to validate the so your column and you got into a relationship with a woman named polling Poland\nAnd we are very different in most other ways that's about as much as also if it's a ... are you saying that the names played some kind of a role I I have to think that I have to think and we were from different backgrounds different um\nDifferent religions I mean where we come from very different worlds and yet I was very attracted to her\nAt a worse yes she was attracted to me right yeah [laughter] I said I and I understand why you would sort of called this charming and I think if you do this work for a while\nThere is a certain smile that comes to your face you sort of look at these connections and you're so to see you you understand sort of the choices that human beings make but I Do think there's something disturbing about it because I think\nThere is a very strong sense that I think most of us have I have the sense even though I've been covering the world of the unconscious mind for the last ten years I have the sense that my choices I deliberate choices that I thought about that my ...\nI had the sense that my choices that deliberate choices that I thought about that my ... and make name intentionally and the idea that you're coming in and telling me that they had these hidden factors that come in and change how I think about myself and he's a disturbing idea\nIt is a little bit disturbing and of course most people do what you and I do what you said well of course that applies to the rest of all but I in particular but never fall prey to re implicit racial bias room solicitor you get to them so most of us do tend to sort of separate ourselves from even our own findings but I've become in the past decade or so comfortable enough for the study that I have to\nAdmit that I really never know for sure exactly why I did something I mean sometimes I have a pretty good idea but I don't I certainly don't kid myself anymore to say that I even usually know what why and do what I Do I mean there's just too much research and much of what you've documented in reporting on\nThat show that by these were completely unaware of no just sometimes powerfully drive us in very\nParticular direction so I think I've just kind of let go of it ... it was disturbing to me when I first became study it the Serbian as well as delightful and now it's become more delightful unless disturbing\n[noise]\nSomehow you're wondering how does any of this matter [noise] who cares if people wanted a twenty third of September married those born on the twenty third of July\nWho cares if someone named Betsy carpet gravitated towards carpentry why does it matter if I prefer a philosopher whose name is similar to my own\nThat at least raise it tough\nQuestions about the degree to which we have free will so I think some people who have pretty negative reactions to this work are very threatened by it and the sense that it suggests that very important decisions\nHave at least a little nudging influence\nUm based on things that you're completely unaware of so people are more likely than they should be by chance to marry another person who happens to share their birthday number that's not an objectively great reason to get married you should get married because you shared values you're both Republicans you're both rabid Marxist but\nLearning that these subtle little influences can affect what you do\nA apparently to some people's ... I find it delightful but some people might find it pretty threatening I don't think that it proves that there's no such things free well but it to me it does suggest that we don't always have free will sometimes we make a decision\nFor one reason that we told ourself when really the more powerful underlying reason is something we could've never put our fingers on\nAnd this isn't just a matter of being drawn to someone who shares your birthday in general we tend to prefer things and people who have something to do with us and that can be a big problem\nI Do a little bit of research on social justice and that's one of the things that concerns me most is that we tend to focus on people who are more like us who speak our language who speaker idiom who look like us who worship like us and we have much less attention to the problems of people who don't", "show_name": "Conversations from the World Cafe", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "13"}
