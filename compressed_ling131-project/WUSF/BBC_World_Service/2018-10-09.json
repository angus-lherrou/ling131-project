Saudi ambassador to the U.S who was the brother of Saudi Arabia's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman mom\nSat in a statement that um the allegations of his detention or his murder in this country that are completely false and baseless\nUm we all waiting for a B continuing elephant conclusion all the touch investigation um the what's happened today is that Saudi Arabia has granted techie the rights to such the premise of the Saudi consulate here to stumble\nSo that it it's significant that they should let them into what is Saudi territory because of uh the the rules of diplomatic pressure coal\nMine dust of the bizarre situation a few days off the he'd gone missing whether we just need agency were allowed into the consulate and they what they want some video footage\nYeah I I mean a

settle for Saudi Arabia that night from Istanbul one going by to buy one going by Egypt\nAnd security officials have told a pro government state TV channel here\nThat they believe that the Fifteen Saudis who flew in and out that same day took with them CCTV footage from inside the Saudi culture that\n[noise] how much pressure is that on the Saudis now that that you can uh assessed to to be transparent and the way that the United states of course a very close ally of Saudi Arabia and now calling for them to be well\nI think that there is a sort of public pressure on them behind closed doors pressure started to the public pressure that for example the talks have announced that based on the Saudi ambassador twice in the last week\nThat they are demanding full corporation but clearly always allegations flying around um how how raising pressure last on how to write it to give a convince convincing explanation\nBut then a in capitals like London and Washington for example they all kind of biding their time and they're waiting\nFor the conclusion of protection investigation before they really come down hard I think\nThe British foreign secretary ... tweeted that he has had a meeting with the Saudi ambassador in London and he um as last for a a a you know an explanation as to what happens if the conclusion proved that Jamal casualty wouldn't be the victim of the state sanctioned\nAssassination ... van there is going to be going to be serious consequences for the Turkish Saudi relationship\nThere a guy that's going to be a lot of pressure on western governments who have rolled out the red carpet for crown prince Mohammed bin Salman to change their approach to Saudi Arabia and see him no longer is the kind of a you know young bride to reform up but as somebody who uh is extremely ruthless and who is potentially ordered these the state sponsored assassination\nMy plan how cartoon and joining us like that from its temple thanks\n[noise]\n\nNow we go to a devastating earthquake and tsunami in in the knees yeah the authorities that has off most foreign aid was to leave the country the official death toll from that is also exceeds to south and the some five thousand people remain missing and presumed dead\nThe Indonesian foreign office spokesman er are ... definitely said tell us the following statement today which ...\nThey could not intended to prevent assistance so volunteers from entering but to ensure that they had first coordinated with the national agencies in Indonesia leading the rescue and recovery effort\nAnd important in a recovery efforts are well coordinated though are such in cases where we really need assistance and there are others where we have adequate capacity underground\nRegarding volunteers and it does have requested that they'd be coordinated if not we can end up in a situation where they would be many volunteers with good intentions but he could in actual fact Tampa rescue and recovery efforts [noise]\nWas that the statement from the Indonesian authorities today so in states like teach me just a case of the Indonesian government trying to improve the efficiency of the disaster recovery operation don't technicolor banks is a lecturer at the University of Manchester and a fellow at the global development Institute I think so\nThat's the Manchester and a fellow at the global development Institute I think so I mean I think after every emergency response there are reflections unimportant lessons to be ... and perhaps that since the Indonesian government not only reacting to this response but also learning from the experience of the\nThe um responses that they that they let\nInto needs there isn't the first country that has chosen to make decisions like this in India had also made a similar decision often the floods in Canada I Wonder if you see this as a as a possible trend imaging it\nCould well be possible trends and one that we have to understand in the context of shifting\nRelationships between international NGOs unless southern counterpart I think governments are increasingly wanting to make sure that government on civil society as lead winning national voted but also from the other side international NGOs are also we are entering that focus and trying to build stronger partnership sin which I'm southern pot and at the uh taking the lead\nSense than in places in what you're saying that the lead on the control is very often imposed from the outside I think so and then\nI think if you look at the um responds internationally and some of the nation from the public and from government that's a huge influx from the outside that the government quite right so he wants to be able to centralize coordinate a and understand what's going on I think that disaster emergency\nCommittee raised six million pounds from the u._k. public on the first day of the response so\nThere is a huge ... influx of results says and personnel and in this case the Indonesian government has said\nRight let's put limits on the personnel it for me votes but then not requesting that foreign funds be restricted\nIs this an issue that you didn't fool them to a certain extent by national pride if she like\nI think any country in the world would want to maintain control of what's going on and exploded I don't think it's particularly surprising that is rooted in pride but it's also rooted in territorial governance the government wants to know what's going on in the in control of that\nAnd in one seemed to be in control all what happens and how a dissolves the AIDS reacted to in doubt ways could possibly be that a country like in the knees yeah\nMight be passing off its nose to spite hits faith in the context of expertise and and the skills that are required to respond to such disasters\nI think that's an easy assumption to jump too but I also think it's important to reflect and understand how strong local organizations are in the context a lot of the big international NGOs that we're talking about here that are amazing stuff may well have\nLocal offices out with local and international staff and have trained personnel and expertise on the ground so\nI Would imagine the Indonesian government have not taking this decision lightly but it's one to to look out for the record questions of it so lessons can be lumped in the future [noise] I
