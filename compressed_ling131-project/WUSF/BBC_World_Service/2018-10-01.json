I Hope he returns home safe because deep inside my heart I feel that way\nSafe because the ... side my heart I feel that way\nBut it's got to different places where we will keep trying to search for him to get there without their family members\nAre ready to well many scientists said that they haven't been expecting such a big snow me following friday's earthquake Jason ... is a geophysicist who works for the consulting firm ... teaches a humble State University in California he explained why he had been surprised\nBecause the earthquake was a strike slip type of an earthquake where the crust move side by side as a geologist we did not expect ... possibly as large as the ... that happened\nOne of the different types of earthquake then what sort of a quake would you expect to cool was a ... of this size\nSo earthquakes that are the result of compression workplace move towards each other tend to cause vertical land emotion\nAnd it is this type of vertical land motion that lifts the water column up and elevates it so that there is gravitational potential in that water and that water falls down\nAnd that is what starts the nominee strike slip earthquakes they move side by side and typically they don't generate very much vertical land motion however\nWe do have examples of that and twenty six team there were an earthquake in the works in basin southwest of some ... there was a large strike slip fault earthquake there and it cost us to an army in addition in Nineteen Ninety nine the is much turkey earthquake caused a tsunami however the strike slip tsunamis\nAre much smaller in size than generated by a conversion earthquakes like a along any subduction zone\nSo that'd be other factors involved in this one\nYes we have observed on social media and on post earthquake satellite imagery that there have been extensive enlarge landslides\nOn land and then also landslides along the shoreline\nAnd so this is the second possible cause for Saddam means is that from a submarine landslide when submarine landslide happens that submarine landslide can also cause displacement of water and that displacement of the water can generate a tsunami\nAnd I'm going to be absolutely clear when you're talking about a landslide you're talking about one below sea level\nYes in order for a landslide to cause it's an army would it would need to be the low level of course the landslide could start out on land and then move into the water or the landslide could be a submarine landslide entirely under water\nSo how will you allow others go about verifying exactly what happened and why the soon on me was so big\nIt will be important for people who want to investigate this to take a research vessel into ... bay and the ocean north of ... bay and collect detailed bath and metric data information about the shape of the fee for to see if they can locate a landslide\nIt is possible that there were enough landslides that were small enough that would not be you know ... from a ship but that would be one way of testing the hypothesis that landslide was responsible in Nineteen Ninety eight there is a earthquake off the shore of pop when New Guinea\nAnd this earthquake caused a tsunami that Saddam me had higher than expected wave heights and run up elevations and afterwards scientists who\nWent there and mapped the four and located age submarine landslide that is hypothesized to be the reason for the large city\nThat is hypothesized to be the reason for the large tsunami\nThe Indonesian authorities have told us that that Saddam me early warning system based on the boys floating on top of the water was not working either because the boys had been stolen all they were simply not activated if\nThat had been working would it have detected this particular Saddam and given what you're telling us about it that is ...\nMay have detected the ... I mean if they were in the cracks location unfortunately\nThose bully that it's an army warning system could not have helped the people in the region of ... because the earthquake with so close to them and the earthquake and the landslides being the likely source for the nominee was so close to them that\nWe need to emphasize that people who live an earthquake country who are along the coast and exposed to potential salami hazards they need to recognize that the earthquake is they're warning and so if someone finds themselves in that location in that area if the ground shakes\nFor twenty seconds or more they need to evacuate to high ground\nSo there's something nothing that can be done to bomb them above and beyond the earthquake warning system and the earthquake itself\nCorrect so dominant warning systems can help people if they are in a little cage that far away from the source of the ... but they do not help people who are in the region near the source of a sudden I mean\nSo does that mean that people living in these earthquake zones near near the scene near the ocean need to have special different type of training\nThe type of training that people who live near the coast and people who live in earthquake country that type of training is they're getting that right now by listening to this broadcast all they need to know is that if they are in a low low lying area and the ground shakes her more than twenty seconds that they need to get to high ground\nIf we can learn from the horrible disaster that happened and it is ongoing and civil or say Indonesia that would be a great thing for us to learn\nAnd that was Jason ... a geophysicist at Humboldt State University in California and just remind if you missed any live edition of the program you could always count shop with a pub cause which we are\nLike twice a day seven days a week to slip for BBC News hour on cause you're listening to the b._b._c. will service his knees out with James come on or something [noise]\nAnd this is W.
