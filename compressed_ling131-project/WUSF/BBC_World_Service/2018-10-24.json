plates cutlery cotton bonds which make up more than Seventy percent of marine they talked on the ... such as beverage pop cultural has to be collected separately and recycled as a race has Ninety percent by twenty twenty five\nBefore we came on our I spoke to mark ... a material scientist at University College London he explained the staggering contrast between how long we use these everyday items full and then life span in the environment\nThis material will last hundred years in the ground and in the oceans but he's only meant to last a few minutes and you'll hands [laughter] it's\nKinda crazy situation that we found ourselves in the projections are if we don't stop doing that will be more plastic in the ocean than fish by twenty fifty\nThat statistic I learn you would think would have made us look there's a lot earlier than we have\nPeople have been willfully blind to this industry of known for a long time\nThat these plastic from not being recycled no company wants it to take the first new because that would ban on page but making the others are competing against you know he's been out of sight out of mind for many people you put it in your recycling we open and you think well that's being taken care of but no it hasn't been taking care of\nSo now with this ban which will be presumably implanted in all the European Union countries what will be alternatives be and how long do you think it will take before the ban is enforced across the board\nWe going to stay in the next two years by twenty Twenty one uh phasing out of the existing stalks I've just said that it is a hell of a lot more single use plastic but\nWe don't hadn't if you have an alternative but with other things like an egg bond is quite easy to replace with the paper one bought things like the multi laminate transparent films that you find on your vegetables that protected tomatoes and you'll fruit strengthens replacement so those are not easy to find\nI think that the twenty Twenty one goal that the European Parliament has now imposed is too ambitious\nI think we need to be ambitious I Know that there'll be lots of pain in the industry but some plastics the all\nQuite easy to just get out of your life and I think that we should all citizens strive to do that and\nWhat would you suggest that we should eliminate immediately\nWhere you don't need a plastic for the I mean a lot of the folks are given to you without anyone really thinking through the ... it's not going to be recycled what isn't everyone like I Do bring with them and stainless steel

that it's all things that we can do immediately\nI wanted to do what you think is the real problem that needs looking at now as well which is just the levels of consumption is there a complete re education that needs to happen\nI think there is a re education about people not expecting the stuff that he was completely and I keep up with an ... century consumption for ... sake like the practical unlike disposable cops on notice flexible but\nI think actually doesn't systemic change that's about the whole way we run the economy to have to change and that will take longer that will happen soon but it has to happen in my view that everything we make\nWhatever the waiters and shampoo bottle or a car or a mobile phone ring\nOr they will have plastics and by the way\nSomeone needs to think about the end of life and they must always come back and methodical such autonomy\nAnd in my view should be illegal to sell currently where you don't know how the disassemble it and put it back to them\nWhat you're asking for is a complete overhaul and the way in which we structure our economy because that last point is pretty radical\nIt is radical but the alternative is equally radical which is a complete ... the environment and that is a stark truth of the way in which are linear record them in I live near by saying this we basically take stuff on the ground we pump it out of the ground we make products which are amazing an ally especially in the west of full of wonderful material for them\nBut then we have NO PLAN about what to do with all that stuff and of course the economy is all about taking demand for most stuff but we haven't even watch out what to do with the stuff we don't want anymore and we will just end up with an environmental catastrophe if we do know rethink that linear economy\n[noise] serious thought sad for a month ... middle snake who is a material scientist at the University of University College London\n[noise]\nNow start because on the west

some but they were focused mostly on European Americans and African Americans [noise]\nSo what I did was um and large the simple to undercut the global on diversity in bad shape\nLike I said it's what you found you studied three hundred and forty eight so nice to be a hundred and fifty cents from twenty four different populations what would the differences [noise]\nWell if you look at the shape or they can on for example subset African women I cannot is very different from what you find as an average and some\nNative American population for example St ... African women it tastes more circuit sometime it's actually deep are back to front than Haiti's whiter side to side or what if you move to Native American populations for example you're fine\nUh what if you move to Native American populations for example you find that it's the largest side to side and suddenly we're back to front so it's a completely opposite and shape of ... said they cannot wear the baby's hot spots descending\nAnd I think that the the this knowledge has this lack of understanding today each has actually had a negative consequences for women\n[noise] it is possible that some evidence from the Nineteen thirties again the same period in which there were um ... women there we're also following up what's happened after birth\nAnd they did find that the baby I'm can have a different presentation at birth depending on not id group the woman was coming from\nBut also a there is some evidence that some of the movement\nThat wearing posted a baby gives him first said we're not ideal for the shape of some women a minority women especially say fifth ... uh\nUh she cannot things that the European order out on a sub Saharan African woman that might actually be wrong in the sense of the baby would turn in a different type thing and if you try to drive the baby was the first day of specific that action based on your motor you will actually harm to a baby and monitor that actually happened\nYeah so what do you expect now to happen with the information that you have now I'm ... researched\nJust said well I'm hoping I'm hoping that the as some idea or the variation that we're seeing women all over the word will be afflicted in textbooks instead of just basing\nUm everything on a simple motto of what we found most and European women so some knowledge mental variation of preparation of of the teaching some midwives base and as you noted\nEarlier Bessie a biological anthropologist at the University of ... are joining a slice thanks very much you're listening to the b._b._c.

maybe it's the manor house a manor house a industry here\nUh to uh\nUh influence policy both in the executive and legislative branches of the Saudi influences expensive that's one of the reasons they've been able to retain a such power internationally Washington despite the fact that\nThe Saudis are played a role in nine eleven many people feel a we have one former chairman of the intelligence committee saying that there was a direct line between the Saudi Government and some of the nine eleven uh hijackers\nAre they a before and after nine eleven going right up through uh their attempt to block the nine eleven victims from suing the kingdom and making a case that they weren't involved through Yemen through other action\nMaking a case that they were involved through human or through other action their their opposition to the important Iran nuclear agreement the Saudis are really are not our friends they do not share our values and we ought not to be now covering up for them promoting their cover up of the really outrageous murder\nThat they may not shed us values as you described them but they really do help the U.S economy is the U.S led to walk away from the home field they have with the U.S we're talking about a hundred and ten billion dollars and many many American Jobs\nSurely the president of the United states has some strong case to make to protect those jobs\nYou know I expect the same argument has been there in the u._k. because there have been plenty of weapons supplied from the u._k. to the Saudis as well uh there has to be something that is more important than just the next dollar of arms sales ah and ah in this case\nWhen you are selling these arms or to someone who gauges in this kind of outrageous conduct is time at least to

thirty local time with the prime minister of Lebanon sensibly they're going to be on a panel about economic development in the region and how to make the middle east you know more of a global powerhouse\nBut yeah everybody sort of wondering if you point to address the situation with a show busy at you know a few people did earlier at the conference yesterday\nHow would you characterize the atmosphere than\nFight the fact that there were a lot of withdrawals and people falling out boycotting ... there are a lot of people here they're expecting about three thousand for the week up there if there have been some people who have been you know recruited ... faces but\nYou know certainly a lot of activity at the little bit more subdued than it was last year when there were robot milling about and\nA lot of the big name executives from American banks were here but you know I think there's definitely a lot of field being cut\nAnd when you talk about the fact that deals actually are being done it don't sound as though that they the kind of potential re calibration of engaging with Saudi Arabia but ultimately the ... the color of money will prevail\nThat's probably right I mean you know will depend on how the next few weeks ago at more evidence emerging or you know they did find the memorandum of understanding yesterday or you know and I think it's off the boat that we could see the Saudis are shifting from ... to the east and the other direction there's a lot of Russian\nUh business leaders here there's a lot of people from Asia the parts of the world so you know Thursday which direction but we'll go one\nOf the leaders who has decided to to show up pays a the the median stones prime minister and focus on Enron Conn he's made it very clear that engaging with

to be talking about Pakistan potential even for investment became away from the trip you know the ... billion dollars for it though I think uh you know there was that when\nI Wonder whether you think that the uh\nI think you know that when\nI I Wonder whether you think that the Saudis are lost in tiny on irony when we when we hear that time the eagles classic song hell California is that is being

that set speak now to Kevin old Feinstein his former U.S diplomat in the middle East that he says most recently as ambassador to Yemen under President Obama\nHe's now the middle East Institute in Washington DC welcome to the program I I Wonder what you think about a well Mike Mike Pompeo has done so far would you like to see\nSome more extensive responses to what the Saudis have time to come out ...\nWell I'm certainly and and the administration itself or the president as well as secretary Pompeo said that uh this was a first step and that they intend to ah pursue a further steps as as more evidence becomes available to them so I I don't think that this is the end of the story\nWhen you say you don't think this is the end of the story I mean do you feel that they will be a just a week calibration of the U.S relationship with weeds we adult or will it will be much much bigger rupture\nWell my my view what what I said before is that I think that we need to distinguish between um between Saudi Arabia and Mohammed bin some odd in and in my view or this is primarily not a problem of the U.S Saudi relationship as much as it is a problem of\nOf the U.S relationship with Mohammed bin some on and the other question about what direction he is pushing the country\nSo uh I I think that the focus is going to be primarily\nOn uh the relationship with the the senior leadership as opposed to a looking at a country with which we've had a very long and close relationship for a over Seventy years it's\nGoing to be quite hard one to sit next to the Internet because uh but President Trump and his son in law Jared Kushner has aligned themselves so closely with the crown prince\nAbsolutely and and uh you could see that ah you know President Trump was struggling with this whole issue early on I have no doubt in my mind that they would have dearly love to see this whole problem go away\nUh but uh but certainly you know I think that the level of anger both in the United states in the United States Congress we heard from congressman dog it earlier as well as internationally a is a is clearly forcing the president's had to do more\nGeneral ... senior U.S diplomat in the

regardless of who they are are in the health care and in a transparent way and then we decide ... can move forward from there\nWell they've had three weeks to be transparent and buy your own reckoning

a way that is sometimes critical of government but not for me it's a thick sight of over matured and country\nIs there any reason to evidence since Saudi Arabia in any way listens to such cools\nSo I think that is and I think you know say they are very very aware thought it's relationship with the kingdom as a key to teach Jake uh you know nature and the history with them is very different to that\nOr some other countries in the region and I hope uh that Saudi Arabia are values that relationship realize you need the kings of a deadly serious when we say that\nYou know the mother of
