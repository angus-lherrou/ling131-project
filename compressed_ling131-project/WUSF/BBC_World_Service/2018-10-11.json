it's analogous to take off of an airplane you know let's see I have a problem then you're kind of most vulnerable especially with all that fuel on board\nAnd so you know they were definitely in in danger there was the rest of their uh fortunately all of the abort systems work properly and that is there was no second failure and fortunately there was no catastrophic\nA failure for example a you know some kind of a of the explosion of the booster they were able to you know pretty smoothly execute this or emergency procedure and get off of the rocket and bring the descent module back down to the ground\nYou know the sort of space cross what are they like to climate\nYeah fell on my fourth space flight I did for launch from the biking or caused the drum on a similar still use space craft and and then landed at the end of the mission in the soil used as well it's pretty cramped inside very tight especially with two or three people inside\nYou've got your knees kind of pushed up towards your chest hand uh you know you're in that position for quite a while\nNow having said that it is very reliable space craft it's a basically it's been in operation and been steadily improved ever since the late Nineteen sixties when\nBoth rocket ... started flying so it's unusual that we have this kind of a an event ah the last time this kind of a board happened I Believe was a Nineteen Seventy five\nAnd then there was a launch pad of boards different type of a boards I Believe that was in the early Nineteen eighties it has happened a few times over the years but in between the rocket has flown several hundred times in the spacecraft as well\nThere was a problem ... wasn't that they were there was a hole in the old between caps you lie I think and not only met a hole up in the space station wants to go but I had to be repaired I mean with what happened today together with ... raising concerns about the future of the soldiers\nThat does raise some questions in my mind and that's one of the first things I thought of as well we had this unusual issue with a whole being probably accidentally drilled on the ground and then you know then stuffing patched and then we have this issue with today's launch and it made me wonder if\nA hope that the Russian investigators will look for some kind of a systemic breakdown one or more people cutting corners may be you know something like that that they actually look into the whole process to make sure that something isn't slipping\nObviously relations generally between us and Russia Iran great spot American astronauts relying on that Russian colleagues to to to help them get to the international space station when you were operational did you ever have any doubts the tool about the professionalism of your Russian politics or not\nOh never never and even beyond the cosmonauts everybody on both sides very very professional very courteous we had wonderful working relationships no matter what was going on you know with our political leadership\nWonderful working relationships no matter what was going on\nYou know with our political leadership it never filtered down to the working level after working level everybody always got along with everybody always for doing what they needed to do [noise]\nSharing information that needed to be shared in order to keep the station going even though as you point out relations between the U.S and Russia are not great and haven't been great for a few years I Would argue they would actually be worse if we didn't at least have this very visible common civil space project that we worked together on\nAnd yet the U.S is developing other ways of getting to the space station and I think a spy sex and we'll start bombing developing capabilities which I think you're going to be tested next year it's not the right way to proceed votes or the America doesn't have the reliance on soybeans\nRight and so you basically are developing their own commercial space craft to take\nAstronauts to and from the international space station\nAnd it's not so much that we don't want to rely on Russia's there ought to be more than one way to get to and from the station and when the space shuttle flying\nWe had that having a single provider when you have a problem like this you know now we've got to wait until mishap board figures out the root cause of the problem and then the problems are fixed\nAnd then the vehicles are recertified not going to take some time we're running up against is that the lifetime of the soil use on board or\nYou know in ... which is about two
