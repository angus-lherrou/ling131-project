Jamal ... all ... an interrogation that went wrong\nOr I don't know exactly what the uh what is it going to say on that delicate nuance of what I'm told is that the scenario that are going to lay out goes like\nA generalist Syria got some kind of accent or approval from crown prince Mohammed to carry out rendition or interrogation that is to get a ... and to bring him home for questioning\nOr somehow there was either a or a misunderstanding or general theory overstaffed or his his orders in ... through some personal ambition\nAnd ended up killing that your show any answer that is going to be credible to the Turks a will not include a furious element of interrogation because\nTheir evidence they say is that Mr for sure he was killed quite quickly after he arrived in the conflict so there wasn't a lot of time for questioning\nBut even in the scenarios are you a out lining on the crown prince is involved\nYeah the crown prince of the wrong that's what I set out to this is a very significant scapegoat if you will if it's just a scapegoat it's a pretty serious scapegoat but because of his proximity to ... I don't want to prejudge that this is just a made up story but hypothetically if it were just a made up story to cover the crown prince\nYou would have to name someone who is very very senior\nBecause only that kind of a person could give these orders and have them carried out without the direct involvement of the crown prince\nEven so many people are going to question whether even generalists theory could have pulled this off or without the direct involvement of the ... it's not clear whether the world is going to believe this story\nYou said at the outset Mr cook Patrick said she was getting some of this from from White House sources so um it it it's tied to assume that some of the White House is is aware of this ... emerging plan\nYeah I didn't say people in the White House but I think on the White House and the things I Believe they didn't inform the American or certainly aware that this is the direction the record is moving him\nWould that be some sort of explanation told President Trump's reference to I'm a road Kansas to saint Catherine the week\nWell how about that reference or because that occurred right after his conversation with king Solomon himself it certainly was pressured it if it's not a evidence that he had for knowledge of this scenario\nWhat do you do make all the um signed by the ... that this was punched in the old adage the killing of Jamal ... jeep by crown prince themselves [noise]\nWell I I was listening to John's comments closely and he doesn't exactly precisely say\nOr that it was ordered by the crown prince he said it looks very likely that all the evidence points are being ordered by someone very close to the crown prince uh but I think that if anybody in a position to judge she is and because of his stature or in the u._k. and the U.S\nI think is very public comments today are going to make it more difficult for people in western governments who might be inclined to accept a this explanation in that\nAnd governor who might be inclined to accept a this explanation that someone else's as possible it is going to make it a little bit more difficult for them to do so you know the the United States government and other government certainly some people in those governments would like to just smooth things over with Saudi Arabia as soon as possible it's an important ally\nBut comments like the ones we heard today from John sorry they're going to make that\nHarder and how soon would you expect the information that you say you some gathered from your sauces to emerge into the public the main you know\nSaudi Arabia moves editor on speed\nI so I Am not at all sure a house to them they are going to wrap up there and they're calling it and many of these disclosures to be honest and now that are reported to uh become widely debated that may have some\nImpact on how they proceed I mean if this idea it's shot down before it gets off the ground\nThat could change their their thinking I'm but I'm a you know I'm I'm I'm waiting myself with some they just basically here when they finished they where they wrap it up\nJust to go back to I used to say that there's any ... that some than New York times says is maybe being used them as in some kind of way to to test this particular proposition\nAh in this case I don't think so you know although it's certainly common for for various people or whatever just float ideas like that in this case it was pretty hard for me to pry it out a and the people who ultimately confirmed it to me\nDid so reluctantly so this is not a situation where someone calls me up and says oh by the way you're let me give you that I'm which leads me to believe that it was not a deliberate clap\nDavid Kirkpatrick an international correspondent for the New York times speaking from Istanbul he's also the author the recently published book into the hands of the soldiers freedom in chaos in Egypt in the middle\nEast which has come to the Arab Spring and it's something [noise]\nI my replayed over one at a free babies born in the U.S is delivered via C section and the rate in some countries is even higher on the next science friday a look at what's behind the rise of C sections and what this means for healthy babies and their mother\nPlus how farmers in Puerto Rico are rebuilding one year after Hurricane Maria which all on science friday\nFrom WNYC Studios that's\nComing up tonight at seven here on to us at eighty nine point seven ... college probably has eleven live H.
