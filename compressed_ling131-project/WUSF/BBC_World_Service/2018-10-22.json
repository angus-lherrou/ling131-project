risky investors perceive something\nThat is different than interest rates between Germany which is the safest so\nTo speak or at least risky country in the euro area and it's at least\nIf that spread rises and keep rising at some point the cost of new debt in Italy will become unsustainable be high\nAnd everybody will be running for the door for then I think it surely will be in a position where the government will have to change its policies if it wants to avoid an old out prices\nWhich could have a contagion impact elsewhere in Europe and possibly the world\nOne of the striking features so far in this a crisis or if we can call it that by now he is that actually there hasn't been much contagion to other southern European countries like Portugal Spain or even reached\nThe cost of Italian government debt has been rising but the others have been removed very much\nIf that were to shift well then obviously they would be a crisis for the euro area as a whole and again most like the European Central bank would have to change its policies or at least take some new additional measures the risk of that happening is that there would be many\nInternational investors that allocate a certain amount of their portfolio to southern European peripheral if you're like government debt in the euro area\nIf they truly were at some point in the future to be further down raided by the credit rating agencies into what is called a non investment grade or\nMore juggler recalled junk a rating\nWell then many of these investors would simply dump\nTheir holdings of not just Italian but also the other southern European countries government debt and you would have are the kind of contagion that everybody is quite fearful about but as I said to date haven't really materialized\nOkay so do you think an mission and at this point in the ... non compliance it supposed to be deciding the next ... to ... well ... options\nLegally it's options are they can completely reject the budget but after that then uh it will take several months and then they can enter into a a an excessive deficit procedure\nSometime in two thousand nine team but there isn't any sort of concrete thing is that the ...\nBut there isn't any sort of concrete thing is that the commission can sanction or levy fines or anything like that instead of course a measure\nThat we are in the short run really have much effect of course if the commission decides to have a very public debate or fight with the Italian government over the over the edge of the commission can hope that the international investors and\nCapital markets a new to this and that they are financial markets put additional an immediate pressure on uh the Italian government to change its policies\nBut the cost of that will probably be political because uh it ... and the other European members of the ... you are heading into\nA European election a parliamentary election campaigns ah culminating next may\nAnd there's no doubt that the current Italian government would love to have a big political fight with Brussels over the Italian budget and over the extra money that in their eyes they're spending you know to help [noise]\nAverage voters in its ally because that that will obviously play into their political fortunes they're looking for this fight\nYeah cup ... got that from the Peterson Institute for international economics\nSays why might the Italian government be looking to ruffle feathers at the very least in Brussels that's the name ... even the ruling coalition stood on us get to the phones during the elections in may still trying to stir up hostilities\nI think speaking to the under secretary for fun says ... from the science stop needs met and I asked him if the government and just trying to pick a fight with Brussels\nThe important things to make people to understand that we have a good economy ... they probably did that so we think that having a stable an increasing economy\nIn the reform that we are applying good out also in our country to reduce the debt in three years that can be a good\nUm do you like to hear upset that you say you got a good economy in fact your interest rates has written shop play in the past few months since you are and like I said we had that to the Italian government is struggling to sell its phones invested a retreat thing it's not to stabilize you think\nWell it was the other even during the read using all the ... the friends they are ... that our economy is good so I think that the reality is that what you're paying more in the interest on to that\nAnd that leads to create some trouble by the way they think that we can increase our area the economy with three or four so I don't think that in the European Commission they were really and then the difference between you know every program and and expand the program\nSo you're looking at the essence of stimulus package basically but even if they had no ... behind it and found you still in play a violation of your time rules and the European Commission potentially tomorrow it could turn around and all day you to read this budget what would you do if I ... it\nLooks to me sounds seem very happy to go to the end just look at the data are coming from France or Germany and France that have been at both the limit for years even during the ... gonna be the mandate that I

internal problems about this cannot deal with the guardian people we are so\nTiny and people's a decision and and well as you say\nObviously in Joe Main concern but looks at the ... accusing me of being irresponsible with Italy's\nEconomy and potentially with the economy of the whole year already known I mean youre trying to love at the age of pension ... when you go to an aging population

case and if the need for the foreseeable future or is that something that is being discussed in its any\nI think nobody wants to go outside of the eurozone and the and in the euro ally and so do not even an argument in our government and we are described to be willing to leave the eurozone but not the gate in any in any any than going to the long term or uncertain that's going to a BS\nYou currently in a coalition so of course there's a range of political reasoning on the table and you have to work with your publishing partners in that if the European Commission to more does order you to go look at the budget again bring it down bring down they said as\nYou'll be forced to do that when you\nKnow we are not forced to anything we would not do it we can go deeper in some reform in trying to explain downloaded the talk of the hour we are waiting to achieve by the reform would already be debated in our country and that we think that these will work\nAnd that was the under
