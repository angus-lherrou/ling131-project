that it will not bound to us pressure that is the headline that President Adam ... says well read listen to and by\nThe BBC's monk low in in east and build them with him all from him about the political implications of this case in a few minutes to Brunson hasn't been without support from his compatriots in court in Turkey during this time William Devlin is another ... from New York\nHe's traveled to me several times over the last few months to follow the hearings and he was also at the courthouse today\nBecause the court is held in the Turkish language we had to wait for our translators to communicate the news to us\nAnd when the news was announced pastor Brunson you're guilty we sent and shoot a three point one years\nIt time served you're free to go the travel ban was lifted we are the court is now releasing you so when that was red right after the government prosecutor had re read the entire indictment which took them almost an hour\nThe government prosecutor from turkey of the court\nAsked the court to send pastor Brunson who's been on house\nArrest since July to fend pastor Brunson back to prison the court recess pastor Brunson was just emotional crying hugging his wife I had the opportunity to speak to him and so\nBy the time the court came back they read the sentence you're guilty but you can go\nIt wasn't until we were exit from the prison courtroom out in the parking lot of the prison that finally are we're asking our translators\nWhat happened is he going to jail is the and they said no he's free to go so we're rejoicing we shouted hallelujah\nNow you've been following code procedures in Tokyo all the way through this I Know and the Turkish government says today's decision proves the judiciary independents that this wasn't a political decision what's your assessment\nIf you cannot explain it Paul then you know that God is in it and that's what I've been saying that people all day you know what were the the ... channels going back and forth what were the give up from the American government I think that the Turkish government was finally be relieved\nOf getting rid of past her pups and and if the Turkish government is saying it shows you the independence of the judiciary in Turkey then we'll find well we'll take that home and it will take it to the bank\nTurkey then we'll find vote will take that home and it will take it to the bank now the pastor Brunson is on his way home so we're very excited and we're thankful to God\nWell if this wasn't a political decision they certainly will have political repercussions won't sit Reverend done and what do you think of the fact that this is an enormous boost to President Trump in the run up to the mid term elections he will say this is this is his achievement\nYou know whoever wants to take credit for it I think frankly as the economist periodical wrote last month that a pastor Brunson had become the world's most expensive prisoner turkey had the pressure of their lira going down\nOn the terror that the U.S government placed upon Turkish goods coming into the U.S I think there was an enormous amount of\nPressure and there was an enormous amount of chats bumping you know this is what happens when you have to bombastic world leaders who are proud and pride full and that would be President Trump and president everyone\nAnd it was like a big fight and who's gonna win\nAnd I think it was to the Turkish government credit\nAnd arid and won the Turkish government Trump whoever takes credit for Paul words as grateful he's out and he's home and this is another one in the wind column for religious freedom and human rights around the world there are many others that are still being in prison not just of the Christian faith but of every faith and so\nThat's what I'm focused on is getting those people released and back with their family\nHe's not being deemed innocent by the Turkish codes have the the reason he corrected because he spent two years in detention is not a politician\nIt's exactly not apart and he was found when the the leaves turkey pastor Brunson yeah leave turkey a guilty man but a free man\nThe Turkish government has demanded the extradition of fair to the deal and the cleric who lives in the U.S and who deals Aristide Kentucky accused of being behind the failed coup in Turkey and you supported that cool his extradition ... didn't you is that not for the U.S justice system alone to decide\nPrison error once said you give us a school in we'll give you Brunson so I think\nIt is in the interest of our relationship the U.S relationship with turkey that we extradite Gulen so as I was talking to us diplomat today they said that the grueling extradition because we had that treating with turkey\nThe goal and extradition has been the most examined extradition and the history of the United states that's quite a statement to make\nBut right now the judges who are overseeing that extradition hearing they find no reason why for tool a goal in this a mom in northern Pennsylvania should be extradited to turkey I think it'd be a great idea it should have happened I Hope it happens soon\nSo we were able to receive now pastor Andrew Brunson that I Hope someday for tool a goal and we'll go back to turkey and meet justice back there\nThat was passed to William and dabbling who's from New York speaking to me that from his men as we could the big concession took he wanted for the release of pastor Brunson was the extradition of the character to look good and he took he blames us must of mind to the coup attempt\nOf July twenty sixteen I asked the BBC's mount blow in it he thought Mr ... status in the United states could be in jeopardy after this no I\nDon't I think that he used to bigger fish to trade from the U.S in this way and to trade him anyway would be an impeachable offense for an American president and his case is going through the courts because the U.S does have much more of an end\nThrough the courts because the U.S does have much more of an independent judiciary than techies technique wouldn't the rankings by Moscow says it cetera\nSo President Trump ... federal lands extradition and the way they present that one can probably old at the release of an American past to ... I think ... was much more in play was the general relationship but the fact that he's trying to buy F ... fighter jets from the U.S at the moment which was potentially jeopardized by the relationship\nAnd just basically techies economic problems facing the sanctions and terrorists I mean techie is facing\nThe beginnings of an economic crisis here and it just seems to be quite literally could not afford to keep us to Bronson in President can we expect us took his relations to bloom now\nThey will warm to some extent but they're all still major issues between them pot be ready to the war in Syria partly related to fit your like your land party related to general decades don't animosity\nThis was a major source of friction eats relief that tension in the friction\nBut it's not going to be hugs and kisses immediately the honeymoon period that President Trump had with presidents had one when he came to office has well and truly ended the U.S and turkey could end up sharing suspicions of Saudi Arabia following the disappearance of that Saudi journalist in Turkey\nAnd they're all some links between the two stories techies trying to build a case\nAgainst Saudi Arabia by leaking evidence that incriminate them and suggest that Jamal ... was the victim of a state sponsored assassination by Saudi Arabia\nTurkey wants American support for that it could get more American support by having released pastor Brunson by you know the U.S still has a very close relationship with Saudi Arabia and when Donald Trump was asked whether for example the U.S would stop arms sales to Saudi Arabia the actual case he\nSimply said no it's too much of a benefit to the American economy\n[noise] the BBC's monk low in talking to me from a stunned bowling Andrew Brunson is not report it to be on route from his former ... is mayor in Turkey\nTo the United states by Germany according to his lawyer the latest is on the news website as is analysis of the lake just Turkish us relations with the BBC will so this news down [noise]\n\nAh\nVoters are getting ready for the midterm elections but are are voting systems ready I'm Ira Flatow I'm an ex science friday a look at the security of our voting infrastructure plus how scientists and an aunt sniffing dog are working to restore the ecosystems and California's channel islands\nIt's all on science friday from WNYC studio [noise]\nScience friday coming up at seven o'clock this evening here on to USF eighty nine point seven thousands of orchids are in bloom now through Thanksgiving weekend at zero to ... gardens during its twenty Eighteen or could show enlisted forms sponsored in part by these Sarasota County cheesy cheap tickets are at ... dot org\n", "year": "2018", "show_name": "BBC World Service", "city": "Tampa", "day": "12"}
