Research Center for forensic science and invest de dum de\nWhy is it that children sleep student loans to you know that that's a very\nGood question on the answer at the moment is no we don't which is probably not hugely helpful and what we do know is about to children and don't sleep through or don't appear to sleep through the conventional smoke alarms that we all have in our houses\nAnd the two studies that you mentioned one is ours when you play the sound from from the piece of work that we did and not work has now been corroborated by um the study that you mentioned in the United states though the two research groups were not linked um and they looked at the mother's voice to the to the the\nActual recorded voice of a mother of the children and they found out to be more effective than the conventional ... smoke alarm sound but the the the answers we don't know actually why this was happening\nI mean you gave evidence in a court case into the deaths of six children who died in back in twenty twelve and they all died of smoke inhalation even know there was smoke ... when\nThe wind tossed really tragic case that um I I Wonder whether you now know that it's the mother's voice that is effective and not the fault it's not a male voice\nIt's a it's a it's a very good point um it was my research student pick of the evidence or no meat so just to make sure that we have a correct\nAnd so what we found in our study is that uh we used a female voice we didn't use the mother's voice and I think there's more work to be done to see whether or not that we need to be inside female and I suspect\nWhether or not that always needs to be inside female and I suspect that it just needs to be a voice at will be my my suspicion there has been some work done in coal with colleagues in Australia around different types of voices to be [noise]\nSo it doesn't appear to necessarily need to be the mother and father to a voice that that seems to be the thing that triggers the children to wake up\nWell given that to what extent do you think then they should change the way that we think about fire safety I mean should smoke alarms now have a human voice in and when the noise of Vietnam\nI think that there's something to be said about that um I think certainly for 'em\nSmoke alarms in ... where there are young children and our work looked at children under the age for about fourteen after where there are young children what we start to me no is smoke alarms without voice don't does wake those children up so what we're\nNot advocating is that people shouldn't do smoke alarms it's exactly the the the other at a different message people should you smoke alarms but they need to be aware that conventional smoke alarms may simply not wake their children up to they're going to need to go and wake their children up themselves\nBut when you ... when you talk about what you are advocating what happens after a research paper like they have to you then got an advice I'm On hospitals you know schools you got to talk to parents how does it work\nFor the work that we did hear it on the I'm absolutely we we began to a a piece of work with and our local city council and adopt a initially was to raise\nThe awareness um around the fact that conventional smoke alarms minor wake up children and so they worked with her to prepare documentation information that they went into all of the local authorities schools wouldn't ... I think there's a wider peace here though because I think that there's a a a challenge and to be thrown out to those who make smoke alarms and\nTo address that issue the issue is really serious and I and and there's there's there's certainly not the underpinning research to show that we do need to use a different type of sound in order to eight children than to interlinked some\nConventional smoke

Seventy thousand Sega is almost as many people who die on the roads and from guns in the United states each year\nIt's extraordinary I mean another figure that you know I I sometimes go to people is since the turn of the century more Americans have died of drug overdose than died in World War one world war two put together\nOh this is the worst epidemic we've seen you know it's even worse than aids actually on the peak in terms of the the amount of death you'd have to go back to the flu epidemics of you know fifty years ago to find a time where as many people were being cut down in the prime of their lives as we're experiencing right now with opioids and\nAll ... to ... still prescribing some of these drugs\nPhysicians have changed their prescribing significantly in the United states in the last five\nYears but we are still way higher than for example or the u._k. would be I mean we got to a point that we were outstripping Europe by you know factor of six to one per capita and outstripping nations like Japan like thirty five to one why is that oh the\nUh if we have a for profit health care system that you know doctors are paid based on the number of people they churn through and I think prescriptions help you churn through quickly\nWe do not regulate our industries tightly enough and they promoted products like oxycontin and is the most famous one very aggressively and they pled guilty in federal court to lying about how risky that drug was\nAnd uh you know I think that sort of corporate lightly regulated way of of regulating farm I regularly to health care system is a big reason why the U.S has had this explosion of prescription opioid addiction now\nPresident Trump signed into law a new bipartisan bill to try and address this crisis does the government have a grasp of the full extent of the problem now and how much of a crisis it is\nWell the bill or the law was signed yesterday and I worked on that closely with our Congress it does many smart things in terms of of covering a care for people who are addicted to opioids through our various insurance programs Medicaid which is focused on lower income people Medicare which is focused on\nOlder Americans but fundamentally we have a very long way to go I mean the the bill is allocating you know something like five or ten billion dollars towards this problem\nUh whereas the White House council of economic advisors estimated the damage of the problem is five hundred billion dollars every single year so um we still have not you know put the kind of money on the table that we did for aids in which was needed to turn the AIDS epidemic around\nAnd uh it's really just going to depend on you know we have an election coming up and who comes in and whether they want to make them more substantial commitment that has been made so far\n... is not limited amounts of money going to be able to do ... would you be able to do if you had more\nIt will have things in it like the overdosed rescued drug naloxone or which doesn't remove addiction but certainly saves the person's life starts they're breathing again will be distributed to Sanford police and firefighters and families and people who use\nOpioids around the country if we'll find some training of professionals who are getting more people in the field and know how to take care\nFind some training of professionals who we get more people in the field and know how to take care of addiction\nThere's some interventions for people who are leaving correctional facility which is a very high risk time for people to do ... contrary to stereotype it's actually hard to get heroin in prison and then when you come out you haven't been taking it for a while and your tolerance is lower than are screaming at high risk of overdose there's a lot of smart things like that but you know if you really want to\nMake a difference got to make a long term commitment throughout the entire healthcare system and that would be rather than saying we're going to have a two year grant program to do now locks on or a three year funding stream for treatment of people leaving prison you would just say look addiction is part of human health it has been\nFor all of human history we need to make permanent commitment\nTo have adequate treatment for addiction adequate screening or for people when they see their GPA so that we catch a dictionary we need to permanently invest in training doctors how to handle pain properly and sometimes of course that does me prescribing opioids very often it is on\nAnd so far and few people have been willing to\nReally grasp that metal and say we need to permanently end structurally all to the U.S health care system this is not a crisis in the sense that if we just work hard on it for a couple of years it will go way addiction as a permanent feature of human condition and we need to adapt to that reality\nAnd what about the companies that make these drugs that presumably still making a lot of money\n[noise] yes I mean Purdue Pharma which is the most famous of these companies which marketed oxycontin they were fined about six hundred million dollars ten years ago for how they marketed the drive but their revenues are estimated at thirty five billion\nSo they're still doing fine and in business and selling their product and I should add by the way a now increasingly around the world not just in the United states um there are enormous lawsuits being filed all across the country by city state's counties or the federal government may get involved in that as well\nUm but none of that will touch there are these the international activities that these companies and that'll be something to watch certainly in Europe and it's really a ... as well as in
