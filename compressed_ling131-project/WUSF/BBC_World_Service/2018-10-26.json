Britain and to Moscow he may have crossed a red line triggering the nerve agent attack\nAnd that was the BBC's Richard gap and reporting\n[noise]\nAntibiotic resistance is one of the biggest threat to public health around the world is a growing number of infections are becoming harder to treat just bacteria adapt to the drugs used to treat them but a new type of antibiotic might offer some hope at school\nSo fit or a cold and it has a particularly clever way of attacking Fox professor says most of it's an expert on that project so the London School of hygiene and tropical medicine and as we've been locked in a student at welcome to the program I explain how this drug was how is it different\nOh thank you I'm happy to be here what's not new is how the drug I mean effectively kill the bacteria from inside the so what's really exciting and clever built this\nIs how they engineered the bacteria to enter the cell they really exploit an unnatural pro sets of the bacteria to import and actually it's and acts like a Trojan Horse that actively imports the drug which effectively kills it\nSo the bacteria sort of welcome the drug into ... whereabouts realizing what it is\nYeah I think it's a lot of fun because the scientists cleverly exploited and natural\nHost pathogen interaction that\nThe bacteria needs to import 'em iron in innocence for its own replication and someone's survival\nAnd with climbers this drug ... attached to free iron inside our bodies and therefore the drug imports the iron but unknowingly imports the drug at the same time and from inside the cell or the drug do the job\nBut what do you make of the trial there was a fairly small trial or have a few of them five hundred people and it was used for a year and retract infections what are the chances that it could be rolled out at some point more widely\nUh ... it's an exciting first stepped and at first step and in terms of safety it really did its job\nBefore there's still a long way to go of course we have to be responsible about this we don't really know about the durability of treatment or the long term a clinical impact so I think exciting that started with the study was performed it\nSo I think exciting that the style with the study was performed it really looks promising now we have to do more extensive test to see how long it lasts at how well it performs\nThis is the way the research is going they looking at clever ways of of getting antibiotics into the system if you like\nI think we have no choice we really neat creative ways to control the infection pro says a bacterial evolution is a very strong force\nAnd if we can exploit natural processes of our immune system\nTo engineer clever ways to deliver the drug I just think this for example this is just a great example of modern medicine and I think they should inspire other research avenues also thinking like this to exploit natural processes of the bacteria\nBut all innovations keeping up with that I see politic resistance\n[laughter] I think now that we're aware of it in ... in an antibiotic resistance is such an urgent health threat it's an exciting time as a scientist because we have studies like this really leading the way and there is an appetite for innovative therapy so I as a researcher I think it's an exciting\nTo our listeners will want to know a a a scientist swimming that ... or are we going to see even greater levels of resistance and therefore more people getting sick\nYeah it would be irresponsible for me to say the work is done there there is wages to go this is a small victory it's a clever study\nUm but there will forever be work to do and it's an ongoing battle with evolution enough results has been poured into it you think well there's never enough resources considering it just the global impact of this health threat\nI'm In ... in terms of this study we're not even sure if evolution to this new drug could one day emerging that's super important factor to consider in longer term studies of this drug maybe it's impossible to engineer resistance against it I Believe will get their\nMoney thanks for coming in that was professor ... or from the London

just rewind it story them a little bit how did he come to Britain because he was born in New York wasn't me\nYet he was born in Staten Island we think Seventeen sixty three he was a slave earned by Reverend Richard Charlton who was the Episcopal minister shot just in time Drew's on stuff that island Richmond came into English as a teenager under the patronage of El Paso usually it was an English so Joe\n... who was fighting the war at that time exactly why posse brought Richmond dive its wing ... not quite clear about it's a it's a little bit of a mystery why the Reverend Richard Charlton freed Bowe Richmond is also a bit of a mystery because he himself died not long after bill rich ones left America and the rest of his slaves\nHeed the police to somebody else he didn't for any of them\nSay why well she allowed Richmond together\nIs a little bit mysterious he with his parents that also is something that we don't know I I mean his boss is no record that in the parish registers\nI have a theory which is the dough Richmond was a mixed ethnicity and I think it's possible that maybe the Reverend Sharpton himself with somebody from his household may have been ... father and that might explain why he allowed to leave all gave him his freedom but that is only a theory\nAnd so how did he make its way when he came to brush and because it was a while before he started getting a vote in books he wasn't it\nWas I mean initially he was in the past the household up in the northeast of England and I'll pass you'll have to say was the sort of on commonly and the

know that they stayed married throughout the rest of his life started they had several children as well\nPart of the reason I always thought of cool too so we're thinking about you know the possibility that we might find his remains and I guess the attention then turns to his ... and whether there are and he's still alive\nYeah I Would absolutely love tonight so far I've tried everything I come to find somebody who's related to bill Richmond and I've drawn a blank the traces of his children\nDie ousted about Eighteen forties or fifties and so I was a public record that's possible but maybe some of them emigrated abroad so as of yet have not found a living relative a bill rich but\nIf we could find living relatives we could put some of these theories to the test in terms of his parents' age I'm trying to discover more about his genetic makeup\nTo what would you want to happen to his remains is they are found\nI Would like DNA Analysis to be done if possible my theory that I was talking about he may be related to the child and family they're all members of the Charleston family who we should maybe get solved was from in America that quite a prominent family in religious

your hand the exterior of the interior show there's nothing left\nThat can't be forensic we looked at in the future undoubtedly is what happened and how he was still able to quickly to be apprehended\nWhat I did find curious in his investigation will round this out is that apparently the packaged melts and Mr George Soros Westchester County was hand delivered I'm Wondering and I'm hoping by now there's some sort of travel record whether it's on Amtrak with us on a bus\nIf he has not traveled to New York well then who's who's co conspirator that's the fear I have now but I'm hoping it was just him\nThat's the fear I have now but I'm hoping it was just him\nThis crime is usually just the work of one person he acted in my opinion are going to be said a simple all the packages probably\nFrom the post offices within three to five miles up as residents because in some of these packages at eleven stumps on didn't they indeed and that's quite common did why is that okay what most perpetrators of these crimes do when they're going to send the bomb through the mail or anything they want to get to you know\nWe've all done at where we had the male it's like our passports of somebody or male of application well just to make sure and making the right way let me put an extra stamp on there was twenty cents to same mentality of this individual in his room

well\nIt ensures he doesn't have to go to the post office and inevitably maybe someone will remember him and of course it ensures that gets there now mail room personnel\nIf a package comes to your mail room that's over stamps and also over rats like with a lot of string and a lot of ... that's a warning put it to the side\nI Believe it might have been to New York times had a picture of one of the packages I don't recollect seeing a lot of shape but there was an over abundance of stamps and that just stood out as classic and I probably would say that every single package at the same look chew it\nIn the last week or so that have been comparisons us boat made to all the Unabomber who live close to the best part of two decades to catch right I mean now is it possible to get away with a crime like this with all the sophisticated threatens aches and technology and\nI Would dare say that probably even the Unabomber can get away with him out because she took such precaution Theodore Kaczynski was his name and he was a man of extreme intellect but also of extreme psychosis but as extreme intellect led him to not make one mistake\nAt all he was obsessed in his mission it appears that Mr say oc perhaps on the spur of the moment if you will or perhaps when last maybe two to three weeks decided to do this\nAnd then acted without the demonic tool if you will and methodical work of the Unabomber who hand car which all his packages on a leave that would enable polished\nAnd there was no friends you traced whatsoever [noise] have you traveled alone is pickup truck in the mountains and he left no trace just to say Iraq had no such resources still is angry angry individual at the world acting rationally and left a trail\nNow those a lot of talk wasn't that are over the last week in politics I talked to be honest with some Republicans saying this could be a sort of false flag operation with a Democrat simple to posting these bombs [noise] we don't know that this guy did it but what do you make of this profile\nWell first of all that kind of talk from Republicans or Democrats who said what if bin frustrations versed there's just a a responsible it is just horrible you have a potential act of terrorism and now you're going to start spreading propaganda if you will not even fake news total out garbage\nIn order to take away from the actual horror of what could have potentially happen\nWhen that happens I just have to turn it off however this gentleman apparently again I take no ugliness because I'm a Democrat or Republican or anything like that\nHe fit the
