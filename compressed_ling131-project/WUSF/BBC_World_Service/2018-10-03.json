the United states but he also travels to took you needed to go to the country led to sort out some documents for his forthcoming marriage\nWell now his fiance on friends waiting outside to see if he emerges but that's being no comment a tool from the Saudi Government well among the group outside is so to run his lecture director of an Arab language TV station\nNot none of which I didn't know\nYes we're absolutely sure because the doors that we know the eggs and Cindy ... says no one has gone out of them no one has gotten into them and in addition to take his CCTV has to be monitored and on

exact we see him every time he comes to assemble but yesterday physically he was giving a speech at the organization that Iran which is four Arab journalists and so I saw him when he was giving a speech recognition\nHer what was that the holidays that Asia and what do you think it's happened to him that often not not done or what was your model or what\nWe have no idea exactly today well known journalist and we knew some speeches that even though he loves salad the endemic jeans he had been critical of sentiments policy over the last year clean his foreign policy he said that the foreign policy harm the region but he said nothing personal against him\nHe'd been living in the U.S for the past two years\nFor that in our opinion show that there was nothing personal new legal problems between the Saudi Government\nSomebody lived there for the\nUm one has to assume that if he if he was so worried about having good on the wrong side of the Saudi regime you wouldn't have gone anywhere near the embassy but he he did go that didn't need to try and sort out some personal matters\nA lot less than the other countries do their work and what kind of check\nWouldn't say he's relationship with the government is good because these kinds of relations surveys all the time when things are good the other day there's problems but last week he went to the embassy and came out there was no issue the differences that yesterday he when he was told he had to pick up from paper like that\nThe difference is that yesterday when he was told he had to pick up from paper like that he wanted to ... getting married in Turkey and then he was stuck in the embassy before going to the end he can filter from lawyers just to check whether that would be an issue and they said they wouldn't be that way that my editor\nAnd finally as someone who knows conditions for journalists across the Arab world it is fair to say that conditions full reported in Saudi Arabia have become much more difficult recently and they were pretty difficult before now when I could\nDo and yet they can definitely say that in the past few years the median Saudi has really changed and so have the circumstances for what that is why so many journalists who used to work in Saudi has left the country they now they're either in Paris and London around Gemini just so they can do that properly which they were not able to do in\nFact what does that because of Mohammed bin ... come on how the mind\nOf course from what we see and what we see we can say that I'm ... the intelligence\nThe journalists lost most of the

chief international costs when leads to set all Smith's does that race\nHow hard it would be to make that system work\nIt is going to be hard because the role of the u._s. dollar in the national

laws but not based on the tests that change every other day\nPresident Trump had a very harsh warning anyone who doesn't isolating Iran will face extreme consequences now what about a country like Britain which one to more than anything else to maintain its trading and political relationship\nPrime minister may as well as president Macron and everybody has said that we are committed and we are committed to see that Iran enjoys the economic David Savage of the the other Europeans\nProbably made better commitments than anybody expected\nThen it was two times they those political commitments in two mechanisms and I believe those mechanisms are going to be in place now the next us\nWhich is the most difficult an important test is to see whether those recognitions work three all going to be ... or patient it doesn't mean that the patients would never run out but we all going to be a little bit more patient to see\nThere is a way out you could take President Trump's offer to have a summit

gas for years most from point for me to be ... actually the sooner the better because all of the protesters needs to remain in round\nBut still there will be a need for new supplies to work in the coming decades we're still need or the important thing for us it's that's there or that will be a part of the energy mix temperature actually the point with the law was emissions from the production\nHe's such a love story by this idea that noise production is clean but is it any cleaner than the other major well pertussis and say Saudi Arabia and all that figure similar views\nI think you can go around the globe and look for several in order for you\nAround the globe and I looked for several oil fields and find variations in rich and the average emissions from an original novel shop around nine ...\nIf you compare that to do an international level it's having the and candles production that other countries will have to ... levels deals\nVery I think you can find individual field\nBut if you look at an avalanche will also find out why and how to fight for instance just got tired of hearing how long are\nAre one hundred and fifty kill them at this one of the big as a unfair and and the world for which when from next year start producing that would be produced with practically no emissions from the production since they've is being power from a short\nAs a big

it's something we need to keep an open dialogue with the also the investor market on there for we are also explaining are investors that we are preparing for a\nFuture but actually we expect that to missions sincere to need to have a higher cost and when we are now planning for projects we are adding on more costs stretched testing fields for higher costs\nSo that we can make sure that for

green energy and yet at the same time you're a country that still making an awful lot of money exposing fulfill field doesn't not punish your environmental credentials\nNo I think that we are very aware of this or is it kind of power though so we need a strategy that has two sides to it one is that he wants to lead into use so the Syrian mission technology has it meant no we had last month for four to seven percent or electric car sales\nBut during the last ... green shipping out new things though more than ... the electorate Ferris come in and do you use you can see that in in also in other areas\nAnd at the same time they're very aware of that for the world to reach the Paris Agreement goals not only are the two degree that warming but also aimed for one put five degree you have to stop the use of fossil fuels as fast as they call\n... but it ain't no way you've got legally binding emissions reduction targets of twenty twenty fifty but the main streets Michigan I could find show that you see oh two missions which is called a key greenhouse gas still coming up slightly\nOver the last couple of years to come down slightly last month when seven percent uh last year so this is for us is to work even harder on reducing our emissions are especially if\nWork even harder on reducing our emissions are especially from transportation where we are doing a lot\nBut it's also takes time until it's really it really gives an effect but at the same time for us it's important that we know that the oil and gas industry will become a smaller part of our economy and the future so we need also\nThe bed sharing and for the movement is it is that you're going to keep on drilling and people expect the total production of oil and gas to keep rising until twenty twenty three\nAnd
