I'm a law professor at Catholic university at\nThe Columbus school of law where she teaches legal ethics and she sat down not too long ago with me and our producer Brenna feral brought us the story and under whose skin it also seems to have got yeah\nIt it just made me\nKnow whether to side with my head or my heart so to get the story started shirt Jim Tracey my name's Jim Tracy and I'm an award

thousand he's interviewed hundreds of people and I think the reason he's he's been so focused on it is that it's pretty close to home for him\nUm I live in the ... which is where the story begins so Saturday Night July twenty eighth Nineteen Seventy three for young people did Eighteen to twenty three three men in a woman's go camping in the outer on ducks pulled off the road a aside road off route thirty\nThey made up a makeshift campsite grass clearing they set up too tense and went to sleep for the night\nAnd then Sunday they you know woke up and about nine AM\nTo campers hurts somebody walking outside their their time and all of a sudden they heard the zipper on the time go up\nAnd what they saw for the middle aged men peering into the\nTent who looked like a conservation officer you had a door with a feather on sunglasses a rifle yet a butter knife binoculars around his neck and very calmly he told them almost politely to step out of their time which they did he get\nThe other campers out for them rounded up together and they were kind of standing in semi circle\nAnd then the men cocked the gun and said listen uh of killed before and I'll kill again\nI'm I'm going to take your gas I don't want to get caught someone to tell you the trees and he started marching the kids off into the woods took him into the woods near a brook in pairs of two with him behind them are the kids of course we're scared out of their webs he pulled out some real basically\nHe had he had each of them tie themselves you know as he pointed the gun Adam and then the last one he tied\nSo after we had the four people tied he went back to the first boy Eighteen year old Phillip them blue ski and because the other three kids were spread out to the foreign they couldn't really see what was happening but they could hear clearly and um they heard vomiting\nSounds [noise] and then they heard filled with voice get really high and\nThey knew something was happening something bad what's happening to him\nWhat was happening with the man stabbing dumplings gave it back and I had been five times\nAnd when this happened three of them and their panic were able to break loose and start running Nick Fury salary into his car Carol in ... he ran through the woods\n[noise] bought demand caught one of them David Freeman he took the boy back to the campsite and he had to lay down in a ditch\nNext to to kind of monitor the situation I guess so Freeman in um the killer laying in the chapter about an hour the men come men that the other two campers the ones who have gotten away had managed to alert locals new there they came with rifles and all of a sudden they spotted done a killer and Freeman\nLaying down in the debts and when they did Freeman got up and ran towards the men screaming for help saying he's got a gun is going to shoot\nAnd the man with a gun just kind of stood up\nAnd calmly Cooley walked into the forest\nAnd nuts began\nWhat was it the time the largest manhunt state history\nHere this morning at about eleven thirty you can see a state police cars parked almost as far up the road is you can see\nThe manhunt commenced on Monday morning many deputies in state police standing by it was the scene like a never been seen before or after\nToday where you are broken down our manpower into a rating for trolls\nMen armed with with all kinds of weapons rifle shotgun flood homes that are travelling trails helicopters and it's a waiting game right now by Monday or Tuesday they had two hundred men on the case waiting to flush the fugitive out of the woods\nSay eventually find the man's car and they're able to run the license plate and it comes back with an ID A thirty\nSeven year old Robert Darrow Robert Francis Carroll senior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward today he was an ex con\nSenior of Syracuse New York the fugitive police are looking forward to today he was an ex convict he'd been in prison for rape ... seven years\nNow armed with a thirty thirty rifle a knife and the story was on every TV station CBS ABC and NBC so by Tuesday night when the people got panicked when you're all are well one of\nThe doors are shorter large people loaded their rifles they lock their doors for the first time and we've noticed a lot of people leaving around here but people left the area so fast\nI don't care that last night and the day before that they left their tense up they left\nBarbecue smoldering they left behind coolers so that the man has dragged on what happened was Carol was able to use those camps and that food and those drinks to survive day after day the manhunt it's about four hundred men now\nThe police follower lead that he had stolen car and he had been cited and they they're kind of closing in on him\nAnd then they twelve Thursday August ninth Nineteen Seventy three very very hot day one of the hottest summer\nThat day a conservation officer named Taylor block spotted\nGuerra needs to freeze or drop your gun something to that effect and scare started running\nA little black fire four times got 'em in the back the arm in the\nFoot Guerra went down once got back up and kept running they end up you know chasing through the forest you know found a blood trail and just in a very short time they saw a girl and he was laying down in the mud not moving and so they thought he might be dead 'cause he was just laying there but\nThey took his paws and everything and he was certainly alive\nBut then they put 'em in an ambulance and they're rushing to the nearest hospital in Plattsburgh and according to a gym a couple of cops go with them they're really in the whole time because they think\nThat he might have been responsible for an additional murder and for a girl who has gone missing [noise] but you wouldn't talk to this point\nThat the story that I'm interested in really get started it's known as the buried bodies case ... and I think one of the things to so fascinating about this case that the law professor lethal arm and again\nThe conflict between what a good lawyer should do and what a good person should do in the situation\nAnd we are recording the guy at the center of the conflict was a man named Frank our money Frank age aren't many\nIn front of the lawyer in Syracuse and never know whether to pronounce it or money or urban that Mary Armani Frank's wife\nIn our area in some ways they use urban but it is money\nCouple of months ago pretty through time an Adler and I went up to visit them they live right outside of Syracuse New York and Germany now in his eighties he's retired [noise]\nMy name is Frank or money and I was the attorney for Robert girl\nUm where I'd I'd love to have you start wherever you like ... how did this whole story start for you well just to give a bit of background Mitch Armani told me that when he was a kid he got picked on for a couple of different reasons and he said he was always the guy that that wouldn't walk away or\nFight or I like ... flights go fight like standing up for the little guy and that's partly why he became an attorney when you were fighting a cage for who defended you're fighting this state and tear it\nAnd you're doing really well he was well respected had a good reputation but then he met Robert De Niro\nLast year strong back to take him out you need a forty five and a a juice had that feeling I mean there's this guy is dangers in love with things are going\nI mean this guy is dangers and a lot of things are going to happen\nThis is a year before the manhunt Nineteen Seventy two I'm Frank remembers he represented him at first on two pretty\nSmall things wind won a schoolteacher headed to sell to his trial he was sued the school and I talked to monitor but none of them will be actually represent mound that\nBut then pretty quickly it gets dark Garrett was charged with trying to kidnap to college kids that kids got the Mets but then\nI kept picture for\nMolesting some young girl Richards\nTwo very young girl aged ten eleven Darrell was released on bail he skipped his court date and just disappeared and then we pick up where we left off the murder the manhunt and an August ninth the night Guerra got captured Frank at the call from girls wife\nOne in one bar where one of France's bell jeez I'm lady friends was hanging out\nThere about thirty minutes don't you talk to her then he asked if he could borrow a car\nAnd then went off the back door [noise] took of\nDriving the lady friend car to try to lose the tail\nAnd so they got back on the highway and they drove through the Adirondacks until finally they get here which may be as far as\nWe can walk up to the old abandoned mine [noise]\nOut there last February with reporter\nI went out there last February\nWith reporter Lauren that chemistry and that tells you provide your of Mariah Tom's 'cause the father says it them a road that goes to the mind of their what is it fair to them on [noise] it would then sort of hilly area south inside of the road this a\nTrail of her own or you're just very icy that day this year just used to be an overall [noise]\nWe're we're walking up a very wooded hills fairly teeth are no leaves and all the trees were\nAnd I'm Sorry skeletal walking\nRight in the same area that are many and this is the only way they came in here so\nHere we are in our Sunday suits every girl tragedy choose for is looking for the case [noise]\n\nBut lovable worse look [noise]\nPhones is\nWhen you see the air shaft there they find that air shaft which is just a hole in the ground a couple of feet across that shoots up from down in the depths of the mind off the carefully let's get any such [laughter] yeah you don't want to fly down in there\nAnd so they couldn't see anything down the hall So Frank our money lay down on the ground at the edge of the mine shaft got a flashlight that he takes out and then those you know my feet and left me down in there and as Frank got lowered down into the whole\nI could see or sneak shoe a blue sneaker [noise]\nAnd a leg and I said to myself this ... does it end he yelled back up to ... get me out of your money back up that\n...\nAnd Julie ... found the other body ... body she was in a cemetery work arrowhead that he left her but our money wasn't there without the founder so what ensued\nWas a very long struggle\nWhere the lawyers tried to figure out what to do with the information about the bodies of these girls to let the other play that out what what are your options sure so option one we've got a call the police we've got to tell the prosecutor\nThese are missing kids were the only ones who know you know shouldn't we just call the police right no you can't\nYou just can't we took her to know to keep your confidences over wire under the current rules which have developed quite a bit since the time it's happened um anything that is related to the representation of a client\nIs under the confidentiality umbrella\nSo you're not supposed to tell anybody except prevent reasonably certain death or a substantial bodily harm that will be that that that can be or we'll be right so so in this situation the two girls are dead\nThen there's no future crime it's over it's done\nEven if the parents of the missing girls in question are frightened and waking up even if they have hired detectors and even if the local police are combing the woods and the taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if the if if the people\nThe taxpayers are paying for that but there's no if if if people are already dead than you do the lawyers ...\nThat's right it's a really tough job to be a defense lawyer you have a very particular part to play you you have a role in that role isn't what you think as a person is good and right and what you would do for your friend or family member in that situation what your role is\nIs to to play the part of it took them in which you're the one who stands up for the guy that everybody else hate ... even if everybody hates you even if maybe you hate yourself a little bit you have to\nDo your job in that job is to be in the role of the person\nThat fight hard as they can for their client\nThe lawyer is the agent of his client only only the agent a plant or also a citizen and a member of the ... and part of the justice system and there's a\nThere's a there's a double murder here and families seeking to find out what happened he now knows what happens right is there a ... year building on on the side of tell just tell tell\nA

I'm Robert Krulwich is radiolab and now we should get back to our story from producer Brenna feral when we left it there were where they were stuck right where they knew this thing but it was a client was very guilty of something they found the bodies of these two girls and a\nNo brainer what what's their next move wild so they decided to put the burden plea bargain to take this information to the prosecutor and say\nI have information that will help you solve some cases some cases yes and in exchange I Want you to give me a better deal for my client to\nGet Guerra into a mental hospital instead of a prison also right away they are going to use this as leverage that was the idea\nYeah you're going to give her Lulu and you're going to ...\nWell that's kinda gross you know yeah he's trying to get a better deal for this murder but I mean if you think about it from Frank perspective he's got this information\nAs a person he doesn't want to have to keep that secret so if he plea bargain then that's the way for him to get some closure for the family because he can give the information to the prosecution but he's also not selling out his client so report Jim Tracy again\nThey called a meeting with Henry McKay investigator from the state police detective located in the district attorney arm in his office and when they met Armenian bell gee search the briefcase was up to be a an investigator make sure they weren't wearing a bug\nBecause they are paranoid there's going to be a wiretap or some type sort of bug and then a Belgian present the deal he says listen I've got information on two bodies\nI Want you to agree to put my client in a mental institution instead of sending them off the president and the prosecutor apparently very quickly put two and two together and immediately thought\nAt least it told me about this penalty organized back in two thousand seven for the American bar association a big conference on professional responsibility\nAnd there were about four hundred people in the room most of them lawyers and they were there to watch on stage the featured speaker Frank our money and it was a love feast\nDoes what does what does that feel like it did you ever think you'd get to that point when you were in the midst of the hardest part\nNo never dreamed that\nAre doing Sergio was here or there was a lawyer to do to stir up\nA ... I was very good lawyer [noise]\nSharks or through art everybody\nUm and now you know over forty years later this case let's talk about and what our money and bell gee did a good body is case taught in law school across the country everybody teachers the case it's like a touchstone what people think what\nIf what if what if you will face so I went to a couple of classes I went to one legal ethics class and I also went to a criminal defense class here in New York that was being taught at Fordham just stand\nUp um I agree on his duties to his client who represents his client's best interest if you've\nBeen sitting in on these classes and and talking to law professors I think one of the reasons that that this case is taught the widely as because professors can point to that they can point to a real human being at the center of a really tough legal situation and they can say in this situation this is what a lawyer should do\nThis is what a lawyer should should be\n\nFrom from the moment I started thinking about this story I always wanted to talk to the families\nInvolved which proved really difficult I wrote letters to both families and I made a bunch of phone calls and understandably no one wanted to talk to me but eventually I did start corresponding with a family member of one of the victims\nAnd she initially didn't want to go on the record but we emailed and after a few phone calls she ended up changing her mind and decided that she did want to go on the record\nOkay All right yeah so I'm with me on the phone call would you mind I'm just telling us who you are your name and\nOkay okay I'm I'm Roberta pets and I'm Susan mother\nWho's been with the girl from Chicago She was a college student who had gone missing much you'd camping with her boyfriend and she to our money indulge you found in the mind you know as as I explained before my interest really\nIn the story um has to do with the fact that it's that that it's become I'm sort of a key part of how a lot of legal ethics classes talk about the concept of confidentiality and so I sort of wanted to just start with that idea um to ask if that's something that the u._s.\nStart with that idea um I guess that's something that you knew the uh the law schools were teaching and and if you had any dealings with also about that\nI had no idea that this was being taught in law schools and I'm pretty horrified to think that this is what is considered to be correct uh 'cause I don't think it's ethical at all and to think it's being taught is the right way to do things\nIn an ethical class is totally and comprehensible to me\nAnd the the first that you'd heard that it was being taught when I reached out to yes was yes\nYou are the only in talking to you did I Know that yes maybe they ought to think not only about the criminal who they are trying to defend but what about the victims and I think that that should at least be an equal starting their mind if not a greater consideration\nDid you did you have a feeling um the did you really weren't uh taken into consideration as as all of this was happening\nYes and only ... my husband and I when we first heard that she was missing we flew immediately and and went to the police station and uh\nWhen we were there sitting with the police men they received the policeman at the time that we were with received a phone call that Danny's\nMy daughter's boyfriend was his body was found and that's that's all we knew and we never really hadn't any updates and\nNobody told us what was going on and obviously there was no closure and it was just getting worse and worse and then the only other time we were contacted by the police was\nOr some authority I Can't even remember who\nWas um when her body my daughter's body was found like five months later and in the meantime of course we were all going crazy my my father as a matter of fact I even went so far as to contact a psychic that's how\nHow important it was and how it was our entire lives during that period and as far as visiting the lawyer which my husband did it was a totally lie\nMaybe he considered it to be ethical but what he was doing was lying to my husband and causing us more months of of horror and [laughter] and this is what is being taught and law schools\n[noise]\nSo anyway to try to be fair to everyone involved as far as I've encountered anyone a law professor of law students there um\nWhen they approach that says it's with a lot of sensitivity and they are they're struggling with the pain I think the instinct is to side with the family than to imagine what they went through but my feeling is that how could any of us possibly imagine that if we hadn't gone through it\nAnd so I guess that's why I'm hoping to talk to you to kind of um but you have a chance to communicate and all of that experience\nYeah well it's impossible to really communicate and words I made forty years later I'm Still I I ... and it's still a struggle to discuss this because\nYou don't ever go away as long as I live so\nI don't I guess\nI'm Wondering if we've been talking a lot of um substance I'm Wondering if there's any thing you would like to say about I'm Susan that that doesn't have to do with any of those that you would want people to know\nYou want to share I don't know you don't have to but [noise]\n[noise] [noise] what can I say she was she did\nWell what can I say she was she didn't receive her degree she mostly I we we didn't go and pick it up at Boston University really difficult for\nThem and Danny what's your boyfriend had is just that summer and he had a full scholarship and he graduated just before and\nSo true I and I'm sure the other two children get great future I had a true and\nIt's just a horrible tragedy\n[noise]\nSo it's horrible you know to be in a position\nTo have to live [noise] I mean how how do you really lose your your daughter you know what what excuses for protecting the person that killed her no justification you couldn't justify my mind\nI don't expect them to accept it but that's the way it is [noise]\n[laughter]\n[noise]\n\n\nUm I'm going to get just a minute of silence up here if that's okay yep [noise]\n\n\n\nHey can you hear the echoes the dog down the mountain things tend to travel up the hill it's kind of bounce around um water I think it's some deeper down in there dripping I Can't tell where stripping everything up here it's frozen solid totally sure what that is I\nThink I'm going to turn back ground [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "On Point (NPR)", "city":
