Bach which was a a hugely influential book in certain circles are published in Nineteen eighty nine we actually got interested in him or things are pretty thrilling levy because of an obsession of his which predates that sixteen I was sixteen year Nineteen sixty one\nI was taking French literature class on one day I came across this poem\nA tiny little bump it kind of sat right in the middle of the page\nLike a long stint sausage beautiful bomb [laughter]\nLike a long thin sausage or to focus on it [laughter] you know three syllables per line to super skinny and twenty eight lines long and mom and it was delightful it was very cute and funny I fell in love with a poem immediately and memorized that I still not by heart diplomas\nBasically a get well card it's written by this guy Kleiman Murrow who was opposed nearly Fifteen hundred at the court of queen\nAnd he wrote a poem for us this queens daughter she was seven or eight and she had gotten sick the flu or something and the problem we supposed to cheer her up and and I thought it was very sweet could you said in ... let's just here at first yeah okay\nIt's called a ... done with that in my lab to a sick them although so to speak it can wait they affect young lady\n... doesn't look boom through new ... ... ... ... to eat them all calculate moment of ...\nVast sea onto the taboo ... to ... to ... ... ... for ... to ... I mean young\nOh my God it must have gotten so many chicks and you're right it was really ...\nThe opposite I was I was a ... [noise]\nOkay so you read suppose founded away deep in the corner of his mind that's what about Twenty years publishers for [noise]\nThey become very popular and the publisher decided to have it translates into the number of languages including French in that process which took years it\nPut me into the frame of mind thinking what kinds of crazy things can happen when you translate crazy texts and all of a sudden one day that home\nPopped into his mind and I said there is a challenge what is that what is the challenge okay what I meant was to set ... here's the thing he said he got this palm ... done little\nBooms and if you just focus on the word basically you're the guy talking to a younger girl saying hello my dear I'm Sorry you're sick being sick like ... I ... wish you to open your door and get out into the world ... going to get out of bed eat some jam goofy\nToo so you don't look so pale out and you lose your plump shaped Eldorado or or you know sort of like get better here's your good health\n... to ... I mean young\nBut just saying those words in English\nMisses the whole spirit of the ...\nThe tone the light hearted apps and and this is key for doubt it also ... form it's wonderfully\nCatchy little south that shape when the page the fact that the lines\nRhyme you know a B. B. C. C. D. D. and uh the first line mom union is identical\nTo the last line I mean young to sort of had the feel of a ... it has the poet name in the middle of the poems in a moment of ... oh and I forgot that I'd say three syllables per lawyer didn't or three syllables per line I mean that's crucial and then also twenty eight lines long\nSo all of those things added up to a set of constraints you might say on me\nSo Doug sat down and got to work and a quickly became embroiled in the question of like how do you translate this coming along the way\nEven began to make a little grids of possibilities for different lines of the problem for example is off the onto the top ... like this line that basically says don't wallow in bed\nI had a lot of possibilities and I'll just read you the a little diagonal display here instead of\nHurting blood and bad instead of burping in your bed instead of bursting out in ... and that of lurking in Europe instead of hurtling out\nSting out in ... and that of lurking in Europe instead of hurtling out of instead of hurting their ... dead of squirming in your bed of slurping sloppy and instead of burning up in bed instead of turning blue and bad on and on\nAnd I came up with you want me to read my ... my sweet dear I send cheer all the best\nYou're forced rest is like jail so don't ale very long just get strong go outside take a ride do it quick stay not sick ban you're a ... for ... sake\nButtered bread while in bed makes a mess so unless you would choose that bad news I suggest that you'd best tuna rise so your eyes will not glaze Douglas prayed help be near my sweet dear\nSo Clay Moltz now Douglas clean all became Douglas and I I like the other ones are jammed became bread though the bread and butter butter bread yeah well I just figure jam and jelly they\nAre words but the words represent\nConcepts and the concept of a kind of a halo around them I mean when you talk about jelly your implicitly talking about bread and things that you spread it on ...\nLike just stick their fingers and jelly no bread needed OK okay fair enough\nFeeling like he hadn't quite nailed it ducked sent the plume to one of the guys that translated his first book into French yeah a guy named oddly enough Bob French\n[laughter] I said hey Bob\nCan you do it and a Bob Said well give it a try\nFerris friend let me send my embrace quit that place is dark halls and bank\nAnd soft still regain health\nBreast and fleet off with ... Clement who called for\nVery different in tone and really quite marvelous he\nGot the pill face in there you got to a gym Clements name in the middle but at the same time it didn't have the lightness the tone is much more ancient which you could argue well it's an ancient Rome but Doug said no no there's a bigger problem\nWas thirty lines long so extra long and when he ate was a sacrosanct number so that's just lines though no no no no no claim on my whole wrote a three syllable poem twenty eight lines that rhymed wonderfully and the essence of his poem was a form rather than a a\nThan a message that the message was get well\nWhich is pretty simple but Doug would argue no it was a form that's what made the things funny charming and so the question for him was who could get the feel but nails before he ended up sending the pull him out to like sixty people\nDoctoral student to my sweet I treat\nOne regard oh too hard dear colleagues friends chicken D.

one too is about how Carlin hated euphemism\nI don't like words would hide the truth I don't like words that conceal reality I don't like euphemisms as an American English is loaded with euphemisms
