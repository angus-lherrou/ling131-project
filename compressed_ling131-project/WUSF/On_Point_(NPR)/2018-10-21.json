I'm Robert Krulwich radiolab and today we have a story about what we can see and what we\nCan't end or in the spirit of the bleep which students episode or contain some graphic content I'm strong language may not be suitable for young kids but\nIt does have to have a contract because this was a story about censorship about the pressures to be due to certain oh no no don't say that we have to say that we don't we have to do and so that didn't exist throughout the show so\nAnd you're on the radio too because we would rather not bleep a show that is about bleeping so we watch what we built it on the radio yeah so she got kids with a you may want to much more or less yeah\nAnyway the story comes to us from producers Simon after George start can we started to does make sure about what the song yes please check [laughter]\n\nInto a December twenty seven a sunny Saturday morning or the this group of young middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo Alto\nThat this group of young to middle aged women gathered in downtown Palo [noise] and I was singing and swinging directly in front of the glass toward headquarters of\nFacebook and [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] it was a humble gathering is a a few dozen women and babies that\nRight there are you the organizer\nIs one of the organizers of the gathering Stephanie Miller\nAnd what what are you calling from St Louis\nNurse in has been like breastfeeding the intent was really just to be visible and be peaceful and make a quiet point\nSo Stephanie in this group of mothers they'd have photos taken up themselves occasionally breastfeeding their babies they wanted to share with their friends what was going on so they would upload those photos to Facebook in these pictures would get taken down and they would receive a warning from Facebook for\nUploading um pornographic content and people were really getting their backs up over this [noise] they want to face but to say that well nudity is not allowed breastfeeding is exempt period [laughter]\n[noise]\nNow what Stephanie couldn't have known at the time was that this small peaceful\nProtest would turn out to be this morning a face off on Facebook and one of the opening shot\nFacebook triggered or hornets in what would become a loud but to face with rockets\nAnd global bad embattled said look the bar today playing defense\nAnd now I'm not talking about all the things you recently heard about Russian interference in election meddling or data breaches but but rather something that I think is a deeper than both of them free speech\n[noise]\nViolence against roe kingdom what we can say in what we can't say that again by like ... ... what we can\nSee in what we can feed led Mueller right judge a front of me on\nThe on the Internet\nThank you Mr Chairman Mr soccer America got to\nGive you some jak laid prioritize or sensors ...\nCongresswoman or we don't ... and global for doing it in censoring speech but there are types of what\nWhat what really grabbed me was was discovering that underneath all of this is an actual rule book\nA text document that dictate what I can say on Facebook where you can say on Facebook and what all to point two billion of I can say on Facebook to digital documented it's about fifty pages if you've printed off\nAnd diet in bullet points and it's been statements it spells out sort of a First Amendment for the globe which made me wonder like what are these rules how were they written\nAnd can you even have one rule book\nRight exactly and so I I dove into this rule book and dug up some stories that really put it to the test ... so uh let's start back on that morning and two thousand in the morning that you could argue started\nIt all [laughter] [noise]\nCome in the building right behind those protesting mothers there was the Google Facebook employees sitting in a conference room trying to figure out what to do\nI'm cool so if I so I'm just going to switch and just\nSo I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm\nWhat you just read so I was able to get in touch with a couple of former Facebook employees when I'm One of whom was actually in that room at that moment\nAnd now neither these two were comfortable being identified but they did give us permission to quote them extensively so what you're going to hear here is is an actor we brought in to read quotes taken directly from interviews that we did with these two different former Facebook employees\n[noise] All right ready so at the time when I joined them there was a small group twelve of our snow sleet recent college grad who were sort of called the site integrity team again keep in mind this was in nearly\nTwo thousand seismic changes and weaken the Internet hierarchy but it was like the deep dark path life space dot com is now the most visited website in the U.S Facebook had somewhere in\nThe neighborhood of ten million users we were smaller than my space the vast majority of them college kids and so in those early days those twelve people they would they would sit around in a sort of confidence like room with a big long table each of them in front of their own computer\nAnd things would come up onto their screen flag to Facebook and on Lake\nMeaning like I use their saw something that I thought was wrong exactly like a reporting a piece of content that you think violates the community standards this is Kate ... she's a professor of law at St john's in and she spent a lot of time studying this very thing\nAnd and she says in those early days what would happen is a user would flag a piece of content and then that content along with an alert\nWould would get sent to one of those people sitting in that room it would just pop up on their screen\nMost of what you were saying with either naked people blown off heads or things that there was no clear reason\nWhy someone had reported because it was like a photo of a golden retriever and people are just annoying and Everytime something pop up onto the screen the person sitting at that computer would have to make a decision whether to leave that thing up or take it down\nAnd at the time if you didn't know what to do you turn your pod leader who was you know somebody who had been around nine months longer than you and asked what do I do with this\nAnd they would either have seen it before and explain it to you or you both wouldn't known you'd Google some things\nIt really was just kind of an ad hoc approach was there any sort of written standard or any common standard uh what kind of\nThey had a set of community standards that day at the end of the day they were just kind of that it's one page long and it was not very specific\nSorry the guidelines were really one page long there are one ...\nAnd basically all this page said was nudity is bad so it's Hitler\nAnd um if it makes me feel bad take it down\nAnd so when one of the people sitting in that room would have a breast feeding picture pop up on the screen in front of them they'd be like I I can see a female breast so I guess that's nudity and they would take it down until\nFriday's fight for the rights that Brett\nAnyway now a dozen or so people in front of their offices on a Saturday it it probably wasn't causing Facebook too much heartache but\nAccording to Stephanie me are those protesters were just a tiny fraction of a much larger online group who had organized\nIronically enough through Facebook so to coincide with the live protest it just ... you know take up a little blurb encouraging our members that were in the group to do a virtual nurse in two for one\nDay changed their profile avatar to an image of\nBreastfeeding and then change their status\nThe title of our group a Facebook benefiting it's not [noise] and it caught on social networking website it under fire for any pollinate on some of them women renovating their shelter I taught him twelve thousand members participated and the media requests started pouring in the face of the banning it now\nMedia requests started pouring in the face and it's a fascinating is now I didn't hundreds of interviews for print Chicago Tribune Miami Herald time magazine New York times Washington Post\nSo the Internet is an interesting\nDr phil [noise] it was a media storm and eventually\nPerhaps as a result of our group and our effort Facebook was forced to get much more specific about their rules so\nFor example by then nudity was already not a lot on the site but they had no definition for nudity they just said no nudity and so the site integrity team that the twelve people at the time they they realized they had to start spelling out exactly what they meant\nWell he's generally we found\nOut pretty quickly ... none of these folks are willing to talk to us about what they do\nAnd so there's a lot of renting semi happening\nLot about the good work if I can go now I don't have the money is you know I'm Sorry you work in but\nI mean like we just came out of there [noise]\nI Know your life in fact most people wouldn't even admit they worked for the company\nI Know you're lying in fact most people wouldn't even admit they worked for the company like what's a is there something wrong about being in the Lincoln NDA that they find\nWell yeah so so when I finally did find someone willing [noise] are willing to offer me do you want to be named or do you know where do you not want to be named\nI'd rather do that that's the only find you know I ... a year\nTo explain that he and all the other moderators light can were forced to sign these nondisclosure agreements stating they weren't allowed to uh admit that they worked for Facebook they're not allowed to talk about the work they do\nAttract the ACLU about ...\nMind there's several reasons one is that up until recently Facebook wanted to keep secret what these rules worst so that they couldn't be gamed or at the same time it it creates a sort of separation between these workers and the company which is your Facebook you might want\nYeah I I signed up to monitor traffic has\nJust given the nature of the job\nThat you know I really you know you don't really know the impact that African hat I yeah I tell you got your so\nThis guy I talked to he he got his first contract doing this work several years back and for the duration of it about a year could show up to his desk every morning put on his headphones\nIgnored ... he\n... I guess I just like a forty five ... every day it was just an edge session and it's just such a\nSize five thousand a day you just said yeah I was like it was a lot of case yeah he\nHe said basically he'd have to go through any image or some other piece of content every three or four seconds wow all day long all day eight hours a day [noise]\n\n... ... if I can ask ... what kind of things did you see\nThat's just like ... or it's too dangerous to extradite\nClicking through he came across unspeakable things Saddam\nHas exploded able to you know get squashed by attached to you know keep okay just ... like\n[noise] a Thirteen year old girl I was having sex with an eight year old boy and it's not just watch it over and over\nWhen did you did this like keep you up at night as you do this is\nActually about ... percent I'm actually up at night uh he'd\nCatch himself thinking about these videos and photos when he was trying to relax you had to start voting things\nThat were there were specific like it is but I Will watch it was why I like to look at like ... ...

the second one is blown off below the knee other than the femur bone sticking out and then ... skin and muscle and tendons it's it's ... ... meanwhile\nSimilar CBS studio on the other side of the country the I actually find me I remember snippets of the day\nThey spoke employees are clustering around several desk staring at the computer screens watching the news right now\nThis has occurred just in the last half hour or so I have\nMemories of of watching some of the coverage chilling new images just release of the Boston bombing I remember seeing the photo published online and it wasn't long after that\n[noise] someone had posted on Facebook from the folks I spoke to the orders events here are a little fuzzy but [noise] pretty quickly started going viral [noise]\nAnd we realized we're going to have to deal with it just images reading like wildfire across their platform is it appears to be way outside the rules they'd written by its in this totally new context\nSo they got their team together sat down in a conference room I don't know there was probably eight or ten people thinking about like should we allow it or should they take it down according to the rules are in this photo you could see you could definitely see bone\nAnd so by the rules the photo should obviously come down yep however ... says\nNo the other people are saying list as newsworthy\nEssentially there's photos being posted everywhere else it's important we need to suspend the rules we need to make an exception which immediately received\nPush back well I was saying that what we prided ourselves on with not making those calls and there are no exceptions there is either or their mistakes were improvement we made the guidelines for moments like this ... the other side shoots back oh my God are you kidding me like the Boston Globe's publishing this all over the place and we're taking a downed like are you\nKidding me damn the guidelines let's have common sense here like humans we know that this is important\nAnd yeah they're kind of their right but the reality is like if you say well we allowed it because it's newsworthy\nHow how do you answer any of the questions about any of the rest of\nThe stuff that in other words this is a Pandora's box and in fact for reasons that are totally cleared they decide to take the photo down um\nBut before they can pull the lever words start making its way up the chain and internally within Facebook according to my sources an executive ... down in order we were essentially told make the exception\n...\nI don't care what your guidelines say I don't care what the reason is the photo stance you're not taking this down\nYes so um yeah that's what happened\nThis decision means that Facebook is just become a publisher ... but they don't seem maybe they\n[noise] that Facebook has just become a publisher but they don't see maybe they have made a news judgment and just willy nilly they've become a news organization\nYeah ... and this brings up a legal question that that's at the center of of this conversation about free speech like Facebook a sort of collective scrapbook for us all or is it a public square where you should be able to say whatever you want or yeah it is it now and news organizations strengths parents\nThere let me let me get a I'm Sorry to interrupt but let me get to one final question to kind of relates to what you're talking about in terms of what exactly Facebook\nIs and this question has been popping up a lot recently in fact it even came up this past April when soccer bird was testifying in front of Congress\nTo think about a hundred and forty million Americans get their news from Facebook so which are you are you a tech company or use the world's largest publisher\nCenter this is a I view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do is build technology and I said you're responsible for your conscience which kind of a publisher right\nWell I agree that we're responsible for the content but I don't think that that is incompatible with fundamental yet at our core being a technology company where the main thing that we do is have engineers and build product\nBasically sucker burg and others that the company arguing no they're not a news organization why what would be the downside of the\nWell Facebook currently sits on this little idyllic legal island where uh they can't be held liable for much of anything they're subjected to a few regulations however where were they to be seen in the eyes of the court as a media organization\nThat could change but setting that aside what what what really strikes me about all this is if you're you have a company that really\nUh up until this point has has been crafting a set of rules that are both as objective as possible\nAnd can be executed as consistently as possible but if you if you ask me that there's nothing more a subjective or geographically bound than what people find interesting or important what what people find newsworthy he'll give and I'll give you know give you a great example of this\nOr that happened just six months after the Boston Marathon bombing when this video starts being circulated out of northern Mexico and it's a video of a of a woman being grabbed and forced onto her knees in front of a camera\nAnd then a man with his face covered grabs her head pulled her head back and slice of her head off right in front of the camera and this video starts being spread\nI Can't count how many times they just reading my Twitter feed had been like you know like\nOne person who came across this video or at least dozens of others like it was Shannon young\nMy name is Shannon young I Am a freelance radio reporter I've been living here in Mexico for for many years
