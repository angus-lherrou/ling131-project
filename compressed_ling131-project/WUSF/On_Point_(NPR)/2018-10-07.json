Barton Robert Krulwich radiolab but today to\n[noise] we're going to start\nThis show with a with a fellow named Ben Montgomery a reporter for the Tampa Bay times we've had on the show before Ben say something\nHi [laughter] okay good good All right\nWhere we just want to know from you like what are you guys doing how you doing it what are you thinking I'll start at the beginning Yeh started thinking you know what you're doing so after the Mike Brown shooting in Ferguson and\nThere is growing outrage tonight after an unarmed African American teenager was shot in ... when I became a national\nThere was a lot of ... and pressed\nHow many people do is be killed in the United states about why the police each year ... districts there's currently no national statistics on police shootings law enforcement officer involved shootings and it struck me at the time that like ... what we react to is all anecdotal you know once in a while one of these things will\nTime that like ... what we react to is all anecdotal once in a while one of these things will catch fire and we're right Asian Harris than about John are able to come sort of a national story and I personally was having trouble and processing that like the number one\nIs there a is a trend in one way or the other our police shooting more black people and white people just very simply\nYou know the problem is we don't know we have no idea because nobody's track these FBI doesn't state agencies don't for the most part I said that that that doesn't exist somewhere when the police for itself in the police department it does on the local level however uh it doesn't exist in any accurate way\nUp by a broader agency and I could tell you how many purse snatching there were in Florida in two thousand eleven using the FBI numbers or the numbers committed for department of law enforcement but I Can't tell you how many times police shot somebody\nNow there have been a couple of organizations that have tried to keep track nationally but everything that's done so far is incomplete you know 'cause most of those you know like the guardian had an online database\nMost of them rely on media reports that the only really keeping track of the one that sort of hit the public\nConsciousness that is right to ban in his editors thought let's do something that's more complete let's do something that's unprecedented\nSo burst study had Florida a third biggest state demographics are pretty similar to the rest of the country and Florida has wonderful public records loss and legally it's easier to get information in Florida than in a lot of other places ... invent that down thirty emailing\nEvery single police precinct in the entire state of Florida\nAnd three hundred and eighty eight emails asking for five\nYears worthless paper any paper generated when an officer fired\nA firearm and someone was injured or killed as a result of that shooting now this involves a year of work county police department is getting lawyers involved as as a massive thing they're both probably no less than a hundred people but eventually [noise]\nThing than men put together the most comprehensive police shooting database that we know of flu show that\nFor a while back we send our producer met guilty down to the Tampa Bay times always with them right here to check it out yeah\nHow many how many documents you think you have sitting on the stuff probably five thousand pages so I have a stack of paper that's I'm about as tall as me ... six feet tall we've got um broken down\nBy county but you can see a show a or B county ... Boynton Beach uh all the way through the alphabet\nAnd you basically just have a all these uh manila folders with tons of papers in them spread across the entire desk\nAnd the combination of a use of force reports civil court records and media clippings represent a eight hundred and thirty one shootings\nI Hope every shooting and the state of Florida in ... in six years time two thousand nine to two dozen fourteen [noise]\nSo we did was go through all of this material scraped each of those reports for every bit of information that we could yet that we thought it was useful um circumstantial stuff that involve a SWAT Team\nDidn't involve a an arm stuff's packed wizard chase all the demographic information for the the firing officer officers and the people were hit by those poets than we thought looked like learn from these let's see how how we can compile\nThe data and build a database and um [noise] you know hopefully draw some conclusions lessens some solutions\nDidn't all went into an online database to Tampa Bay times website you can check it out there are lots of link to it from my website radiolab dot org highly recommend hopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day\nHopefully other organizations and other states will start to do the same perhaps even one day we'll have a national agency to keep track of the stuff in any case in the meantime you some of the things have been found and initially some of it from you know kind of surprised us\nWell the biggest some sort of counterintuitive a line and this is the the numbers are flat [noise]\nHe said if you look at the numbers what you see year after year after year the numbers of states that have about a hundred thirty people shot by police every year\nWhich seems odd because uh you know the past couple of years these videos go viral and a ...\nMakes it seem like this is a a new and intense problem the numbers show that that doesn't seem to be the case we also broke these down into category and you said you know what you see like in the most basic level\nAre are that about a third of the police shooting cases involve someone on the other side who is called mentally unstable\nAnd this is a case we're not taking a gas that whether the person is mentally unstable these are cases in which there is some evidence in the report that the person has been diagnosed mentally ill\nMaybe off their meds anytime of the shooting and in that category been says they found a surprising number of cases they hold suicide by cop which is where somebody who's usually are mentally ill apparently trying to get themselves shot intentionally\nPerson is in view of the police standing on a porch any by the screen door and raised as a weapon toward a the police either a weapon or or what they want the police to think as a weapon\nSo it's called I'm going to kill myself but I'm going to make you do it to me right and that's considered a suicide attempt because they know they're going to get shot it's an attempt to shoot I thought so this is something that people who cover police apparently know quite well you know\nThey're the news briefs that you see once or twice a week\nBut it was new to us I mean clearly police are now like the de facto front line in dealing with mental illness in this country but when it got to bend central question what do the numbers say about race I think I Would start with the fact that I'm there I'm not sure it was so surprising\nThat a forty percent of people shot by police are black\nAnd that is a data out of whack with uh the Florida a demographics\nAnd your what is a good percentage of African Americans in Florida it's not forty percent\nIt's more like Seventeen that's right which means ultimately that if you're a black person in Florida you are four times as likely to be shot by police than if you're white\nSouthern tell us much right now but the breakdown between the ... for the same demographics and its without they're going through this particular set of numbers fifty point nine percent were carrying a firearm nine percent had a blade or Seventy percent involve some form of resisting arrest\nYou know and we talk on the numerous times over two years you know drilling down on those numbers and as we were doing that fifty point nine percent you know it's weird I started to feel like you know I'm really glad that we have these numbers finally that in itself\nIs a good thing but some further down Ninety One of the five Seventy or sixty and numbers themselves don't really get you very far and ... percent six ... ISIS one percent or more years just like yeah this is\nOnly one ultimately limited way of knowing the proper\nYeah you ... I mean [noise] I mean what's what gets me is like the I don't\nKnow it's back to where we were in why we want to start this methane gas was until just moved by the single case the individual cases and it's hard to remember that each of these is [noise]\nI mean they're all written in this ah supplement investigations revealed that a a speedy officer Matthew Fowler received a call ... to Cato Darryl police speak Fowler approach department to fifty five inch confounded by white male later identified as Anthony Skiles\nArmed with a knife in apartment to fight every one of these every report is at least one human life someone was either you know [noise] more often than not gravely injured or killed\nSomething was either you know more often than not gravely injured or killed [noise]\nUh so we have on this table the investigation the death [noise]\nOr severe injury of eight hundred and thirty one people too\nSo we decided to do in collaboration with the Tampa Bay times as we grabbed a couple of soldiers right off the Montgomery giant boulders to act to follow wherever those stories might leak\nMac guilty and Ben traveled around Florida and a few different occasions talking to the people behind those statistics you heard and today we're going to bring you one of those stories and if you're interested after this up so you can head to our website radiolab dot org\nFind them into the club that nobody really wants to be\nOut that family more than just\n\nAfter the event ended up the community center crystal took a bunch of the mom built on their cars and drove over to this like little gem shops\nLike you guys do this after every every event or you know for no just wanted to know them was there and has been telling everyone about them\nIs the energy to her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nAbout ... to her son Andrew died in twenty four team\nSo no we didn't know anything about this but figured it must be part of the different types of learning part of hoping remind me right now we're all just simply trying to find a way 'cause their personal\nGathered like probably Fifteen of us into this tiny little store because she wanted to show these women like here's how I Hope or here's how I deal with my grief you can either get the um the largest age at the Quakers was talking to these two women and she had this big bundle of stage in her hand okay yeah 'cause like if you want to do like your house like a\nLike a like somebody\nThat I open my windows and I don't really I go through my house she took the stage comes her down you know I'm just [noise]\nAnd then they went from the gym shop over the course or how [noise]\nMid sized one story house into it and and a lot of women hung out in the living room or drinking juice talking to bend about his story crystal and her cousin\nWhere the kitchen\nCooking chicken\n\nAnd one thing that caught me by surprise is how these women when they come together like they bring with them or their own stories these stories of grief of suffering and yet when they're in the same room together it's like they just they just have fun\n\nAnd the night before they'd all gone out dancing together in\nThe summer when a fire [noise]\n\nAnd now what we're doing that I'm getting motel rooms again this is talk of Clinton's we start to stay over ... which means in each other head on each of couch you know a metric as it becomes like a huge sleep over\nAnd reversal of policy for up talking you know getting to know each other you know tell me why they chose results like therapy for us\nTo just let me ask but there was this moment when it's spent the day with these women that really stuck\nWith me to believe or add I'm Marlon problems to\nWin crystal let some of its over to the site where uh her ex husband Marlon was hit by that squad cars\nAbout twelve people out and about eight of them were women who had lost either a husband or brother or a child and we're basically just in someone's backyard just walking through the patchy brash\nDo we usually the video that we\nMy house probably over like right now and then the police car that taint behind them was probably right here and then the officer they hit their head um came in\nWe came in he came right here\n[noise]\nAnd that's why we called extradition and the vegetables are close to the guard and once they invested\nAnd all that\nBut I I Am then 'cause I'm when a when you know when they took him away and released and sit down and take and stuff we came back here it's all you can smell what's going on\nAnd so now like when you have any like it's it's not it's not as bad now but just the association for when I'm quite onions you get that smell like it just you know slap them in terms of any brings you right back here mhm yup [noise] and\nThe twelve is just kind of stood there for a minute\n[noise]\n\nSometimes resorting ... somebody\n[noise]\nSometimes we started ... some of the other one that started to cry\n\nAnd then you don't want me to uh take some yeah my find the best about what about on the me\nA couple of women had to be their phone my\n\nProbably about these eight women who huddled together and they just stared at the camera\nWith this sort of straight face a three to one\nThree two one [noise]\nWe all started walking back to the cars [noise]\nFirst of all I just want to thank you for just sharing with us from and you know [noise]\nYeah we haven't been I have\nIt was sort of very faint we saw that last week\nAnd I was like in the morning [noise]\nWhat I remember being like to tell you all the time how do you live so far away from him\nOh my gosh that was that was [noise]\nOf every time I visit\nHome I have to go there all the time of horror\nYeah know floors how could you not\nAnd then I Know what you like you want to go take a chair uh-huh said fair yeah and it's crazy because like if a if a cemetery like a little bit further out mhm and his credit you can do about is like a certain time every day and it's been a little white\nMan we share everything like that on like literally I think he does he like go have lunch every day\nI don't know if you're in a way of going on in all of that is a little white guy that always did not know\nHe take his chair I Can't I Would they would come with among [noise]\n\n[noise]\n\n[noise] so the trick to Florida was almost about a year ago and it felt like I happen to be there at the really interesting moment because just a few months after that trip [noise]\nOr you can either repeal with some other Sandra Bland when she spoke at the Democratic national convention one years old\nChewed on stage with Michael Brown's mother Eric Garner's mother\nI watched as my daughter was lower than to the ...\nAnd it was rather tempted a few of these women started call themselves the mothers the ...\nSome of them showed up at the women's march in DC [noise]\n\n\nAnd it was weird because in the short amount of time [noise]\nThis thing that we stumbled into this thing that really kind of felt like at the kind of support group and suddenly become a for it uh\n\nUh [noise]\nComing up again a cop with a gun a man with a knife\nAnd a look at the razor thin life or death moment between them\n\nSo stay with us oh Mm\n[noise]\n\nThis is Christopher calling from South Florida radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred P Sloan Foundation and hence the

just drop the knife and walk to me why did you keep coming at me you\nWere lucky you didn't just shot I wanted to show your best shot and I say that you want to die I Want you want a guy you can die\nHe told the officer was of Jesus Christ and I want everybody to know the police boats can't kill\nTheir fan of our parents really want to\nBe to pick 'em up walk him over to the squad car [noise] put 'em in [noise]\nAnd the un huh\nSo this is the thing that you guys will use this video for what it is one of a multitude of videos that we show officers when the correct way to do things\nYou know and and that's the points we at home or the officers used time in distance to their advantage they didn't pull right up and the the guy leans unicorn judge that women you know you have to resort to deadly force right away they use verbal commands first worn and let them know what's going on\nA trigger control was another thing you know what that ...\nAnd it's important to their guys partner was holding a gun and have you heard that hot you might have different mentally reacted thinking of the gunshots fired his gun\nSo you know he's deploying the taser and communication is key communication with the person you're trying to arrest and communication with your fellow officers those are the things that we drive home and again there was no doubt in my mind that they one officer in particular new that individual from prior contact\nRead them and it's interesting to hear him say the name Derek right like Derek is Derek and Derek isn't just a black man shirtless with a knife in his hand when there is no connection there\nThere's a lot easier to see somebody whose name was and faceless and I got scared and they shot him but because of that knowing that officer because of that in established some kind of a report that made the officer think\nOf how he's going to deal with this thing\nTo\nActually after he finished watching a video and I was packing up ... told me that just a couple of months after that incident\nMight get through the neighborhood as you mentioned on the front step ... what are you doing man that dared does stupid son of a bitch you and how close came to be in that wouldn't be backwards medication I wasn't doing drugs and he was is completely as normal as me and you are right now\nTo now again uh almost kind of like when I was with these women it felt

her which decreased executive research forum\nBig coalition appreciate a and a twenty six team put out what they called her thirty guiding principles for these forests and the number one principle rather than being some beans law and order law and order is the sanctity\nOf human life [noise]\nJust a month after ... put out those principles to the biggest\nYou know just a month after ... put out those principles to the biggest pleasing organizations in the world the eyes he peed International Association of chiefs of police\nAnd the fraternal order of police the big ... in both came out against these guiding principles basically saying that being the top is a dangerous job in some of these principles make it more dangerous\nAnd then just like eight months later so I'm the icy pie and the fraternal order of police started to adopt some of these principles publicly despite that there still is a bit of a divide between the organizations but according to Ben\nFor the very first time I think you're seeing these massive conversations and police weren't talking about this two or three years ago\nHuh I don't know man and just thinking about this like you've got these women who have ... have become kind of a political force you have also this growing movement of cops who are possibly changing the way police things done in America or at least maybe slowly right but cumulatively it does\nI hesitate to use this word but it does make just feel like reason for hope right and I sort of felt the same way\nToo but [noise] there was his experience than I had ... ... how far
