[noise] we went through a rally in return or ... or ... or for trial and it was almost like a trip to grow all [noise] um [noise] it was just absolutely wonderful uh\nThe or ... years was Schumer's is a this is a ... he's a former you're a sharp roost a driver or [noise] um\nOther than er he's still a Steve we're just starting or before it gets you a question because I Do I Do want to hear your question but since you said you went to the Richmond, Kentucky rally or with the president\nThis weekend um and he said it was wonderful I'm just wondering when the president says things that are demonstrably untrue um you know when he basically says the Democrats want open borders to flood the country with criminals you heard that clip earlier her ... they don't know I don't think any Democrat who advocated open borders to flood the country with criminal\nOh yes well you know so you're totally wrong\nTo flood the country with to to flood the country with criminals\nYeah that's correct and my Thirteen run out of control\nYes for the ... well I guess what I'm Wondering a Steve is that that the president's asserting that the Democrats won commercials that come into the country no Democrat has ever said that so I'm just wondering when he says things that are that are untrue does that does that trouble you at all\nBut a lot of thought on true it was a bribe for current\nOkay uh and so then you're the question that your your\nYour your sadly wrong\nOr I don't think I've heard a single Democrat say they want to welcome criminals into the country but but you ... the question that you that you had for for for a panel\nKind of a moot point really um\nKind of a moot point really a question I heard was due to think that a President Trump will go\nEasy one day and somebody from ... in front of the bill one or think she'll go outside to go on for a record for [noise]\nOkay well Steve thank you so much for your call a necessarily been David let me turn to you first let's just take us Steve question there about a a a questions about the future of General Mattis as secretary of defense their early ... what do we know\nWhat I was raised because during the sixty minutes interview the president said something about mad as being sort of something like sort of a Democrat or something like that which clearly he did not intend to praise and it probably was suggesting that I'd I'm mad as has somewhat more [noise]\nYou know perhaps dovish views for lack of a better term and the president doesn't certain things and that raised a lot of questions about whether or not\nA matter of who's going to stay that long after the midterms bedrooms are traditionally of time with a lot of cabinet members may leave and perhaps Madison's on that list\nUm I think it's a little early to know where he would go for replacement I mean there's generally you go into the military community or to a former lawmaker but there is some precedent for going to the corporate world I think it's early to say but I think uh it was the first time at least that I knew of that are there had been not clear of a signal from the White House\nBut the possibility that Madison might not be around for that much longer was in the air\nOkay Ayesha Rascoe I had asked the caller about ... what he thought of\nA ... when the president says things that are are untrue and obviously he took exception to that but I the reason why I had asked that is because at the Israelis the the president does say things that that we can prove are are they have no\nNo and no evidence behind them and I ... I guess I was just wondering how much that has an impact on on people who\nAre are going to these rallies how much impact that might have on potential swing voters we heard at least with the with our caller that it makes no difference to him whatsoever because he doesn't think any of it is untrue and I just want to know your response\nTo that for people at those rallies and and I've been to a few rallies I I was at a rally in Iowa at\nWeek I think our time runs together with a with a with a President Trump but the people at these rallies at they were so energize\nThey were amped up they are you know they are true believers\nSo I I don't know whether they take everything that Trump says that the literal truth or they know they say that maybe he's joking sometimes but they they are his fans regardless he does say things like he'll say there are thousands of people\nOutside and that that that clearly won't be true waiting for his rally they're they're not thousands of people outside but he says these things\nBut I don't know that at this point whether it makes much of a difference to the people that support him that like ... ah that are entertained by the things that he says and that that the the court things that he says resonates with them for swing voters\nIf you are skeptical of President Trump then these things being point pointed out or make you may make you questioned him even more but but you kind of have to start from a place of if you're already questioning President Trump\nRight So Adam Smith the that same question to you as as Asia that it seems as if it's the the swing voters who could be a influence or or push either way of based on what the president says ... things that are that are both true and and don't have any basis in fact\nIf anybody can find the swing voters I'm struggling to find them everybody's so dug in on both sides but I Will say you know sometimes I think the media and the pundit tree of culture\nSometimes I think the media and the pundit tree of culture take some of the things that Trump says when he's being a little tongue in cheek we send it sometimes take it too seriously no he's not literally in love with the leader of North Korea\nOr no he doesn't literally think Elizabeth Warren is Pocahontas but there are things that uh that that the crowds and they are just an enormous crowds uh don't quite take literally like we do now that isn't\nIt had our caller who said that everything the president said was true and yes and push back on me several times\nAnd if he can my email is a Smith and Tampa Bay dot com if he can email me the name of a single Democrat that said he wants to open borders some more criminals can come in you know I Will happily eat my reporter's notebook [laughter] barbecue on the ... I mean just to jump in the Amazon had enough time I mean it may be\nThat he wasn't saying that Democrats are declaring that they're in favor of criminals coming in and said that the impact of everything that they want to do I mean that's sort of how I took when he was trying to say but\nTo me the color you are really exemplified the extent to which were in this country in a very much an us versus them situation and the people who are motivated seems to me ah as much or more by hatred sometimes with the other side as belief in their own side it's one reason I think that as we approach the election\nUh there's more energy from the Republicans because the prospect of democratic takeover pointing to people like\nNot only Nancy Pelosi but even Hillary Clinton as a villain who could be empowered if the election goes the wrong way and it's a very resonant with a lot of people and it's I think we're seeing one reason for the energy on on both sides really this absolute a disc taste and dislike an version to people on the other side of the political debate\nMm well let's go to David who's calling from Oklahoma City Oklahoma you're on the air David\nA magnet panel I I was watching the sixty minutes interview and I was absolutely astonished that Trump's projection of the streets and the viciousness\nUh putting that on the Democrats um which is something we typically does or just sort of you know smoke and mirrors everything I mean if you look at the Capitol hearings as an example first talk address this is supposed to be impartial he does Fox News interviews he brings Hillary Clinton up in his opening statement\nA for a doctor or drop apologizes for Kavanaugh in history but I'm not a word about Dr Ford\nWe look at the weather with Julie Marquez of spectrum ... said going to be pretty hot today ten percent chance of rain and high of tiny to this is W.

I don't want to overstate the mouth of of actual military contracts that the U.S\nHas with Saudi Arabia and he also talked about the ... Saudi Arabia kind of just easily going to China or Russia to buy military equipment but they've already invested\nAnd US military equipment so it would be difficult for them they can't just switch over I and go get Russian a Russian equipment or Chinese equipment so this idea that it would be a easy for them to just switch it is not necessarily true but\n... is kind of making this point that he doesn't want is drawing the line in the sand that he wants to leave arms deals on the table with Saudi Arabia\nThat could set up a a kind of a standoff with Congress because you have law makers who are calling for a hot to uh arms sales of Saudi Arabia and if they decide if you have\n[noise] this is W.

S. project to spread democracy persisted for so long because\nI mean we can we went through some of the examples but it wasn't on impeachable a part of U.S foreign policy for so long you couldn't even question this as one of the duty that America had to the world being as guiding light for democracy\nAh but you said that there is an entrenched foreign policy elite that helps\nA that idea that notion persist across administration who are they who is this foreign policy elite you're talking about\nA it's a a broad a group of set of people are I Would say you know when a Ben Rhodes the former national security advisor referred to the foreign policy blob\nIn Washington that's essentially who I'm Talking about but we're talking about the formal institutions of government the parts of the actual government bureaucracy to Defense Department intelligence services State Department so they're part of it\nThis whole sort of think tank world the PIN number of supporting institutions in Washington that right in comment on foreign issues on a pretty much a daily basis then of course we have very special interest groups in lobbies on a whole series of issues from arms control to human rights to ethnic lobbies to the business community\nAs well I Would put in parts of the media who writes about foreign affairs and of course people like me in academia who are also actively engaged in writing who train students and often go to Washington\nTo work so that's who I'm Talking about um and what's striking to me about most of that group not every single member of it but most of that group is the remarkable consensus behind what I've called the ... this idea that the United states first of all have to exercise global leadership in every corner of the world\nAnd second it has to do that and the pursuit of the spreading of these various liberal ideals and there's a whole I could talk about the different sort of sacred cows within their but there is remarkable consensus across party lines in ...\nWithin their but there is remarkable consensus across party lines in favor of that you see this and the fact that most Democrats supported the Iraq War back in two thousand three um you see that in the fact that people tend to circulate amongst different think tanks without much a difference because they're all kind of interchangeable or to some degree\nAnd finally I think you see that in fact that the various quotation soup and uh playing here from Republicans and Democrats alike all subscribe to the same set of ideals but\nAs I Want to get to him in in a second about how you if you see this foreign policy elite is on accountable but Iraq is it the disaster of Iraq or it isn't it's an interesting moment to discuss here because I Want to dive into that a little bit\n'cause you know you said that the majority of Democrats supported the Iraq War but I wasn't that in part because it was also sold to the American people and it's a war for the security of national security of the United states I mean that's part of what you say here that the foreign policy elite as\nFrequently are collected issues of security in order to uh to get people on board with this idea of spreading democracy I mean isn't Iraq with a perfect example of that\nUm I I think it ... it shows you how easy it is to steer 'em a stir the debate and one of the points I make in the book is that the foreign policy elite out especially presidents in the executive branch have all sorts of advantages in selling policies to the world\nUm and I point out that there's actually a pretty significant gap between what the American people actually said they want they want a more restrained foreign policy they don't want to engage in all these crusades around the world [noise]\nSo how do you convince them to go a long\nWhile you do the things that the Bush administration did but again it's not unique to the Bush administration you inflate threats\n[noise] support for on point comes from Charles River apparel making the New England or rain jacket since Nineteen eighty three committed to designing a pound to prepare folks for whatever the day has in store\nThen you phone collection is on view at Charles River apparel dot com and told me advice or a matching homeowners with home improvement professionals for a variety of home projects from minor repairs to major remodeled homeowners can read reviews of local pros and book appointments online at home and visor dot com [noise]\n\nThis point I'm making a trucker body we're speaking today with Stephen Walt his new book is the hell of good intentions America's foreign policy elite and the decline of us primacy a and professor Walt lots of comments coming you let me just read a couple of them to you on Twitter pole moves or us is saying\nQuestioned the premise that the u._s. was ever really on a humanitarian intervention military or otherwise\nI said Noam Chomsky debunked is and Walt should counters arguments are limits of allowable debate are showing\nA David Crandall says liberal Gemini missing from our discussion is the counter effect that liberal values of human rights et cetera have been used as a stalking horse for American corporate a Gemini which is a highly questionable democratizing influence uh just your thoughts on on those two comments first of all Stephen Walt\nI'm I'm sort of sympathetic to both comments I've never thought that American foreign policy was heavily driven I Want to be very careful they're heavily driven by corporate interests in this sort of narrow sense yes the United states has favor to ah you know globalized economy and that's good for some corporations not all\nOf them and in some cases there have been corporations that had particular influence over U.S foreign policy but I don't think that's what we do we do a lot of things that actually\nDon't benefit corporations at all go back to the Nineteen nineties for example a Dick Cheney when he was running Halliburton used to complain about our sanctions happy foreign policy because it was making it impossible for Halliburton in oil services corporation to do business with Iraq or to do business with Iran\nCheney wanted to make money but our foreign policy was one of sanctioning both\nOf them and then that very same person if ... during the Iraq War and Halliburton got to go in and uh you know and have billions of dollars of us contracts\nThat's right and then finally uh I I think the United states does not devote a lot of effort to a purely humanitarian intervention it's hard to get the United states to do something\nPurely to help other people I'm not talking about rescue missions and things things like that\nUm but I Do think that motivation has been there a that has ... has driven certainly the intervention in Libya was I think driven in good part by the desire to prevent what people suspected would be if not a genocide at least mass killings in Benghazi and the desire to end now\nAt that point then uh the sort of desire also to try and do regime change took over and what had originally been justified by purely humanitarian concerns and approved\nOnly been justified by purely humanitarian concerns and approved by the U.N Security Council on that basis became something bigger yeah but\nSo I'm just a follow up on this idea of a corporate interests when we're talking about the foreign policy elite in Washington now are just some of those corporations the funding sources for many of the think tank we were just talking about in the previous segment\nYeah there's no question and and if you look I think at the role of\nOf the military what do you know Eisenhower recalls the military industrial complex they are very actively involved in funding a variety of think tanks organizations who not not surprisingly then want the United states to have an ambitious foreign policy and a very strong military because that's where they make the money [noise] alright\nWell lots of college just let's get a couple of them in here Mitch is calling from coming Georgia you're on the image\nHi thanks so much for taking my call 'em you know I I just think are under under current president um who is\nAn amoral agent uh mostly concerned what well I worry that are American values are going to be malleable or that they might even be for sale I think the current controversy around Saudi Arabia and uh the\nUh journalists a highlight this conflict of interest and I just want to know your thoughts are our our values for sale\nMitch thank you for your call even want to do well in some respects I think ah our values have always been to some degree for sale or there have always been a a sense of trade offs that there were set of ideals that the United states has stood for and learned to promote in the world and there were other imperatives as well with our national security or others\nAre and we have always sort of wrestled with which of these uh to favor and most of the time it's your national security and economic prosperity that tends to win out\nOf most of the time we are seeing a particularly stark\nA vision of that right now with the controversy over the possible murder of a the Saudi journalist can show you are in Istanbul and it's interesting to see that that you know for example there's this supposedly this big conference in Saudi Arabia or next week and a bunch of corporate sponsors and other participants have been pulling out of its\nPresident Trump has been waffling it seems to me on this one uh that his initial statements were were quite forgiving he seems to be you know in typical Trump Ian fashion\nKicking up sort of squid ink cloud of distortion about it\nUm [noise] it's I think you know the the concern the caller has is exactly right here and at ... I think one of the larger issues with President Trump is his inability to separate out some of his own personal interest and possibly personal financial interest from the broader interest of the country\nWill so let's talk more about the Trump Administration now because the you open your book saying that um then candidate Donald Trump had a clear articulation of his view of these foreign policy failures that we've been talking about throughout this hour Stephen Walt so so let's just remind folks what what the president the then candidate Trump said when he critiqued\nThe status quo of U.S foreign policy here he is on the campaign trail from April twenty sixteen\nUnfortunately after the cold or a foreign policy veered badly of course we failed to develop a new vision for a new time in fact as time went on our foreign policy began to make less and less sense the logic was replaced with foolishness\nAnd arrogance what'd you lead to one foreign policy disaster after another they just kept coming and coming\nThat's Donald Trump on April to thousands sixteen now Stephen while we could talk a lot about the foreign policy decisions that President has made since then I mean about the Paris climate accord about or his or just discussions with North Korea about the\n\nOn how strong has plenty to say about the politics and we're America might be headed will he tried to turn your politics and policy that's our next president\nFrom the old you AMU and NPR in Washington DC is one [noise]\nHi there I'm Joshua Johnson today on on a fully auto Castro some consider him a twenty twenty presidential contender he's a former Obama Cabinet secretary former mayor of San Antonio and a regular on the Democratic speaking ... we'll get to know who we are on ... heads [noise]\nAlso the latest ... to Saudi American journalist she's reporting may have gotten into\nThis morning President Trump tweeted the Saudi Arabia's king denied knowing anything about the she'll be seen how does a close and complicated us Saudi relationship\nWith the search for answers we love to hear from you comment on our Facebook page or tweet us at one end [noise]\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Lakshmi Singh a joint Turkish in Saudi investigative team is searching the Saudi conflict in Istanbul, Turkey nearly two weeks after journalist ... entered the building and apparently never came out he is feared dead\nAnd mystery surrounding ... whose columns have been critical of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman puts the Trump Administration in a highly sensitive diplomatic position with the U.S ally in the middle east and peers Michel ... element is traveling with secretary of state Mike Pompeo who is on his way to Saudi Arabia this hour to meet with the crown prince his father Washington\nPost columnist your mouth is Yogi was last seen entering the Saudi constantly ... earlier this month President Trump says on Twitter that the Saudi king denied any knowledge of what happened to show the Trump said he spoke by phone with gangs all non ended sending his secretary of state Mike Pompeo to Riyadh\nTrump that the Saudis are working closely with turkey to find an answer Turkish authorities have said they believe the Saudis lord to show it to the ... and killed him there and\nThe cases draining us relations with Saudi Arabia the trumpet made clear he doesn't want to disrupt lucrative arms deal Michele ...

A. M. U. dot org let's talk a little bit about your record at HUD be Sean Clark wrote on our website the one eight dot org watching one said holy on Castro actually did while at HUD how did he distinguish himself\nNow thanks for the question we had the most groundbreaking progress when it came to fair housing during my tenure at hug you know for years decades of\nHad different democratic administrations have been trying to get done something called the affirmatively furthering fair housing rule essentially this was part of the Nineteen sixty eight fair housing act um that said the secretary of HUD had the obligation to affirmatively further fair housing the problem was that that had never been put into a rule\nOn so in twenty Fifteen we actually came out with this rule which put teeth into the fair housing act by requiring cities that got\nA hug money basically taxpayer money to get more serious about ensuring the heads equal housing opportunity in their community and I'm\nVery proud of it ah unfortunately that's one of the things that's been rolled back uh through a secretary Carson in the Trump Administration a second thing that we did that I was just fantastic for the folks who are able to benefit from it was something called connect home um\nThe vast majority of people living in public housing don't have access to the Internet at home and we know that you're having Internet access at home today is not a luxury anymore it's a necessity\nFolks that are trying to look for a job kids that are trying to do homework and so on and so we actually created a a\nA public private partnership with Internet service providers housing authorities nonprofits to expand to extend broadband access to families living in public housing\nDean tweeted as past secretary of HUD what do you feel is the best way forward for affordable housing and how is hug doing on this now\nWell I Wish I could say have more confidence in the direction of HUD right now um I think what you have over there is a whole bunch of 'em\nI think what you have over there is a whole bunch of\n'em a career employees that are dedicated to the mission that are trying to do the right thing but a political leadership that is not that it keeps the mission that wants to blame people for being poor you know secretary bank which I completely disagree with I think they've taken into the wrong direction\nI'm the best thing that can be done is is number one to invest the resources\nTo create more housing that is affordable to the middle class and of course to low income individuals ah and\nUp and down the line from the ... the federal level state level and local level to do that and then also the ... work with the private sector and important ways for instance at the local level to figure out a zoning codes and planning codes to make affordable housing more developed bubble\nYou spent some time in Iowa you were in Des Moines last week supporting Democrats there who are running for office and we know\nThat President Trump's trade policies toward China are really hitting some farmers in Iowa pretty hard last month I was agriculture secretary Mike nags spoke to CNBC about what impact that that's having at home\nWhile it as we head into the twenty Eighteen harvest season for corn and soybean out here in Iowa that that elation of the trade conflict really couldn't come at a worse time so it is impacting our markets and that impacting our farmers so ah are farmers to understand that there are issues that need to be resolved particularly what China\nBut there is no doubt that the retaliatory tariffs are impacting our marketplace and that impacting our producers negatively\nThat's my next secretary of agriculture in Iowa speaking to CNBC I Wonder if you've been hearing what you've been hearing rather from farmers and pork producers and others\nIn agriculture is you're making trips through Iowa and and elsewhere are some of them okay with the current state of relations the U.S China they understand what President Trump is trying to do and agree do they tend to be more posed what are you hearing\nHere a lot of concern a lot of worry and ah folks are also wondering what's the plan here\nOr you know I think a lot of folks are can believe that we can improve our trade relationship with China\nBut they think the president has gone about it are completely the wrong way in this go it alone style very radically starting a trade war that is going to hurt Iowa farmers they're also disappointed in their representatives are folks like Steve King right now that they felt feel have sat idly by\nA while the president has done this or David Young is another good example out there and so I heard a disappointment with the leadership of of uh of some of those Republican congressional representatives and also tremendous concern because President Trump is so erratic when it comes to China\nNow my neck has spoken positively about the newly renegotiated NAFTA agreements between Mexico and Canada what about the trade deals that the president has been making in his time thus far particularly if you become president in twenty twenty and have to enter office with these deals as a starting point\nWe should always begin I'm from the premise that we want to ensure that our trade deals are good for American workers\nAh we also want to ensure of course that American companies who are engaged in trade are are treated fairly and uh that\nWe don't get taken advantage of and so I don't I don't think folks disagree with that I think what folks disagree with is how erratic Donald Trump has been and so you know in San Antonio we actually hosted in Nineteen Ninety two or Ninety three the signing of NAFTA and\nWe know that there are states that have benefited more than others from NAFTA one of the challenges for this president and the next president is to strike trade deals that can\nFor this president and the next president is to strike trade deals that can benefit as much of the United states as possible [noise] we've seen some of the benefits of of trade deals in San Antonio we've had additional investment\nUh from auto manufacturing a to a number of on to other industries certainly along the border of taxes logistics and warehousing\nI'm so Texas probably has been the biggest beneficiary of that\nWe always need to look at our trade deals from my perspective the American worker and how they can benefit\nSo what do you say the workers though who understand where President Trump is coming from who say you know I appreciate the value of trade but I see what's happened in my town how many factories have closed how many jobs have been lost\nI see immigration increasing in the U.S [noise] it just feels as an American like the rest of the world is siphoning off the best of trade and leaving people like me to kind of scoop up the drags and hopefully\nCobble a life together what do you say to those folks in terms of the future of trade here [noise]\nAh what I say is that number one\nI'm you know\nWe need to make the investments so that folks can be successful in this twenty first century global economy\nUm we have to be smart because I Do think we can improve this trade deals these relationships at the same time ah we're far past the point where the United states is just going to close its doors and not be part of a global trade relationship\nUm so the question becomes how do we ensure that you and your family are well positioned to thrive in this twenty first century global economy\nGive me one example of one of those investments you would start working on day one\nNo I I Would start working on um a\nEssentially understanding in especially in these hard hit Midwestern communities\nUnderstanding of the assets of each of those communities um your water the skills that we can invest in in folks who live in those communities what are the industries that may not be located there now that we can actively along with the private sector work on getting there\nAre and then how does that relate to to each of these trade deals and the thing is that uh what's missing from the Trump Administration is any kind of\nA thoughtful plan on these things in fact even with this latest a rebuke of NAFTA it seemed like they were rushing right through the finish line and just cobbled together whatever they could get at the end or it none of these things seem to have a plan behind\nA significant part of your story is obviously an immigrant story so I Want to ask you about immigration policy particularly because of the significant enthusiasm that Trump's supporters have for his stance on immigration even if not on all of his policies you right in the book\nAbout the difficulties you and other Latino families

A. M. U. dot ... before we move on from Medicaid read\nI I Do want to get your sense of kind of where this is going only one state Maine has approved Medicaid expansion through the ballot box so voters in Maine voted for expanding Medicaid but the governor of Maine Paul Page still refuses to do so\nHe talked about his opposition to expanding Medicaid during the morning talk show on W. veal AM radio back in July here's part of what Maine's governors said\nOr one thing I Know is no where they can force me to put the state in reading and I will not do that to tell them to go to jail before it ... through the state and read it and if that's the core tells me I have to do it then we're going to be going to jail\nThat's part of Maine Governor polar page speaking back in July and I read ... telling voters I'd rather go to jail can kind of feel like he's telling voters to go to somewhere else but how much of his political future I mean how's this going to ask\nWell a ... page is a he was sort of Donald Trump before Donald Trump was Donald Trump he uh he was the loud and and bombastic candidate in a one two races that are\nAre he probably shouldn't have one in the political sending that you know main is a pretty liberal state and\nI came into shake up the old order and that's what voters elected in foreign uh now he is refusing to follow the will of the voters I'm In the Medicaid expansion will happen in Maine at some point Paula pages turned out this year uh the Democratic candidate is leading and in most of the surveys that are that they're up there\nUm but you know it it has not happened yet and as a consequence of all the pages actions\nThere are thousands of people in in Maine who not only voted for this thing but voted for this thing and now don't have\nThe health care that they that they need and this is a it's a problem in Maine especially in a communities that have been hard hit by things like climate change the lobster community in the in the northwest part of the state along the northern coast or is it has been pretty devastated and they work for very low wages and pretty dangerous jobs and\nA ... you would think that they would need that Medicaid expansion\nLet's shift gears and talk about the cost of prescription drugs and issue I think that everybody sooner or later has to grapple with now dozens of states\nDrugs and issue I think that everybody sooner or later has to grapple with now dozens of states pass laws this year the aim to get rid of this kind of gag rule it prohibits your pharmacist from discussing prescription drug prices with you\nWe spoke to one democratic state lawmaker about isn't about why he introduced new legislation on prescription drug pricing\nI Am representative Ryan Patrick Kennedy I Am from the state of Rhode Island and I'm In my thirtieth year as a state representative\nSo earlier this year representative Kennedy had this sinus infection a mild infection his doctor prescribed an antibiotic Kennedy went to a pharmacist that he'd known for a long time and the pharmacist told him that he paid the retail price of the if you pay the retail price the drug and didn't pay with his insurance he would pay less\nWhen I went to my local pharmacist he told me I I Can't tell you that they might be another option for you that other option would have been not to use my co pay because the cost of the of the pills was so low it would've been cheaper for me to pay those out of pocket\nRepresentative Kennedy learned that the pharmacy had a contract with a company called a pharmacy benefit management company it handled its drug insurance plan that ... that prohibited the pharmacist from discussing this with customers\nKennedy and for the Democratic state lawmakers decided to introduce legislation that would ban the so called gag clauses and the bill had not passed\nWe wanted to make sure that Rhode Island does have that opportunity to speak one on one with the air with the pharmacist in and learn what their their pricing options are because\nOf that is consistently one of the big complaints we hear from our constituents on a on a regular basis is how expensive drug costs have become\nSo Scott Greenberg or we heard from representative Kennedy about what's going on in Rhode Island how common are laws like the one that he's pushing ... how many states have passed laws like this will\nBe these gag or clauses are are pretty common and uh last year there were a over a dozen states that [noise] excuse me took up legislation or\nHaving to do with these gag clauses um and actually just recently President Trump signed a bill outlawing these um gag clauses this was kind of low hanging fruit though of a\nOf a drug the drug prices issue or I don't think anyone like these gag clauses but uh\nYeah that that will the let federal legislation in the state bills won't change the fact that many many people struggled to pay for the prescriptions they need and um it's a very complicated issue and there are many states are taking other other steps to try to rein in prices\nSince you mentioned the president's he signed two bills last week as you noted that were designed to lift these gang clauses on prescription drug prices here is part of what the president said\nIt's the you know the lowest price active two thousand Eighteen and the patient right to know drug prices that and uh\nObviously based in the name you can tell that this gives people knowledge as to prices at different locations where to buy the drugs that will have an immediate impact to [noise] um it's called the law of supply and demand pretty simple but we didn't have that they didn't want to have that a lot of people didn't want to have that\nBut now we have it then it's going to really drive prices\nScott ... back up to the bills that various states have signed on this California signed a few bills into law in this a few weeks ago governor Jerry Brown signed them and these are considered among the strongest of these laws and the country what do they do\nWell I think the what a lot of states are doing in California or as is often the case with this kind of progressive legislation is and that is in the lead on this on California is trying to reduce drug prices through transparency in other words they are\nIs trying to reduce drug prices for transparency in other words they are requiring um uh the drug companies to be public about a price increases increases beyond a certain point in the idea\nIs that uh if these are made public that they'll sort of be shamed into into reversing some of these increases it's still too early to say though whether this is going to have the desired effect um nevertheless other states this year California passed a bill\nOr in two thousand Seventeen and last year you had five more states um Connecticut May New Hampshire Oregon and Vermont all passed a drug pricing laws that are similar\nTo California so we'll see whether transparency is enough to\nReduce prices and then in addition to that um some states have tried to go even even further than that Massachusetts passed a bill that would've allowed a its Medicaid program\nTo exclude some drugs from the a formula or the the um [noise]\nUh the group of drugs that are available to Medicaid recipients and the idea was that this would give them some leverage when negotiating with a drug companies over prices if they were able to exclude some FDA approved drugs and and as of right now Medicaid state Medicaid programs have to include all\nFDA approved drugs and their formula Larry the idea was that if they were able to exclude drugs that would give them leverage in negotiating on prices but the federal government shutdown that that effort by Massachusetts\nI Want to make sure understand the argument from Massachusetts what they were trying to do anything to the federal government shut that down so Massachusetts does not do this now are now for an hour an hour now but the ... it sounds like you're saying the argument is you know find Massachusetts\nAnd you know Julius the drug company I could say hey Julie this medication that we know is FDA approved is still too expensive and we're not going to just pay blanket leave for a medication we think it's too expensive so you have to keep negotiating or we're not going to we're not going to honor that part of the\nExactly that's right I mean interestingly enough in this uh uh the federal government though it rejected a mass at the Massachusetts effort\nA President Trump has proposed um that there'd be a pilot program where five states would be able to um\nTo do this what Massachusetts wants to do an addition to change the way that a Medicaid works with regard to drug prices and allow these five pilots states to negotiate directly with drug makers rather than um adhering to this national price formula so there is interest even though\nJulie markets have spectrum ... says look for a high and

on one day\nBack now to our conversation with read Wilson Julie Rovner and Scott Greenberg are still time to get in a few more of your questions and thoughts about state health care policy where you live one a at W. A. M. U. dot org Julie let's get to that question from Muncie law who tweeted isn't part of the reason Medicaid expansion didn't get as good support\nIs that it wasn't available as quote unquote GAP insurance for those whose employer plan has a high deductible\nWell of course the people who have an employer plans with a high deductible our our big problem in the lower income people of those have a particular\nLarge problem if you have many thousands of dollars and deductibles who have to pay before your insurance kicks and there are a couple of small demonstration programs where Medicaid has been able to ah basically fill in with employer insurance but generally Medicaid has sort of an all or nothing proposition you're either on Medicaid or you're off\nThe way the Affordable CARE Act was created with those people up two hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get\nWith those people up two hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty we're supposed to get 'em medicated people between a hundred and thirty eight percent of poverty and two hundred and fifty percent of poverty get special did camp they don't have those big deductibles so it it and then over two hundred and fifty percent of poverty then you're sort of on your own\nI'm In Arkansas I might point out though another we've been talking about a lot of different program that they instituted was to help people who often who were right at that margin we're constantly shifting back and forth between Medicaid and private plant and basically what they would do is the state was allowed to basically buy them into the private plans that they wouldn't have to keep\nChanging were too weak side bar for just a second let me the the point of the series is it's the talk about what states we're doing on big issues healthcare is a very big one it's one of the very first things that Donald Trump said he was going to act on when he became president repealing and replacing the Affordable CARE Act ha Obamacare\nThere are some people who feel like health care should be a national matter that every human being in the United states of America should have equally good planned ... simple set of healthcare costs and there are other Americans who believe it should be left up to the states that every state has different kinds of needs and different issues and their needs to be versatility\nAre we any closer to one side of this argument winning or is the state federal split just kind of baked into the nature of this country like where is this where is this going\nJulie actually it's where it's going it's back to where it was before the Affordable CARE Act what we're finding from all these sort of small incremental changes that the Trump Administration has done is that the the Affordable Care act was intended\nTo create more of a national floor if you will for health insurance states still do an enormous amount of regulation of how can they always have the federal government has always been sort of at\nThe junior partner to the state um but it had gotten so such a patchwork that it made huge differences which state you lived in what kind of healthcare you were able to get to the Affordable CARE Act with trying to say\nThere's a floor beneath which people won't fall that is slowly being chipped away and we're going sort of every month looking more and more like we did in two thousand nine before the Affordable CARE Act passed\nScott do you get the sense that this means that the effort to repeal the Affordable CARE Act is kind of succeeding that it is taking us back to where we were beforehand well\nJulie said it is in some states but in states that want to go in a different direction again the California Massachusetts states like that they are re instituting some of the uh parts of the Affordable CARE Act that the Trump Administration has and the Republican Congress have tried to undercut so for example\nAh on the individual mandate the requirement that you have insurance um\nSo called association health plans which are these cheaper plans that do not a ... offer all of the benefits that were mandated under the AC a some states are saying well whatever they're joined the federal level um insurance is regulated or at the state level and if you're going to sell insurance in our state you are going to abide by these rules\nI'll tell you one issue read that states and many people have been hoping the federal government will act on it states kind of moved on anyway and that's dealing with medical marijuana it's on the ballot in some states again this year about twenty two states have already legalized pot for medical use some of legalized for recreational use\nVoters in Utah will choose whether to join the states are not the end the political battleground seems to have shifted and I want to read if you see it this way for more traditionally liberal states into more conservative\nAreas overtime or yeah and it's not just the medical or that has gone that way but also legalization of recreational marijuana the two states where a legalization is going to be on the ballot this year is in Michigan in North Dakota\nMitt for no for ... for recreational low in order for it in on the medical side there are three different amendments in Missouri which was nice and confusing for the voters out there to try to figure out\nWhich is which are and then the Utah is as you say on the ballot Oklahoma already approved at this year\nAlready approved it this year so yeah we're we're not talking about the liberal coastal elites that are legalizing marijuana ah we're talking about a red America that is now dealing with this debate or it came up and you know in Florida last year and\nLast year two years ago um but this is this is now a debate that I think it shows the shift in the political conversation around marijuana those sorts of people who approve of\nA marijuana legalization tend to be a older white males funny enough and then the millennial generation that the younger the basically the younger you are the more in favor of\nA legalization you happen to be um the older white males the theory is that's the that's the sort of libertarian streak or they don't want the government regulating something that\nThey don't think the government has a hand in regulating and the real swing voters or perhaps not surprisingly come down to suburban women are in talking to the people who run campaigns for and against marijuana legalization or basically the battleground is a mothers who are worried that their kids are going to be exposed marijuana\nSo you get the proponents are talking about the law enforcement uh ability and the fact that not that this will not expand the market into younger people who will have access to recreational marijuana and then you've got the opponents who say exactly the opposite that legalization will in fact\nUh begin to a rope and a bunch of kids why are there three items in Missouri\nSo they're all on the ballot from different ah proponents different sides of it with two of them are from a actual citizen groups that they put them on the ... amendment to an amendment three and then there's a proposition which is currently from around I think the proposition goes on the ballot from the state legislatures that's going to be some kind of\nCompromise a piece that's proposition see 'em and they are all sort of competing with each other and this underscores another piece of\nThe evolution of of marijuana politics pots big business or in a lot of these states that have legalized Colorado Washington Oregon a California Nevada Alaska or Massachusetts and Maine\nAre the people who are setting up a ... who get to write these laws\nAlso essentially get to determine who's in the market um and who owns a very lucrative space one of the biggest opponents of recreational legalization in a bunch of early states where the people who ran medical marijuana shops because they already have the monopoly right why dilute the monopoly with other people\nI should know by the way we did a program this year about state laws on marijuana and the business of politics can find that on line at the one a dot org Scott\nA couple of things to add to what to read said on this very interesting issue um at one is that it's sort of intersects with what we talked about earlier the opioid crisis because there are many people\nAre supporters of medical marijuana who argue that this is a viable alternative to uh to opioids for people who have chronic pain and then also I think we've written about this um it's interesting that social justice provisions are finding their way into marijuana\nBills or this idea that a a minority communities have been the most impacted by the war on drugs and therefore uh as we move towards legalization that makes sense to include in these bills provisions that are\nAbout ... on the one hand would allow people to uh to expunged they're a criminal records for small amounts of marijuana but also some of these bills are calling for investment in these communities that we're most impacted and and also as I read said it's big business", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "15"}
