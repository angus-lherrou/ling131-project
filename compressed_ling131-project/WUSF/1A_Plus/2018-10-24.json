Nineteen Seventy eight Congress passed the pregnancy discrimination act it's supposed to protect expecting mothers at work\nAnd it requires companies to accommodate pregnant workers request say lighter lifting or less standing but only if that company is making accommodations for other workers quote similar in their ability or inability to work\nWith that little hitch is one of the reasons why forty years later pregnant women are still reporting workplace discrimination in some cases they're losing their jobs and in other cases even miss carrying at work\nThis hour on point pregnancy discrimination in the workplace and you can join us we want to hear your story did your employer refused to provide some or any accommodations to you\nWhen you were pregnant or did you have the opposite experience and have a very accommodating employer what happened how much should accompany be required to shift workers duties around her pregnancy and\nWhat are the costs and limits to that

kind of challenges that a pregnant women are facing in very physically intensive jobs I just wanted to start there a little bit\nUm for example you talked to a woman named of T shirts\nStart they're a little bit um for example you talked to a woman named ... wool bright she used to work at a Wal Mart can can you tell us the story of a T shirt and what happened to her so O T show was working\nIn the deli and the bakery at a Wal Mart and um she was lifting heavy trays of chicken um she asked her employer to be able to stop lifting those heavy trays\nAnd her employer or her manager in this case I'm told her no and said actually I saw a video of\nDemi Moore doing a somersault when she was almost full term so pregnancy should be no excuse for you\nYeah what can I jump in here because we actually out of ... of telling the exactly this you know the story of that because uh\nShe did an interview obviously with you too but also with the the the New York times podcast the daily uh in June and so you're gonna hero T shirt here I'm\n... describing what happened this moment when that happened with her supervisor and I should say as you report it as both of you report it she had already been told by her doctor that heavy lifting of those fifty pound trays of chicken\nOr could have put her or would have put at risk of miscarriage so in this tape ... describes the conversation that she had with

look into a incidents love some in some cases extreme incidences of alleged pregnancy discrimination and what happened and why\nThat series was co reported by Jessica silver Greenberg and ... and they they joined us today and we also want to hear from\nFrom you do you think that a workplace accommodations for expecting mothers have gotten better in the forty years since the first law about pregnancy discrimination in the workplace was passed did you ask recombination from your employer uh and got them\nOr were you even afraid to ask concerned about whether or not I'm having your work changed because of your pregnancy might affect your job or possibly even lead\nTo your dismissal were at one eight hundred for two three eight to five five this eight hundred and forty three talk also want to hear from employers about uh the situation from from your point of view\nIf you're an employer how much combination can you make and what are the realistic concerns that employers have about the limits too accommodating or employees during pregnancy again we're at eight hundred\nFor two or three eight to five five now I just want to play a little tape for you because there are a lot of stories out there you're going to hear from Heather Myers she was working at a Wal Mart in Kansas and two thousand six when she discovered she was pregnant she talked to NPR in twenty fourteen about it\nAnd she said that while her doctor had recommended that she keep a water bottle with her on the wall Mart sales for\nHer supervisor did not approve so Myers went back to her doctor and got a note to give to her supervisor\nShe said I'm Sorry that we can't accept you know because we have water I don't see it you have the water fountains available to you\nI was just a little shocked that this water bottle is kind of having this big deal and they read and scrutinizing my doctor I decided to go against what my supervisor suggested and listen to my doctor and to my body\nAnd decided to keep the water bottle and one day that they provide your came up to me and she said either the water bottle has to go or you'd have to go\nThat's Heather Myers she spoke with NPR in two thousand fourteen\nNow just because silver Greenberg ... uh in the course of your reporting how did you were you surprised by um the number of stories that you've found or was it still difficult to get women to come forward to talk about discrimination that they felt they had experience in the workplace while they were pregnant so\nI think we were surprised when we first started reporting this story by just how common to experience was\nWhen you start something like this we had been looking for something that might be impacting women the way that me to have and we were shocked at the outpouring of [noise]\nWe were shocked at the outpouring of\nSort of very similar experiences from women all the way up and down the economic ladder and blue collar jobs in low wage jobs in office jobs\nFor this most recent story and miscarriage I can say that uh we went to Texas together I mean to Texas to to Memphis together um\nAnd uh we had\nTo in many cases go back to the same women over and over and over again and really gain their trust because what we were talking about here was one of the most personal and devastating experiences of their life\nSo in the case of a miscarriage or really deeply affecting health experience it was difficult to get people to talk to us\nYeah and and I imagine the the extreme difficulty that the the women who were you know ultimately willing to speak to you that there are extreme difficulty with compounded by the fact that I Would guess almost all of them really needed the jobs they were in right it wasn't as if they had\nA the freedom or the means to just say okay well if you're not going to accommodate me I'll go find another employer\nRight and they also needed the health insurance that came with those jobs there were there ... yeah exactly um so it was a paycheck and it was also health insurance and again\nJust and I talk to people who are still working at the warehouse so these are folks who are at again great personal risk\nComing forward to tell their stories um when you know it could risk their job\nRight now I Want to get to the bigger picture here but it but I should note that ah the the warehouse company that use that many of these women or all the women in their mid your second story most of them that where they work\nDid the company not also said that they ... the allegations because of uh currently do their attempts to unionize uh employees at the warehouse\nYes they did say that they said that um they said they believe that these allegations were manufactured drummed up an exaggerated by the Teamsters Union which is\nCurrently trying to organize a the warehouse what we found so there's a couple of points that kind of mentioned that\nNone of so with the exception of one one and\nI'm Tasha morale who ultimately left the warehouse on and has become an an organizer with the Teamsters none of the women were affiliated with the union at all and so none of the women who use their names were affiliated with the union at all\nAnd you have to put the denial 'em by X piano and pointing the Teamsters in a broader context which means they made a lot of denials some of which we included on the record so\nWe and it comes down to a pretty basic I'm a pretty basic set of\nDisputed facts so for instance when he describes the warehouse at the beginning of the story as they age and window is they just beat the company disputed the description of window is pointing out that while the warehouse has no exterior windows\nIt has a number of interior windows\nSo they don't ... the sunlight or daylight there just inside the building\nThere are windows that I'm I'm not exactly sure what into your windows they're describing I Believe that does exist but when you're when you're evaluating the credibility of a statement I think\nWhen you're when you're evaluating the credibility of a statement I think you need and the credibility of a denial I Do think you have to look at the facts that they are disputing that are smaller then shame\nYou know whether or not a woman had a miscarriage on where you are\nI mean I'm sitting in a radio studio right now and there's an interior window I can see out into the hallway of our radio station but\nYes I I'm In a similar studio I can also see\nHot into a into a room and then is working so you know what I Want to get into sort of the uh the\nLegal framework that all of this is going on in you know across the country here and just a minute with both of you Jessica ... but we have a lot of callers who want to join us let me just let's get some of their stories and if I can so let's go to Joanna who's calling from Edmond, Oklahoma joined a year on the air\nYes Hi Hi go ahead [noise]\nUm well my experience was I just wanted to kind of share because it hit home um I was working for oil and gas about six years ago when I became pregnant with our first son and um because I was I'm a private contractor I couldn't\nWell I wasn't fired but I was let go as soon as it I'm kind of became known that I was pregnant and um\nI guess the only the biggest thing was it was the only other girl and the woman in the office was the only one to help me bring my chair down like two or three ... three stories as well as all my other things and all these other men were just sitting there and what I thought were like at least co workers like a friend level on that level\nIt it didn't prove to be and it just makes me so sad that actually I just saw that friend of mine and she's pregnant and she's now an attorney a title attorney and she's having the same problems and so it's still very relevant and I don't know if it's just oil and gas is a good old boy kind of thing but\nI just really hope and pray that\nWell you know you see the day that men really want to look out for their women to just help us\nWill join us can do the work [laughter] you know\nYeah Joanna thank you so much for your call and thank you for sharing your story let's get another

I mean pregnant\nIs I've stood on fours on watch and it's one thing to say well you don't have to do X Y or Z because you're having morning sickness or accommodating some you know hey they're going to come get me when I was a male nurse like pick somebody up didn't matter\nFrom get me when I was a male nurse like somebody up didn't matter just because she weighs ... pounds\nShe can't live like okay but some of those simple mhm when you start moving into and you shouldn't have to work large group of single people don't her children that's a different basis for outright discrimination\nYeah Lee I assure you actually and and I I Want to turn your a call back to our guest here but at least call actually makes me think um ... but a least call makes me think of the two thousand Fifteen Supreme Court case a young versus UPS\nOr give me so I can you just have to celebrate because I think it was the last time or one of the more recent times that uh\nThat we as a nation sort of talked about actively about a pregnancy in the workplace so this is when a a UPS driver Peggy young doctors said she shouldn't be lifting heavy packages because they put her at risk of miscarriage\nAh so she was told to stay home a meaning she lost her medical coverage and so she sued UPS the case went all the way to to the Supreme Court and in a twenty fourteen interview with MSNBC Peggy and described what happened\nTo the doctor I got into it with my restrictions and I turned out and and basically they said you know we don't provide light days are paying to see the home town along are pregnant\nI should say in two thousand Fifteen the Supreme Court actually ruled in her favor six three in her favor but Joe Williams my question comes to you because I was looking at the dissent\nIn that Supreme Court case it was written by Justice Scalia\nOr it's a really interesting descent and I think leaves call echoes a lot of what Justice Scalia said back then he he wrote for example that\nProhibiting employers from making any distinctions between pregnant workers and others have similar ability would elevate pregnant workers to most favorite employees then it gives an example theoretically if Boeing offered chauffeur's to injure directors they would have to offer show first a pregnant mechanics\nAnd if Disney paid pensions to workers who can no longer work because of old age it would have to pay attention to workers who cannot work because of childbirth which he says it's implausible the current federal law\nWhich elsewhere creates a guarantee of equal treatment here alone creates a guaranteed a fever treatment what do you think about that\nUm well that's not true I'm Lee does have a good point on it's not illegal but it's very bad practice um two Everytime you have an undesirable shift give it to somebody who's single who doesn't have or doesn't have kids in order to accommodate parents\nOn the other hand um that's not typically that discrimination in the workplace is very very strong against pregnant women and mothers\nOn and the um the the fact is there a lot of situations for example someone with diabetes needs to take breaks to eat well somebody who is extremely nauseated because a pregnancy need to take breaks to eat what's the difference\nAnd what we have seen is that employers to accommodate the person with diabetes often don't accommodate the person I'm with a with a pregnancy\nAnd blue collar contacts and I think about what Joanna said she said we can do the work I remember reading at one woman saying oh I can do the work it's the men I Can't take and that's exactly what you know when I was saying um\nThat often and blue collar contexts women can do the work but the employer my sense and reading hundreds of these cases is um the\nEmployer didn't want to hire these to it in the first place and so figures great I'm just going to wait until they're pregnant then I can force them out on the eve and fire them and that's what the young versus UPS decision a began to put an end to\nNot just because silver Greenberg\nUh begin to put an end to\n... know Jessica silver Greenberg and not only to truth how there there have been attempts\nThough since at least twenty twelve right to provide some kind of upgraded modernization of uh laws around pregnancy in the workplace\nThere there have been um so Jones mentioned the pregnant workers fairness and that's been a kind of center piece of um efforts to\nStrengthen the federal law and filling the gaps that the that exist in the pregnancy discrimination act there has been effort since so every congressional session since twenty twelve\nUm lawmakers have introduced to the pregnant workers Fairness Act\nSo far it has not made it out of committee so it has not made it out as to\nUm help committee which stands for how Sen labor and pensions I'm not going to get the exact terms right but um it's never had a hearing and um it has bipartisan support it now has bipartisan support\nI'm kind of not ironically but interestingly the chairman of that committee Lamar Alexander I'm his home state is um where ex PO or where that XP on warehouses made so Tennessee [noise]\nAnd and so you but you're saying that it hasn't actually sort of advance to any new it hasn't it never even advance to a voter debate\nIt's never been put on the floor and now it's your right it's never it's never had a a hearing\nOkay so Joan Williams let me just hop I have to you here I mean is what you see uh in in in this proposal even if it's not going anywhere in Congress yet is it taking us in the right direction\nIt's taken us in the right direction and in fact somebody like twenty two states already have filtered provisions there should be a national law that says\nI'm ... workers are sometimes women women sometimes get pregnant and you have to accommodate them when they do on the other hand I think it's really important to recognize that pregnant women already do have sweeping rights and they actually have rights even if the employer has accommodated nobody else\nI'm potentially under the Americans with Disabilities Act so any pregnant worker who was in a situation like those described in the article or listening\nOn please go to pregnant at work to to ensure that you can exercise the legal rights that you have because pregnant workers already have a lot of rights under existing law\nThat doesn't mean we don't need a new law because situation is very complicated to simplify it for employers and employees\nSo just getting badly though I Wonder I mean you spoke to so many women are in the process of reporting this story even with what Joan Williams just said that the ADA might cover a lot of women in in the accommodations they could need while pregnant\nI imagine that you rented to folks who were saying well I'm of hesitant to ask\nBecause of how my employer might see me I'm hesitant in terms of I don't want them to uh to reduce my pay or limit my future advancement or just that it would change sort of how they're seen in the workplace which then could have a future effects even after their children are born\nSo right so the women that we talk to 'em were overwhelmingly women who as you point out magna there in\n\nMajor funding for on point is provided by Geico offering car insurance as well as services for homeowners and renters

E. N. G. A. G. E. dot com [noise]\n\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker body we're talking about the Trump Administration signaling its desire to pull us out of the INS treaty that the Cold War era treaty\nThat limited or ended the use of me medium range or middle range land based nuclear missiles and we're speaking today with just ... the only he's president of Ploughshares Fund a foundation focused on nuclear weapons policy and conflict resolution and let's hear a little bit more uh from the president himself about why he wants to do this\nHere's President Trump after a rally in Elkhart County Nevada on Saturday telling reporters that he's ready to pull out of the intermediate range nuclear forces treaty or as we've been taught calling it the IMF treaty\nWith Russia China was and they all say let's really get smart let's none of us develop those weapons it Russia's doing it that if China is doing is we're hearing today agreement that don't accept\nSo president Donald Trump's they're saying that maybe we can and proliferation of Russia China and the U.S all come together and desire to stop it\nHere's national security adviser John Bolton during a press conference in Moscow yesterday where he met\nRussian President letter but I'm ... and both said there's just one point on wished Russia and the U.S agreed that other countries with nuclear arsenal in the world aren't restricted by the IMF it's a bilateral agreement between the United states and Russia and that's a problem\nSo there's a new strategic reality out there this was a Cold War bilateral ballistic missile related treaty in a multi polar world I think on this latter point of the more\nComplicated global ... a strategic environment for something that concerns of Russian a very substantial after we talked about that\nJust ... how do you react to what you just heard John Bolton safe\nJohn Bolton is on a mission to kill all arms control agreements she believes in the world of power and might\nOr a world of us dominance he believes that these kinds of treaties restrict military the military power the United states you want to world where there were no restraints whatsoever on US military for freedom of action he seems to have convinced\nA Donald Trump to ... to follow the course of action the fear of our allies the fear of many national security experts around the world and just you you take down this treaty which is working but just in place which is restricted the arms race in Europe than the next on his target list is the start treaty that had reduced\nUh the the us and Soviet arsons not rushing arsenals\nBy over fifty percent and if you take and that will bend toppled that seems to be his goal and then you for the rest of the entire non proliferation\nTreaty regime in other words all the rules of the road that Republicans and Democrats liberals and conservatives have built up over the last forty fifty years would come tumbling down and it's a a dog eat dog nuclear world well that is a road instability and war\nSo I mean we have seen though uh for at least a year now that America's nuclear arsenal um the Trump Administration seeks for it to play a bigger role in the in the defense of the nation I mean I was looking at the the most recent nuclear posture review and it's and and it talks about the exact risk that that uh\nYou know of Russia of China of a non uh a non a bilateral world here and that in order to counter or these other countries that are that are at hand singing modernizing their nuclear arsenal that the Pentagon and the national Security Council say well the United states must do the same\nAnd the national Security Council say well the United states must do the same thing so I'm just wondering I mean earlier you you were saying that that stepping out are pulling out of the INS though you say America loses some leverage them to over Russia I didn't quite understand that how\nAbsolutely look the first thing you do when you want to build new weapons is inflate the threat is provide some justification for why you need even more\nThan the thousands of nuclear weapons are already have and in this case it did Bolton is pulling out an old trek he's using a technical violation to kill the whole treaty that he disagrees with for ideological grounds what are we talking about here\nWe're talking about the the Russians who have modified and existing weapon to give a greater range larger fuel tank and they put a few of them and one of their test sites and European Russia and apparently in one of the site we're talking about a handful of weapons that are technically in violation and we'd been detecting this was about twenty four chain\nThere are mechanisms for dealing with these kinds of violations they happen frequently in arms control treaty resolution measures but instead of fixing it\nInstead of enforcing it instead of going and insisting that they take those weapons down he's killing the whole mechanism\nSomebody breaks into your house that's a violation of the laws against burglary you don't like repeal the burglary laws you enforce them by repealing this treaty you're allowing put in to do whatever you want now there'll be no restraint on him deploying weapons whatever kind do you want in Europe and here's the the the really bad part\nIt's unlikely that we can match it of course for us to put these ground based systems in Europe we'd have to have a country that watch them read into European ally wants them that's why you're seeing how of complaint\nFrom France from from Germany from the European Union who warned that you're taking down and these are their words a pillar of European security\nNo one needs a new arms race says the foreign minister of the European Union\nAmong among others that's what they're afraid of that Trump is citing an arms race that was already brewing as both us and Russia building other nuclear arms and now they're afraid that Europe uh once again be the battle ground\nFor these two nuclear giants as they battle\nRight I mean Europe is signaling as loudly as it can it's a discomfort with the possibility of an end to the INS treaty I mean I'm seeing here this big march Gabriel who just stepped down in March of German foreign minister this week said that the demise of the IMF\nThreatens to quote again turn us in central Europe and here in Germany into a venue of nuclear madness I mean we should recall that a ... at one time a million Germans marched against nuclear war a weaponry and Europe which is one of the things that led to a\nThe the INS to begin with that just hurts you and I knew he had a lot more to say but I Want to welcome in one more uh ... voice into this conversation Evelyn focused joins us now she joined us today from Washington She's a fellow at the Atlantic council future Europe initiative Eurasia center and the ... Center for strategy and security\nShe also served from two thousand twelve to twenty Fifteen and the Obama administration as deputy assistant secretary of defense for Russia Ukraine and Eurasia and when it first is welcome to you\nThank you magnify gray today here so I'm very eager to hear your take on this given your experience here do you think the Trump Administration is a is doing is on the right track here in terms of its desire to pull out of the INS\n... unfortunately I don't really see\nA better option right now because the Russians essentially put our back to the wall this is really like going back to Nineteen eighty seven where\nActually our European allies the Germans asked us to step in and counter the Russian short short range or medium range missiles that were deployed and threatening Europe at the time with our own missiles so in that case the Europeans wanted us to help them out and ...\nOwn missiles so in that case the Europeans wanted us to help them out and President Reagan did so but did so I think largely in a way that he was able to use it to negotiate the Russians out of their own missiles and that's how we got the intermediate nuclear forces treaty\nAnd I having been in the administration [laughter]\nI Know that we tried very hard to confront the Russians to convince the Russians um to do what we could using words\nTo deter them from continuing to violate the agreement but they did not stop 'em as you noted in the beginning this has been public since two thousand fourteen I'm the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff testified openly that the Russians have deployed this capability these missiles and\nSo what are we going to do I think that for the U.S government the best option unfortunately at this point is to do what we did an eighty seven which is to threaten to counter so the burglars burglar us\nWe then send another burglar outside of their house have that burglar stand there and say if you don't stop we're going to send our burglar and\nThe problem is the way I think the Trump Administration went about it it doesn't sound like they consulted it doesn't sound like they had a plan that included our NATO allies\nUm or or the issue of how to deal with the Asian theater\nSo that's that's the issue I think today\nWell Ellen for just a couple of quick questions here um you first of all you heard Joe surrounds you and he just a few minutes ago thing that she sees the way to counter the Russians is is through the very instrument of the ... treaty itself and that by by you know deep sixteen the treaty you've lost what is perhaps the most effective\nMechanism to push back those intermediate range missiles or the that Russia you know as you said we've been talking about this twenty fourteen\nIt all begins tonight at nine on W.\nUSF eighty nine point seven this is your NPR station W USF I'm Robin ... thanks so much for joining us today\n[noise] support for on point comes from WVU

resolution and Evelyn and justify may we've had a lot of patient colors waiting so let me just get to some of them right now Kelvin\nIs calling from Charleston, Missouri Calvin you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call um I Am a former world military I'm veteran Thirty Years' old African American and um\nAs far as I'm us go as far as our our military and our nuclear arms and basically are on I think the way President Trump went about it\nIs not necessarily the right way but I Do think he's going to go right\nSee 'em as your first got there you know about the way we recall nation of appeasement too a lot of people\nFor too long and a lot of the the President Trump has done has shown no food no longer take this role on the global stage for resolved but instead of the nation that is or like\nLack of better words I think we've been to sleep in the military and she says it's best to stay on guard all the way because when you fall asleep that really yearly attacks or break schools like Russia's going\nI think he's doing the right thing we can be asleep or I watch as far as our allies are by nature you go read happy you know right now I feel like we're behind the eight ball Russia's\nKelvin home and take back from there and thank you so much for your call let's go to Margaret who's calling from ... Virginia Margaret you're on the air\nHi thanks for taking my call I find the whole idea of pulling out of yet another nuclear a treaty buying and a logical to think that once we get out of it and we increase our production of nuclear weapons is is going to make the world safer we already have more than seven thousand new\nThis is going to make the safer we already have more than seven thousand new believe and I don't see how the idea of increasing the number is going to make the world and they said well we have enough to destroy the world many times over all ready it's only a bone in my opinion to the war industry\nMargaret thank you so much for your call Ellen Vargas how would you like to respond to Margaret um well first to I'm Calvin if I could just quickly um I Do agree that we need to be from with our adversaries and I guess my\nThinking with regard to this move is that it's a deterrent move and hopefully move that will ultimately strength and arms control because\nI'm going to right now give the administration that chance I'm not going to assume that John Bolton has the lead and we're going to tear up the treaty entirely and we're going to drop all nuclear talks oh I'm maybe a little bit giving them too much benefit of the doubt but that's where I Am\nI Do however disagree with President Trump's approach to the allies and again as I said before we have to be more collaborative with our friends and from these heavier enemies with regard to Margaret's point I agree I mean I Do not think we should be wasting money on developing nuclear weapons that we don't need\nAnd that's the whole point of being from and standing up to the Russians and getting them to\nStep back and think about what they're doing 'cause this is also part of the bigger picture which has to do with Russia's military doctrine there over reliance on nuclear weapons as part of their war strategy a which I think is highly alarming and you could have a whole nother showing that\nIt just turns you a new turn back to here because of course uh we we could also continue to spend the rest of the hour talking about Russia and we we will return to it but China has been lurking here or a as a major part of why President Trump says he wants to pull out of the I N F here I mean I'm I'm seeing that part of the thinking is that\nFor ... the U.S has constrained by the ins and not able to deploy strategic weaponry in the in the Asia theater as Evelyn pointed out earlier\nBecause of this and that that's putting us chief Calvin term behind the eight ball in Asia\nYou always have to be very careful when you hear people who are who want new nuclear weapons in the language they use so John Bolton says\nYou know an out outmoded treaty violation ignored were constrained and so you know it feeds into that feeling that we're be where the suckers and the other countries are stealing a march on us or as one of your callers pointed out\nWe have a six thousand five hundred and fifty nuclear weapons\nThat is to about ... or ... several hundred times more weapons than you need to destroy every\nHuman being on the face of the earth we have plenty of nuclear weapons and you don't want to fall into the trap\nOf nuclear war planters his planners who who's the this was some kind of board game where you have to match piece for peace so on China what they're talking about is that China a land power doesn't have much of a navy doesn't have much of a\nAn air force that can reach beyond us borders they have new for now [laughter] okay for now they they they have\nA nuclear weapons or about a two hundred three hundred so nuclear weapons compared to our seven thousand and their land based and they can reach targets like Japan like career like warm\nOr anything like the United states and about forty that could reach us\nAnd we don't necessarily have those we don't have those ground based missiles\nThat match their capability exactly and that's what they mean by were constrained you know where the treaty stops us from building note but we have to see based missile and we just are based weapons that can reach them fought just fine we have strategic submarines to proudly ocean second which just fine in other words we have does this\nMarine so proud of the ocean second which just fine in other words we have dozens of nuclear weapons ... that can have them for every one they have the can hit us we don't need to match them and here's the other off underline reality prompted you there's nobody you know one of our allies want these weapons Japan just yesterday said\nThat they do not want us to part of the IMF treaty they don't they're not looking for us to deploy nuclear weapons in Japan which is one of the places you would do to deploy them if you want to match weapon\nWell everyone versus a ... I think the the ... one of the deepest points that Joe is making here uh it's worthy of of some dispute discussion here for the discussion because\nAnd I think he's right that that there is\nA sense when you hear I'm certain members of the administration talk now that the United states is weaker than it actually is I mean what's your response to to Joe's point that what there is no need for land based in intermediate range missiles and we have such a a overpowering sea bass nuclear arsenal that we could use\nNo one wants us to use them but that that are there for a for U.S Strategic purposes in the Asia theater\nWell I mean I I have to confess here I'm not a military planner so I it's a little bit out of my\nLeague to say definitively that we don't need those weapons um I Will say however that it is true that\nOur president and I wouldn't say members of his administration necessarily better president does speak of America is that for a declining power as if we're not the the strongest military power on the globe right now the strongest diplomatic power at least potentially were squandering that every day\nUm and of course still the strongest economic power so I Do think it's worth bearing in mind that we do have the upper hand and the reason the Russians are developing the capabilities that they're developing has to do with the fact that they can't go head to head with us or the Chinese they have to develop asymmetric means\nAnd I think the real issue here has to do with Russia's\nFeeling of vulnerability the lack of what they call strategic stability in our defense relationship\nAnd their desire to do something to correct that and I think\nThis administration needs to sit down and have some real\nBlonde conversations with the Russians about the state of our defense relationship about the various dangerous asymmetric asymmetric things the Russians are doing to try to get an edge on us like developing missiles not just these missiles but other missiles um like their cyber\nCapabilities the fact that they have inserted a box or other um cyber weapons into our energy grid that they could activate in time of war if necessary things like that are actually\nOf greater concern to me personally and I think should be the subject of serious discussion and then hopefully negotiation if the Russians are open to it", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "24"}
