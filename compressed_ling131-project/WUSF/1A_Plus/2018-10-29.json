in America in\nTwenty Eighteen we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk listen to how a president Donald Trump himself reacted to what happened in Pittsburgh during a Saturday evening rally in Murfreesboro Illinois the president began his speech addressing the shooting\nFish we could act of mass murder is pure evil hard to believe and frankly something that is on a measurable\nPresident Donald Trump on Saturday evening in Illinois I'm joined today by David Friedman he's executive editor of the Pittsburgh Post Gazette also by Howard find menus NBC News analyst and journalism lecture at the University of Pennsylvania\nAnd joining us now is rabbi Daniel written birds she is a rabbi in residence at ... an organization that trains Jewish social justice leaders her opinion piece for the Washington Post is headlined the victims of the tree of life synagogue massacre are martyrs we have a link to that at one point radio dot org rabbi written Berg welcome to the program\nI magna so you're first thoughts today on um how how we should be looking at and thinking about what happened on Saturday a tree of life\nWe need to be seeing it in context\nUm when Trump is saying this is so hard to believe and I think this is absolutely\nDevastating a but it's absolutely conceivable given the context of anti Semitism historically and on the rise in America given the context of our lack of protections for gun violence given the context of ongoing tree thing hate crimes in America and the rise of white supremacy\nI'm this absolutely is a ... if it said that a lot of contacts and and I argued in the piece that it also sits in the context unfortunately of our history of of murders a in Judaism\nMm Mm I should note here that we've got a couple of comments that are coming online Nancy banks tells us on Facebook that while I Do not in any way wish to diminish the horror of the killings in Pittsburgh to black men were also murdered last week\nOr possibly a hate crime a lot of heat for one week and in fact a genetics he's point that shooter was it who had who couldn't gunned down those two black men in Kentucky said that whites don't kill allegedly said whites don't kill whites and we also have\nYou know we're not even a couple of weeks off the pipe bombs that were sent to various political leaders around the country as well so that's why I'm trying to want to talk specifically about rising anti Semitism but also in the broader context of a as I keep calling this ecosystem of hate\nShip right now that maybe that maybe stoking all of this\nI there is a tremendous amount ... we have a a white supremacist administration\nAnd Trump has been\nIn self attacking churches are us for a long long time I he's been using even after the tree of life shooting he's been making use of the global asked what she does very very often both of these are new contemporary anti Semitic dog whistles\nAt the idea that there is a Jew who is powerful and on front and secretly how you know funding infiltration is\nUh is is a very very very ancient idea um but it's it's manifesting now in a in a myriad of ways\nMm [noise] well I mean Howard Simon let's talk a little bit more about the specific things that um that the shooter in Pittsburgh\nA was really ... ranting and raving about online I mean ah you know he talked a lot about uh his hatred of\nUm of the ... the Jewish refugee relief organization um highest rate that that originally began and I'm more than a century ago as an organization to a Jewish refugees around the country but now he's a leading\nOrganization in the United states helping refugees from all walks of life\nA and that you know he believed that they were encouraging an infestation a ... in the United states and that's one of the reasons why he wanted to\nWell he he he murdered people in order to end the assistance to refugees talk and then there was a conspiracy behind that as well so hard just talk to me more about about how all those threats come together\nWell ah this isn't the story just about the Jews are just about the tree of life a synagogue or where I basically\nGrew up [noise] if you know history you know that in a way the Jews are the canaries in the coal mine of social and political uh disarray and and and and break down\nAnd and I think you need to look at it in that context of the first thing I thought of yesterday morning was the mother Emanuel church in Charleston\nWere quite similar thing happened uh attacking worshipers on this case in a church\nI'm fed by a lot of the same paranoia and and anger and and and conspiracy thinking a then that's how that's how I I look at it uh over the course of history\nAh conspiracies a conspiracy theories about the Jews have been a convenient and deadly a answer easy answer for uh people who are disengaged and in an angry at the system\nAh it's been it's been true for hundreds if not thousands of years\nAnd here in America is part of a medley of hate\nOr that we're seeing across the spectrum\nOr we're seeing we're seeing racially motivated a paranoia we're seeing a religiously motivated paranoia where we're seeing we're seeing politically motivated paranoia and and the language has gotten a harsh on all sides I mean conservatives will tell you and I think they're right some of the\nSome of the language that the the Democrats have used to\nHave to have lean toward the idea that everything is a fight or that everybody is or who is who is a political opponent is somehow not quite human\nWhat the point we've reached here or there are a lot of reasons for it there are lots and lots of reasons for it uh is is that anybody we disagree with politically\nUh is is that anybody we disagree with politically or is it subhuman is not quite human is is an older with a capital oh that is dangerous in in comprehensible it out to destroy society\nUh it it seems like the connective tissue of our of our culture has has has has gone missing\nAnd I think the founders when they when they set up our system wanted contention but they relied on the idea that there would be character and the people that there were to be communities communities where people would know each other and us understand each other's humanity even if they disagreed with them politically\nAnd and that's kind of disappeared and that that kind of hollowing out\nOf our civil culture is what's allowed this to happen it's what's allowed\nOr the shooting in Charleston to happen it's it's what's allowed people to send pipe bombs to democratic leaders which is what led a Mr ... hours to ah to say I'm going in\nAnd and head into a a a building that I Know all too well where my parents both taught Sunday school where I was permits food\nUm scenes of mayhem there just to be able to manage and he says that it's all part of this larger context of the hollowing out of our civic life\nCan I can do that go ahead I'm\n[noise] I think\nThis both sides rhetoric is not helpful in this moment and I think that's\nA obfuscate the context in which a group of people have power and are stoking hate and our fostering humanizing language and are putting separating families putting children in cages creating Muslim bans removing a\nTransgender ah folks access to to legal protection I'm\nOoh\n\n[noise] support for on point

life\nSynagogue about America's rising broader ecosystem of hate and what to do about it and joined today by David Friedman Howard find men and rabbi Daniel written bird and rubber written ... just before the break we had the color or shalom who was taking issue with some things that you had said and and I wanted to give you a chance to respond [noise]\nSo the idea that Trump could not possibly be an anti Semitic because he has a Jewish daughter in law it's gonna be a Jewish daughter not Jewish son in law is ridiculous it's like saying\nThat he couldn't possibly be in a Sachin is because he's had three lives as somebody said on Twitter right [laughter] the idea of it that he somehow or other dissolved of his white supremacist stoking of his blaming the the caravan on Soros\nOf his constant attacks on source calling you know calling lock him up even a few days ago at a rally\nUm that he uses the word globalized again and again and again but somehow he's auto magically freed from from connection because of his daughters decisions if not resonate with me the idea that George Soros\nIs somehow this um you know it was involved in the confiscation of Jewish property is actually a right wing conspiracy theory that has been debunked inserts themself\nAddressed it in an interview it's not as he was a fourteen year old in Hungary ah when the Nazis were there um and yeah I I I I really do not understand the Jewish Trump\nMindset I Will say that I'm very clearly the Torah commands us\nAgain and again and again to protect the stranger who is among off the vulnerable and recommended thirty six times more than any other myths but in the Torah to protect the stranger because we were\nNon citizens and the the immigrant among us and I I take that obligation very seriously and I know that those five to ... to paint us as I'm having some sort of secret power operating behind the scenes um are are just part of a larger like right\nNow this measure yeah it is that you Howard yeah so how can I just I I definitely will turn this do you become but I also just wanted to sort of put together some other pieces of\nUnder a tendency to become but I also just want to sort of put together some other pieces of this this broader puzzle here because I I Do wonder why we can't or are not just you know I I I take the point that there are lots of bad actors on multiple sides of things but let us just confront had on this ecosystem that is being\nUm if not birds end at least a I don't I don't know legitimize or not it's tamped down by a Republican leadership in America right now\nCan I speak to that because I've been covering them\nFor years and I've got several examples of even just in the past week but please go ahead go ahead\nNo no I uh to to to take it\n... through the eyes of showroom if I can for a second and the notion that Donald Trump is the best friend the Jews overhead\nIs utterly wrong or and here's the reason uh for the Jews to live in peace and security in the United states\nOr we need the the ideals in the uh the ideals that the founders put forth and what's best in us to be not only president but but evident\nAnd and and the Jews survive\nAnd thrive in places where there is a free exchange of ideas where everyone is regarded as part of the community and no one has written out of the story on the theory that they're not human\nAnd and what Donald Trump has done is that he has taken every thread of discord cynicism hatred and fear that has always been resident in American Life going back to the very beginning we were talking about slavery we're talking about\nThe Native Americans et cetera he's he's gathered every one of those bloody threads in his hands and rhetorically is used them to get elected\nAnd as using them to govern I'd I don't like the phrase white supremacist just because it sounds like\nToo much of rhetoric and and and propaganda but the truth is\nThat he rose to power on fear the rose to power on fear of the other\nOr whether it was a in Central Park or on the caravan or anywhere else in American Life he has an on unbelievable gift for gathering those threads together and rhetorically using them to gain power\nAnd that is a scenario that is the worst possible scenario for the Jews and indeed for everybody else in this country and that that's the concern right and there's no doubt that he is weaponized all these things politically and that's the moment that we're in\nI mean so she has no matter how he chooses to use it by virtue of being president the United states he has the most powerful a and perhaps most influential voice here but if you also look\nMore broadly I mean just a couple of examples from the past several months earlier this week before the shooting at tree of life house majority leader Kevin McCarthy put up a tweet warning\nOr that three wealthy Jewish Democrats including George Soros Michael Bloomberg will quit buying the mid term election he deleted that tweet before the shooting on Saturday but it was up there for a while I people have perhaps part of the fact that ... a Representative Steve king of Iowa in August\nAfter visiting Auschwitz\nGave an interview to a right wing Austrian party that has historical ties to Nazis you know talking about uh that he was in support of their their far right groups and that emphasizing hardliner ... immigration stance is\nUm and that the western civilizations on the decline and that he said if the is this party where in America pushing the platform they push they would be Republican\nIf the is this party where in America pushing the platform they push they would be Republican and we also have for example Senator Chuck Grassley looking to uh George Soros and saying he he can believe that soars may have funded\nThe quote unquote mobs that protesting against judge Kavanaugh silly all of these I should say justice Kavanaugh now but all of these things together to me seems to be I don't know it is it just you know political cynicism and using these conspiracy theories some of it is to believe\nBut that this is just an ecosystem that I'm Talking about here that has grown up and Donald Trump may be and how come of that ecosystem and so if if it that is the case\nUh Howard let me just turn back to you and what do we do about it I mean we even have Lou Dobbs on the day of this shooting on Saturday ... running an an ... a conversation with judicial watch where the guest says that there's a store is occupied State Department\nYeah I heard that comment about the SARS occupied State Department\nI think the only answer is leadership is voting as David Was saying uh with uh people have to get out in the in in an express their their views and their their concerns as we are are designed to do in America which is through the ballot box next week and then in the twenty twenty election\nSo voters have to an individual says to the individual by individual voting it also has to be leaders we have a paradox school system here in the sense that it's of the people by their people for the people\nAre as from the bottom up but we in order for it to work properly we need leaders of conscience and character and and and and I would say the answer is we will hear it when we hear it\nFrom from somebody or from people who come forward as leaders to to explain that America is a community and uh we're individuals and we'd prize individual ism in America ... per also community and we can't operate without that\nSo it's going to take leaders to come forward to to convince Americans as a whole that there is an answer to using fear and hatred is a way to gain power uh there's there's gotta be that's that's the only way forward\nI Will read I read ... David should have been I Know you want to get a word in here but I Do have to make some space for our callers who've been patiently waiting so let me just go briefly to Lois who's calling from Northampton, Massachusetts lowest you're on the air\nHello thank you for taking my call I'm voting I don't know about leadership um education to talk of a Jew as a conspirator somebody as they

Boston and NPR I met her body and this is on point a little over a week out from election day and the midterms are indeed heating up several states are reporting huge numbers showing up at the polls for early voting\nAnd those last minute superPAC funded ads are flooding the airwaves and other missions are typically seen as a referendum on the sitting president and certainly that is true in this case but as to the outcome particularly in Congress nothing's guaranteed\nFor all the talk of Democrats and they're blue wave Republicans are saying that that we've made crash into a red wall so this hour on point we'll check in with enlist and reporters on the final stretch of the twenty Eighteen mid term elections\nAnd you can join us what is your top issue if you had to the\nPolls next week or have you already voted in early voting and what are you hearing from the candidates in your state where one eight hundred for two three eight to five five to eight hundred\nFor two or three talk you can also join us anytime it on ... radio dot org or on Twitter and Facebook and on point radio well we'll start today in Washington with Janet Hook she's national political reporter for the wall Street Journal and it will come back to one point\nHello glad to be here and it's great to have you also joining us from Washington is Nathan Gonzales editor and publisher of inside elections which provides nonpartisan campaign analysis he's also a political analyst for CNN enroll called Nathan welcome to you as well\nOh thank you for having me so let me just get books are from both of you to your big picture taken where we are right now because there has been a lot of enthusiasm on the ground from Democrats\nHere but um do they have the momentum on their side or have things been shifting in recent days here and they let me just start with you what what do you see\nWell you know I've always kind of looked at these mid term election says to America's because when we're talking about a blue waves and two nominees and any other whether whether metaphor that you might be hearing it really doesn't apply to the Senate me in the Senate map has always kind of been in favor of\nRepublicans meaning there are more Democratic senators up for reelection more of them in red states you know in the in the bottom line I think that Republicans are most likely to\nUh maintain control the Senate and maybe even gain seats in the Senate and I could see the president sort of grasping that as as a you know does the red wave a materialized when really we've been saying for months\nBut the house was completely different story I mean it's it's a different America different battlefield where Democrats don't have to win in deep red Republican territory and I think that's where the houses were Democrats can make big games and I think at this point are still most likely to regain the majority\nHuh Interesting Janet ... are you seeing something similar out there\nI Am and ... on the question of enthusiasm I mean really I think everybody it's totally a revved up and ready to vote 'em and a lot of places they already are voting big um turnout in early voting in states that have it already\nUm for a long time the Democrats had a big enthusiasm advantage because I'm voters and people who hadn't previously been involved in politics gotten\nVoters and people who hadn't previously been involved in politics gotten very uh fired up by Trump's election and so there's been in our polling at the journal and elsewhere big enthusiasm gap between Democrats and Republicans\nAnd you can hear the CBC is cute tonight at eight o'clock on your NPR station\n[noise]\nSupport for on point comes from WB warm Boston and oddly traveled\nAll these countries specialists design trips and experience is intended to change the way into clients' either world more information is available at AU G.

turnout for early voting so what do you think that means we want to hear from you or what are you seeing from campaigns and from candidates in your state in your district in what do you hope for the outcome and he's\nCandidates in your state in your district in what do you hope for the outcome\nIn his mid term elections were at one eight hundred forty three eight to five five and I'm joined today by Janet Hook national political reporter for the wall Street Journal and they think it's all is editor and publisher of inside elections and Nathan before the break Janet was talking about how in Florida that gubernatorial race um\nIs garnering a lot of attention and potentially pulling a lot of people to the polls and we heard a caller say exactly that\nSo I was wondering if Florida serves as an example there are a couple of key states where gubernatorial races maybe yeah sort of more of the political center of gravity and who might that attracted to the polls [noise]\nYou know I think it's a specifically to Florida in specifically would kill him I mean I I think his ability if he can turn out\nA younger voters and African American voters in the mid term the way the interest in times when Democrats have struggled to turn out those voters in midterm elections I think you can have an impact of further down the ballot you know when we zooming out when we have multiple house and Senate\nYou know when we have multiple competitive races on the ballot sometimes I'm not sure which which raised with driving what about what I think is interesting about the house in the Senate map going back to the two Americas as others actually not a ton of overlap between the competitive U.S House races\nAnd uh in the Senate map in Florida is Florida is one of the the exception so that we're there are at least a handful of competitive house races but elsewhere you know the the pockets of the places where Democrats can make big house getting such as\nUm New York and California I mean they have ... races but they're not particularly competitive\nI see well let's take a quick call here and Gary is calling from Clarkson Michigan get you're on the air\nThank you for having me on back not thank you a panel or taking time from each day and I I wanted to bring up something here quickly because I Do live in a state of Michigan which obviously what threat for Donald Trump and twenty sixteen and\nYou know our neighbor one of the counties that helped Donald Trump won the election and I find too interesting thing or one interesting thing here in this day and then I have a question for you as well to back now um one thing I find interesting here in the state of Michigan is that there seems to be this consensus of white\nIs Donald Trump's economic policy going to be moving forward obviously this is a heavy manufacturing state this is a state that kind of gone through with a lot of the the deregulation that Donald Trump had gone through with the previous governor Rick Snyder but again he wasn't the kind of fiery personality that Donald Trump was and he was more so\nJust as a progressive guy who was an office there but I Want to ask you this question and in terms of\nYou know what does potentially what looked like in the state of Michigan to be a blue wave coming in or what the impact and what that leads on the state and local level here meaning for Donald Trump and the Republican Party in Michigan and twenty twenty you know this was one of the state the gang up what Dover all there is a proposal ballot ear that will potentially\nUm you know changed the district the voting districts which could blend in favor the Democrats like as in this in in the house especially in the state of Michigan and so I find it to be a very perplexing yeah eight which you know not many people seem to you know talked about when it comes to a battleground state\nGarrett ... thank you so much for your call Janet Hook what do you think I mean if if indeed there is sort of a a good democratic showing and twenty Eighteen Michigan could that have an impact on twenty twenty oh for sure\nAnd actually there if there's one state of consequences that that seems poised to have a blue wave it's probably Michigan it's only because\nUh the governor's race there is so clearly going in the Democrats' favor Gretchen which were Widmer seems to have a pretty sizable\nI'm angel leading the polls and they're sort of miscellaneous house races down ballot the incumbent senator there I'm Debbie Stabenow is pretty safe for reelection\nUm and in Michigan as in the other\nBe safe for reelection um and in Michigan as in the other um mid western states that gave Trump is margin was by such a narrow margin ahead it doesn't take much to tip that against I'm up against President Trump than twenty twenty\nYeah and then as Garrett was asking a seems a question that he's hearing a lot in Michigan are is what are we going to be the next steps for the president's economic policy in the next two years and how that might that have an impact on uh on on Michigan on on Michigan and Michigan workers\nWell it depends a lot on what happens with the terrorists that he opposed and imposed because it's just it's the economic impact of that is sort of uncertain and he alternates between a talking about imposing more ... more tariffs on the one hand or using them as a bargaining chip\nIt probably um help stabilize the the industries in Michigan that they've come to a new NAFTA style agreement\nBut um if there's one thing about Donald Trump and his policy that's safe to say it's a kind of don't know what's next\n... or or I'm not sure I'm not sure how many policies the president hold near and dear to his heart I mean I think if it's if it's not working and you know there's two years before the next presidential election of there's something about working you can just turn to do one eighty and or I were going to we're going to do something else and\nWhen it comes to Michigan or just the presidential race the twenty twenty raised in general I think a lot depends on who you who is the Democratic nominee and one of the contrast\nBetween approaches and styles and in their view on the economy as well as\nHow people feel like the the country's headed in the right direction when we get that\nRight you know and and I definitely understand how a twenty Eighteen and the midterms are connected to twenty twenty but my goodness we need to get through next week first of All right\nSo let's say let's go to Georgia because there's a bunch of really interesting races are happening down there and joining us now from Atlanta is Steven salaries political reporter for Georgia Public broadcasting we have\nA link to Stevens reporting at on point radio dot org Steven welcome to the program I met thanks for having me it's great to have you okay so I think the the big headline grabbing race in Georgia right now is that gubernatorial race between Stacey Abrams and Brian Kemp the current secretary of state\nFor Georgia what what's the latest polling show how close is this race\nWell it's a very close race there is also a libertarian candidate which matters because if either candidate doesn't get fifty percent plus one vote we could be going to a December fourth run up and polls really have the two neck and neck and have for quite a while now\nAnd so really uh every vote counts and every person counting by this point there aren't many voters that are undecided it's just whether they're going to decide to vote early or vote on election\nDay okay so this is then one of the reasons why I'm the news over the past several weeks around I'm voting rolls and purging voters from the rules has become a such a big deal in\nA ... in Georgia because of course as I just mentioned Brian Kemp if the current secretary of state for for Georgia so I just want to hear a couple of pieces of sound from last Tuesday's gubernatorial debate in Atlanta\nFirst of all we are going to hear from democratic candidates Stacey Abrams really a refuting a Brian camps that statement that he has not suppressed voters as secretary of state even though there have been reports that maybe some one hundred thousand Georgians have been purged from the rules\nThis is a man who had someone arrested for helping her blind father cast a ballot heat right at the offices of organizations to stop them from registering voters that type of voter suppression feeds the narrative because voters depression and only about blocking a vote it's also about creating an atmosphere of fear making people worried that their votes don't count\nWell at that gubernatorial debate Republican candidates secretary of state Brian Kemp said that he has quote absolutely not suppressed minority voters voters should look at the ...\nAbsolutely not suppressed minority voters\nVoters should look at the numbers and know that this is all a distraction to take away from is Abrams extreme agenda that she has for a government takeover of healthcare warning to get a scholarship to those that are here illegally in many many other radicalization\nThat's current secretary of state for Georgia Brian Kemp even fell a king give us take a minute here to walk us through this controversy in Georgia what exactly are ... has happened with voter rolls in Georgia and how important of an issue has to come in the last week of uh of campaigning before the election\nWill so the two candidates we have here really are the diametrically opposed ends of voting rights and voting access\nSecretary of state camp has done a lot to clean up the role some people say purge the roles of removing people voting there's also a record number of Georgians registered as of yesterday it was six point nine million people\nAnd the early voting numbers are higher than they've ever been before the twenty fourteen midterms were at a one point one million people that have cast a ballot early as opposed to about four hundred thousand and twenty fourteen\nBut on the other hand Stacey Abrams has dedicated a lot of her political career to getting more people to vote getting minorities to vote getting younger people to vote who haven't done and so the two have clashed over the years and it's complicated in this gubernatorial race and now there have been recent reports about a different numbers of people being\nThe adventure begins Wednesday October thirty first is nine\nYou've ventured begins Wednesday October thirty first is nine right here on double us up eighty nine points of\n\n\nSupport for on

editor and publisher of inside elections that provides nonpartisan campaign analysis Janet Hook is also with us She's national political reporter for the wall Street Journal and let's go straight to our callers there's a lot of them so Leo calling from Akron, Ohio Leo you're on the air\nMagnum pi for taking my call [noise] um we're after voters and I'm among other big top big issues I'm\nLeading up to this election and it it's just so\nUtterly ridiculous to hear these claims that these GOP lawmakers or protecting people with preexisting conditions\nWhen their votes have said just the opposite and I know that they're picking on people not paying attention to everything in the weeds leading up to the election [noise] but I mean you have the you have to be off the grid to not know that these people are attacking\nPeople with preexisting conditions\n... ... thank you for your call Janet Hook 'em your your thoughts on what we said\nWell if a\nNATO was right in talking about how central the issue health care issue is for the Democrats and if every wondered whether or not it was an important in winning issue there is nothing quite like the Republican response I think they're really nervous about the power of that issue um\nIn past for the past I don't know six elections the repeal of Obamacare has been the central I'm campaign promise for Republicans they didn't come through with that and now the healthcare system is kind of in a mess again and\nTo the extent that there is one issue that has really broad residents for people if the protections for people with pre existing condition that pre pre existing conditions that Obamacare provided yeah so the Democrats realize that and now the Republicans seemed to be realizing it too\nWell this is playing out in so many different races up across the country let's go to Nevada here where in a debate between uh the candidates for Senate in Nevada\nUh we had democratic representative Jacky Rosen who's running against incumbent Republican senator Dean Heller there and you're going to hear first a this is representative Rosen\nA asking senator Heller to tell in Nevada family and their son whose name was dean why Heller quote broke his promise to protect people like dean who have pre existing conditions\nYou promise and that you must protect their health care and that you would protect their protections from\nTesting condition\nAnd then you went back to Washington\nAnd you for your promise to cave\nSo and I want to tell you what can the camera\nAnd what they want me to ... to look them in the eyes\nReally tell them the truth\nAbout why you broke his promise and why you\nAbout why you broke his promise and why you support slashing protections for pre existing conditions why you want to hurt their son\nThat's representative Jacky Rosen who's running against in Nevada incumbent senator Republican Dean Heller and here's how ... responded to Rosen's assertions at that debate\nDifferences in turns you consider to under which are you concerned in a thousand times it's just not true I\nA roast the replacement bill for the Republican forward I don't know exactly what's real and what's your name that bill includes print existing\nTenacious housing shortage in the whole top send in the eye and tell them the trend here than it was on\nThat sort of debate a between Republican incumbent Dean Heller and democratic representative Jacky Rosen in Nevada and joining us now from Las Vegas is a million Mr Lee she's political reporter for the Nevada independent and we have links to her reporting don't point radio dot org Megan welcome to the program\nHi thanks for having me so how much is healthcare factoring into this race or between senator Heller and representative Rosen as\nWell as you just heard during that that clip it it's been a huge focal point of the race\nUm you know like like you all are talking about earlier this is something that Jackie rose and that the Democratic or a first term congresswoman has been\nReally making an issue of and the race and and what it really comes down to is the fact that there was this sort of now in summit press conference that happened last summer where a Dean Heller stood alongside our Republican governor Brian Sandoval and and they both expressed and if it can concerned about\nThe first repeal it or repeal and replace proposal that Senate Republicans have brought forward\nBut then he ended up actually voting in favor of as you know advancing repeal and replace the debate and voted in favor of one of the the repeal bill and so this has been a huge focal point of the campaign she has run\nNumerous ads against him accusing him of flip flopping on the Affordable CARE Act she had this sort of memorable ad\nAttacking holler as senator spineless featuring one of those sort of inflatable two men you might see outside an auto repair shop and accusing him of sort of blowing in the wind when it comes to the Affordable CARE Act so it's it's ... it's been a huge issue in the race\nAnd how effective has it been on the campaign trail so far I mean what are the one of the polls in this late stage telling you\nWrite that this race is still really close and you know if you listen to folk talk about it you know maybe maybe at you know Jacky Rosen should've been a little bit had given that Dean Heller was considered going into this cycle you know the most\nVulnerable Republican incumbent senator a thing reelection um you know facing reelection and a state that Hillary Clinton won\nA in twenty sixteen and so you know he was sort of a you know didn't have the edge going into the race but there are still neck and neck um you know if you look at the polls he's been a little bit ahead and some of the old um but most of them within the margin of error so\nYou know everyone is expecting that to be you know an extremely close race and come down to the wire so I think you know the big question and and what remains to be seeing as how that message resonates with ... you know non ... than are independent voters here\nUm you know whether they do have that significant concern about health care and from what we've seen health care really at the top issue for voters here in Nevada and they're like oh\nWell a nation Gonzales a little earlier in the air you were talking about how there are certain there's a there's a possible outcome where Republicans gained seats in the Senate but this is one of those places where they are looking for someone vulnerable to what are you seeing in Nevada\nI think I'm One of the reasons why people would be sort of a chance to gain seats which I'm not convinced a detail is going to lose you could do much for much of a cycle that I really you know we had it as a tourist we I think we've and it's a toss up for the whole\nThe whole reason we're probably G but there are ... in the back of my mind like you know I I think he's still going to I think it's going to lose and so that matters to math but if he's if he\nI think it's going to lose and so that it matters to mouth but if he's if he hangs on or maybe Republicans hang on to Jeff which open seat in Arizona\nThen you know that increases or ability to actually gain seats foot event has been interesting in a plug for the Nevada independent from Megan in her boss John and in the show and the whole team because they know Nevada better than anyone\nWhich which struck me is how ... has been more of a slog for Democrats from what I expected you just like well to Hillary Clinton state but Republicans have a chance to hold the governorship Dean Heller is a chance to be reelected there's two\nCompetitive congressional districts that Democrats are defending ... district and the fourth district which is open as well and I think Democrats voted to spend more time and energy to move and money and they would have wanted to hold those seats so it's kind of I think were this was mid term that enough presidential in mid June advantage tends to be more Republican\n... what do you think about that\nI think that's that's exactly right and that's one of the interesting thing we've been sort of keeping an eye on so far as you know turn out it is much better for Democrats with early voting which start at a little over a week ago hearing about it than better than it was in twenty fourteen which we saw a complete red weighing in Nevada\nAnd Republican slapped at you know control all of the state's constitutional officers\nOf the legislature on the competitive how the I truly was you know a red wave which which stands in such a stark contrast to what happened and twenty sixteen um but but that point is exactly right you know Democrats traditionally don't perform at while during the term elections and that's really going to come down to you know\nAll that effort they are cutting in with their ground game to try and get folk to turn out with the help of the powerful coronary union here um which is part of what's known as the Reid machine are started by you know obviously former science archives leader Harry Reid\nUm you know under heads his tenure at the big question is can can Democrats you know make this look a little bit more like a presidential year as opposed to to the ... midterm year in which they they traditionally don't ferrets\nSuch as as such an interesting thought that the midterm Nevada mid term any state might be different than president the the ... state in the presidential year but one question for you\nMaking I mean here we are just a week to go before the midterms and I heard you say that you know I'm obviously there's a lot of question around whether what direction certain voters might go independent voters in Nevada et cetera but\nHow much uh it's the uncertainty right now is it is it that like are there are people still out there making up their minds based on certain issues or maybe last minute campaign stops or is it simply a get out the vote question now because I'm just like who out there still doesn't know how they're going to vote in Nevada\nFind out how to live ... million dollar gift could mean jobs for us up students I'm an excellent university

I Wonder how you view kind of the phenomenon of of sites like Gavin job is not the only place where this kind of speech to lift weights on line it is worth noting since our program one a as named after the first amendment the first amendment lesson\nHate speech is protected by the first amendment you were allowed to make hateful nasty vitriolic comments\nIncitement to violence tends to be the line whereby speech becomes curtailed so there is a case for protecting this kind of hateful rhetoric but rabbi Jacobs the Internet has given to the new kind of\nSpeed and ... that I can only imagine makes makes encounters like what happened in Pittsburgh all the more worrisome to folks like you\nShort well first of all it's not news that hate speech can lead to violent actions the book of proverbs teaches us that death and life or in the hands of the tongue and that unfortunately\nHas become more and more true is seeing how true that ancient wisdom is particularly over the last two years but certainly over thousands of years of history\nAnd it's true that hate speech is protected speech that said that doesn't mean that every privately owned platform has to give everybody the right to speak to such hate speech\nSo it's different when we're talking about the government controlling speech then when we're talking about whether everybody has the right to say whatever they want wherever they want on whatever platform they want [noise]\nI also just wanted to say something about the ... that one of the to respond to one of the Facebook comments that you read\nThere has been particularly over the last couple of days certainly over the last couple of years a lot of ... and it's true of course that their corners of the left where there is anti Semitism it's true that there's anger\nBut we've seen nothing like the white nationalism that we've seen from the right and what's crucial is not the question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right\nThe question of where there's more hate I think it's clear that there's more hate on the right against Jews against people of color against algae ... people against immigrants refugees et cetera and what's crucial is that that is being\nThat that hatred is being supported nimble than from the very top when the president of the United states that the white nationalists see him as an ally they see him as somebody who will come out after Charlottesville and talk about the very fine people on both sides\nAnd that's what's crucial we don't have a situation in which we have somebody\nOn the last two is in charge we have somebody on the right who is the president of the United states and who is at the very least winking at the white nationalist the racist anti Semite sometimes retreating them sometimes putting out content like the very last campaign ad before the election in which he\nHighlighted George Soros Janet Yellen and Lloyd Blankfein and suggested that they were a part of some large conspiracy pulling the levers of power and the United states which of course trap the taps into very old anti Semitic tropes ... yeah\nIt was a ... I'm Sorry where am I but I Do want to get a little deeper into that\nA lot of thought a lot of our listeners have been trying to get on that and endure I'd love to to get your thoughts with that on that I mean the president did address this during a speech at the future farmers of America convention in Indianapolis on Saturday he began his speech by talking about the shooting\nToday with one unified voice we condemn the historic evil of anti Semitism and every other forms of\nEvil and unfortunately the vote comes in many forms and we come together as one American people\nPart of the president's opening of his speech to the future farmers of America in Indianapolis over the weekend but contrast that with what the president tweeted this morning she wrote quote\nThere is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly\nThat will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must end unquote gotten a number of comments from some of you about the president's potential room when all of this Susan as in Silver Spring Maryland right outside of DC Susan writes\nI look forward to the day when we once again have a president who understands and always considers but his or her statements have far reaching consequences Indira I'd well\nThis was of course incredibly disturbing to have the president once again demonizing the press and calling us enemies of the people\nAnd the thirteenth annual tests Schofield the screen is back that as a boy he'll nature park in South St Pete\nThis his W us after

questions and comments Constance in Silver Spring Maryland writes I Know this sounds weird but I actually feel some hope\nAfter the massacre it was obvious that the bigoted crude and hateful language from prominent people would end in tears we were told it was just trumping Trump telling it like it is you could be as prejudiced and root as he liked it was his right under the first amendment it wasn't his fault people looked on him as a role model\nNow that everyone sees the consequences we can all mobilize against hate speech and hate crimes and frankly it's about time [noise]\nAsia W tweets hate speech is free speech if we're going to live in a free society that's how it has to be but legally acceptable behavior isn't necessarily morally or socially acceptable behavior we can fight back against hate speech with our own words are votes and our money\nAce in Chapel Hill North Carolina writes real media has to start calling out outlets like Fox News for their lives and propaganda that enables hate speech to be propagated\nNPR and other rational sources have to call out the president's lies and distortions\nThere needs to be consistent strong resistance to the hateful divisive speech that is anti American journalists need to be less accommodating end quote unquote fair to all opinions and stop repeating without strong criticism of the president's ignored rants if not you who make America kind\nFrance if not you who make America kind again\nLet's get back to the phones and again thanks to those of you who have been patient with us on the phones we know that screening has been tough today but we've had to screen very hard with some of the people who felt like sharing their comments on our air we won't hear from those folks but we will hear from David who's here in Washington DC Hey David what's on your mind\nI'm well thanks so much for having the show I um\nI guess I'm I'm speaking as someone who's both religious ... and also very much scientific I think there's a strong feeling among a lot of us that there has been a a much lower acceptance on the left of people who have a strong religious views\nAnd a close connection state of Israel I mean I teach at a a small school here in the city and or in this in the suburbs and a lot of her students do feel uncomfortable because you have to feel that um\nYou know if they express a\nStrong here instead of Israel or especially religious views that aren't um you know but I mean about hot button social issues but as their religious views that they won't be accepted and I think that that's something that that needs to be talked about to um\nYou David how how do you deal with it when it comes up on on your campus can you give us an example of how it shows up and and how you were home schooled deals with it\nWell I mean we're Jewish religious school so you know for us you know what we\nMean there are students who are you know are not particularly\nStrongly support of Israel in one way or the other but um when our students leave this school and they often find their campuses unfriendly they find professors especially a friendly if they want to express a pro Israel standpoint and uh\nSo I mean while it's true I mean I don't think it's reasonable to say that you're seeing a lot of violence from the left and that that's true I think you are saying and I think our students feel certain intolerance 'em when they go to college\nUm and it's you know I don't know we we tell we do tell kids they probably should need need to shut up you know and I don't say shut up that you know you can't argue with that we're\nJust kind of how you're going to have to learn to live with that to kind of pick your battles I think that's a hard thing yeah to pick their battles I mean I I don't speak for the school uh but I've certainly advised students to do that and not the not settle everything will David ... book can be can be very hard\nTo David let me put that to you for sharing that let me put that to rabbi Jill Jacobs rubber what do you make of David comment\nThank you David I wanted to respond both to you and to Stephanie who are speaking about one of the the same phenomenon really I wanted to say Seventy first on really sorry that your son is going through that unfortunately it's not unusual these days but of course at high school students shouldn't have to experience that kind of hatred\nAnd for both of you I Want to be very clear that there certainly is anti Semitism and I'll laugh and very often it expresses itself as it\nAs a tax on Israel on Israel's right to exist now that's different from saying that criticism of Israel's policy is it anti Semitic which it's not even criticize any countries policies but often that criticism of Israel crosses a line into anti Semitism [noise]\nAnd as an organization that is pro Israel and also critical of many of his trials governmental policies that we are all the time speaking out against the places on the left where\nWhere that criticism crossing the line and we have to be really clear about where those places are I have an article actually in the Washington Post that tries to lay out some of the places in which criticism of Israel is not criticism of a country and its policy it's rather crosses over into\nStraight up anti Semitism and unfortunately we have seen incidents around the world in which there are people who carry out who carry out violent\nThe world in which there are people who carry out who carry a violent acts and say that they are motivated by hatred of Israel but the targets are actually choose who are shopping in a grocery store and the Jewish store and that's in a God\nAnd at the same time in the United states right now again saying that we have to call out that anti Semitism the left what's different about the anti Semitism and other hatred a race racism and homophobia and seeing a phobia on the right is that it's being supported by the government\nIt would be different if we had a situation in which there was hatred on the left hatred on the right and somebody at the top who is trying to restore who's ... who is criticizing\nAny kind of hatred and who is trying to restore civil discourse to the U. S. then said we have somebody at the very top who is encouraging the hatred on the right and riling up his people\nGet to a few more of your comments as we continue our conversation which has many of your calls as we can as well Stacy wrote on our Facebook page\nI Am emotionally exhausted I was in my own synagogue on Saturday when I heard the news I was looking forward to going to synagogue to escape the news of the week now there is no escape and no sanctuary but as our ancient rabbis teachers the world is a narrow bridge and the main thing to remember is not to be afraid\nLynn wrote on our Facebook page yesterday's interfaith service in Pittsburgh filled me with hope\nVarious religious leaders offered support strengths and loved to a community crushed by its loss if anything is going to change we citizens must make it happened last night's fellowship help to bind our wounds and set us on the path for making our town better Indira would you react to that I feel like part of what worked [laughter]\nI hate to say in Pittsburgh favor but one of the things I think helped in this whole process as you described scroll hill is it's the kind of community that had these ties long before this happened so that people who needed to come together already had so in crisis struck they just they just rolled out and they knew how to lock arms with one another\nThat's right I mean a squirrel hill is a very ... this is one factor is a very educated community um it's right next to CMU Carnegie Mellon University in pit\nAnd a lot of the people who live and scroll hill are um you know doctors lawyers professors teachers accountants dentist it's an educated community a tolerant community and Pittsburgh overall\nIs also um you know politically a liberal community and it voted something like between Seventy and eighty percent for Hillary Clinton and the last election even though Pennsylvania\nUm went for Donald Trump so the community of Pittsburgh overall and the mayor I'm Bill ... has been you know talking about tolerance for a long time and that is the history of the city so that's why I Would say yes it did help and Pittsburgh's favor but\nYou know all of the negative rhetoric that we have coming um we were talking about the end of the enemy at the people line earlier that the president tweeted this morning I'm we now know that a bomb was apparently headed for CNN was just intercepted today in Atlanta\nJust four months ago and attack or killed five reporters and Annapolis newsroom the capital Gazette so you know I I Do think we have to worry about drawing the line\nUm I mean meaning there is a line between hateful rhetoric and I'm hateful actions because of group polarization that happened\nTo tiger wood and beer description CNN is reporting that as suspicious package that was addressed to CNN was intercepted a post office in Atlanta view investigation I don't think has at least you'll do it any public information in terms of what was in the package whether it was similar to the ones\nThat were sent last week but that story is just kind of breaking as of this morning let's get to a few more of your calls and comments including one from\nLet's get to a few more of your calls and comments including one from Pittsburgh where Lee is on the line highly what's on your mind\nOr Joshua how you doing today\nSure what what's on your mind how ... how are your neighbors doing after all this\nThat is coming up in one hour at three o'clock we hope you'll join us this is W.

a colleague revealed that winds dean had tried to rape her last year Perkins broke her confidentiality agreement after about Twenty years of keeping her coworkers secret here she is in an interview with the BBC\nThan than that no disclosure clean that had the ... and ... thanks side um but it's way too many important legislation is changed around how these agreements and ... you cannot have an equal document that protect\nTheir criminal many state lawmakers agree with ms Perkins this year in the wake of the me too and time's up movement Tennessee Vermont and Washington state among others passed laws banning certain kinds of confidentiality agreements\nOther states including Maryland and California passed laws that expands sexual harassment protections to workers like freelancers\nIt's another example of states taking action while Congress makes promises and remains deadlocked\nToday we'll discuss these new state laws and what impact they could have on workers and employees it's the final part of our special series the state where in where we've been focusing on the bills and initiatives that are trending in state capitals\nJoining us here in Studio to discuss it is Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center\nThe organization administers the time's up legal Defense Fund\nWhich assists with sexual harassment cases

Elizabeth welcome thanks for having me and Suzanne ... teen is the program director of the employment labor and retirement program at the national conference of state legislatures in Denver Suzanne thanks for making time for us yes things\nState legislatures in Denver Suzanne thanks for making time for us yes things fat and\nWe'd also love to make time for you particularly if you've had experience with sexual harassment sexual abuse and felt like the law did or did not protect you if the law did not protect you in your state what went wrong or perhaps what did the laws in your state do write\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one a or email one a at W. A. M. U. dot for Emily Martin before we get into the state laws let's talk about the federal sexual harassment laws who do they cover and who don't become so when you look\nAt workplace sexual harassment laws um titled seven as the federal law that said that you can't discriminate based on sex and that includes harassing people on the basis of sex\nBut title seven only covers you if your employer has at least Fifteen employees so if you work for a very small employer federal law doesn't protect you against sexual harassment\nAnd title sudden also only covers employees so that means if you're an independent contractor if you're a freelancer maybe if you're a volunteer or an unpaid intern that you aren't protected by our federal sexual harassment law\nShe was in a whole team the number of states including Vermont and New York in Delaware have expanded sexual harassment protections to apply to more workers tell us a little bit about more tell us a little bit more about which states are expanding protections and who they're covering\nYeah definitely so we've seen at least twenty states introduce legislation and twenty Eighteen on workplace sexual harassment and the majority of the states I have introduced legislation other relates to limiting or prohibiting nondisclosure agreements or ending first arbitration agreement so\nWe've seen states are so far enact legislation on that area including Arizona Maryland New York Tennessee California and he mentioned Vermont and Washington\nAnd other states are also looking addict standing training requirements\nUm so how many hours messed a employees are employers um require training and so we've seen legislation on that path in um California is just one example of that\nElizabeth tipping I'd love to hear from you about some workers like freelancers and contractors who may or may not be protected by these laws we heard from the inner ear is already who told NPR she was sexually harassed on two separate occasions when she was a contract worker once while singing in a band and once while working as a tutor\nShe says she could not report the incidents to a chart and as a contract worker she had no employer to sue\nI thought about it and I was like I don't want to put that on my social media it can change your reputation I really wish I could have protecting myself in both situation there just I feel like I Would have had an accent that agency and and what it felt in control of my life\nProfessor tipping how common is this for freelancers in the in a situation\nI Do think it's really important to extend protections for independent contractors and that's because employers have no incentive\nTo provide a remedy an internal fix for contractors if they're not even covered by the laws at all\nSo even basic protections are like your caller referenced like being able to use the employers hotline being able to use the employers complaints system the employer is not going to be interested in extending those the contractors unless they're covered by the laws\nWere speaking to Elizabeth typically associate professor at the University of Oregon school of law suits and whole team program director for employment labor and retirement at the national conference of state legislatures and Emily Martin the vice president for education and workplace justice at the national Women's Law center Emily I'd love you to react to a comment that came in\nPlace justice at the national Women's Law center Emily I'd love you to react to a comment that came in from Charlotte\nCharlotte emailed I Am a Florida based graduate student at Boston University this year ... required all students all staff and all faculty to complete a sexual assault training course\nI had no idea how many legal terms are associated with such a difficult subject it's complicated without this require training I Would never have known about my rights as a Floridian much less where to look\nEmily this is rather complicated although some states including Delaware Illinois California have passed laws expanding sexual harassment training and the education requirements for for some employers\nThat is true we have seen that share and generally seen a lot of policymaker energy in the states around the issue of our place harassment which is exciting that they've been new creative [noise]\nUm well to bear thinking about how do we really solve this problem and one of the things that lawmakers have focused on ads\nRequiring training or expanding training requirements again under federal law there is no requirement per se that employers train employees on sexual harassment a lot of employers do but it's not because I'm federal law makes them do it\nNow we don't know as much as we wish we did about what sorts of training are really affected what sorts of training really make a difference in changing behavior\nSo one of the things that I Hope comes from the long overdue attention she workplace harassment is some attention to learning more about what kinds of training can really make change in the workplace\nYeah I I Do want to put that to you professor tipping also in terms of what you think makes the biggest difference I mean there's a certain kinds of training or the other new kinds of state laws that you think would be the most effective in reducing harassment well when you think\nAbout me to you as a sign of a broken system you want to attack all of the aspects of them so part of it might be that our laws in general do not really hold employers accountable when there is harassment in the workplace but it's relatively easy especially under federal law firm ways to get out of them\nAnd a lot of states have really low caps on damages though if you through your employer the maximum amount of money that you can get from them you know in some states might be fifty thousand dollars that's not much of a deterrent for employers who are trying to decide how much to invest in their system to address harassment\nFind out how to ... million dollar gift could mean jobs for us up students I'm an excellent university Wednesday at seven forty five AM and again at five forty

to strengthen protections against sexual harassment\nWas Emily Martin of the national Women's Law center Suzanne whole scene of the national conference of state legislatures\nAnd University of Oregon law school assistant professor associate professor Elizabeth typically we woke up some more of your questions and thoughts as well especially if the laws in your state that deal with sexual harassment sexual abuse worked for you or failed you we'd love to hear your story or even just your questions about the way these laws work\nComments on our Facebook page tweet us at one eighty or email won a a W. A. M. U. dot org Emily Martin I Love to get your reaction to what we heard from California state senator ... sounds like ... California is\nTrying to do quite a bit to improve the way that we prevent and prosecute sexual harassment what do you think I agree that\nCalifornia's been a real leader in his face those with the laws that um we just heard about that were passed last last session as well as if you love that unfortunately we're vetoed by the governor that would have expanded the statute of limitations for bringing a workplace sexual harassment claim\nYou know in under federal law it's often as short as a hundred and eighty days from the date of the harassment when you have to bring a claim and given that we're talking about\nI'm Talking about activity that really leaves people traumatized that is not enough time off and for people to figure out what they need to do how they want to do it to find their attorney to find out how they can take action\nSo you know we joined the national news lots and are joined with more than two hundred and fifty other organizations this week\nCalling for twenty states by twenty twenty to pass comprehensive sexual harassment protections and California I think it's really a beacon for other states and thinking about how can they strengthen their lives and meaningful way\nAnd thinking about how can they strengthen their lives and meaningful way spending states Emily that you're targeting in particular [noise]\nWell I think that one of the things that we've seen this past year is that it's not just progressive states for example Tennessee a past new prohibitions on employers requiring employees to sign non disclosure agreement that the condition of coming to work that would ah\nKeep employees from talking about sexual harassment when it happened and\nSo we're really thinking broadly that this is a nationwide problem that requires a nationwide solution\nSuzanne ... your thoughts on what we heard from state senator Jackson\nYeah I think that's a great example of a legislators I'm really trying to grapple with how to deal with sexual harassment in the workplace and and I'm introduced a lot of different types of legislation to get out that I think we've seen a lot of creative um pieces of legislation in other states one thing that I\nDid want to mention is Illinois has a really interesting piece of legislation where they created a sexual harassment hotline which is the first time that we've seen that across the states and that provides legal assistance as well as as a way to report sexual harassment or place in private and public sector\nBefore we keep going I Would note that quite a few of you have commented to us today about state laws that are aimed at statute of limitations laws we did an entire hour not too long ago discussing just that very topic\nYou can find that conversation on statute of limitations on line at the one a dot org vets the words are the number one the letter a dot org Susan let me stick with you we mentioned nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements you mentioned the state of Tennessee\nCalifornia, Maryland and other states have also banned certain kinds of those agreements and in a number of states those laws passed unanimously\nOwners who's in if we can begin to the line of where nondisclosure agreements come into play I mean they're not inherently illegal they can have a purpose\nIn contracts I work in news a lot of people who work in journalism have certain kinds of contracts about disclosing privileged information Venice wrote on our Facebook page\nThere is a place for legitimate nondisclosure agreements however you does a disservice to our communities when they're used to hide illegal behavior I Would be comfortable with laws that allowed anyone to speak with law enforcement in such cases regardless of the existence of this agreement Suzanne\n[noise] yes so that's interesting and I will say that states are not all states in their legislation specify these contracts as nondisclosure agreements and sometimes they just called them contracts um or other types of agreements\nMost of the legislation that we've seen us specifically says nondisclosure as it relates to sexual harassment in the workplace so it wouldn't necessarily band nondisclosure in great agreements and hold but just as it relates this specifically to sexual harassment in the workplace\nProfessor typically ... before we move on to too much for there can you just define that term force what exactly is a non disclosure agreement what exactly do they do well\nThere's actually two types there's the type that you mentioned that people find that the start of their employment that says keep our information confidential and there was another type of people find usually after they're already involved in a lawsuit or they've hired a lawyer\nAnd those are to settle the person's legal claims and those are the ones I think that had become most problematic because in those cases it's clear that some sort of bad conduct to the current or if you did and in those cases both parties might agree that they're not going to talk about the facts underline the case\nFor someone who speak with you for me though I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of the line for confidentiality agreements or help for hurtful in terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you have said\nIn terms of dealing with sexual harassment I understand that you have said that they may not be enforceable because they may be some there maybe some contradictions with federal law but I Would gather that sometimes they can be in the best interest of the person who's been sexually harassed where do you see the line\nWell\nFor the contract you sign at the start of your job I think it's helpful to have a law that makes clear that does can't cover sexual harassment or other forms of harassment or discrimination because essentially forces the employer to disclose in the contract\nThat keep our business information confidential but if you experience unlawful conduct you're allowed to talk about that though the contracting away educate the employees about their rights\nIt's a lot more complicated though if you're talking about settling a lawsuit because in that case many times the person who's represented by a lawyer and I've heard plaintiff lawyers say that they like these provisions 'cause it's moved the path toward the settlement\nAnd I think that's kind of hard about that the people who maybe have the most interests and learning this information aren't at a table future backed and potential victims of harassment they don't have a say and whether the victim and the employer decided to keep the information secret\nLet's get to some of your comments and questions Alex tweeted earlier this year in the army I got sexually harassed by another soldier luckily we have to go through sharp training every year we all like to make fun of it we make fun of it to the point where and when I actually had to use it I knew exactly what to do\nStuff on emailed my girlfriend works for a college in upstate New York while in Chicago for work conference a resident of Illinois sexually assaulted her despite my encouragement she is terrified of coming forward for fear of retribution do laws across state lines especially in Illinois and New York\nComplicate the legalities that would otherwise helped bring perpetrators to justice Emily Martin what would you say there's definitely\nA great question if you're talking about state law protections that go above and beyond set our ally yet there can be complicated questions that arise if the person aid usually employed and Wednesday but the harassing or assaults and behavior what in another\nBut it's important to remember that we're talking about state law stay in the ways in which states are going above and beyond federal protection is there are core federal protection they should be strengthening various lead\nThat their core federal protections against what play sexual harassment against sexual harassment and schools and so that as a baseline that covers everybody with the important exemptions that we've talked about\nBut no matter what the ... they live in\nA suit and I'd love to get your take on one of the states that did not pass at least one of its proposed bills on sexual harassment and that was in Louisiana it had to do with settlements of sexual harassment cases Louisiana State House bill five seven eight would have stopped employers\nFrom forcing workers to settle sexual harassment disputes through arbitration state representative Raymond cruise voted against the bill among other things the rep said it would open up litigation for everything\nRight now are considered one of the most with ... states and the nation's one source I just looked up said we're number six six out of fifty own worst states for litigation\nMatter of fact if you divide the country into five four regions the south has one hundred eighty six\nCases like that her ten thousand people the next
