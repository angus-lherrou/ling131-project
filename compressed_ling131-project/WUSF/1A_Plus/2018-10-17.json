E. N. G. A. G. E. dot com [noise]\nThis is on point I'm making a trucker ... we're talking about students for fair admissions versus Harvard it's a federal court case going on right now that alleges that Harvard University may discriminate against Asian American students\nBut a lot of people are looking at this case saying really what's on trial is affirmative action and we're joined today by Peter would he's president of the national association of scholars there are a group that filed an amicus brief this summer in support of students for fair admissions\nRules are joined by Nicole gone ... she's a supervising attorney at Asian Americans advancing\nJustice or an Nicole gone over to you you just got a quick a quick hit there right at the end of the the previous segment so pick up on your thought I mean ... what do you see this case really as and and do you see any credence or any evidence that Harvard\nDiscriminates against Asian Americans as the plaintiffs are alleging\nShore so I'm\nAn Asian American civil rights lawyer that fights discrimination and racism against Asian Americans every day in a variety of contacts [noise] of course I Would be concerned about discrimination against Asian Americans and Harvard's admissions process\nNow the claim here is intentional discrimination and while I Do see that there is some negative effect on Asian Americans in the admissions process based on the data that I have seen\nI Do not think that it is at all related to the consideration of race in the admissions process\nNor do I think that it is\nIntentional discrimination I think there is a disparate impact for Asian Americans do two legacies and other preferences that\nPredominantly a benefit white privileged applicants and I also don't think Asian Americans are alone and experiencing the disparate impact on of those policies but can I just jump in here because it's clear because the plaintiffs\nAllege that they they see evidence in the thousands of pages of documents that have been released during discovery in this trial the D.C evidence that\nOf that of a either a disk of discrimination or at least biased against Asian American students in one of the four factors that are that Harvard uses in in admissions they've you know they look at academics that look at extracurricular they look at athletics and they look at\nUm this is this thing called a a personal which is a character and and it's in that personal category that they said ... harbor chose a pattern of marking down Asian American students for for no real reason other than\nPerhaps bias shore somebody address the personal score issue I think there's a number of things to consider about the personal score so first statistically\nThey're saying that Asian Americans are consistently rated lower on the personal score but that's because\nAre consistently rated lower on the personal score but that's because of how the Oregon they organized the data so they organize the data by academic death dial which is Ninety nine percent based on SAT scores and GPA\nAnd they're saying that\nAnd the students and the highest ... who are you know Asian American or whatever they're getting ... lower ... personal scores than other racial groups\nBut I think that it's a mistake to organize that data by academic dial because it doesn't necessarily correlate just because someone anyone Asian American or otherwise\nScores high on the SATs doesn't mean that their application is demonstrating all of these personal qualities and so actually if you don't organize it by academic that style than there is no stick statistically significant difference\nOkay Peter would let me turn back to you and sort of a step back here for ... big picture because twice or in terms of when affirmative action has been taken all the way to the United States Supreme court\nIn Nineteen Seventy eight in the ... case and in two thousand three and grab the ball injure Harvard's admission process seeds have actually been highlighted by the justices as the way to use\nRacial factors in admissions at the right way to ease racial factors in admissions and that it's not a deciding factor because\nUh there are many thousands of qualified applicants but it it could be a factor that used in in the entire mix here it was held up as as as the right way to do it so what's what's the problem now that you see\nWell first of all the the ... the tapes and Nineteen Seventy eight was fractured opinion the court split for for one one was Lewis Powell who was Powell was the only one who looked harbored\nAnd fought to its approach to diversity ought to be compelling no other justice agreed with him at that point\nThat remained in the category of Supreme Court ducked the all the way to solve them three when in the ... case\nSandra Day O'Connor decided to resurrect polls eccentric opinion and make a blog land\nSo now the U.S Supreme Court house and not instance said that the pursuit of diversity taking some code of racial preferences\nWould be a a suitable thing the colleges and universities could do not that they had to do it but that they could win and that's where the law stands on this was reaffirmed in the Fisher case with few years ago\nOn what's at stake here is what's been the steak all along which is should the United states be a country that ... law the land that is titled six of the\nCivil rights act like teen sixty four that no person in the United states shell on the grounds with race color or national origin be excluded from participation in are denied the benefits to be\nA word to be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance as far as ending affirmative action we could say the Harvard does have other options\nYou could take the option of saying we no longer want to receive federal aid therefore we're willing to put our money aside in order to discriminate because we'd like to discriminate\nAnother option is that Harvard which has a dominant meld thirty nine point one billion dollars could expand and men are the could accommodate students who are qualified and rightly long in as good as students uh\nNicole gone to what you want to give you a chance to respond to that\nFor sure so I Do want to push back against on this notion that Asian Americans are definitively being discriminated against and I want to do that\nCans are definitively being discriminated against and I want to do that by sort of talking about the admissions process so I think it is a fiction that\nEvery other score or every other consideration in the admissions process is objective and\nI think there's a lot of research that establishes that that SAT scores and grade even extracurricular activities to some extent\nSystematically penalize black and Latino students on and some subgroups of Asian American students as well and so I think to sort of look at the admissions process and to look at the personal score as the only one that\nCould be potential Tobias it incorrect because all of these doctors are in perfect all of them to some extent are vulnerable to implicit exquisite biased and the case of SAT scores systematic discrimination against certain\nUm [noise] you know racial groups\nAnd so I don't think that the remedy for any of this\nIs to eliminate the consideration of race but it is actually to have race consciousness and a lot of scholars would tell you that the way to remedy discrimination is to consider race and to make sure that these um that racial groups are treated unfairly compared to ...\nOkay so I Want to take a step back here and actually bring in the voice of Harvard University itself because back in July or I had a chance to sit down with Harvard president Larry back out right at the beginning of his his presidency at Harvard\nAnd and we had a long conversation with a link to that whole conversation or at on point radio dot org but I'm going to play an excerpt here for you because I began by\nAsking Larry back out again Harvard's president about what he sees as the overall mission of harbors admissions process and is and what it should be an and here's what back out said\nThe admissions process should try to construct a class to bring together a group of students in a residential learning environment which optimized who's the opportunity for them to learn not just from the faculty bought from each other\nAnd diversity is an important component of that because we learn from our differences\nI'm a trainer will visit puppy clubs at USF Tampa

thanks for taking my call and high magna I'd really love your program\nI'm calling I'm a with this comment and I have a question at the end and a comment is that I'm In my career where I live here in New York City I worked in a new show for my career I'm retired now\nAnd I see the school system in this city public versus the exceptional schools as apartheid structured\nAnd the other part of this comment is that when you look at the African American community and the history of African Americans in this country that are African Americans have like a ... a of four hundred year deficit and\nPursuing I'm a equity in this country and that's reflected in our schools are going to most of the public schools in this in the city of New York or you don't see Asian and white\nCivil how are you what are you saying that you believe affirmative action is needed then to a level that field to write historical inequities\nYes I yes I Do and I think that um I'm an Asian Americans who are dissatisfied with their percentage at a Harvard or have their heads in the sand or at Harvard ... less than fifty percent of the student body is is African American\nLet me take it back to me on on on that point and forgive me for interrupting but there are a lot of voices we want to join us\nBack to me on on on that point and forgive me for interrupting but there are a lot of voices who want to join so I'm very much appreciate your call oh let's get a different perspective from DJ who's calling from Norwich, Connecticut DJ you're on the air\nThank you for having me on this morning um as far as for singles you know I think a lot of implicit bias has to do with some of these things I mean\nYes if it wasn't for affirmative action some things would have never been able to take place but it isn't in the race balancing but it doesn't necessarily mean that that's off of the good you know I grew up in Palm Beach County Florida\nAnd maybe the African American myself I went through some of his throat high school and elementary school or I couldn't Lewis on my own right there in my community I live the bus way over here because of what a million black students going over there\nAnd my sisters following through the same thing and and during the eighties early seventies where it would be very violent things that I made sure\nAnd I mean I don't I don't I don't know that made it uh it says a double sided coin you know and as far as like with Asian Americans with Harvard I think it has to do with the as far as like some of the personal criteria that needs to be in order to get into the school\nI think that it has to do with the fact ah\nFrom my experience of them a lot of people and experience so I yeah I Know about the Asian community they're not very inclusive of and so I think they may have something to do with the about the personal effects but at the same time I think that is a testament to how well versed they are and how much they are all about the academics as opposed to some of those others\nOkay did you have anything to get back to be there a mud thank you so much for your call Nicole gung ho chi let me just go to you quickly because even though I feel like a I mean uh uh did you was talking about his experience as an African American male or\nIn this country he also then sort of made some presumptions about the Asian American community as well I just wanted to give you a chance to respond to that\n[noise] sure um yeah I mean I don't really agree ah with DJ that as a group Asian Americans are not very inclusive or you know are more about academic than um than anything else I think that is a stereotype and I think that\nKind of stop Bush is why we need\nThe policies like affirmative action because our country and so segregated that people don't have the opportunity to interact with each other and to break down those stereotypes and that is\nOne of the points of considering race in admissions process and to have a diverse student body act in colleges is though that these barriers can be broken down and what you heard\nFrom DJ it was probably the result of him not actually having that many interactions with Asian Americans along the lines of what Mohammed that that there is an apartheid system in our public\nSchools So Peter would let me turn back to you here because I just want to get down and I and we're going to I'm going to ask this question of Nicole as well but she's already spoken about how she believes diversity is is part of what's core to\nAn essential and I experienced on American college campuses but if you were to have your druthers what would be the basis upon which colleges and universities in America admits students\nWould admit students on the basis of proven ability aptitude determination self discipline the qualities that make for someone who can undertaker rigorous college curriculum and the full range of things that go on in college who lives in to the maximum\nAre aren't they always did to determine a determination et cetera aren't those are very objectively measured though\nWell they can be objectively measured but there are certainly objective qualities involved in it as well students who do well in their academics through grade school and high school and who have transcript showing the the excess\nThrough grade school and high school in ... trench group showing the food sold in the courses that are available to them and have gone beyond those courses or showing the determination that does not close to a matter of somebody subjective opinion about it but it's actually illustrated in their large lived up to the\nPoint okay because I keep going back to what Edward Blum the men who is really the force behind this case what he said in two thousand Fifteen that he said the goal of these lawsuits is to eliminate the consideration of race in application so he needed plaintiffs he needed Asian plaintiffs now now Edward Blum has a long history of\nAgain bringing cases against affirmative action to the Supreme Court he also challenged the Nineteen sixty five voting rights act in Shelby County view holder\nOr and and won that case that the Supreme Court of getting on the court to overturn a very key part of the voting rights act\nHe's been focused on race a lot in America but but what I mean Harvard uses a athletics as part of it's a admissions process is why why should athletes have twice as much chance to get into Harvard as anybody else what does that have to do with\nTheir merits there or what about legacy admissions why not bring a case against\nA students who may have a leg up simply because they had a family member who went to Harvard University I mean if you look there's a lot of other issues apart from race\nThat a separate that the housing that has not have not in the way Harvard admit admit students\nWell Harvard may be making ... decisions when it comes to the preferences gives her legacies for people in ... but those are decisions so the private university republic one for that matter are free to make\nSo why do they make the decisions also then based on what they see as a mix of students that they need to bring it to have a diverse campus\nBecause this country passed a law through Congress signed by president upheld by numerous Supreme courts which is ... it'd be a title six of the um [noise]\nA Nineteen sixty four law and that just makes it plain that to this country discriminating on the basis of race is no go don't do it\nNow if Congress were to pass a law that says we're not going to give preferences for athletes who would be strange law but no such law currently exist this is about Bain law\nI see okay so let's go to another caller Eli is calling from Steven city Virginia Eli you're on the air\nI like now I just wanted to call in because I think a lot of the narrative around this case has been saying that Asian Americans don't believe in affirmative action um a lot of people in the Asian community I Do believe in an affirmative action um East Asian American Woman\nAnd the majority of the plaintiffs any cases are Chinese American feeding 'em and\nThat you know they're not under

point I'm making her party\nNineteen nineties ad campaign the softer side of fears we're talking this hour about Sears declaring bankruptcy and what it means for retail in America in two thousand Eighteen the once dominant perhaps the dominant retailer in the United states more than a century\nCan't hold on and is going into chapter eleven we're talking this hour with Sarah ... of Bloomberg opinion columnist covering the consumer in retail industries\nVicki Howard is also with us She's a business and cultural historian and a professor at the University of ... ethics and author of for main street to mold the rise and fall the American department store\nAnd Vicki Howard before the break we were talking about how Sears a century ago really changed the way Americans shop to particularly in rural parts of the country now was that because of uh the catalog\nOh yes I I mean before Nineteen twenty five it was a huge mail order from you know yeah it's competition was Montgomery Ward it also had a catalog in the late Nineteen century um but uh uh this was a a wave that's um\nRural people could access all of the goods that were manufactured in in the United states that were um manufactured in northern factories and shipped out on you know railroad cars you know across the country\nAnd you could order your your clothes or your your um equipment for your farm or a you know everything under the sun was available in these catalogues\nOkay so the company was founded or I mean as the years as we know it was about was created an Eighteen Ninety three by Richard warns seniors and a hell of a Curtis Roebuck what was it about them and how they approach business that all that I was allowed them to see this opportunity that there were all these untapped customers in rural parts of the country\nUm I mean I think the ah they started out as a selling watches so it was just a sort of limited uh\nFrom in terms of what it would have had offered to begin with but it really grew later when Julius real civil got on board um\nAnd he took the company into it sort of a modern day for us so I I think that this was the gilded age you know it was an era of you know big gap between the rich and the poor are but you know it was a time of industrialization and I'm also movement into cities and\nThe growing consumer culture at the time I was focused on cities but you know lots of people in the country also um wanted access to some of these goods and this was a way for them to have it on other otherwise they would have had to travel long distances to go into cities to to shop in the department stores or\nMaybe they would have just been able to shop in their country store their general store in their area in a rural area so it really was about I'm reaching those segments and then when it became a department store in the Nineteen twenties then it shifted gears and became a more of a main street entrepreneur I'm sort of\nGoing to get small towns across the country and then eventually you know moving into his later section in after World War two\nSarah ... isn't as one of the most interesting things about seniors as a major American Company that over the course of several decades was able to open up markets in opportunities for a for consumers in rural areas and as a Vicky how are just saying you know also in suburban areas becoming becoming the store that\nHad the catalog and was an anchor store in so many mold and um\nHad the catalog and was an anchor store in so many mold in America\nYeah I think in some ways a story it's yours is the story of the American economy right that you can see those clear links from and adapting to a largely still rural and agrarian society to seeing what the automobile would do to change city patterns in shopping patterns on and making that adaptation so quickly\nI mean you think about that they didn't start stores so Nineteen twenty five and I believe\nA within a decade stores were the majority of their business compared to uh the catalog and so the fact that it was so nimble you know we talk now about the extraordinary changes in the Amazon has been able to bring to bear and the speed with which you need an evil to disrupt the market well that's pretty speedy disruption too and that's why I think feared occupy\nSuch an important place in retailing history in Congress and\nSo we'll talk more about the uh the effects of online retail a little later in the program but we've got callers who want to join us 'cause I mean most Americans have interacted with the seniors are softer years perhaps at least once and their lives so lots of lots of memories you go to Deborah who's calling from Watertown, Connecticut Deborah you're on the air\nYes making great show I I'm I have worked for two great American institutions fears and potential um and potential continues to thrive and fears of course is not\nI started wiring furious when I was a kid during the Vietnam War um my father was a military surgeons stationed in Japan so we ordered everything that we needed\nAnd I would pour over it for hours um I think fear is has been off the fight and heading for trouble for a long time I worked for years in the Nineteen seventies when I was in high school in housewares [laughter]\nI'm the guy I worked for his name was John man I Hope his kids here this he was the top housewares manager and the entire country\nHe was very innovative very successful very aggressive\nHe he was a fair about knowing the merchandise send me an spying missions to see what other stores were charging so he could set prices in sales based on that information he had made cooking chicken and ham inside the store grilling it so that the smell would attract customers who might not be thinking about\nI Love this sounds like a really creative manager\nHe was totally like that and he never ever ever got promoted beyond manager of one department in one store because he didn't have a high ... I mean he had a high school degree but nothing beyond that and and you know and I especially remember just one story\nThat I'd love to share from those days about I'm an old style manager here I was sixteen years old and I was on the phone with a customer who wanted to order replacement parts for his Webber grill\nWhich was not hard but he was really really difficult and really unhappy and hard to help well it turned out that the reason he was so unhappy was that his wife had left him\nAnd she had um [noise] taken the parts but not the grill uh-huh\nAnd and I and I didn't I couldn't handle and when I finally said to him excuse me sir it's not my fault that your wife left you\nAnd I hung up on it and he called store manager and demanded that I'd be fired yeah and the store manager who we never saw on the floor who was a you know young man college educated wars suit came down to you know get my head on a platter and drawn stuck up for me uh-huh he said\nShe shouldn't have done it she's young it's her first job she's a good worker and then he sat me down and he gave me you know the costs yeah always right lecture but he stuck up for me\nDebra thank you so much for your call and for your memories there and and a really wonderful example about or perhaps hope more qualified\nIs there and and a really wonderful example about or perhaps how were qualified people it feels weren't at least in this case weren't getting promoted thank you Deborah let's go quickly to Chris who's calling from state College Pennsylvania Chris you're on the air\nAre great program or what but not fair but a lot of these big like a record the role of the vulture capital of the combat overhead fought the fire these corporations are\nOr were jumped all to hell to pay to go back for the price of a trip all the assets fell off and on your little dog would crash but are kept all the\n... of a wildly popular all the Catholic now they're just going back and we're or a load the at all of the corporation and all the federal somebody else\nIcy crust thank you for your call Sarah ... ah did that happen to see here's where they were they purchased by hedge fund or or a private equity business at one time\nI still any land bird that who just stepped down as CEO and who orchestrated it's merger with Kmart he is a hedge fund guy\nOn and he has used a lot of those hedge fund tactics to\nTry to keep Sears a flow in recent years so and this is one of the main knocks on his tenure is that he didn't really have the merchants instinct he wasn't running series like a retailer he was running it was sort of his henchmen guy hat on and so he is and you know doing things like spinning off it's real estate\nProviding loans are selling things like that crashed into a brand sort of moving around financial chess pieces to keep it alive but he wasn't really need to get a better retailer\nWill so should we talk more about this then because I think the presumption when you hear that a retailer goes into bankruptcy is that somehow they were doing business wrong but it may have nothing to do with that I mean\nAs a as our caller pointed out we have so many examples Toys R us he's right is another one where there's a hedge funds or a private equity managers using these companies are as credit cards and then you know letting letting them drowned and all that leverage\nThe adventure

liberty we're talking this hour about seniors declaring bankruptcy on Monday and what that means for this major American retailer it's been a retailer at the heart of American Life for more than a hundred years and ah what that means for retail as we move forward in the digital age\nI mean let's listen here to a clip from a Sears ad from the Nineteen nineties featuring Bob Vila home improvement television host also a Sears commercials spokesperson talking about all the things you could accomplish with yours products\nRemodeling a kitchen or bathroom such a big job\nWhen you try to do it all and do it right\nHi, Bob Vila procedures in the home improvement professionals maybe you've been dreaming about a beautiful new kitchen more updating your bad well if it's too big a job to do yourself trust the job to see years they've been in business for over a hundred years\nBob Vila there in the Nineteen nineties wanting fears long history in the retail business we got comments coming in on our website a debit says Sears was our parents and our parents parents store when I think as the years I think of craftsmen Kenmore the only two brand I ever bought there\nThere are still manufactured and can be bought elsewhere uh so that's a comment from our website on point radio dot org let's go to Dave who's calling from Buffalo New York Dave you're on the air\nI Do and doing great day what's your thoughts are taking my call yeah go ahead\nOh okay yeah you know on a and I said I'm a I'm a current shares employee [noise] um I'm a service technician and you know what I'm we're just getting bigger and bigger\nOr not actually attached to their outlet uh-huh cheers is always going to be there and they explained it to us if you think of it this way it's going full circle years\nIs worth a catalogue company\nLike as an outlet for them to it and you guys talk very interesting and you know Sears catalog company and then they started having spores more and more everywhere\nSo now that the the digital age is here and the millennials by everything on line just about and and I'm I'm a father than kids and I and I go what's yours over Twenty years yeah you know a great place to work\nAnd I mean I'm gone full circle\nAnd I read and um they're full circle\nSo ... so they can just jump in here for like what do you mean first full circle what do you mean by that because if you say your service technician and ... your your business is is is as busy as ever\nUm yeah just kind of your you know what we're um Sears and the fact groups or are they in the center for applied electronic because we do other I'm\nLike we do um flows hold a vote or rules um that's why we do all the service\nI see stable along\nWith all the sport you know wherever wherever appliances so we do the orange juice or\nDave I'm going to take it back from your thank you so much for your call Sarah ... a with a Bloomberg opinion columnist David he's feeling confident at least for his part of Syria's business and he sees the company's coming full circle what do you think [noise]\nSo I think there's something to the fact that the services area is if if you had to call out some bright spots at Sears services would be one\nAnd that's a key part of their strategy of trying to revitalize the company as counting on that you trust them for those issues and so you buy your appliances with then because uh they had this relationship with you I had their services business so there is something to that that this idea than coming full circle\nI think they would have to have a more robust e commerce business for that to be a plausible outcome and we just don't see them as a formidable competitor in that space and look at the labor's been saying for years that's years is going to shrink to profitability\nAnd that just hasn't happened they keeps shrinking they keep closing stores they keep investing in the e commerce business and they've had seven straight years of profit last okay\nSo since you mentioned e commerce just just remind us broadly how much overall of American retail right now is done on line it it it actually may be less than we think\nThat's right ah we're at the point now where I Believe the most recent figures show nine point five percent of all commerce has done online and certainly I it it varies a lot by category right in categories like grocery it's probably more around one to two percent and categories like apparently it's probably more around twenty or thirty percent\nTwenty or thirty present an apparent okay but overall less than ten percent correct instill in an even with Ninety percent of of overall shopping done in brick and mortar stores fears couldn't capitalize on that are having problems doing exactly\nAnd I think that's why yes this is definitely a story an Amazon and its disruption but it's also a story and Sears getting hammered by its traditional retailing counterpart I we we mentioned briefly before Home Depot and Lowe's are those are two extraordinarily well run retailers that have taken share from Sears\nAt Best Buy stock in your all time high is that it as it has staged a remarkable turnaround it has taken share from Sears and on the apparel side of the business a lot of the disruption there has been from off price stores like T. J. max and Ross which had been on a tear in recent years and taking share away from traditional department stores like seers\nWell let's go to John who's calling from Detroit Michigan John you're on the air\nThank you so I got my first craftsman set of tools back when I was a teenager in the seventies and out of you know no pun intended guy or a fierce version [noise] um and then when I got involved in the communities of Detroit we'll find out that there's actually a catalog houses\nAll right down the street from me that were built in their forties that were purchased right out of the catalog unfortunately a Sears is kind of waned on the east side of the trade or the last Twenty years and it's probably been\nTen years since I've been an ... [noise] uh and they just don't offer like they used to\nWell John thank you for your call Vicky how are you\nUsed to yeah well John thank you for your call Vicky how are you the the business and cultural historian John reminding us that you could ... there was a time you could buy a house out of a Sears catalog\nYeah I think I might have lived in one myself\nUh from the Nineteen twenties I'm In um upstate New York so I I'm familiar with them they're\nThey're lovely homes ah and um it I think that they had their special special catalog devoted to to them that closed\nA down I think right around the Nineteen forties I Believe on but you know you can see homes from the turn of the century Nineteen twenties in any community in the U.S on ... you might possibly be able to identify them as a serious home yeah\nWell so picky Howard a minute ago a Sarah ... talked about how\nUh in two thousand Eighteen yes e commerce is huge and getting bigger but we're still doing Ninety percent of our shopping in brick and mortar stores and I mean you've written about the rise and fall of the American department store so\nSo why is there and the seeming disconnect between how much we shop and where we shop and why some department stores Sears among them are having trouble hanging on\nI mean we haven't really talked much about Wal Mart and Amazon is\nSort of taking over our in our thoughts of you know as the as the big competitor for these brick and mortar stores but you know when I was writing my book I I thought mostly about Wal Mart as as a competitor for the traditional department store um\nAnd you know the urge you to occupy a space that Wal Mart to um uh uh now does a as the largest retailer in the country\nA Walmart be overtook the years and I'm In the early Nineteen nineties so I think that it needs to be seen in through that longer um trajectory of it Sarah a\nSignal or hurt really comments that ... what happened to the IRS is not just about the last few years it's about sort of a long term trend I'm going back to the Nineteen eighties and if it's\nIt isn't inevitable um I I Do believe that um\n[noise] uh that all of those uh missteps or might have made a difference\nYou know in the short term of survival of a from like like Sears\nBut I Do think that if you look at the department store industry as a whole that that sector has been a losing out to the big box stores to\nJust the for them even a even before them the discounters target a K. Mart Walmart all all founded in Nineteen I'm sixty two\nAnd a growing up going to the Nineteen seventies that are the traditional department store of which Sears is it a place to park you know it's more of a staple good stead I'm standard where sort of change\nRight we've got sector's been losing out\nYou know so I'm hearing over and over again through this hour uh Sarah ... a leadership matters right vision and an executive or", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Tampa", "day": "17"}
