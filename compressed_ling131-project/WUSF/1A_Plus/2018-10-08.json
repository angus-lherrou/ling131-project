I'm Sorry to jump in here but but are you telling me that like your your out trying to trying to turn out the vote for the midterms\nYou got it and you got it and I was doing it prior to what courage ever been I don't care whether Republican a damning independent get out and get into the\nNeighborhoods neighborhoods where people are really suffering and and you know come on the Republican then wait to get down into these neighborhoods and see what's going on for these people who can't access\nJobs who who are living in ... in shambles right\nGo prior Kathleen I'm gonna I'm so sorry to interrupt them and take it back from you there because I Want to turn what you're saying to to our guest here\nA polar read your hearing a lot of energy there just from you know two of our callers one of whom saying he's gonna he's gonna vote Republican almost entirely across as about for the first time in his life and then you heard Kathleen there in Ohio things she's going to try and turn out democratic votes so I mean how much\nCan we tell how much has this fight over justice Kevin are really further energized I'm a voter's going into the midterms\nWell it's certainly energized voters going into the midterms the question is whether or not the GOP can sustain this\nOver the next month because well I said look at the cabinet confirmation process did not go how the White House had hoped but the one side for them is that it was mobilizing voters ahead of this critical midterm election the polls show that it was helping them sort of closes enthusiasm gap there were having trouble closing\nOn their own modality has been confirmed now that they sort of solidified have solidified\nHonest conservative majority on the Supreme Court the question is whether or not they'll be able to continue this momentum she heard the president I can just over the weekend and you'll hear him say this again him and his allies trying to sort of frame this as as all Democrats trying to obstruct their agenda world Vinge for the Trump\nUm that the Trump victory in a presidential campaign to try to continue to get people are angry enough to get up and vote in November and there's no question that that folks on the other side democratic progressive that they are certainly mobilize and this has been a catalyst for many of them to vote or encourage others to vote\nBut again the big challenge for the president is allies can you sustain this yet another month now Dick Pullman a here in\nPennsylvania we've got a brand new district map congressional district map and so there we have a lot of races that are newly competitive that weren't uh Israel in the last cycle here so how much might major issues like a you know the confirmation battle over justice Kavanaugh ... effect what's gonna happen here in the front\nRow I think [noise] you know the capitals things really in some ways for a lot of these new districts which are a lot more democratic friendly than the old ones from the new districts were by court ah and um they're much more sort of ... of them are much more of a sort of are appropriate mix of democratic independent and Republican voters in the old district\nUm and the but the Kavanaugh\nThing the kennel things relax and go to just sort of be a cap or on a lot of the energy that has driven a lot of suburban white women suburban white educated women\nAre toward the Democrats uh we'd be talking about a blue wave for months uh I don't necessarily think that just because there's reports now increased Republican enthusiasm here and elsewhere that that blue wave narrative should go away because I think what's gonna happen is all depends how to do something\nIs going to land just proportionally in different places so a lot of the house districts were which were are strong suburban districts like a lot of the ones around Philadelphia ah our\nUm aren't being energized by by women who are really fed up with Trump over a lot of Republicans over a lot of things that are being nearly the latest saw you know it's hard for me to imagine that the Republicans excuse me\nThe latest saw you know it's hard for me to imagine that the Republicans excuse me that the Democrats won't win the house and we need a net gain of twenty three you're probably going to pick up five or so in Pennsylvania alone you know there's twenty three twenty four districts nationwide that are that Republicans have that Hillary Clinton won the presidential vote\nIn in twenty sixteen those are very vulnerable so I think this whole thing about enthusiasm is going to it's going to fall different different places the red state Senate red state Senate seats the Democrats have now that's where I can see a lot more\nRepublican enthusiasm may be making a difference from from the you're thinking\nOf North Dakota and Heidi Heitkamp\nWas Andrea Hsu she might she might be told McConnell much McConnell may be right when he says this is going to energize Republicans to keep the Senate the house I'm sure we'll\nSee what I'm going to come to you here in a second but ah since ... mentioned the Senate and we had that caller Kathleen from Ohio expressing her distaste for Senator Susan Collins of Maine and her vote to confirm justice Kevin ... we have a U.S some tape here from Senator call and she spoke with Scott Kelly on CBS is sixty minutes last night\nAnd said she felt very comfortable with her ... her decision to support cabinet despite the testimony given by professor Christine Blasey Ford\nShe with clearly terrified traumatized and I believed that sexual assault had happened to her why\nI think she's mistaken about is who the perpetrator flat I Do not believe her assailant with Brett Kavanaugh\nNot the ... Senate calling also spoke extensively on the floor of the Senate explaining why she was going to cast that affirmative vote for Kavanaugh and then we have\nThis strange happening on Twitter where Susan Rice apparently hints that she might dip into into a race against Susan Collins wouldn't hold up for re election in a couple of years I mean what's going on their\nVote Susan Collins was obviously one of the pivotal swing votes it's arguable that if she voted the other way than Joe Manchin the Democratic came out almost within moments of her announcing her vote or would have gone the other way in the cabinet nomination would have would have sunk\nNow progressive activists have already worked on a campaign to raise a lot of money\nFor whichever Democrat challenges Susan Collins and twenty twenty she is the sole surviving blue state Republican in the Senate so that makes her quite a target I think our reasons for voting for Kavanaugh was that number one she said ideologically he's acceptable and that the president should have ... you know wide latitude to pick 'em adjusts just as long as they're qualified\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from college fine where

national political reporter and writer of the national interest blood\nAt WHYY polar read is also with us she CBS News correspondent covering the Justice Department the White House and legal affairs and so he ... he joined us as well as national political reporter for Bloomberg\nPolitics and so he wanted to turn something to you here because we heard Paula ah especially talk about before the break that the president wants to talk about things like NAFTA or when he's out there on on rallies but perhaps the news about justice cabinet has kind of around a lot of that out\nI mean there were some other big issues as well that lots of folks were campaigning on him I guess primarily healthcare is has that sort of been temporarily set aside or do you think that that will will come back to voters and and Kennedy to going to come back to focus on these persistent\nIssues are that you're in the country still grappling with\nHealthcare certainly has not subsided that whatever happens in Washington and you know what whatever kind of a a heated Supreme Court confirmation battle is happening healthcare has remained\nIn more cold than not that I've seen the number one issue for voters throughout this election it's deeply personal to them and I think the uh the efforts to repeal and get rid of the Affordable CARE Act inflamed that debate\nA in kind of a unique way that we haven't seen but the bottom line here that the mid term elections usually come down to a set of basic fundamentals in that as\nPresidential approval rating and the generic congressional ballot and the last we've seen the president's approval is\nSomewhere hovering around forty percent or it's historically not good usually uh the president's party suffers big losses especially when they're providing as at that level and the generic ballot we've seen it fluctuate a little bit but Democrats have more and more polls and not enough of an advantage to take the house now for the president campaigning\nHis efforts on the campaign trail are likely to hurt Republicans in the house and help Republicans and the Senate he is very either\nAre likely to hurt Republicans in the house and help Republicans and the Senate he is very he's been a very good position to help the Senate Republican candidate or trying to defeat a red state Democrats like Joe Manchin of West Virginia Jon Tester in Montana\nJoe Donnelly in Indiana Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Heidi Heitkamp in North Dakota who is probably the most endangered democratic so it breaks down differently in different places that Republicans have kind of a dream of the Senate map where\nYou know twelve added a Thirteen most competitive races are in states that President Trump won in about half of them by massive margin right\nWell I mean as you mentioned and Dick actually mentioned before the break that mid term generally are seen as a referendum on on the sitting president which you know could\nMake it a tough tough tough challenge for Republicans a this coming November but on the other hand because of the acrimony over the cabinet or confirmation and nomination we are hearing\nRepublican leaders talking about re energized the base I mean Here's Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell on CBS does face the nation just yesterday saying that democratic protest over Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation had actually reinvigorated Republican voters\nIronically the behavior of the first the Democrats all the sudden Judiciary Committee and then the overreach of the protesters at the Capitol is actually energize the Republican base a particularly in red states where we're trying to pick up seats out across America so I Want to thank I Want to find the\nOther side for the tactics that have allowed us to kind of energize and get involved all of voters\nPullman do you think that's enough to sort of overwhelmed the negative ratings or or the little approval ratings that we have the\nPresident while you may be on the Senate side like we've been talking about but um you know I think\nHe's doing that in part because uh I don't know much else they they really have I mean we don't we just talked to a few minutes ago about you know their past tax reform but if you look at how tax reform as polling most Americans don't think it's really making much of a of a bite of not by much of a boost to their income so that really hasn't been point very well\nOr they did promise to a ... a abolishing obliterate Obamacare Obamacare is still there and as a matter of fact where Democrats used to run away from Obamacare as a campaign issue\nThis year particularly on the house side they're bracing it and it's not just I Know what you see it around here in Pennsylvania side but over just across the river here in South New Jersey\nA there's a long time Republican congressional seat\nThat is a very uh it may took to the Democrats this time because the Democratic candidate by the name of Andy Kim\nA is every day he's stressing healthcare a and they don't talk about you know they're not talking at least ... aren't really talking that much about cabinet are much less about impeaching a Trump or anything like that they're trying to stick with what they think are sort of fundamental kitchen table stuff\nUh that um you know is going to sort of a you know cancel out any ah protecting potentially temporary spikes\nIn Republican enthusiasm so I think when McConnell is doing is you know he's driving what he hopes happens he figures you know if they said enough and they stuck it up enough you know the hope and believe becomes reality but I think they have a a a ways to go on causing that gap\nWill probably read I'm going to go to a couple of callers here but I just wanted to give you a quick shot at this um you know issues like health care a persistent issues and and and Dick's right I mean we were out in a Pennsylvania's new seventh district or just this weekend and a lot of talk\nAbout health care and actually relatively less about Kavanaugh himself all the women across the board were very energized I think that's right yeah Kavanaugh certainly something that ... here in the beltway and obviously to the hearings got enormous viewership there was interest but I don't know necessarily how much\nViewership there was interest but I don't know\nUnnecessarily how much that will really got into the polls even President Trump's watching edited come down to issues like health care immigration I'd infrastructure these kinds of things and I'm surprised that Democrats haven't hammer the president a harder on their part about health care act and they're a promise that need and and not kept yet\nYeah stick Pullman actually there's something you said earlier in the show they wanted to circle back to a little bit because yeah we can we can talk about health care we can talk about immigration et cetera but you made the point\nThat you didn't quite understand why Democrats haven't yet made the long term changes like that can that can come with things like Supreme Court justice appointments more central to their argument or they're you know the sale to turn to do with voters here do you think they should know\nWell I yeah I think they should I think they should have I think they should have a long time ago I'm a ... you know maybe there's this whole notion maybe a lot of Democrats hold on this notion that uh the courts are uh\nAre impartial and independent and peoples and voters don't like to think of them as being part of the ... battlegrounds ah but the Republicans have successfully\nA campaign that way for years I mean you can go back to even the nineties late Nineteen sixties when President Nixon a ... then candidate Nixon in Nineteen sixty eight was talking about\nThe ah the war on the Warren Court and how would the law you know we need more law and order he campaigned against the court in sixty eight successfully or in some so for years Democrats of not\nThey have not stress the court uh uh\nI thought that ... what happened with the Merrick Garland in twenty six you know I think if you flip the parties around and and a Republican ... Republican president been in office ah and had nominated in February of an election year a well qualified Court nominee\nAnd who didn't even get ahead you can get a hearing say from a democratic candidate I think it would have been stolen seat would have been a hash tag the entire year and I said I don't understand why the Democrats yet so he'll go ahead\nSorry I I just wanted to add a it's a great point that they can make because it was you know the decisions of the Warren Court from the fifties and and the Berger court through the seventies things like\nA Miranda rights for criminal suspects brown versus board of education and and the backlash from the south you know to the Supreme Court banning racial segregation roe versus Wade that galvanized the conservative movement and they built a very very successful and very effective movement\nOr you know it wouldn't messaging with voter mobilization with millions and millions of dollars to a vet Supreme Court candidates were were solidly conservative you know would vote with them in a way to advance their goals\nThey did that as a ... you know and and they were able to do that partly as a result of a backlash to the liberal decisions that the Supreme Court made in that time a ... a question I have now is whether the left can catapult\nA you know can do a similar thing now in an era where the Supreme Court has made decisions like Bush Gore on Citizens United which you know the the the pro or or the anti campaign finance regulation ruling\nThat paved the way for a lot of dark money in politics to the Supreme Court decision and got the voting rights act and an addict mentioned the blockade of a President Obama Supreme Court vacancy with Merrick Garland by Republican leaders in the Senate\nKent liberal use that to motivate their base to care about the Supreme Court because right now the ... the conservative movement the conservative base has a massive advantage on this issue\nWill get a couple more calls here before we switch gears so let's go to Amanda who's calling from Charleston South Carolina Amanda you're on the air\nHi I'm ahead go ahead\nAll things considered at four o'clock this afternoon on W.

the electorate here is pretty evenly split between Republicans and Democrats you'll remember that President Trump won Pennsylvania by less than forty five thousand votes out of the six million ballots

the we're broadcasting today from the studios of WHYY in Pennsylvania because we are talking about gerrymandering and Pennsylvania is\nAdventures in redistricting and really what effort or what impact that had on Pennsylvania politics on representation here and the Keystone State what impact it could have\nAs the discussion about gerrymandering and redistricting is taken to the national level I'm joined here today by ... she's a multimedia journals for WHYY and also for Keystone crosswords media nonprofit that's really focused on the state's political challenges\nWe're also joined by Terry Madonna he's a professor of public affairs and the director of the center for politics and public affairs at Franklin and Marshall College as well now Lindsay and Terry ah I just want to play a little bit of tape for you because uh we were talking about at the very beginning of the conversation how\nPennsylvania's gerrymandered districts were struck down in January of this year by the state Supreme Court\nA and this weekend we actually caught up with Valentino did Georgia oh he's the chairman of the Republican Party for the state of Pennsylvania and\nYou know he's previously called and I've seen this in your reporting a Lindsey he's called he called the January twenty Eighteen ruling a hyper partisan decision by an activist judicial bench and he followed that up with us this weekend and here's what he said\nThere was nothing in Pennsylvania ... which says they have to be fair whenever fair me that he just took it upon themselves to say fairness means\nYou know what we think it means and they drew in the process was one analyst called the Democrats dream map so it was that was just such a [noise] you just take it unconstitutional taking a power by\nThe volunteer to Georgia the chairman of the Pennsylvania GOP now Lindsey ... let me just get a uh some impressions hear from you because first of all when to Georgia talks about this new map that the state Supreme Court drew they didn't actually want to have to\nDo that they want they sent it back to the legislature to draw new map but that didn't work out yes and so the timeline here was it was pretty much a crunch so\nAround ... well on January twenty second at the decision came down that the two thousand eleven map deprived Pennsylvania voters of the right to free and equal elections\nAnd basically gave Republicans an unfair advantage and diluted the Democrats votes and basically they gave about a month\nI'm In between that time to come up with a new map so they kicked it back to the legislatures that OK guys you know give it to your best shot\nThat didn't happen and we saw these um these contingencies of different groups Hannigan map and just those Republican controlled legislature but Pennsylvania has democratic governor now they were supposed to agree on a new about the could it yes the governor was supposed to approve 'em the matter is that the legislature um came up with it didn't have that didn't have\nFirst of all the legislature didn't do it the legislative leaders there there was never passed by the general assembly in a form of a law which is what is required\nAnd the Supreme Court in all fairness to both sides of the Supreme Court did not give the legislature I think adequate time to come up with a map even from the legislature could've come up with a map when when a mid ... and they went back to\nThere's a clause in the constitution known as free an equal yeah which had never been applied in that way before I'm not suggesting what the court did was wrong or merely suggesting\nThat they went back into a the Eighteenth century for the\nInto a the Eighteenth century for the original constitution to find it\nVery yeah let me ask you both about that because you know we've had other cases that have worked their way through the federal system to the United States Supreme court but Pennsylvania Pennsylvania's who brought this case deliberately chose not to do that because\nThey saw the Pennsylvania state constitutions having stronger voter protections that even the U.S constitution but fatalities indicating here that but this was a a novel\nReading room really ... well I think you also have to look at the makeup of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court there are five Democrats on the court and two Republicans on the court so we also see this change in that make up of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court I'm so who are ultimately making the decision\nYeah that's exactly right I mean are they part of it was a political calculation on their part and are going into the federal court it could have going on and on and on for a relatively long period of time as it worked its way up to the to the Supreme Court\nAnd as that state court challenge was going on there was a parallel challenge for off of you know different theory in the federal courts that ended up going nowhere and actually that the federal judges decided that no it's not they can't say that it's a a gerrymandered map\nOkay there's a lot of detail in terms of what's going to happen next in Pennsylvania about these new districts that have been drawn and many of them swing quite dramatically from Republican to a balanced\nA Republican Democrat or into the Democratic category or um some of them become profoundly more Republican I mean we'll talk about that in a minute but the but the point is is that a lot more of the districts are competitive now\nAnd that could have a big effect nationally because the Democrats need to pick up some twenty something seats and they're looking for anywhere from four to eight of them right here in this one state\nYou know but the reason why we wanted to come here because I actually I'm also curious about a deeper question and that is sort of the divide in American politics and whether you're gerrymandering is helping to drive that divide and if we reduce gerrymandering will we get\nMore moderate voices so so we actually went to the Lehigh Valley uh this weekend to to ask that question now of course gerrymandering is not the only driver of hyper\nPolarized politics now but it does tend to drown out moderate voices so I just asked voters up there what do they think about Pennsylvania's new districts and and here's what some voters in ... valley told us about what they see\nHave a place for you for the church and uh\nThere's pumpkin pastry and pulled pork on the table at the ... the United Methodist Church\nIt's in Pennsylvania is brand new seventh district in the Lehigh Valley on this day there's a meet and greet going on for Republican candidate Marty no Stein a bulletin board hangs on one of the wood paneled walls reminding members to keep Jesus at their core\nIn the middle of the road a volunteer has set up a life size cut out of President Trump\nGiving a thumbs up Brian Rodgers takes a quick break from the meet and greet he's a grassroots coordinator for the new Stein campaign of a campaign staffer a lot of quick meals the Lehigh Valley with previously split into a long lobster shaped district that captured heavily Republican areas to the west near Harrisburg\nThat made it safe for former Republican Congressman Charlie dent a moderate who never faced a serious challenge ... retired this year saying basic governing had become far too difficult in Washington\nIs old district voted for Donald Trump by a margin of eight points Rogers says the newly drawn district favored Hillary Clinton by just one point making it one of the most competitive races in this year's midterms\nLike to think of the valley as a microcosm of the United states blue dog Democrats to Trump Republican voters rural areas suburban areas urban areas and it's it's just going to be a battle and we know that\nSuburban areas urban areas and it's it's just going to be a battle and we know that we really try to better Rogers called no Stein a different kind of conservative primarily because his candidate won a cycling gold medal at the Sydney Olympics no Stein also advocates were strict term limits\nBut he falls in line with the ... on key issues low taxes anti abortion pro Second Amendment rights also calling for an end to the Affordable CARE Act\nNew Stein is also a farmer and a small business owner and that's what excites Dorothy Nicholas she organized the church meet and greet\nHe's not a pie in the sky conservative there's people who are justified the logs and he was not an ideologue he is\nA working man so I ask Nicholas question does she think political compromise may be possible in her new rebalance district\nYou will always have to buy their because you're having the patriots versus the socialists and the global as\nClose says there's another divide she thinks Democrats are encouraging a sense of victimization and women and other women at the table not in agreement\nFor Dr forward I think she was victimized but she came across as for me that would not have been our response\nNot by any means we refused to be victims we we would have been angry and yet\nWhen he closed does not approve of the fact that millions of women and men are angry right now\nAnd they're taking action they're marching in the streets and protesting on Capitol Hill\nBut to Nicholas that kind of anger isn't becoming it's not viable she says Ryan Rogers Marty no signs campaign staffer puts it this way I think ultimately will come down to just the contrast of candidates\nAnybody can hold off a blue wave in Florida it seems like Rick Scott and he's well known as

Pennsylvania Jason you're on the air\nFor taking my call [noise] um I I'm from a you love this district in Pennsylvania just seeing is running\nAnd um I also helped I also did some volunteer work for a short Scott any a tense district and I was\nHappy to see these two districts are now competitive especially the the ... district but um\n[noise] I'd really like to see from Slovenia move further and Mr and make it more fair mhm and I really wonder why should this be more of a mathematical\nModel a procedure rather than a political procedure you know start are starting to top left or the state sort of mathematically work your way through the population and the counties junior boundaries\n... it's a good question Jason and I mean ... lives aren't even phones issue for a long time what do you\nYeah I think you've got a great point there and I'm under the ah Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruling um you know they they kinda borrowed from the state legislature or the state legislative district rules that\nYou know a congressional districts me to be ... compact they need to be continuous they need to split as few counties municipalities as possible\nAnd that part is in consideration cannot supersede those neutral criteria\nSo I think that you know I'm\nGoing forward or the ruling does say that there are these neutral criteria that need to be considered before part is concerned but you know the court didn't go so far and say that here's where you can you know a draw the line as far as when a drawing districts becomes\nDraw the line as far as when a drawing districts becomes to parties and so there's it's today but there there are some guidelines that you know at the legislature can use\nGoing forward but I'm Terry Madonna to to the point that the caller was making about you know are there algorithmic ways to get fairness out of out of district map drawers or politics always going to be part of this process\nAnd I don't think you can ... I don't think you can remove politics Democrats and Republicans were both tried to advantage themselves and actually because of the algorithms and these\nAre and these models that they now have that can be more skillful added there actually can be better a jury may during because of the nature of they they can literally get down to the precinct level you know what I said not the district or the ward level the\nPrecinct level and divide and divided up the electorate in a way that benefits one party or the\nOther couple and still is is that the rules for the algorithm and when I was thinking we think computers can do a better outlook take another call here Jim is calling from Akron, Ohio Jim you're on the air\nThank you for taking my call I Lived in northern Sonoma County that's the Akron Ohio area and we of course of a ... a Republican governor and Republican Congress and they\nAre about three years ago they came over in ... northern summit county which was a democratic area and we now have a Republican congressmen were were they see and it was all gerrymandered that's how they got us and we lost our our democratic congressman\nMm yeah may I made a thanks go ahead whom and how to make a point about this elections have consequences and what happened in two thousand and ten in the Tea Party election was not just that the\nRepublicans picked up sixty three house seats or put it in another way the Democrats lost sixty three house seats\nBut that they took over state legislatures I think the number now and I may be off is thirty six state legislatures in which the Republicans control the state legislatures\nBoth houses and you can see what that means in states not every state does it has it's done by law\nBut when you get all these Republican governors and Republican state lawmakers in state after state after state\nThat has a huge difference on writing the laws if each day you know that govern the judge drinking yeah exactly and the actual process itself so the two thousand and ten election was huge not just in terms of the bringing the Tea Party to power the ideological conservatism that represent\nGo ahead yeah just to piggyback on that just one thing that I think we saw with Pennsylvania is you know\nUh you know one of the most egregious gerrymandered maps in the country we see one party control right we see that the Republicans control the house the Senate that the governor's office and you know they made the was they made the rules and there was no really check\nCombined the Democrats would do ... that's being nonpartisan about a year not parties and but the Democrats have done that already pointed out there's a district in Maryland yeah yeah so this is not partners in both parties will do that\nThat's exactly the point I wanted to go to because if if the regardless of party if the party has the power it seems very natural in terms of American politics try to consolidate that power but but you know when Republicans do it and are there and they have done here in Pennsylvania Democrats have done it elsewhere to people keep talking to me about Marilyn\nA California back in the eighties and nineties\nUm ... but the point is is that is there a way to come up with a fair system\nIs there a way to come up with a fair system that does mostly remove politics from the equation and and I'm here let me just limited to them and let me let me play for you I'm a a little bit of tape here this is again Valentino to Georgia oh he's the ... the chairman of Pennsylvania\nAnd he basically just take he takes issue with that entire question because he says it's perfectly fine with legislators creating districts um\nAnd he really opposes the idea of any other system specifically an independent citizens commission which we'll talk about here to second he poses other systems to drop future congressional map and here's what he said\nLegislators are in the best position to draw a line than\nThey are today heaven forbid politic should enter into a piece of legislation that draws part you know political maps done all over the country Democrats have drawn maps that are favors and others say look in Maryland so you know this is nonsense this was part of a rock Obama Eric Holder\nFair disturbing plan they call that to take back the rational these and they've done it here in Pennsylvania\nThat fell to Georgia Pennsylvania GOP chair students' lives are so he ... he basically says we know the state the best we should draw the maps but there is this other idea about an independent citizens commission what would that look like in Pennsylvania I just have\nTo say I love that um operatic music behind failed in Columbus Day festival here in Philadelphia is taking me there to south Philly um so\nYou know a a group a in Pennsylvania fair districts PA um for a number of years now they've been trying to\nChange the Pennsylvania Constitution and to implement and independent citizens commission that would actually draw the lines and they modeled this after California\nAnd um this is really a grass roots organization you see them at street fairs out you see them at a Ben canvassing and you know uh they they ... they're asking the legislators to basically vote against their interest to form this commission\nAs you pointed out if there is such a commission in California made up of a appointed independent citizens and I think some several other a couple of other states in the west have similar similar commission so who do they work they have they created fair districts\nUm if you talk to the the people on the commission yes if you talk to voters yes I think a key difference between Pennsylvania in California is that in Pennsylvania\nUm there's no referendum so basically um to get that process in place at the state legislature would have to pass a constitutional amendment and then it would go to the voters for in a referendum\nThen there is no guarantee there's no guarantee that an independent commission itself would be truly independent I mean they're going to be appointed by somebody you know that that that's or hold positions by verge get on to get on the commission by virtue of a position they already home\n\nJustice Brett Kavanaugh\nHow did those words feel\nHowever you feel you're probably feel that strongly and you will for some time\nFrom W.

investigation was a total sham and John ... investigation in quotation marks on a chair and I didn't want to ask you about that in terms of\nWho was believed in this whole process set aside for a

just\nThe visceral way in which some people seem to be more believed than others what did you make of that [noise]\nSo this episode like so much and are highly highly polarized society um\nIs two completely different world views so when Democrats on both parties in Democrats any way I look at what happened with Kavanaugh they see a Republican Party that is ... that doesn't believe women that diminishes charges\nA sexual assault doesn't take them seriously\nAnd um they have some things in their in their quiver they can point to the Roy Moore episode end to end to the president himself and so forth so that's their view\nAnd uh and to the president himself and so forth so that their view on the Republican view is that the allegations of Christine Blasey Ford was even though it was held until the very last moment and they're they're very angry about the the process as um I was saying\nBut they also point to the fact\nThat this accusation the blazing Ford won was taken seriously was listening to but then it was roped in\nBy many Democrats on the committee with two other allegations that were so absurd that they should not have even pass the laugh test I'm the one by Julie sweat neck which she immediately walked back you know that that there was some sort of raped gang going on in a in ... but that is to Maryland in the Nineteen eighties and to\nThe students in that she has a college student was attending a lot of high school parties and saw Kavanaugh spiking the drinks are girls with clay lose and then attacking them well of course she she walked all of that back but\nUh and of course the Ramirez story too was quite thin so thin that the New York times looked into it and we refuse to publish it\nSo um so so the the problem was that when Michael ... sort of collard sweat neck and dragged her forward and included her absurd allegations in with Blasey Ford's more\nUm believable accusation it had the paradoxical effect of ... of um making sleazy Ford's case all the um weaker because it was seen to be part of this political hit\nAnd um and I think ... a may have a lot to answer for from his Democratic colleagues\nWill the president did also make some political have wish Christine Blasey Ford's case for her story as well let me here's part of what you said at a rally on Wednesday in Mississippi in an act of what he said was to help defend Brett Kavanaugh and his unfair treatment here's a bit of the president\nKind of characterizing washing cars are generous word what professor Ford said to ...\nHow did he get home I don't remember how did you get there

[noise]\n\nMan a man why shattered\nPart of what the president's sort of his rally last Wednesday in Mississippi it's worth noting that the president is incorrect in his assertion that all the professor Ford remembered was having one beer indeed she said that seared into her hippocampus a psychology professor\nWas the fact that she was laughed at during the assault\nYes she also remembered that it was upstairs I mean she remembered many things were president did not cover himself with glory in that moment where he was mocking current diminishing her of course a that was that was disgusting on the other hand\nUm there has been a tremendous amount of behavior on the left during this process that was also I'm really lemon trouble um stopping people in restaurants and and a driving ah people\nAh from the public square um uh you know accusing someone of um absurd\nCharges and not taking into account his whole life you know ... if judge Kavanaugh where the monster that uh the some of the Democrats had been portraying you would think somebody would have picked up on it at some point in his adult life\nWell and that's kind of what I'm Wondering in a way I hear you on that morning early on I also kind of noticed scratch [noise]\nI hear you on that amount of early on I also kind of noticed that\nOne aspect of the debate around Brett Kavanaugh would seem to not get a whole lot of mixed in the final analysis and didn't get a lot of the nation from Susan Collins of Maine when she gave that what fifty minutes exploitation on the floor of the Senate which was actually rather fast moving towards hearing if you've ever heard it\nIs just how Brett Kavanaugh handled the accusation I mean if someone accused me of something awful but I knew I did not do\nI think I Would hope so it'd be able to say listen this is an awful thing that happened it sounds like a tragedy I Wish I could give you the closure you're looking for but I'm not the person who did it like something about temperament in this whole discussion kind of fell by the ...\nYeah I Do think that once the additional allegations came out in ... in his testimony had to answer not just for a lousy Ford's allegation but also for the other two allegations\nAnd and he was upset angry in tears enraged are outraged\nOn Democrats sort of their their arguments a became\nOne not about necessarily guilt or innocence but one about temperament and did he had the appropriate temperament sit on the bench\nAnd it ah their argument necessarily uh it it became one not about do we believe her but then he doesn't have a judicial temperament and Republicans answered intern that a Democrat that said he was to ... and the Fox interview and to detach and then when he got angry they thought that wasn't good enough\nI'm from a from a report ... perspective on the the temperament question was an interesting one to me it's sort of seemed to me from afar that looking at the justice says on the bench we know all of their politics are based on the president to a point that it's based on the way they ruled\nSo ah the temperament question was\nInteresting I'm not sure how relevant is because we know all the politics of all of the justices\nNot really sure how cabinets temperament plays into\nIt with regards to temperament and civility Sam wrote on our Facebook page there's a difference between the Thomas and Kavanaugh hearings referring to Clarence Thomas back in Ninety One Thomas required sixty votes to confirm Kavanaugh only fifty fifty plus one\nThere's no need for civility for the majority anymore because there's no need to have abused some support\nHas been pretty silent jeep Perry will tell you if I said very personal reason he's back coming up I'm Hugh ... public radio international me up

some of your stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with you know step in LA on a Johnson and motive Sharon ... let me let you jump in and responsibility on his comment before we could go\nEarly on I mentioned that that Republicans might suffer in the midterms and that was a political sacrifice worth making I I actually think that the opposite I mean I'm not in that political prognostications business I think after twenty sixteen that's a dangerous business you're\nAt but I don't think they'll suffer at all in fact I'm especially among Republican women there's been a big jump in and day out and there's had twelve point\nUpward swing among Republican women and not because the left doesn't actually owned the voices of women on for a lot of women out there that's\nThe voices of women on for a lot of women out there this this hearing about fairness\nIt was about fairness for their husbands their fathers their son on that a lot of blame on two are are really scared about the standard that no one I mentioned right the idea that I think all accusation\nWithout any kind of corroborating evidence is enough to destroy a man's life I think there are a lot of women who see a problem with that standard as well and they are also energized taken out to the\nThis is no doubt very very visceral for quite a lot of you including gene\nGene emailed urging contacted us in road we're more concerned with the men who were falsely accused two to five percent of the time\nThan the women who are raped Ninety five Ninety eight percent of the time\nWhen one in four women in America deal with rape and tens of thousands of rape kits remain untested there are bigger issues than your panel was talking about our justice system is broken the women on your panel or making my blood boil ... are we losing sight of something larger here [noise]\nUh well the um the problem of rape has always been with us as long as there's been human civilization\nAnd I'm the only one I I hate to interrupt you but I just want to clarify something from the comment the comics wrote that one in four women in America deal with rape Senator Dianne Feinstein and the shearing said that according to federal statistics it's one in three but one in three women will deal with sexual violence it was a yet or not race\nThat's that's way overstated sexual violence of central so and that's a very very broad description Ron clued even just being funneled over your clothes against your will so right over should be careful with a number yeah they do it's going okay so yeah the number is is is a is not not right but look at the problem of of male\nSexual aggression or has been a problem throughout human civilization\nAll civilized society seek to cope with it\nUh and it's also one of the most difficult crimes to prosecute because in most cases there are only two people it happens in privacy they're no witnesses um it's very hard to show proof if there was no actual if there were no wounds on the woman's body et cetera et cetera\nSo it is you know when people say well we're not being believed it's because it's it's very hard to prove and also you have to recognize that the consequences of finding a guilt at finding someone guilty of rape I mean\n... years and years and years in prison and so of course we do need to be careful about how we evaluate rape accusations it's it's it's an awful thing it's it but I don't see any way around you know keeping in mind our standards of justice and fair play I don't see any way around\nThe difficulties inherent in these kinds of accusation\nEspecially like with this is one of those moments do you want to do where a lot of women including several who commented on this program not that I think that the show was perfectly representative sample of the country but a preponderance of the woman who commented on this program have essentially said I don't want to hear it\nWe've been waiting for all of human history for our society to deal with the fact that men can treat women like pieces of meat and get away with it with impunity that day is over yesterday so fix this or we will shut you down until you do\nI hear your Mona but it's that emotional visceral part of politics earlier and I I I don't think that the political will is there especially among women who have been assaulted to say okay I'll take a breath and wait another term for this to get\nBetter [noise] well I think there are two challenges the first is that we have a justice system based on a presumption of innocence and the cabin are confirmation presented another challenge which is that he was not being tried in a court of law and the question raised and it was should he at\nBenefit from the presumption of innocence and we had a lot of senators saying no he should a hat\nAnd we had a lot of senators saying no he should I had the presumption of guilt and he should have to clear his name and that seemed not to go over a well there was a political backlash on the right to that\nAnd so I think that uh there certainly is energy on the left but it is met with equal force from energy on the right with people who feel that that's\nGreatly unfair but the cabinet confirmation and saying that a ... a presumption of guilt when an accusation is leveled was sort of met with an equal and opposite energy from the right and emailers and callers can say that that makes their blood boil but\nCovering this as a reporter that is simply a sort of what we saw\nI Do want to move on and talk about the impact on the Supreme Court bar should know that this has left some of you just regardless of your politics feeling very cynical about the process over all I mean this was very high political theater in some ways when you get down to it and that was kind of a reflection of one listener who just left a note in our inbox\nMy name is far I'm calling from Cleveland, Ohio I'm very disappointed\nCheck and our congressman and I'm very disappointed with the United states at this time an African American woman I really do feel that it was all of the joke that they went behind doors and say okay let's get the country a\nGood show they already know what\nThey were going to do it's not a government by the people on Oh yes it is only up to take care of our group of people\nFor so appreciate your calling and sharing your thoughts with us and we get to a few more comments as we continue Tina in Grand Rapids Michigan emailed\nI'm so sick and tired of people talking about Kavanaugh's reputation in life being ruined that is absolutely ridiculous usually wealthy privileged white man whose life is nowhere near ruined obviously now he's been confirmed and will be on the Supreme Court\nHer life is the one that has been ruined if anyone's life has been ruined the me too movement has not been weaponized for political gain an upset that your guest just said that on the air so angry right now this is real for women\nIrwin in Arkansas emailed so we'll have another really take the court to the far right I've been hearing conflicting views from the right where some say if you will do so and others say Kavanaugh will actually be moderate you missed that meant this gets to something that senator Collins of Maine Susan Collins of Maine\nTalked about her long exploitation explaining why she was going to vote\nFor Brett Kavanaugh and some of his background particularly as it relates to dealing with presidents on the Supreme Court she mentioned roe versus Wade very specifically what what's your read on whether or not Brett Kavanaugh will drag the court kind of as Irwin suggested to the far right\nI'm because he's replacing Anthony Kennedy I think there will be a shift the right on the court um I think it will be much more measured than some art cleaning\nUm I think it's really unlikely that you'd see roe versus Wade something like overturned precedent overturn I think it's much more likely that we see some narrowing of the precedent on abortion allowing states I'm a little bit more leeway to regulate abortion and the second and third trimester as I think that's more likely outcome on those issues\nUm I Do think that Susan Collins overstated a Kavanaugh's moderate credentials a little bit and her her speech um because he was at the judge and they ... he was following Supreme Court\nPrecedent his job as a judge was tried to guess how the Supreme Court would rule on a particular issue given the process that now that he is setting that President he's freighter on what he thinks that precedent should be um I I Do think something that's under covered\nThis is Wu USF eighty nine point seven Tampa saint Petersburg Sarasota we're broadcasting from the University of South

A. M. U. dot org\nKatie you're on the ground in Michigan working on redistricting reform I Want to hear what you're up to in just a moment but first I Want to get a little more explanation of this larger issue and ... and let me start with you\nIf you just explain what we mean when we talk about redistricting and and what point redistricting becomes gerrymandering right so this is a process that the United states goes through every ten years after\nThe defending your senses of the census really starts the whole process or the U.S Census Bureau eventually gives the states the official number of uh their population and then the number of seats in the U.S house of representatives do get\nThat are really complicated math formula called the Huntington he'll method which I still haven't quite figured out even though I've been staring at it for a couple of years but that that's how so every state's all fifty states get one member of the house of representatives at least you know there are four hundred and thirty five\nSo that eliminate those those first fifty seats that everybody gets and then the fifty first seat is awarded to the largest state using the Huntington hill method so California gets the fifty first date\nAnd if I'm not mistaken I think they get the fifty seconds a seat as well but then that does the seats are allocated by population all the way down to the four hundred and thirty fifth\nAh and that's how we figure out that say you know Washington state has ten districts this time or California has fifty three and whether or not they're going to gain or lose a seat on the margins depending on uh the population shift and the relative populations of each state\nSo this happens every ten years and then every ... the U.S constitution gives the state legislatures the power to a draw those district lines now that clause has been interpreted in different ways of some legislatures have challenged\nUh the the various independent commissions around the country so that they can maintain that power or other states other legislators have more willingly given up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own\nAnd up that power to an independent commission but basically every state does it in its own way in some with with some you know various courts here and there\nAre and uh the legislatures will then draw those maps and the district lines are meant to go in place by the twenty twenty two congressional elections so the U.S census happens in twenty twenty\nOr the the official numbers are given to the states about a year later and then the states have about a year to draw district lines everybody knows pretty much where the districts are going to be right there in minor tweaks that happened here and there\nAnd when we get to gerrymander young bats when a that that sort of the pejorative term for when a party draws district lines that are meant to favor their candidate in crazy ways in ways that are where the the communities are divided or to diminish one side's political power or bolster another sides political power\nUm and and you know throughout the years or every state has gone through its own\nHiccups with political gerrymandering\nA it's become a dirty word now and it's something that we're going to see thrown around a lot of you listen next redistricting second\nYear in North Carolina is one of those states has got quite a few stories to tell about redistricting and gerrymandering and David your in Charlotte following the national democratic redistricting committee which Eric Holder is leading we had him on this program to talk about it a while back give us a sense David what's at stake\nPolitically with redrawing these district lines particularly with North Carolina being this kind of interesting example of redistricting and and the efforts to reform it\nI think there's an awful lot at stake um if you think about it this way if you look at the five competitive swing states as a Pennsylvania North Carolina Michigan Ohio Wisconsin you might imagine that those five competitive swing states Sunday similar number of members of Congress both parties\nTo Washington except the reality is dramatically different those five states than forty eight Republicans and Twenty one Democrats to Washington the Democrats have only been successful in flipping one seat\nRed to blue in any of those competitive said in his entire decade and that the Conor Lamb the and the special election in two thousand Seventeen so when the two thousand twelve two thousand fourteen and two thousand sixteen elections there was no swing in any district in any of these competitive swing states\nYou often see this as well as the state legislative level so you have all of the states that are closely divided like say North Carolina I'm you know states in which that Democrats may often when\nMore votes state wide for a chamber and yet here for example Republicans have a super majority\nIn in both the state assembly and also in the state Senate so they're able to completely override\nThe actions of a democratic governor here at makes politics more extreme it inflates members from voters it allows them to do things like the transgender bathroom build it wildly unpopular and yet the\nPoliticians um you know feel completely empowered to go ahead and\nEnact that kind of legislation I'm ... and it also discourages competition in a lot of the states in North Carolina in two thousand sixteen forty nine percent of all statewide seats went without a major party\nCompetitor so voters had no choice animal half of their districts here because folks\nTook a look at those races and said I Can't win or raise enough money to actually make it worth the investment of time\nTo get to some of your comments as well clearly gerrymandering is is as some of your fans of the show no one of our audience as hot as taught us topics including with Michael ...\nFriends of the show no one of our audience hottest taught us topics including with Michael wrote on our Facebook page any party that requires gerrymandering to stay in power doesn't deserve power there shouldn't be partisan\nMichael writes Ohio is heavily gerrymandered however in an election earlier this year voters heavily approved with support from both parties and the issue on the ballots are fairly redrawn districts after twenty twenty\nAnd Laura writes Pennsylvania was gerrymandered the rewrote the map but I Do not believe they were making an active for this twenty Eighteen election ain't that a load of crap\nThat's all the same in North Carolina Laura by the way we did a program a while back in February ... actually about gerrymandering where we put a quiz online we have some gerrymandered districts and we wanted to see if you could tell the difference\nBetween the map of gerrymandered district and an ink blot on a Rorschach test you can find that quiz if you search the word gerrymandering G. E. R. R. Y. M. A. N. D. E. R. I. N. G. it was a program that aired this February you'll find that on our website the one a doc Ford\nKatie let me come to you talk about voters not politicians I understand that this was a redistricting initiative that got started after you were trying to find some way to be politically active but not overtly hyper partisan and this is something that galvanized people around you right\nYeah um I accidentally started a political movement with a Facebook post it was after that twenty sixteen election uh before I'm headed to a Thanksgiving dinner and I had heard my friends and family really\nBeing drawn to both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders I'm with the messages about draining the swamp and the political revolution and\nI realize that you know there's a lot of frustration against the current system in place which makes a lot of sense I remember learning about gerrymandering and it does make it to that our voices aren't heard or that popular a proposal aren't being passed at the local level\nAnd infiltrated the fashion world he sent us a link to a website called gerrymander jewelry dot com this is they say\nGerrymandered jewelry has all these pictures six in fact of voting districts than North Carolina sixth district Texas is thirty fifth district's Louisiana six Florida force Michigan fourteenth\nAnd Ohio's first district and they're selling them as jewelry a hundred and Ninety five dollars each but the proceeds benefit of political action group is trying to get more Democratic governors secretaries of state and attorneys general elected in six key Republican controlled states we got a lot of comments read about\nThe role of Republicans in gerrymandering Scott wrote on our Facebook page I live in Virginia the GOP is dragging its feet on this because they barely held onto a majority with the current maps it's gerrymandered in their favor they're simply trying to push this past the ... election to stem their losses\nIs that fair I don't think that the Republicans have cornered the market on gerrymandering neither party wants to be disadvantaged but what what do we know\nWell the Virginia example he's talking about the house of delegates and a half the ... Democrats came within one seat of winning back the house of delegates back in twenty Seventeen the waiver Janine elections work the delegates are elected in a odd numbered years so it has and that doesn't actually have anything to do with the twenty teen election\nUh there are some there have been some federal challenges to the congressional district lines in Virginia\nA but but that there's a difference between the state legislative districts which is sort of part of a larger story of how Republicans locked in a lot of their games in the U.S house of representatives uh but that's those are two different things you're you're exactly right there the ... no party is blameless in this uh gerrymandering started we get the word\nFrom a guy named Eldridge Gary who was the governor of Massachusetts\nUh back in Eighteen twelve he drew a district line that effectively packed all of the federal and members of the federalist party into one district and that allowed his party the Democratic Republicans imagine if those still existed today a is to win all the districts around it\nOr the a newspaper ... in in Boston took a look at the map they said it looked like a salamander was Jerry's salamander he was a gerrymander ... that's how we actually get the word and so yeah this has been happening since like the beginning of the republic hum you could argue that some of this happened back in in a female and democracy back in you know the\nFive hundred BC uh but when we talk about today yeah both parties do this look Democrats controlled the house of representatives from Nineteen fifty four to Nineteen Ninety four and they did it in a large part by a drawing favorable districts in the south\nThat were meant to lock in their members and in in large degree to discriminate against African American voters\nAre and now even today we see some challenges to district lines drawn by Democrats especially in the state of Maryland\nUh there's one district or out in western Maryland they used to be held by Republican until Democrats redrew the winds and now it's a safe democratic seats so yes both parties do this Republicans have done it a more publicly lately and so therefore they are getting the heat but yeah when we started hearing about\nA fair district lines that generally comes from the people who think that the winds aren't fair and therefore are are probably the ones who are losing elections that's not to diminish the fact that that these lines may not be fair but the people who who cry fairness tend to be the ones who are not not holding the pencils if you will\nWe do get comments from folks on both sides of the aisle complaining about how both sides of the aisle tend to gerrymander Harry wrote on our Facebook page the G O P is going nuts in Colorado over ballot initiatives to redistricted by a nonpartisan commission slow deep tweeted I Wish this was such a hot topic back when ...\nThe mission slow deep tweeted I Wish this was such a hot topic back when Democrats in my state had districts in the shape of a pencil\nJoanne wrote on our Facebook page redistricting reform has been an issue for several years in Indiana as we have a super majority Republican general assembly a Republican governor and the state Supreme Court was a majority appointed by Republican governors at approved by the Republican legislators\nNothing will change as long as the gerrymandered legislator branch is controlled by one party\nSeveral bills have been put forward with lip service for leadership been killed by Republican Sherman who do not believe that Indiana is gerrymandered and see so publicly\nKatie fishy I Wonder if this gets back to something that you said earlier about trying to find something political but not partisan can you give me a sense of some of the conversations you've had\nWith folks that you've been witness to of folks kind of talking across the aisle about this does this feel practically to you on the ground like a unifying issue\nYeah my experience really has been that um I mean in Michigan though we have had Democrats and Republicans control the line drawn process so maybe that helps but\nWe have volunteers who are Democrats or Republicans independents and I think that what we've seen is that no matter which party is in charge in Michigan the really common sense things\nThat we all looked to government at at least help provide basic things like clean water or roads that aren't falling apart um those things aren't happening no matter who's in charge and um\nYou know there's also a Detroit is pretty gerrymandered they try and pack a lot of Democrats into one district but there there are still Republicans do you live in those districts into their voices aren't heard\nOr because a lot of these races are happening in the primaries and we don't really have competitive elections at the statewide level of Michigan we're a lot of people talking about even if they're\nThe of Fishell that their um representative at the party they leg they're much more extreme than what they would like to see\nAnd so I think that in Michigan in particular people have just had enough we feel like our government's doing a lot of overreach and want to help restore some transparency in the system especially for consistently ranked one of the\nLeast transparent states when it comes to transparency in government\nUm and that's the biggest thing we heard all you're doing those town hall with a lot of people saying you know I don't know why these lines are being drawn and then eight years later some emails coming out a talking directly about how the lines were drawn to guarantee one party in advantage or another\nAnd people are tired of it they want to be looked at as having our politicians accountable to us and not special interests um what's been really cool to is that you see a lot of families who have joined voters not politicians to volunteer together even for my family it did work I'm happy that Thanksgiving\nDinner or your family yeah yeah\nMy mom gathered five hundred signatures and as Canada thing every day they got thirty days until the election so it's been really exciting I mean you see a lot of people who are like you know there's nothing that we agree on but I really like working on this issue because the basic concepts of fairness and an impartial system and a system that put the people first", "year": "2018", "show_name": "1A Plus", "city": "Tampa", "day": "08"}
