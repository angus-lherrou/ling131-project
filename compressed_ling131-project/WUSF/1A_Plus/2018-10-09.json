are saying are they saying that one and a half degrees is not a reasonable goal anymore\nWell they very carefully do not take a stand on that question but they do clearly showed that it will be extremely difficult in order to do it essentially you have to do something that humanity hasn't done before which is radically changed\nTo do something that humanity hasn't\nDone before which is radically change a major systems how we get energy how we get food how we get around transportation how we build our cities so they once they've described the magnitude of what's required a it's reasonable to ask whether it can be done\nOkay so the Paris climate agreement that uh of holding warming to a one and a half degrees or above ... over pre industrial levels was considered to be pretty ambitious to begin with\nSo I mean what are scientists saying that we would need will actually looking for is that if you are scientists saying that current practices and current plans to meet that goal or not enough\nUh unequivocal either saying that so they're saying that current promises made by countries which they made as part of the Paris Agreement process\nWill give us three degrees

... we're talking about the PCs latest report released yesterday about the consequences of global climate change it's a very dire new report and it's based on more than six thousand sided studies written by Ninety One authors from forty different countries and\nSaying that if we continue on the path that we are now globally\nThat the devastation that climate change could cause would change human civilization permanently I'm joined today by Chris Mooney he covers climate change energy and the environment for the Washington Post ... del also joined us he's professor of climate sciences at Duke University and was one of the authors on yesterday's report by the inter governmental panel on climate change\nAnd we want to hear from you where it eight hundred for two three eight to five five that's eight hundred\nFor two three talk a and Christian drew I just want to play us a little bit of tape here this is Jim ski scientist and lead author of VIP cc report and he said that we need to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere a lot of it\nBut learning that doing so will also have some consequences\nTo limit more bang to one point five degrees C we would need to start taking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere during the twenty first century\nThe methods for doing this include planting trees bioenergy combined with carbon capture and storage changed lawns management as well as some normal approaches to sort of very early stages of development\nHowever carbon dioxide removal on a large scale could have implications for food security for ecosystems for bio of diversity\nThat Jim ski scientist and lead author of the PCC report Chris Mooney it's the last part I mean we'll talk about ah these negative input as ... as he talks about there but it's this it's when he said that um remove a lot of large scale of carbon dioxide could have implications for food security and things like that what is he talking about\nWhat he's talking about is the this is a key part of the the report not only does it say that a mission\nHas to be cut at a extremely rapid pace such as I said before you have to remove the emissions of a major economy annually but on top of that you have to create an entire new industry the polls carbon monoxide out of the air and that doesn't exist now so people have been trying to imagine it\nIn studies and in climate models and one of the ways in which they imagined it a involves planting huge essentially plantations\nOf trees are crops and using those for energy but making sure that you capture the emissions that are released when they're burned and put those in the ground so that you're sucking carbon dioxide out of the air into the plant and then pulling it into the ground and getting energy along the way\nThis is what he referred to as bio energy combined with carbon capture and storage but there's this huge problem which is that you need an enormous area of land\nTo do this and land has other uses like growing food uh so what they're saying is that we might need so much land to pull carbon out of the year that it might compete\nWe might need so much land to pull carbon out of the year that it might compete with the need to feed of the world's growing population\nDruze you know that sounds like a a very [noise] [laughter] sobering zero sum game\nYeah you know I think that taking the risk that we can admit more carbon now and we will make up for it later by pulling it out of the air\nIs akin to you know buying a new house on a credit card and hoping that eventually you'll get a better job and be able to pay for it you know this was a enormous gamble with the future of our whole planet\nAnd and I think you know where the turning over a large portion of our arable land\nTo grow crops to to burn them\nAnd to use a large portion of our water to grow those crops in our fertilizer have enormous implications for biodiversity inability to defeat the planet and so if we cut our missions much more rapidly and we do have scenarios to do this and the report\nWe do not need to rely on this kind of technological carbon removal you can get away with only planting trees a kind of carbon removal that we already know about and is relatively benign but that requires\nThe most aggressive Kurt cuts in carbon if any of the scenarios we explored\nBut just to be clear I mean as Chris was saying we would sell moved that tree planting globally or be taking place on Arab land that would otherwise be needed for you know to feed the extra two billion people that we expect to be added to the world's population in the next several decades\n[noise] that would generally be restoring abandoned land I marginal lands on how we could if we keep the reliance on these negative admissions at its lowest possible levels which you can only do of course by cutting carbon aggressively right away\nThen we can get away with out really compromising much of our Arab ally\nOkay I Want to get to um the uh the the emissions cutting scenario aggressive emissions cutting scenario that you're talking about uh that you hinted at there and just a second but we do have a lot of callers who want to join us and obviously this is an ... an issue with that that affects us all so let me just get to them a Mars calling from East Lansing Michigan you're on the air\n[noise] Hi my question\nSorry my question is when the people that are profiting from the destruction of firemen oil parents or whatnot when will they be held accountable like the conversation very scary but I never hear anything it gets to make money off of [noise]\nAnd so what I mean when you say accountability what are you asking for\nTaxes or something to fund programs or the thing the the actions taken\nSo you like carbon taxes or income taxes and just just trying to get a sense of what you're hoping for\nI'm I'm thinking that there is something that people make millions of oil\nOkay Chris Mooney I mean first of all thank you for your call in because many do you have a response from her for her\nWell [noise] I don't know I Would I Would put it a little differently I mean this is climate change is the consequence of industrial civilization it's the consequences of all of us are deciding you adopt the technologies that we created\nUm that make our lives better a driving you know cheating your home cooling your home\nAnd many many other things eating food that comes from a very far away and we\nOften forget that every one of those things has the side effect which is that it takes energy and to get that energy mostly burn fossil fuels so the way that we live and the scale at which we are using energy is really what's at stake here um so yeah there's companies that\nUsing energy is really what's at stake here um so yeah there's companies that sell energy a ... at this point a lot of them are are actually fully accepting of the science and trying to find ways to do it differently um so\n... do pick up on that thought because I mean I think Christmas is exactly right this is an indictment of modern civilization and so if that's the very thing that we're saying needs to be changed rapidly how is that possible well the\nThere is an indictment and in some sense of people's choices and people consuming too much red meat and\nYou know people using more energy than they need but I I Believe that this really is also an indictment of some of the fossil fuel companies in automotive companies and those who are have been pushing aggressively and recently succeeding in getting regulations\nAre rolled back and so you take something like release of methane from the natural gas industry\nAnd this was a measure that wouldn't nearly pay for itself because methane is the main component of natural gas they would capture more of their own product\nAnd they said it would cost them a little bit of money so they make up the Trump Administration to push that a regulation back\nIt would almost pay for itself with out even counting for the environmental cost so what's happening in reality\nIs that we all pickup these costs you know more than a hundred billion a year in disaster relief expenditures ... everybody's health care premiums go up when people suffer from heat waves an suffer from air pollution and so\nThese companies really are profiting\nBy imposing a hidden tax on every other part of American business and American consumers and I think until we do change that like something you said may not carbon tax that really reflects the true cost of these activities we're not going to make the shift that aren't necessarily\nLet's go to Larry who's calling from middle field Connecticut Larry you're on the air\nI I'm just wanted to mention that I worked for a company in national company and although we pulled

going to have to undergo in order to get a hold\nOn a climate effects are carbons effect on on the climate\nSo I Want to play a little bit of tape here this is Jim ski he's the lead author of the IPC the report he was in South Korea yesterday saying that now the government that scientists have sounded the alarm its governments that have to decide what to do about the grim forecast\nThe messages we've told you the scientific fought the evidence the costs which is up to the government snow to decide what to do with it [noise]\nOkay so that was Jim ski just yesterday so let's roll back the clock a little bit and go back to December two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump here's what he said about global warming\nMom is talking about all of this was the global warming and that is a lot of it's a hoax hawks I mean it's a money making industry okay out\nThat's December of two thousand Fifteen then candidate Donald Trump or of course Mr Trump is now president of the United states ... your author or one of the authors on yesterday's reports\nUh I mean where two and a half years out from when Donald Trump said those things about global warming but in light of what has just been written what do you think\nAbout what the the president's attitude was about global warming\nUnfortunately well he's liable to say things well outside of what many in his party would say that's a really quite a common view for most of the Republican Party and it didn't used to be this way even a few decades ago both parties support it environmental\nProtection and now it is just become in particular since the passage of the since the Citizens United decision with unlimited campaign finance without anonymous campaign finance it's more and more\nPaying finance without anonymous campaign finance in more and more of the Republican Party at least appears to be beholden to the fossil fuel industries and now they're they're toting things like creating coal jobs even though renewables create more jobs than does coal and even though\nI'm coldest is going away not because of government forces but because of the other fields just being cheaper because of market forces so there there's really this this narrative from the Republican Party\nThat's wildly inconsistent with both the facts and the majority of of Americans public opinion or even the marketplace ...\nChris Mooney have we heard an official response from the Trump Administration from the state department or a firm about a response to the PCs report [noise]\nUh yes we have statements from the state department and also I'm from ... acting administrator Andrew wheeler\nUm in our story actually I'm an ... wheeler you know ... one of our journalist asked him what it would take to keep the world the below a dangerous level of climate change and ah he didn't identify specific level but he pointed out um that what you're doing right now would\nHelp um help to lead to continue innovation and clean coal technologies\n'em and these technologies will be exported to other countries are still there wheeler was highlighting something that we also heard from the world's coal association or they're saying that because this report quarterly targets colon says that we're going to have to burn a lot less coal maybe phase out entirely and what they're saying is actually\nNo we need to create technologies that captured the emissions of calling Barrett blow the ground um so that's one of the angles or that as being taken\nOn the report I'm the I'm seeing here that a State Department official as your reporting ... said that quote\nGovernments do not formally indoor specific findings presented by the authors\nAre and that and the person went on to say though that from two thousand five to twenty Seventeen us carbon ... related emissions declined by fourteen percent while global energy related carbon emissions rose by Twenty one present during the same time so it's so touting us efforts to to cut emissions there well\nAnd it did not incorrect us demands have gone down um they haven't gone down as much as would be needed a for the world to be on track for one point five degrees Celsius All right let's take another call here breed is calling from Baltimore, Maryland Bree you're on the air\nHigh magnitude um [noise] I just had um a couple um I guess more like a question ... um I think making and significant changes manageable for the average person is\nProbably our best\nHope of of actually making change so high and it's like a key campaign like this band that are you know sort of blew up on social media and ah you know people really ran with it unfortunately it's not enough to make\nA dent on and on the problems that we had in the environment\nA but it's you know is even eating at you know taking one day a week or we don't consume meat from one day is that enough to make a change yeah\nWell ... thank you I'm a I'm a I didn't mean to cut you off there but thank you for your call because I just want to turn it to drew ... now a individual level efforts a professor she can do is breeze asking could they make a difference they can\nAnd again I'd like to highlight that there's some really positive news in this report too so we did not act for example investigate the entire world going to vegetarianism that seems just some so wildly improbable that it's not really worth looking out for\nWhat we looked at where\nLee improbable that it's not really worth looking at but what we looked at what people in primarily in the west\nWho eat too much red meat according to the world Health Organization healthy dietary guidelines\nJust going back to what's best for them might so it's not like we're asking people to make a huge sacrifice we're asking people to do what they should do anyway for their own body and that's enough to make a big difference livestock has an enormous footprint with the land that deforestation the land to feed\nGrow crops to feed the cattle et cetera and so I think there there are things we can do more active\nTransport but biking and walking more use of mass transit those are active transport it's also good for your health you know but there but there are limits to we cannot all go buy electric cars unless there is charging infrastructure and currently at least in the state where I live we have a special tax\nOn electric cars rather than the government trying to encourage us to adopt them so I ... that there are ways that we can facilitate people making choices we can buy more efficient air conditioners\nOnly if they're available in the stores and they are not available and less companies are pushed to make these kind of products so it's an interplay between individual choice and the system that that determines the range of options that are available let's go to Kevin\nWho's calling from ... Louisiana Kevin you're on the air\nHello Hi Kevin what\nDoes that how you doing I just had a comment to make 'em you know I work in a in an oil industry\nAnd um there's a lot of infrastructure that's already in place like in the Gulf of Mexico per se there's two thousand platforms out there that has jazz jackets and the water might be a little less than that but at least a thousand\nWhere wind farms could be adapted to those jackets easily I mean but they are naturally infrastructure would have to be built to you know the power generation to give it to the beach but\nThat that's something that that could be done also went on when an oil company those exploration on a certain area\nThey have to mitigate somewhere else it doesn't matter they drop a drop all they're not if they kept clean the whole car they have to spend money to mitigate another area that needs to mitigate needs\nRestoration ... so it's it's a balance you know and they do spend money or in to the good I guess some people call it to the you know mining industry some people it's bad yeah but we use it we need it you know I just that's much more common\nLittle ... Kevin thank you actually so much for your call cause many do you want to respond when that first probably to Kevin indicating that I mean he's out there working in the Gulf Oil fields saying that there is an infrastructure in place if we wanted to to expand a wind generation\nWell there's actually a close relationship between offshore oil and offshore wind I mean you you you find a a company like status oil um which is a major oil producer now going a very strong into the uh offshore wind industry and that sort of the deep\nOffshore wind industry which is where you need really really powerful infrastructure and where some of the most powerful when can be harnessed and if you can get it to shore than you can get yourself quite a lot of renewable energy I I think I think it goes to show that there is a corporate transition that's happening right now again the it's not at the pays\nThat Dorie put justice Brett Kavanaugh birthday on the Supreme Court this afternoon on all things considered from NPR News at the\nFour o'clock here on W.

had accomplished I mean let's just talk about it first of all even free sewing for years uh el ... for a long time was one that uh you didn't want to do\nFor a long time was one that uh you didn't want to deal with why\nWell I kind of wanted to but was afraid to um you know it seemed like too much but undertaking I mean a ... something that I'd been thinking about since two thousand nine and then I finally did in a last year so that's eight years of sort of dreaming about you know this big potential climb but it just took a long time to get there\nOkay so so tell me why though I mean for people who don't know A L cap or sort of what it means to climbers what what is it about this particular giant wall that he's so imposing to even the world's best climbers\nThat we hope you'll tune in

rom go faster than I Would say outside of the down on her full blocks\nTo twenty six or live out\nHere listening to Alex ... visualizing the route that he took to free so little climb seventies el ... and that's him going through step by step all the moves he would make in order to conquer the one of the world's most famous a rock climbing walls and he did it with no roads\nThat effort is captured in the documentary free so low which was directed by Elizabeth chai far Sally and Jimmy Chan and Alex tunneled\nIs with us this hour to talk about how he free so loaded el cap a Alex tell us a little bit more about about this particular thing that you do the notes that you take and how you mentally prepare for the climbed do you really memorize almost every move that you're going to make\nWell I mean you can hear in those notes that that is not every single move\n'em I mean I have to memorize every single move for the hardest sections like what we were just talking about what the Boulder problem I knew every single hand and foot placement of exactly how I Move my body but then\nYou know from my no for pitch one was very rough just like step left or to keep place you know the rest of the pitch I could just count on myself to to climate appropriately without having to memorize everything movement but then I also climbed the whole whole face so many times that I kind of just remembered most of it\nUm you know but I didn't have to specifically memorized every single move right is a lot of them\nOkay but so this is part of what did the documentary really sort of underscores that you have this thing that you call them in a sense when you first of all you you were very deeply prepared but you also have this thing that you called mental armor ... what is\nThat why I actually um I actually don't call a mental owners are in the film a Tommy says that a few times and he's actually sort of quoting something I'm like I've had some other climbing films from for many years ago where I talked about mental armor\nBut I'm actually a big part of the process for me to be able to free solo cap was to sort of get past that I think because I feel like the idea of mental farmers to to sort of\nYou know shield yourself from like it's it's something it's too scary you sort of get psyched up and like shield your mind from it and then do it despite the fact that it's quite scary and I felt like that wasn't really a sustainable way to climb oh crap I get it it's just too big of a wall and it's too difficult and I was basically worried that that at some point you know it's sort of\nCome to my senses and things like oh wow this is really scary like what am I doing up here so I kind of felt like I had to prepare to the point where I didn't need any kind of armor where I just felt comfortable walking up to the wall and being like I Need the wall is the wall and I'm and I'm capable of climate is you know not having to get all psyched up or anything\nBut how do you get to that point though I mean that there's got to be a lot of focus in work that it takes to get to that point\nWell yeah I mean that's that's that's basically the the film and now two years of training physically and mentally and practicing and and just refining my techniques and eventually you know I'm into took a long time to feel comfortable yeah and and that doesn't even include districts years before that I've been dreaming about it and thinking about it in climbing tons of other routes that were similar but slightly different\nYou know take a step back here for a second because I could talk to you for the whole hour about the technical have preparation and I'm feet of climbing el ...\nFree solo rowing is also to be realistic I mean people do die of the world's best free solace many of them have died and then that is shown in this documentary ... you're going to hear a climber Tommy Caldwell in this clip a plus news report describing\nSome of the death of the world's best free solar climbers\nI think everybody who is made free cell I Am a big part of their life\nSo called three fellow climbing the mountain when this past week at the age of fifty two\nWe're starting to sort of on the death of us climate showing Larry [noise]\nShow them was killed in Utah was found a couple of days ago Harris nursing was climbing a new some of the valley [noise] his body was found Saturday morning proceed climate as usual alone without the world's\nMost people that are pushing the limits that they have the mentality of screw it whatever happens happens [noise]\nTown they're from the documentary free so low I mean that just all begs the question Alex how did you get into this what is it about climbing with no ropes that has really that really drew you in\nA yeah well you're good at the good question um I mean basically you know I mean to not all free sowing as extreme you know it's not all the face of all kept sometimes ... scrambling a beautiful ridge in the mountains you know I mean sometimes it feels more like an extension of hiking and so\nThere is definitely a place for for rope climbing in the mountains and sort of a more efficient and faster where to climb\nAnd so when I was younger and I was growing up climbing in the Sierra\nUm I mean you could I was I was sort of an antisocial youngsters so combined the fact that I didn't really know many climbers didn't have many partners and then combined with just the the the feeling of freedom to speed or the efficiency I mean there's certain joy in in climbing by herself\nAnd so I just sort of you know got into it to be clear free sewing a stone at small fraction of of my normal climbing yeah you know I'd I'd I climb all styles you know all you know every sort of climbing with ropes with partners on expeditions various\nVarious types of climbing and then for selling has always sort of represented this this extra little side\nBut you can understand why it's the it's the part of your career that draws the most attention because it just defies most people's a tolerance for risk right I mean you\nKnow I yeah I I totally understand that and I mean it certainly always been a very inspiring part of climate to me as well you know it's only a small part of what I Do okay you know it's always been sort of the most significant in a lot of ways\nTo talk to me about that I mean what is it how is what what is it that you're feeling when you're on those big faces with no roads are mean is it is it is zone that you just cannot enter or experiencing any other way\nWell I I don't know I mean I'm sure that humans can experience that feeling and many other ways I think that for me it's sort of the easiest way to tap into that that feeling of of doing something challenging but doing very well you know the feeling of flow whatever you want to call it but\nBut um you know feeling like you're you're close to to tap into your potential or whatever yeah um\nWell here here's why ask okay because I mean a a a long time ago when I was in college I did a little climbing to I mean just sport climbing no more than a hundred feet up but you know and on in in some beautiful places in the western United States and it was really I mean it was thrilling there's something about [noise]\nYou know every climbed that I did that I got a little better at and it's just like super amateur stuff I'm not saying it's anywhere near a even a million miles of what you do Alex but but even my like low level climbing every every new pitch that I was able to do there was something about um mastering minded ...\nFeeling of constant improvement yeah constantly challenging yourself a little bit I mean that's exactly what what I enjoy about free zone is seeking out slightly bigger challenges things that are slightly harder than what you've done before so you feel like you're confident learning or growing you know so that you feel like you're always a little bit better what you do\nOf course with reselling though the cost of in the mistake of absolute so you know you're you're going to push yourself to what is an inevitable perhaps I Hope not but never to blend well\nPerhaps I Hope not but then another to blend well I mean\nWe were all facing the number one and I mean we're all gonna die um I'm trying my best not to climb and you know are very much want to move to old age and her family and all that but\nUm no I mean I I I don't\nThink that if I just keep pushing middle for sure dark climbing the tunnel into well\nLet me just reiterate nobody wants [laughter] but I'm a little bit but we get some calls in here because we've got a lot of people who have questions for you Alex uh we're speaking with Alex ... he is a professional rock climber a best known\nFor free so loving and in fact he did a free so low Yosemite is el Capitan it's a three thousand foot wall in Yosemite one of the most famous rock climbing walls anywhere in the world he did it without ropes and that story is\nCaptured in the documentary free so low which is directed by Elizabeth ... and Jimmy ... so\nLet's go to Kay who's calling from the new Ohio okay you're on the air\nYeah Hi make that and you do that several of the questions I was going to ask Alex about what drives him and that that that edge of a risk and you know that\nThat drive to conquer but I go back and forth for older Colorado to Ohio and have so for the last forty five years so there's a huge rock climbing community there and about four years ago go at the Boulder film festival they showed about four different documentaries\nOn climbing and so I was around that climate community there and they did show want documentary on Yosemite and Alex it was so fascinating that\nAnd then you have like the\n... will visit puppy clubs at USF Tampa saint Petersburg and the next ... Wednesday at seven forty five AM and again at five forty four pm\n\n[noise] support for on point comes from a guy come offering the guy told mobile labs that guy comb overlaps doors ID cards enables bill pay and submit policy updates and clean report directly from a user cell phone learn more in Geico dot com and college fine\nWe're consulting work with high school students to identify and cheese their goals in high school complete the college admissions process and negotiate merit scholarship or more and more in college fine dot com [noise]\n\nDifferent on point I'm making a chocolate bar the we're talking this hour with Alex tunneled he is a rock climbing superstar and he is the first person in the world to free so low\nThat means without robes Yosemite three thousand foot wall el ... and that feed is documented in the new movie free so low which is directed by Elizabeth chai far Sally and\nJimmy Chin I'm going to get some callers in on a second but Alex we just heard a professor ... Joseph there who did that an MRI skin of your brain started talking about\nSome of the unique things that she saw a in her analysis they're wondering now that you know that about\nUm you know the the shape and response of your ... has that changed at all sort of how you see a you're climbing or what you might be capable of doing\nNot particularly um ... I mean in general I I have a strong sense of I mean and I am who I Am and you know in some ways no matter how much you look look inside I mean I'm Still the same person you know I find it all kind of interesting but\nUm I mean we we had a much longer discussion when we first to scan yeah and um and they take away to me was basically just but you know practice that over time you can do some types of things and that was very much been my experience\nThat um that you can learn over time starts yeah it was ... I heard that she would uh one of the previews for for free so I Would have been good to see her rather than the other one in ... hours or more actually\nOkay what would you put it we can definitely get you back in touch you I I was really excited to have to because I think a again as she said and you just said there's this uh you are living proof about the effectiveness of very focused concentration and training and perseverance as well about what can be accomplished but\nThat's that's how I see it but it's interesting because a lot of I feel like people take what they want out of the film you know a lot of people have been seen this and uh\nAnd they just said it was like oh well your brain's effective so obviously this is easy for you or you know I mean people sort of take whatever they they hear from it or I mean I've always heard it as as you know with with practice you can prepare for for many things\nUm but you know and so I suppose it's a little bit open a new\nYeah but one of the things that the movie does explores how the people around you deal with the stress of uh of what you're trying to accomplish so let's get a call uh who wants to a collie wants to talk to you about exactly that's what's going to Garret who is calling from Deerfield New Hampshire guarantee you're on the air\nBag or out\nUm you know it's one thing is to watch your preparing to go through in a regular on the wall where you are in their every move like but\nThere is off the aspect of family and bought one that was just wondering how do you prepare them and how do you measure repair 'em before going out of one of these big feet wiped out through a photo of loved ones or anything like that ever come into your mind while you're in the ... stone nervous\nMulti thousand for them\nThat's the risk multi thousand foot down\nYeah I mean that those and that's probably the biggest challenge in um I'm not sure if you've seen the film yet or not but um but I mean a big part of the film was chronically my relationship with my girlfriend saw it and how we sort of navigate it that because in a lot of ways reselling it'd be easier if you're if you're single or relatively unattached\nBut you know Saudis\nOr sort of argue that ah that I could I could have both you know I could have a a good relationship and still climbing a high level or just needed to to balance it properly and I mean that's I mean that's that's the big challenge but um but I think we never get it All right I mean she kind of\nGave me the space I needed to climb at the right times but in general you know we had a totally normal normal you know healthy relationship\nWell let me ask you was asking though in the middle of a big time I mean well let's talk about al ... ascent yes on ... did you think of her or is what you bring that I mean how how focused\nOn the on the hardest sections which represents maybe half the ... um I wasn't thinking about anything I was just sort of physically executing moves and just performing but then on the easier train 'em I was able to think about other things and think about friends and partners uh\nI mean I remember specifically on on my free souls or cap I spent you know maybe a five hundred foot section in the middle of this kind of easy or thinking about some of the partners I've been up there earlier in the year with just a couple of other professional climbers in front of mind and and you know feeling really grateful for the people who sort of helped me on my on my journey than then\nYeah I mean certainly I was thinking about Saudi as soon as I talked out about my girlfriend um [laughter] you know when I'm finished\nYeah [laughter] well I mean as you write in a free solo does the movie does explore um your relationship with Saudi McCandless your girlfriend and I want to play a little clip from it because here in this exchange a sunny is asking you\nHow are you factor her into your decisions about free solo climbing\nI Want to like I Want to my knowledge to compression you have any more I'm going to die like minds on view what we want to do while we're hearing a time when people die\nFeel like I Want to eat in the play\nAnd when you sound like you take me into the equation [noise]\nYou're rushing sound you're going to be on with cutting into question actually change when you actually make decision instead of having\nI had some kind of obligation to maximize my lifespan and like you obviously I'd have to give up so I got on\nWays to me asking you do you see that as an obligation now\nOr not [noise]\n\nBut I appreciate your your concerns I have you know I respect that but [noise] but I Know what if you obligation now\nIs that true Alex he's still not feel obligated to maximize your life span\nYeah it's kinda hard for me to listen to some of those there's no like oh I mean I have that that struggled through the whole film there there's so many sections hall cringe that's that's pretty that's that was on top or you know I should have been kinder um but I mean I think that that a big part of what I was getting out there that\nYou know whether I'm thinking about her or my family or anybody else um I you know I don't want to die climbing like I'm already doing my best to not fall off the wall and so\nYou know if I'm if I'm thinking about others not I'm Still sort of going through the same motion I'm Still doing the same things to to make sure that I'm prepared yeah\nBut but also I mean that conversation I think we've been dating for about a year at that point and I've been dreaming about recently all kept for maybe the seven proceeding years\nAnd so I felt like the ratio was was was different you know I mean now we've been in a great relationship for three years and I've you know finish this big climb and so you know moving forward them I'm sure the the calculations would\nAnd so you know moving forward them I'm sure the the calculations would be different\nOh okay so there are potentially ten and so she went out and potentially\nSo well I'm I'm sure it would be different and yeah I'm sure it would be different or I don't know which way\nTo go to another caller Michael is calling from Kiev, Ukraine Michael you're on the air\nOh yeah Hi greetings or how you doing a ... all highly Alex you have the uh the mutant climber brain so congratulations a I'm a\nI'm a climber I've I did a various things from the early seventies and\nClimbing my greatest accomplishment was a devil's tower in Wyoming um which you know but the easiest thing on it is the hardest thing I can do [laughter] um so you know you you are a Superman and totally insane\nWhen I was there a there was just this kid who is free sewing it and you know I did I did some of that in the beginning and and it's actually easier and a lot of ways because it's so much faster and and you don't have to stop importing protection which was really hard and really dangerous I really have been done too much leading and uh\nYou know and I I was I was ... I you know the TV reporter I'd done documentaries and uh I really want to do to documentary on this guy because I sort of thought I was talking to a ghost I just didn't think he'd be around and firefighters and but what he did was\nHe actually repelled off the top of this thing and that's twelve hundred feet a vertical crystal on a vertical columns really really difficult it's a thing and the close encounters of the third kind and repelled off the top\nLike foot by foot and a quarter of a mile including the whole room with metal toothbrushes and broke off boulders you know that are exploding like like ... you know blow\nOh and then and then it says is right that they need that he then later free climbed yeah I was wondering if you\nEver had done something that you know incredibly intensive and ah you know I Know you can't give a it's a very smooth including thing that hundreds of thousands of people do yeah ... um\nYeah but no I I I very much went through that exact same process I mean ah\nYou know the the film frees oil is is very much about the two years that senator Palin wall cleaning memorizing holds um you know\nI don't know if it's actually in the film but I definitely did spend some time removing some loose rocks from from one key section of a crack and um and then I can just throw 'em down and let them is because I was there too many people in your seventies but so I put them in a backpack and repelled back down at them\nOn his birthday which has been a girl and other auto refrain the adventure begin Tuesday night at nine o\nW us maybe nine [noise]\n\nKwan McDonald an unarmed black Jean who's killer a white police officer awaits sentencing\nWhat will this case I mean and the fight for police reform\nFrom W AMU and NPR in Washington DC in one area [noise]\nEither I'm Joshua Johnson today on one\nAre you there I'm Joshua Johnson today on what age the future of law enforcement\nChicago police officer Jason Van Dyke could spend years in prison for second degree murder it's a rare conviction some activists considered it unlikely and some in law enforcement considerate heavy handed [noise] what what happens now in the larger push to rebuild trust between police and the public especially in communities of color\nWill explore that today and we'd love to hear from you sure what you know if you're working to improve policing from the inside or the outside\nFemale won a a double A.

year to not release any body cam footage to the public except for family members involved to view if I could make one law to increase mixed trust with the public this would be the one\nBe showing wrote on our Facebook page maybe the real issue here is that the criminal justice system in general and law enforcement in particular are being deployed to manage the effects of social and economic problems that they are ill equipped to resolve\nAnd Seth wrote on our Facebook page as a white person who works in an office that staffs mostly black people\nHearing stories of police shootings scares me that one day I might lose a loved co worker just because of their skin color when I found out they found this man guilty I was elated it's time for bad cops to stop being protected killers\nDisc or do I know I had to cut you short before we pause my wonder if we do pick up with sets comment and finding officer Van Dyke guilty it seems rare that officers are convicted after shooting someone under questionable circumstances what's the legal reason behind that\nWell there is a decision from the United States Supreme court that really is the\nKey to all of this and that is the decision that the court made many years ago Graham case it basically said that when you are determining whether or not an officers engaged in the use of excessive force it much basically take the in the shape\nThat that the steps of the state of the officer so it's a very subjective standard what would a reasonable officer has done in that situation\nSo it is not an object that look it's what is the officer feeling what is the officer see\nWhat is the officer experiencing so that's what the jurors are required to do it as a result you find very few judgment first of all you know in in civil ensuing police departments are jurors\nYou know and and civil ensuing police departments are jurors have to again hold the standard and prosecutors before they decide to to charge the officer have to look at the standard and say what would an officer reasonable officer in that situation have done so\nIt is the Supreme Court that has set this rule for all law enforcement agencies in the country\nAnd they were over Eighteen thousand separate police departments throughout the United states they all have different rules but they are all under the umbrella of whatever the Supreme Court sets of that is the rule that is out there now\nYou were by the way referring to the keys is Graham versus Connor it's a case from a Nineteen eighty nine and some of you actually commented with regards to what's going on and officers mines like Peter Peter emailed\nIt seemed like today was the mentality of police officers that their life is paramount beyond all else including their safety I feel like whenever they are threatened with any sort of possible harm to use deadly force in the new somehow justified\nThis is a career in which they signed up for a similar to the military were they know they're going to be put in harm's way to protect and serve the are paid for this\nLet's add one more voice to our conversation before we get to some more of your comments joining us now on the line is Shannon ... the Chicago police officer who was also a whistle blower within the department work undercover with the FBI Shannon welcome to the program\n[noise] thank you Joshua\nNo I understand you had been working as an FBI informant within the department and as a result of what happened that caused some of your fellow officers not to be too fond with you ... what happened that caused such stirred did it have to do with with corruption inside the Chicago police department\n[noise] absolutely dash law I was working as an undercover narcotics officer with the FBI and um I had discovered that some of my fellow officers were\nActually involved and the money the narcotics trade with and the Chicago area and there for I began\nAnd operation dubbed operation brass tacks against some of my fellow officers who\nI use that term officer loosely because if you are on the other side of the law you are really not an officer but they did have badges and ultimately that\nLed these officers one of them being a bus to go to federal prison and that made me very unpopular among the rank and file within to Chicago police department\nBecause before I came forward with operation brass tacks the code of silence\nWas on her dad's you didn't talk about it\nIt didn't exist I they tried to label man it's crazy for believing that this was actually going on within the ... the department so it made me very unpopular and lead to a lot of police retaliation\nI Wonder why that is from your\nPerspective I mean I Can't imagine I've never been a law enforcement officer have law enforcement in my family but I've never taken an oath so I I Can't I'm speaking as an outsider\nBut I Would think you know if I knew that there were reporters who worked for my station who were lying in stories and they got caught I Would be grateful to see them go because they dragged all of us now why do you think it's not a similar mentality in law enforcement\nYeah honestly a lot of police officers dead approach man they still talk to me and you are correct on his police officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with ...\nPolice officers absolutely do not want to work alongside with corrupt officers however the code of silence is so strong within the Chicago police department and I feel that does go across departments nationwide that officers actually\nFear what will happen to them if they break this code of silence and\nWhat was interesting to discover during this journey of\nBreaking the code of silence is that there's this common misconception that it's a blue officers blue shirt common St officers going against other officers when actually I learned that the retaliation came from the top down\nBosses were actually\nIn ... corrupting the officers who were working with me not to back me up or they would be the next Shannon Spalding so out of\nFear of becoming me out of fear of retaliation themselves or putting their lives in danger losing their job what could happen to them they complied\nBecause they it it's easier it's easier than going through everything that I had to go through and even though officers didn't want to they thought they had to I had officers come up to me and say you know I Believe in what you're doing but I Can't be seen talking to you because I'll be next\nWe'll let me play a clip from the president of Chicago's fraternal order of police carbon

O. X. P. O. P.\nIn the store and we'll share some of your questions and stories tomorrow on one day\nBack now to our conversation with Neal Franklin Shannon Spalding Patrick Smith and judge will doors Cordell let's get to some more of your comments before we start kind of looking forward at where the effort to improve policing in America might be going\nHey sailor tweeted the reasonable officer standard is a very easy standard to apply it's not that hard we do need to eliminate the criminal justice college\nTo apply it's not that hard we do need to eliminate the criminal justice college major and higher police with degrees in psychology or sociology too many cops have no business carrying a badge and the gun however delving had these questions Galvin writes the question is what is reasonable\nTo do so being a police officer shouting mortars constitute the right to use deadly force is a drug dealer running away from the police deserved to be shot\nWhile they may be criminals or the actions from the police equivalent to the criminals auctions ... maybe you should respond to golf and how do we suss out you know minor sense what reasonable mess use\nReasonable illness is in the eye of the beholder it really has no one definition and what jurors are required to do is put themselves in the shoes of the officer\nAnd what was the officers dating experiencing and often times incidents happen and you know just a matter of a few seconds so it's there really is not one definition of it but but I Do want us to\nGet to something you said Joshua about you know looking ahead I Believe it's time to we imagine policing in America\nPolicing in America today is is ... militaristic and police departments officers are seen as an occupying force especially in communities of color and in low income community if that's not how policing started in this country\nPolicing started with individuals who lived in the community who knew everyone and they were people who were not seen as an occupying force there were people there to basically provide a service and help the individuals in the community\nAnd it has dramatically changed we have police departments armed to the teeth with tanks and all kinds\nOf of the equipment that uh are commonly used in the military and I think it's time to to change this whole thing we need to start thinking outside the box why do we need police officers to basically a patrol and and take care of traffic issues\nFor why can't that come from within the humidity why can't individuals' community members somehow the debt the ties to deal with with those kinds of things that the minor kinds of things that are happening in the community\nMoon sometimes somebody research brutal and I'm I'm a disagreement you're just by way of conflicts there are some places where the lower level of sworn law enforce off or worse when officer does deal with things like parking enforcement and traffic enforcement things that are less likely to require deadly force\nShort but but but my point is that that our our whole attitude and this is even within police departments they see themselves as this you know kind of a militaristic force and and they they do have a command structure and\n... and and so what I'm saying is that maybe it's time now to say let's pull back from this whole image we have of police being occupiers and look at a different model entirely\nI'm not opposed to criminal to criminal justice reform but look what happened\nWe we get body cameras and what what happens well we have officers central oh don't turn their cameras on or we have places like Chicago where it takes more than a year and a court order ticket footage out on for example in liquid shooting so that that the whole lack of transparency\nPolicing for example has very little sunshine\nThere's very little sunshine and police say we don't get to know who these officers are their track records their history they're disciplined history it's very very difficult to get that information and what state\nAre going to do with the comment that one of our listeners left for us rich\n... ... state I think that dovetails with the comment that one of our listeners left for us Reggie who lives in Maryland lifted is in our inbox\nI talk to police both black and white and ah they seem to have this militaristic approach to the community I have had experiences where you know we just simply\nAnd I would rather have conflict where ah with me rather than actually serve it I really think that they should\nYou know take away the first couple of months but at least to buy a it's added a community without gun makers Dana community the forced to have a dialogue with community I think it'd be a lot better uh which certainly makes me\nReggie thanks for calling in and sharing your thoughts with us Neal Franklin I Love you to respond to that but if I could first\nIf we could contrast what Reggie said with another set of comments that we've gotten from some of our listeners like what ... wrote scholar writes\nPolice put their lives on the line everyday protecting our society Ninety percent nine zero percent of the cases put forward by activists as examples of police brutality involve people not complying why is the outrage not centered around these individuals' behavior that got them shot\nIf a cop breaks the law I'll convict him but if there's any doubt I'm siding with the police one hundred percent of the time\nNeal what would you say to folks who said that police work is inherently difficult inherently dangerous potentially deadly and then we as a public also have a role to play in easing the tension that officers feel about just being able to get home at night\nSo I Believe it was Reggie that left a message yes um\nYou know that was such a brilliant comment because forcing the dialogue see when you develop a relationship with those people you are serving the citizens who are serving\nAnd you get their support your job doesn't isn't as dangerous as it is today it you know going back to what the judge courthouse had come\nOut used to be having relationships walking up and down the street talking with citizens talking with the neighbors\nWhen something happens they support you when you had those relationships but when you have this occupying force will you know none of the people are very few of the people were the ones that you do know there's conflict\nOn the under ... on the other end of that relationship that's a problem this goes to community control policing that I mentioned before\nWhere the community sets the philosophy where the community sets the budget for those in uniform where the community decides who the the leader is going to be whether you call them achieve for commissioner or whatever\nWith the community decides what's important with the community decides you know what we can handle these issues that the ground level we just want you to pay attention to people hurting other people and this is how we want you to do that\nBut policing is very political political through the unions it's political through the mayors and governors and we'll never get to that place into the community decides they come together and say we want control over our police departments and this is how we want to do it\nHaving that oversight at the beginning means that you don't need police review boards at the end when something goes horribly wrong\nIs speaking of which we got some ideas from some of you about what could be done with regards to policing and review boards were part of it including on a larger scale\nJamie asked shouldn't there be a national group or board who could provide oversight over individual police departments they could be an objective trusted advisory board who's judgments both sides would trust and accept and to whom and aggrieved local citizens group could appeal\nTrust and accept and to whom and aggrieved local citizens group could appeal\nPaolo tweeted police forces with their training transformed them from people's defenders into what's going to these photos with this dance to police forces not your friend even if your a regular law abiding citizen so maybe

A. M. U. dot org\nSpeaking of the world of work there's been some breaking news this morning about a woman who is choosing a new job and has resigned from or current position\nNikki Haley America's ambassador to the United nations announced her resignation this morning\nHe was formerly the governor of South Carolina has somewhat international reputation for being willing to take on her boss from time to time she told the New York times she doesn't agree with the president on anything but it's on everything but says there was a right and wrong way to address that will pick up the phone call them or meet with him in person\nShe'll also be remembered in part for striking back at White House adviser Larry Kudlow who suggested she might have been confused regarding Russian sanctions she told Fox News with all due respect I don't get refute that don't get confused\nShe and the president met today at the White House she lavish praise on him and his family he was part of what ambassador Haley said\nI Can't say enough good things about Jared ... guy Jared is such a thing\nThat no one understand I mean to redo the NAFTA deal the way we can I'm what I've done working with him on the middle east peace of mind it is so unbelievably loud diamond and an office in just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the scenes\nThat I Wish more people knew about the world that our country because there and\nUm that said ministry and I'll just have to say I'm certainly thank you to my family my ... at the same and um my two little ones I adore them and putting us un you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time and energy into it um but and they have a lot of heart\nReally wanted to make America proud and so with that I'm not leaving until the end of the year my goal is that we make sure that everything is in the slaves and on for the next disaster to command but now\nI don't have anything that I'm where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing when I was governor for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand year fly to church shooting associating with a lot and then to come in\nAnd just getting years have flash of Enron and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to the south let's enough to know when you step aside and allow someone else to be the jobs so they can never find it in a\nLifetime and I will say that um if are all in here that are going to ask about twenty twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty I can promise you what I'll be doing is paying for this one so I look forward to supporting the president\nElection but as Mickey Hayley the U.S ambassador to the United nations speaking just a few minutes ago at the White House announcing that she'll be resigning from that post\nHouse announcing that she will be resigning from that post back now with our conversation with ... brown and maybe by way of a transition when she gets to an email from Hillary who says I've noticed more attention since the twenty sixteen election of President Trump how has that changed the work environment have you noticed a difference\nAnd absolutely ... absolutely I don't think work I think this is the whole point work is not immune\nFrom the larger culture and I think we have seen just like we've seen increased polarization in our families and our neighborhoods among our friends at work to edit feels dicey or at work um I think that\nPeople have to be careful and especially when there's power differential and it it's I I actually believe it's become a pretty significant source of anxiety at work and how\nJust being able to talk politics or culture or any of your other dividing line\nYeah 'cause everything feels like it's one step away from getting into a cultural debate where we find other people's opinions and comprehensible\nTo see I Wonder if that kind of for people who are not inclined to time to open up\nIf that ... toward keeping the professional and personal separate that at work I just need to be this one person I Do to keep my head down and get to not make waves I Need to be obedient I Need to be efficient I Need to do the job and get the hell out of there\nAnd the minute that we start talking about emphasizing and being vulnerable and being urban and compassionate and knew that opens the door for me to say something about how I voted or you know whether I own a firearm or who I pray to or who I Love\nThat's going to turn into a gigantic wildfire at work like it almost feels like\nIt's an easy way to give yourself ammunition to put on more armor instead of less\nI think you're absolutely right and here's the hard answer I'd never seen anything meaningful are significant come from mouth shut had down\nIn my career\nThat's just not how we make contributions\nAnd so what we have to do is learn how to listen talk here each other and\nRumble and we use the term rumble because it really feels like a rumble rumble with the vulnerability of seeing other people as people and being seen as a person and it's a muscle it's a foundational skill set\nI don't think spending what ... what do we spend about ... about a half of our adult lives at work I don't think spending half of our adult lives in armor\nIs something that most of us are willing to do I think the psychological emotional spiritual and physical costs are too high\nAnd we're not solving problems I Need you to bring all of you to work I Need the combination of all of your experience as all of who you are to address the problems\nFrom reading your book and based on the research that fuel to book a lot of what you describe points to that kind of armor as an indicator of where something is wrong it's almost like a scar yeah scars tough because the wind is tender right and so if there wasn't something tenders there'd be nothing to protect\nNo that's exactly it and I think one of the big ideas that came from the book that really it was actually voided my hypothesis going in so where did you arrive\nI yeah I just it completely ... just shot out of the water and I and I'm usually pretty good at Jesse what I'm going to find but not in this case so\nWe asked a hundred and fifty sea level leaders there it's a lot of data that we use so interviews with a hundred and fifty sea level global leaders three years building a daring leader assessments that people can see where they are and these were NBA and NBA students at Wharton catalog Rice University and\nThat's at Wharton catalog Rice University and then tons of data evaluation data so I thought when when when\nIt was clear that the future of leadership is about courage we need braver leaders and more courageous cultures I thought the barrier we're going to be fear but then we went and talked to several dairy leaders and said so you're not afraid very often and they were like\nWhat I'm afraid every day I'm afraid all day long I was like so that blew my hypothesis have fear being the greatest barrier to dairy leadership the greatest barrier to daring leadership is armor\nIt's not the fear it's how we self protect when we're in the fear is the perfectionism the pleasing the defensiveness the anger\nThat having to be that nowhere and get everything right instead of being the learner\nUm so really you know and it's interesting what you said about scars and tender places\nNot only does armor keep other people from seen us and sharing ourselves with other people armor protects the fear and less it faster and grow\nAnd metastasize so we need to create work cultures where armor is not rewarded or needed\n[noise] we are some of you to call in and tell us about your workplaces here's what two of our listeners left in our inbox first

lead with regards to arm or Monday sold emailed can you address the differences between armor and establishing and maintaining healthy boundaries\nYeah I mean boundaries are actually a big part of this boxing is boundaries are incredibly important um we defined it very simply as what the okay and what's not OK and so armor is not about\nProfessional management of south it's not about four going boundaries armor is about defense it it is I Am going to put the protection as my ego\nBefore doing right by this business and the work that we're doing\nBefore doing right by this business and the work that we're doing together I'm honored to protect feeling good about myself over movie and I work for it\nTo the difference between so there's a difference between say armor and image such as kind of the self that you portrayed other people to kind of keep bad things and it's it's more it's on a deeper level now it's on a deeper\nI mean the one of the greatest example that armor armored leadership versus daring leadership has one form of armor we see a lot and folks is that need to be right that it's that I've got to be the network and I need to be right and that's more important to me than being the learner and getting it right\nWe got a number of comments from those of you about the way that race plays into workplaces and hope emailed can you speak about the ways in which

the greatest casualties of trauma\nIs the is the law says owner ability and when I talk about trauma I don't just mean a traumatic and said that I mean racism\nHomophobia poverty white supremacy I mean privilege\nDoes or does your everyday traumas and it is real that that ... that you know the armor that you need to survive those things Israel which is why if leaders don't work to create a culture where when you're here\nYou can take that off and be seen\nThan we can't I mean gender as another you know I I think the kind of\nAnita Hill criticisms that happened after the forward testimony where you know Ford was more compelling because she was more vulnerable\nAs opposed to Brett Kavanaugh who is just kind of fun during a way that we're more to hell gotcha yeah he was you know but\nAbsolutely vulnerability can be used against us um and I think that is a that is in itself a form of systemic racism\nBefore we keep going I Would like to talk a little bit about something else you mentioned in your book you talked about core\nValues and I don't think any of us has worked at a company that doesn't have some\nKind of mission statement or vision clarification or posters everywhere assignments were supposed to be and then it's really worth nothing more than the paper on which was printed I work at some companies wind been to some companies where their value statement was like Fifteen bullet points la I'm like well why don't we start\nYou suggest that we should limit our core values to to just to and there's a long list in the book I'm trying to find a because there's a lot on the list and I really struggled tomorrow down to my to why only two\nWell here's a big operation allies values into observable measurable behaviors that people can be held accountable for demonstrating then you just really do have a cat pastor I mean it\nReally is [laughter] it's just really a poster so like I'm a recording of my head but a little town [laughter]\nYeah yeah yeah I've got a Thirteen year old son I Know it [laughter] you know and so\nWhat was so you know operation allies values into behaviors fewer than ten percent of the organizations we've worked with had actually done that had taken the time to say you know what I some assumption of ...\nI've actually done that had taken the time to say you know what I some assumption of generosity is our value and hear the behaviors that we will hold each other accountable for endangered in and so the two is really kind of backing into the data\nThe men and women\nWho had the capacity to be the most courageous could identify their values and they had two to three values and you know I have you know there's a long list in the book like we talked about like Fifteen things on there that are important to me\nOh truism collaboration curiosity dignity diversity independence self discipline patriotism vulnerability wealth wisdom future generations harmony health recognition there's it's a long long list\nYes so I there's probably Fifteen or twenty things on that list that are super important to me but when it comes down to add my two Corvette my core values for me are facing courage and I know that the core values because it's the place where every other things on that list is tested\nAnd so we really we have an we had a companion work buckets free it's downloadable it's on my website where you can do your own values exercise to figure out what your two are and then operation lives and into behaviors\nUm he's changed completely the way we all work together we all know each other's values we understand them we hold each other accountable for them\nAnd then we had our company values and that's actually how we assessed you every quarter\nRiff on the values that you've or to do it\nLike for example one of our values just take the care taking care of each other or south and the community we serve and so one of the things that we measure is I don't talk about people I talk to people\nI mean either do it or you dumped\nAnd so I think it goes back to something we haven't talked about yet that as a real core finding which is courage is one hundred percent teachable\nIt's for skill sets each of the skill sets are behavioral and can be taught it learning how to rumble with on her ability living into your values which we're talking about right now\nIt's braving trust understanding how to talk about trust and breaking it down so we can talk about the anatomy of trust and learning how to rise how to get back up on your feet after a fall or a setback\nDo you need to clear as you saw use I mean I I Would be fascinated to know what you lift me right now for my two core values are because I Know what they are I went through the list and I finally figured out my too but I don't know that anyone would guess what my two were based on who I Am the work I Do like I guess one\nSure catcher I sure OK face no\nThere is that what am I to courts but its encompassed in one of my two calls but no I Can't tell us what you're too I don't know maybe I should maybe I should have and we're talking about ... Joshua no but I'm the host I don't have to do and I'm just I'm In charge here here we go people there's no way okay fine I'll tell you what the\nFreedom and growth those are my two values\nAnd give me an example out of behavior that supports freedom\nUm\nWorld for me being out one thing yet for its freedom I'm being a better listener on this program because if I value the freedom to tell my own story", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "09"}
