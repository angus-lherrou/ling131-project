was to ... of Kyoto University his work in cancer immunotherapy was recognized by the Nobel Committee this year and ... and it also\nChair of the department of biology at Mt Cancer Center\nAnd I want to bring in another voice into the conversation I'm ... and if I could joining us now is Dr Monica ... she is president of the American society for Clinical Oncology she's also chief of the division of surgical oncology at Dana Farber Brigham and Women's Hospital Cancer Center and a professor of surgery at Harvard Harvard Medical school as well\nAnd she joins us today from Washington After Britain hughley welcome to them point\nI'd make that great to be here it's great to have you know you you heard Jim out and describe his research and also a you know meeting the first patient that he had he had met one on one who undergone immunotherapy for her cancer\nA really moving story but I'm sure if you could sort of described from the point of view of as a fellow researchers so sort of how revolutionary is it that that we're thinking or focusing so much on using the immune system rather than external chemicals for treating cancer\nWell you know there is nothing more exciting I'm tired of biologists researches in our field then to see something some understanding from human biology finally revealed that we can really use it to help patients and that's an incredibly moving story that you know fortunately we're hearing lots of these stories and\nYou know that it was it's a couple of decades now in the early nineties that um there was a first clue that the immune system could do this um\nThere was some work done by Steven Rosenberg at the national Cancer Institute where he found that giving um natural drugs called cytokines that could really jazz up the immune system\nCould really reduce eliminate tumors in patients with melanoma and Reno cancers and and you know it was it was just a glimmer that this might be possible\nAnd then it took decades of\nReally careful work in the laboratory and understanding the biology to really make this something that could help patients and so it's just wonderful to see the Nobel Prize awarded in this field and even better to see this brand new tool that we have to fight cancer\nNow or are we are talking about treatments and fighting cancer here is anyone thinking that immunotherapy might lead to down to the root of a chore\n[noise] so we do see some curious from him into therapy what is your main you know to to clinicians cure means you\nHave someone who has a tumor and your ... somehow something we can do is able to eliminate that tumor and they it doesn't come back in their body um that that we mean by cure and summit\nDoesn't come back in their body um that that we mean by cure and some of these initial immunotherapy is perhaps the patient that Dr Alison just described\nShe lived her entire lifetime with now this tumor never recurring that ... that secure so clinicians are very cautious in using the cure word\nBut what really matters to patients is that they live a long long life and never have the burden of cancer in their life so that's what we're seeing and we're seeing that with him you know therapy\nOkay a gym Allison let me ... let me turn back to you here I mean what do you what do you think about what Dr ... has said is are we talking about potential cures\nWas you know for a long time it's been sort of a you know in Brooklyn and appropriate use words treasure ... birds are groups are ordinarily a\nMelanoma persons to receive it'd be remember just as a single ... single round of treatments which for directions for over twenty percent of them are a lot at least two years after a single tree works or [noise] um ... groups after turn people can\nQuit looking over their shoulder very religious or wondering of German for them or down and move on them in a truck much me so happy about the sure about Sherman's experience because she was told bird physician told her to children after off our shoes or none of them are more trips or normal life\nYeah oh Monica Britain usually uh I mean how many I mean no therapies are ... are out there right now\nWell we have um Fifteen cancer indication Fifteen indication so Fifteen specific cancer conditions that are now proof have drugs approved by the U.S FDA\nFor treatment using him you know therapies um but what's another fascinating thing about our field is there are literally thousands at last count about two thousand different new immunotherapy drugs agents approaches\nThat are currently undergoing clinical testing so the field has just been blown wide open by\nA by the proof of principle that untangle ing this biology can have a true transformative effect on patients lives and I just jump in here think landslide styles and currently and development or in clinical trial\nDifferent agents from hitting different heart different components of the immune system\nUm are all undergoing clinical testing across and when's the last time cancer research has seen that kind of explosion in potential therapies\nWell I don't think ever I mean this is really this is really a completely new era and you know we really have to acknowledge that why are we here we're here because there's been a tremendous investment\nYou know on the part of our government on the part of of of ah industry in understanding tumor biology in a very deep level and that understanding is leading to so many different possibilities for for treatment of care\nI Wonder if I ... I Would I Want to just inject a little bit of not skepticism but perhaps a little caution here because and and and please correct me if I'm wrong\nBecause I remember awhile ago maybe a generation ago there was a lot of excitement for example around a Judah Folkman researching angiogenesis and cancers thinking like if we if we sort of figured out a way to block the blood flow to tumors that that would be a way to\nTo really get rid of any and all cancers in the body very exciting line of research perhaps didn't yield I'm the kind of a treatments that we're seeing now with him you know therapy should we so should we continue to have some ... some measure\nThat we're seeing now with him you know therapy should we so should we continue to have some ... some measure of a grain of salt or or skepticism even around this moment of great excitement ... magnet\nYou couldn't possibly picked a better example\nUm you know we didn't plan on this but um you know one of the things I'm sure Dr Alison can will time in here too is that that work that Dr Folkman did to look at the blood vessels is now being combined with the drugs that Dr Allison's group is developed with ... with came out of his work\nAnd the combination of targeting the blood vessel together with targeting that in with activating the taking the breaks off the T cell is producing even better responses in some tumors so at that nothing goes wasted so\nThat's that's correct in the run of the things that we're realizing\nThat or is this coming from and ... um\nThere's just a mirror therapy can be combined with or not on the other surveys but with conventional therapies like chemotherapy remembers you served under under genesis therapies are virtually anything that Charles tumor cells can be used to prime an immune response so that's why so many trauma patients out there so many\nGood terms with regard to really ... David before describes er yeah combination in any kind of scale or else we're we're we're going to be going down a lot of false leads\nAll right well you know we've got a lot of callers who want to join us because obviously cancer is\nA huge issue that does have an impact on so many people's lives you're listening to sour to Jim Allison he was awarded the to any the twenty Eighteen Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine for his work in cancer immunotherapy he's shares that a word of the ... of Kyoto University\nAnd you're also hearing from Monica Britain usually she's president of the

hour about where we are with cancer research and why there's so much excitement around him you know therapies\nAnd cancer treatment and I'm joined today by the two thousand Eighteen Nobel Prize winner in medicine and physiology at the gym Alison he shared the ward with ... of Kyoto University\nGym Alison as chair of the department of immunology at Mt Anderson Cancer center were also joined by Monica ... she's president of the American society for Clinical Oncology\nAnd a little earlier in the show Dr Britain you'll you told us that we've never seen an explosion in terms of the number of possible treatments or therapies for cancer as we are seeing right now some two thousand\nDifferent treatments in the pipeline the research clinical trial pipeline and it's a very exciting moment in cancer research but Dr Britain you only just before the break we were also talking about how how individualized these therapies can be so are we talking about you know slightly different therapies tailored for from person to person\nOh perhaps um you know I there is a whole\nUm emphasis right now on understanding individual biology of every patient and being able to target that specifically\nUm that not only helps us develop treatments that work better it helps us develop treatments that have fewer side effects you know many examples of this and it's a general direction I Believe we're heading and all of oncology let's see\n... yeah they're just a a burden earlier was talking about the adage institutions recognize we know now that many of those are generated by a ... that are part of the cost of gender process itself\nAnd so it was a big effort arm in arm involved in summer but there's many many groups try to develop rapid was of genome sequencing is that gets faster and cheaper to ... make them sort of politically or man you're the Persians along with with through a checkpoint blockers we're going to therapy\nThe ... through a checkpoint walkers or middle surfer perhaps would be much much lower doses of focus the response even more tired but I'm On the cancer cells themselves\nWell Jim Nelson and Monica burden nearly um we've got a comment here this come in on our website and that the person wants us to to make a point that I wanted to ask you about\nSome of them ... coming calling themselves planes dealers says I Hope that in addition to the brilliant scientists involved\nThe show addresses the practical impact in other words the prices of these therapies a means to suggest let me just start with you I mean I'm seeing hundreds of thousands of dollars is a cost for some of these therapies that is that right [noise]\nJust just that's correct and it's a it's it's\n... it's too hot it really is I mean I can understand some of them because I remember when development for example ... changed all the rules the standard um importance to choose critically for evaluating drugs were targeted dresser sales were useful anymore\nTo a lot of field trials because we use the wrong and points from sort of researchers are developmental costs for a measure of yours will probably the most expensive ever I'm not sure [noise] but still got you know that's no reason to keep those promises a perimeter an hour because we certainly don't reflect the costs too much of a drug or shells or daughter come down project we're\nAs we're going to be combinations are hard to know from remembers outs or or or or going to hope for ... for more Persians\nYeah Monica Britain usually I I mean I Know that new neither you a gym or setting prices are for drugs that are are that are coming out of clinical trial I Want to acknowledge that ah and also we've heard frequently over the many years and and Jim just pointed to it that the development costs are these drugs are very high because sometimes that we're talking about decades of research so\nThat point also should be made but on the other hand I mean the both of you were in the world of cancer research are you concerned that as we have these potentially very game changing therapies coming out of the pipeline\nBut because their costs are so high it could further sort of drive a wedge between the haves and have nots it when it comes to availability to an access to to health care in the United states\nWell that ... you know and and it's terrible and it's something that concerns us every day and\nYou know I I think it's a broader discussion than just the cost of some very expensive new ... you know transformative drugs it's the cost of our entire healthcare system in the United states and how are we going to focus\nWhat we can do as doctors and as researchers is to focus on getting exactly the right therapies to the right patients in the best most efficient way\nBecause then it's it's not so unreasonable to justify what that's going to cost what what really concerns me even more is when we have wasted in the system or when it's inefficient or when we don't have the ability to understand who's going to benefit and has not and really as as clinicians and researchers that's where our focus is\nOkay well let's go to ... who's calling from Jupiter, Florida Lizzie you're on the air\nHello Hi Lucy go ahead\nOh hi thank you for taking my call 'em I wanted to counter all this talk of excitement with my experience of frustration over you know therapy I'm fifty two years old I was diagnosed with advanced stage three ovarian cancer which statistically has a terrible survival rate\nI'm like I'll be very very very lucky that still alive and five years and yet every day on NPR I hear about these clinics with all this and you know therapy\nI hear about these clinics with all this and you know therapy but there's not for me and so my question to your research or its is for someone like me how many years I have to try to stay alive you can conventional methods of treatment until someone comes up with a needle here either it's going to ... in my life [laughter] you know what I mean\nWe're losing hang on don't don't hang up the phone here let me just turn to Jim Allison first uh Egypt you have results for her\nYou know what I mean one of the run of the rich are going about immunotherapy is because there's a lot of germs says the word uniform or fertile before are better now responding unfortunate Myrtle respond or member Graham group ... member grab her church for

missing and try to [noise] um you know we're moving forward move\nFor much more effective and we're we're talking about in the future of somber sort of over as we're we're we're just ready to root for snow\nLizzie Lizzie did I hear you correctly when you say that you've been searching for a clinical trial to participate in but you can't find one or one that you call it that will you qualify for\n[noise] um yeah that's correct I found one but I don't think they're saying it's a vaccine but it's like ... which I think it's different from you know therapy but it's also one where there's a fifty percent chance that I'll get a CBO uh-huh route out with a vaccine same thing with them you know therapy as a\n... unit for Iraq ... ... different germs or mental serves no\nMotors weren't nearly I mean what would what would you would guidance or advice would you ... have really because I imagine that there are many other people like her out there who would like to have access to these treatments even in the clinical trial phase but for whatever reason cannot well you\nKnow you have two questions you know ... to issues first Lizzie thank you so much for calling in and for\nSharing your story with us because um this is\nSomething that absolutely needs to be raised every time we have a discussion about some great breakthrough there's just always so much more to do and I hope very much that you are in an environment where you have expert doctors who are doing everything they can for you because um\nYou know there there's a lot that can be done but there's still a lot more to do now the issue of clinical trials again when the thank you for illustrating that how the importance of that\nI'm One of the things that one of the big problems we have\nOnly three percent of patients adult patients in the United states participating clinical trial\nTo Ninety seven percent of people out there\nWe don't have information or even access to them for some of these new a potential breakthrough therapy so one of the big a part things that we need to advocate for ... more availability of clinical trials and those trials need to get every tiny community not just the big cities for

Y. that\nGot was that moment occurred the day after the last presidential election you know I was somebody who was viscerally instantly you're opposed to Donald Trump from the moment that he came down that escalator at Trump Tower\nAttacking Mexicans are rapists and murderers I couldn't believe that you had a mainstream candidate who was talking like that and I never imagined that he would win the Republican nomination much less the presidents and so I was ready to move to see Trump's progress\nFirst in the Republican primaries on them and the general election there was the shock of my life and I think many people's lives to see Donald Trump actually win the presidency and the next day I knew what I had to do which was after a lifetime as a Republican is a movement conservative\nAre re registered as an independent because I knew I just knew at that point I could not be part of this Trump provide Republican Party\n... will also mean seeing movement concerts\nTrump provide Republican Party\n... well so I mean the movement conservative do what do you mean by that\nI was part of what was known as the conservative movement from a fairly early age I was a conservative columnist at the University of California at Berkeley\nI was an op ed editor at the wall Street Journal editorial page I was a regular writer for commentary in the Weekly Standard I was a foreign policy advisor to three presidential candidates so I was fairly deep within the conservative bubble\nAre working for a while I thought was was the good of America and I was shocked and and and perhaps I shouldn't have been shocked I should have seen this all along but I was just so dismayed\nThat change the latest story and deadly marine afternoon on all things considered engineering or coming up at four o'clock this afternoon here on W.

Y. travel dot com [noise]\n\nTo some point I'm making Chuck her body we're talking this hour with Max Boot he was once a leading late in the conservative movement or he has since left the GOP and he's written about why his new book is called the corrosion of conservatism why I left the right and we have an excerpt of it at on point radio dot org\nAnd you can call and we're one eight hundred for two three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk or if you're a Republican and you happen to agree with Max Boot about you concerned about where the GOP is headed what do you think we ought to do to address those concerns\nBut if you're a Republican who thinks the party is exactly where it needs to be right now representing your interest in doing so with a full throated passion calls as well what's your thought for ... where one eight hundred forty three to five five to eight hundred\nFor two three talk uh now I'm actually in ... in the last segment you mentioned um what what you call a GOP quote unquote ... who are have been surrounding and supporting President Trump exactly what do you mean by that\nAll the people who who basically flour has ego including people like Lindsey Graham who once called him a coup and now\nAll talks about how Donald Trump as a superb Gulf or I mean I I I have to our chapter and verse in my ... of of of the circumstance of Donald Trump who literally refer to him as if he were the second coming who think that he used the savior of humanity I mean it's unbelievable this was a\nPresident or you know who was only has the support of about forty percent of Americans and and that's too high in my book but most people recognize\nThat he is not an honorable figure but what's really shocking to me is the extent to which the Republican Party has transformed himself into a Donald Trump called I mean so many people have drunk the Kuwait including people but I once had respect for it's it's really been a ... inch soul crushing experience for me to see what's going\nOn well uh we have some tape here from June to thousands Seventeen when the president convened his cabinet and called on every member of the cabinet to speak one by one now\nI I think some folks might remember this because some of the cabinet members looked quite uncomfortable and we're careful to avoid flattering the president directly\nBut for many of the others um they did heap praise or upon a President Trump now the whole sort of a person by person moment took about eleven minutes um we're not going to play all of that obviously we've got significantly cut it down but here's some of the the flattery\nThat members of the cabinet war heaping upon the president in June two thousand Seventeen thing\nIt was president of the office\nFor a one credit lotteries to leave that for health services at this pivotal time under your leadership I Can't thank you for the religious given that show\nMovie [noise]\nOur staff\nWas present everything for the survey or as the firing\nYear an even greater are to be serving in your cat\nSo you heard their vice president Mike Pence then secretary of health and Human Services Tom Price transportation secretary Elaine Chao and then chief of staff writes previous and treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin\nA no ... you know many of these people can you explain a their their unquote seemingly unquestioning unquestioning guilty to the president\nIt's it's really a cult and what I think that they feel it's necessary because they understand uh the that Donald Trump as a egomaniac who's also very\nStand uh that that Donald Trump as a egomaniac who's also very insecure and has an insatiable need for praise and basically he likes anybody who praises him whether it's his cabinet members or dictators like ... or Kim Jong on but you know that that tape that you played some is to my mind\nIs one of the most revolting at on American spectacles I've ever heard I mean this is something you might expect going on in the quarter Bluey the fourteenth or in Pyongyang this is not what should be happening in the White House the people's houses and our constitutional republic where we do not elect Donald Trump as king he supposed to be the president charged with enforcing the laws\nAnd yet he is being treated by those around him as if he were the leader of a religious cult profoundly dangerous\nTo be totally cynical about this ... is it realistic at all to expect politicians to act anything other than politically and right now they are recognizing that the center of gravity and his party is around the president of the United states\nWell forgive me maybe I'm naive but I Do think that politicians have a higher duty to the country into the constitution than they do to their own reelection prospects this has been so dismaying to me to see Republicans that I once respected people like Paul Ryan Marco Rubio Lindsey Graham an on and on and on\nWho have sold out their beliefs who will not say in in\n... in public when I Know they they understand in private which is that Donald Trump is utterly unfit to be president and why won't they do that because they're all terrified of what happened to Mark Sanford the\nThe Republican congressman in South Carolina who spoke out against Trump Trump treated against him he lost his reelection okay this is not the end of the world okay it's not like Trump is sending out death squads to kill people the worst thing that will happen to these folks is that they will lose reelection\nBut better to lose reelection than to lose their principles and they have lost their principals they have lost their way very very dismaying to see\n... foot [noise] let me see I'm trying to figure out the right way to ask but but can't the argument would be made and perhaps this is the argument that you're making in the book that those very principles though I got the GOP to where it is right now I mean for example\nA you know I'm looking at your own support your vote for support in in the early to thousands for for the Iraq War and there are many people today\nWho ... who cast their vote for President Trump because they look at things like the Iraq War as the epitome of ... of international elitism gone arrived that that was that was money and effort that should've been stand right here in the United states he seems like there were many conservative\nA a a principled conservatives who supported the Iraq War and two thousand three ... those same people surrounding themselves or or their surrounding the president right now so what is it not inevitable in a way that we arrived here\nI don't think it was inevitable but it's certainly understandable because I think the establishment made a lot of big mistakes including the Iraq War including\nA the mistakes that led to the great recession of two thousand two thousand an item that\nDiscredited mainstream Republican orthodoxy and I I ride in the book and in in what I think is try to do in a very honest and sell searching way about my own responsibility for getting here I was certainly a proponent of the Iraq War along with Seventy two percent of the population but I was certainly more prominent than than most of that Seventy two percent\nAnd for years I was very defensive about the disaster that ensued and refused to completely renounce my decision and now with\nThe clarity of hindsight and looking back and and trying to figure out in my way forward I've\nI I mean I make a clean breast of it in the book and I say you know this was a mistake and I was\nIn I was wrong to have advocated the war this is it that terrible\nDisaster for which I have to take ownership and I and I\nAnd I think that other you know supporters and architects of the war should take ownership\nYou know and I think the other you know supporters and in architects of the war should take ownership of it as well and and there's of course the irony is that Donald Trump himself was a supporter of the war even though you won't end but it now but but there's no question that these kinds of miscalculations lead the way\nA an open the way to Trump ism which you know I think is it was a catastrophe for America in the world far worse than what we've seen in the past because he is\nA you know undermining our democracy with those attacks on the rule of law he's undermining American leadership abroad use undermining American allies he's opening the way for dictators so you know this is the the terrible situation but you know we have to be honest and and and admit\nThat the Republican establishment was not blameless in getting us here\nYeah well we're speaking with Max Boot this hour his new book is the corrosion of conservatism why I left or right and we're one eight hundred fourteen three eight to five five it's eight hundred for two three talk a max it's got a couple of callers here if we can let's first go to Mike who's calling from winter veal North Carolina Mike you're on the air\nMax yes\nI agree with your analysis completely I think Trump an absolutely horrible president I was telling all my friends I could vote against them in the primaries\nBut leaving a party is a terrible mistake we need to fight\nFor our party and hope that someone like I have a mental block on flakes name or ... or some decent Republican comes in and challenges him if he still president Tony Tony to fight against him leaving the party is is just wrong\nHe might this way and turn it back to Mexico let me ask you mean you mentioned Jeff Flake as as a desk late Bob Corker all these\nAnybody can hold off a blue wave in Florida it seems like Rick Scott and he's well known as governor and he's fairly popular\nFind a link to Florida matters more on our website or

we're talking this hour with Max Boot his new book is the corrosion of conservatism why I left\nThe right he's a senior fellow at the council on Foreign Relations a columnist for the Washington Post and an analyst on CNN as well and we're one eight hundred and four to three eight to five five to eight hundred for two three talk and max I'm going to go to a couple more colors here because they've got a lot to say so let's turn to Steven\nWho's calling from Norfolk, Virginia a Virginia excuse me Stephen you're on the air\n[noise] Hi mega ... thanks for taking my call so I'm a I'm a moderate Democrat probably closer to independent and my biggest concern is that I recognize that there is value in bowl conservatism of protecting individual rights while\nAt the same time trying to come together society girl society and my biggest concern is that you see the fringes that are just pushing further further right and left to both protect the greedy and protect the\nLazy or respectively so you know it seems like gosh I'm getting old and these two directions and uh you know here's Donald Trump or you know polling pulling polling towards the greedy and his minions and it just it is\nIncredibly frustrating for people like me in the middle that uh you know can't find a way so just wondering if you could comment on that\nSteven thanks for your call ... go ahead oh I feel Steven's\nPoint in time you know I feel exactly the same way I I'm politically almost like I Can't be part of this Trump provide Republican Party but I don't feel comfortable being part of the Bernie Sanders\nElizabeth Warren party either and so on you know I'm I'm stranded in the middle I think you know look I think Democrats have an opportunity here because I think there are a lot of disaffected voters who could not be part of what Donald Trump is selling but they don't know about the Democrats either because a lot of Democrats seem pretty extreme for them like I I I'm In that category\nIf Democrats are I think go to the center there can be a historic realignment of American politics of the kind that you saw in the Nineteen thirties I Would make the Democrats the majority party for fifty years to come I think the way they do that goes by nominating somebody who was pretty centrist in twenty twenty and not going to to the progressive extreme\nWell but all the forces that we've seen in terms of the primary process in terms of campaign finance the things that ah the league or the Republican Party some of the things that believes Republican Party also beleaguered the Democrats as well I mean do you do you think that ah in the in the twenty twenty cycle that the Democrats might actually\nNominate a centrist versus someone who's on the more progressive wing\nOr the guy anything is possible I mean who would've imagined that the Republicans would nominate\nWhen I think anything is possible I mean who would have imagined that the Republicans would nominate Donald Trump or twenty sixteen so we don't know who the Republican not who the Democratic nominee is going to be twenty twenty but there is no question that almost all of the\nMajor contenders of people that are being talked about his nominees potential nominees are certainly from the progressive wing of the party on and that concerns me as as somebody who's who's more of a of a centrist center right a person\nYeah let's go to Jim who's calling from St Petersburg Florida Joe you're on the air\nAll right thank you and I guess my my question has to do with the fact that a Christian\nI talked to a lot of my friends out and let me just starting to call it takes most of my Christian friends are consider themselves conservative Christians are and they don't even have to say that the Republican uh whereas um most of my other friends might be other denominations um art some type of Democrat\nOr when I find that people that aren't religious\nAre Republican but they did get her minority whatnot it usually has to do with the money that they\nWanting to be able to preserve their money or their future so my question is is as a liberal Democrat Chris\nI thought is that for the good of the world we're supposed to take care of each other and all of our government is to make sure that everybody gets by and everybody has the ability to either happiness\nI my question what was the original point up having a conservative wing of the party back when you join and get it the ah the influence of the religious right in any way sway your decision to at the end of the\nJoke saying yeah just thanks for your call go ahead max\nWell the religious right has always been a big part of the Republican Party going back\nTo the Nineteen sixties uh and it's dismaying to me to see what happened with with with with that one of the party there the ... I mean I agreed with a lot of them in in the late Nineteen nineties when they were cast the getting Bill Clinton for misconduct for embarrassing the country for lowering our our moral tone I I thought that was correct\nBut now these very same people these arch Moore listens colds\nWho are criticizing Bill Clinton have nothing to say about Donald Trump's transgressions or you know this was a president who was violated federal law in order to pay off a playboy playmate on a porn star that he had allegedly had affairs with us as a president\nWho has been credibly accused of massive tax fraud this was a president who lies eight times a day you know I'm reminded of\nOf of a bill Bennett spark from Nineteen Ninety eight or Nineteen Ninety nine called the death of outrage where he was lamenting the fact that more people were not outraged\nAbout Bill Clinton's misbehavior well the death of outrageous actually pretty good description of the ah of the of the Christian right or today including people like Bill Bennett where they have nothing to say\nAbout the shocking morality of the president that they support\n[noise] ... I Want to return to something that we talked about a little bit earlier for a second that we should spend more time on and that's the question where this issue of race or and and how that is shaped and direction the Republican Party is going in because I'm I I'm thinking of\nUm you know the number of times you pointed out several uh where the president has said things even before he was elected and after that many people looked upon and said that that was racist but\nDid you ... around him you know thinking of house Speaker Paul Ryan ... going so far as to release a statement saying yes that was a textbook racist remarks but ... but nevertheless I'm going to still support the ... the United states because now he's ... he's helping other deliver on tax cuts which are important to a lot of people and conservative judges which are also important\nTo a lot of people so far as long as that's you know your this is your term found the un bargain exists what hope do you have\nA for change if the if the change has come within the party structure as well\nI have little hope for the Republican Party unless they suffer\nStructure as well I have little hope for the Republican Party unless they suffer repeated and devastating defeats\nThey have to know there'll be a political price to pay for trafficking and bigotry and prejudice for political gain there is nothing I've seen in American political life in my lifetime that as more despicable to notice they know what they're doing and they don't care they are\nThey are claiming that they can support Donald Trump because he's for tax cuts and then they ignore everything else including all of his race was baggage when he you know undocumented immigrants this is a disgrace and the Republican Party is disgusting itself by going along with us well\nLet's go to another call here Ira is calling from Myrtle Beach South Carolina Ira you're on the air\nI N backs food boots I Would take my hat off to you\nI'm turtle application of the courage to your show\nAnd the intelligence analysis you will absolutely correct about the current situation it can be no doubt any man woman on Saturday would face down from the late ... out for what he is a true it's\nTotal dictator and another Hitler however I'd like to tell you\nThere's no need just to be or not it's fair we our great nation we ran through the ... the fact\nOf the civil war and we bonded our roads together to choke I'm sixty is to probably do it we've pretty much on it now but the one who will never recover\nA jazz it awkward she we will recover but evangelists people who support Trump eighty one percent and now we're in Ninety One percent they shall never recover their their chance to be a religious ... book moral ...\nIra I let me just jump in here for a second before I let you go I I hear what you're saying and I hear your passion a lot and I'm going to have Max Boot respond to it ah and just a moment but when you when you said that you see the president as another Hitler\nIsn't the very fact that that is the the tenor of political conversation in America right now isn't that part of the problem because what you yourself said with all due respect to Iran is also incredibly extreme in any it makes it hard to have any kind of a ... you know civil coming together in this country\nNo future generations will realize that he was in fact I ate all if there's no is it not just ... and not in any way exaggeration not at all\nI mean I I don't I don't want to I don't want to have this uh conversation be turned to much towards that but you but you're you're you're equating the president I states right now with the men who led the the murder of six million people are in Europe in in in the middle of the century you are you really saying that\nAnd that rebroadcast his Sunday Morning starting at seven thirty this is W.

I I Do a lot of interviews and nobody ever asked me that so I appreciate that [laughter] I'm good I think that like I'm a I'm a happy about being around the people I knew before the protests and people that I Know really well I got to get my sister the other day and and she'd grade and her two kids so\nEighty nine points and it's like a dream and\nThey do not\nSupport for NPR comes from the station and from Boehner with the bone and certified craftsmen program a network of hardwood flooring contractors committed to expertise and customer service contract to locate her and more information or at Boehner dot com\nAnd from the navy and committed to changing lives through math by building math achievement problem solving and critical thinking skills for thousands of students every day in nine hundred franchise locations math named him dot com slash NPR\nThis is one day I'm Joshua Johnson we are speaking to dream of catching the host of the podcast pod saved the people and the author of the new book on the other side of freedom the case for hope one by graphical thing I did want to ask you briefly you right in the book that teaching\nWas the most important thing you ever did how did teaching help lay the groundwork for activism\nOh you know it's funny how they don't take him myself at very old but I taught a decade ago my my students don't students are like twenty Twenty one now which is so wild [noise] ah\nYou know teaching was incredible not only because they will urging everyday like everything down to shop and I talked to scream at every single day I had to show up in our math to my students had to be asked repaired and I taught sixty nine hundred and twenty minute classes which is a whole lot of math or anybody who's ever there an eleven year old\nI what I learned there are a couple of things one was like how to take really complex information and break it down into\nPieces that are to be consumed and could be repeated back so much skill was like what I learned was not only had to like get kids to understand like when the ... but like I did teach discreet skills like you know what you didn't touch it sometimes means multiplication right that like\nJust how to take apart the big thing to make them bite side and then have students to be able to play with them in a way that they could put them back and rearrange on their on their own or the second was like really understanding like what it means to\nLike do work that will have an immediate impact but we'll have a long term impacts so I remember I'll never forget teaching negative number they struggle they like they can get it like anything lower than the euro that like I don't get it by the end they can fight anybody around like how to solve the most complicated equation and they like deeply understood it\nAnd that was like understanding might the arc of how to\nBuild capacity and like I learned that the third thing is that we think about the best teachers with the ... just walk in the classrooms and they know the gift existed long before they got there\nAnd that like I work at to help\nStudents understand that they can access the gift long after I'm gone after the teacher's gone for the worse teachers do is walk in the classroom and and make people believe that the gift only exists in their presidents and like that it's I think and touch a corollary to organize and that when I travel anywhere where I'm In my own community\nThat like what I'm trying to do to help people find the gifts that they have because they already have them they might not know they might not believe they might not know how to use them\nAnd what I can do to help them find them and they use them long after work on\nLet's get some questions about the black lives matter movement Morgan writes black lives matter is purposefully without a central leader so how does he you direct south is the view his role was in the ...\nLeader so how does he you direct\nSouth is the view his role was in the movement what has he done to ensure that people do the names of the three black women who actually started B. L. M. C. Morgan's referring to Patrice floors of all to muddy and Alicia Garza who helps propagate the black lives matter ... after the Trayvon Martin shooting direct\nYeah so we didn't get the movement the movement is an expansive space and I write about this in the book that\nI you know for those of us who were industry in for a gift and we are mindful that there was nobody who founded the space there was nobody who started the protests there was no one to three ten people who caught us all to the street who organize everybody was so beautiful about the protests that\nAh it was organic there were a set of people who came out every night thousands who made the protest last and you have to remember\nThat we were the she for four hundred days and most people remember as a long weekend which is unfortunate that they're this narrative that if that has come up that is a race so many people that suggest that they are with like a small group of people who started everything who came in St Louis organized every body the organizations did that work\nAnd that's just simply not true so and I think about like how I use my platform of how I think about my work\nThat I'm awful that I was one of many people in the book a highly so many people who were industry in St Louis who did incredible work for whom\nWithout you wouldn't there would be no protest or so that is important to me and then the second part of that I Know that the platform doesn't only exist for me that uh one of the important things about having a platform and access to that\nNot only do I try to make sure that the truth is president everyone but I also know that I'm not the only person that can bring the truth so you don't know the people who said all the protesters every night or the\nThe people who got people out of jail or the people who helped organize some of the biggest actions that people have just sprayed across the country like you've never heard those names are in in the book I Try and write about those people too that I Know them because I was there we were in the middle of the street together\nBut this narrative that there's I guess most of the people who like started every thing in the movement or that there's a small set of organization to like\nWhat a catalyst for the protesters just not a true narrative\nThere's always this tension with movements that have certain people certain leaders to become more prominence\nWith the concerned about but who profits off the cause I mean there are some who would critique the book and the podcast as a way to profit off of black lives matter how do you respond to that and I also wonder if there is any plan to use any of the proceeds from the book to help the cause\nIt's an interesting I think I'm always shut eye you know I feel like I live a pretty public life and I'm always shocked um by some of the the way the question gets at its public that or a portion of all the proceeds went to the end of ... a portion of all the pre orders failed went to the N. double ACP legal Defense Fund that went\nPublic I did it 'cause it was important and it was my way of saying that like I Want you to buy the book but the book also like I Want the process of buying the book to also do more work than just buying the book right so like that's I think about the book systematically\nBut in general this basic I'm mindful of ... when we started camping zero which is like our our biggest project starting twenty Fifteen a we actually didn't participate in the nonprofit funding like the nonprofit sort of reach for funding specifically because of the question that you at\nThe over the past three years we raised a about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars per year which is\nNot a lot of money and the grand scheme of non profits and we did it so that we could just raise enough money to do the work that we thought was important right so we created the first of the database of police shooting contracts at first it public database of use of force policies continue to do a lot of data work that hasn't been done before continue to support organizes around the country and really discreet projects [noise]\nNo I I Know paid staff I'm not paid I don't know salary from this stuff so\nI I Know paid staff I'm not paid I don't know salary from this stuff's so we\nTry to do it as like it would just the bare necessities as do that if not this question of like profit uh\nAnd with the cash you know like I could have the packets could have just been my voice but I don't think that makes sense so I invited Brittany than Clinton to be a part of it they get paid as a part of the broadcast because I think that that makes sense um and it's not like some you know huge moneymaker but it does allow us to like be able to be in a place where we don't have to\nRely on a nonprofit a complex to like fund our work to do this really well\nAnd you know it's like I\nAt the way that I can just in the world right now it's like not necessarily a sustainable way I'm not by state allows me to like\nOh no no I mean like I Do have you know it's like a [laughter]\nNot only does not and that's what I have a salary but um you know when I quit it was really rough it was like you know I didn't have health insurance like you know I'd defaulted on my student loans like it was a really rough um it was rough\nOnly it's only a couple of months ago the first time them actually lived alone since the protests I've ever since she'd been thing in the basement of a like my second parents after the past three years right so\nYou know so that's not us as you want to get married in the in the basement of their second parents that's not that's a famous or\n... but it's like it's the right way that I Want to be in the work right now right that like there are these narratives of like oh I made against the dollar and it's like well no you like me on the news you human a pie cast you like to see me out of an event that means a lot to you and like that automatically means of wealth to some people and that's just not\nThe case that I've had high incomes and before you know that that there was any income and wealth it's pretty significant right oh\nI'm so people have been like really confused by that\nLet's talk a little more about policing one of the members of the one they text club writes police hold a significant position of power in the legal system they should be held to a higher standard than those without power but instead they are held to a lower standard and given special treatment and a free pass in our courts and society\nContrast that with another text club or who wrote as time goes on society will bring about necessary reform but to denigrate and disregard the entire police force as an institution is ludicrous\nWhat do you think he I think you know I think for for\nFor two thousand years we slip people drifting call their health care we literally drain people's blood down and we were like where it's going to drain out all the impurities and people were like oh they their blood pressure changes like no they didn't have any blood right like that actually isn't a solution but we did it for two thousand years it was one of the most popular medical procedures\nBut it didn't work so if the goal was if the people who live like actually wasn't a good thing\nAt the goal was to like pretend that you were doing good like this was excellent and I think about policing it's like if the goal is to stop crime or like to to do any of that work like it just isn't whether how no matter how you feel about the police that just isn't happening so you look at the clearance rates and violent crime all across the country like\nTickets and information can be found online the website is the players dot

I Can't remember now with that and that's one of the reasons that I wrote the chapter that I Know that we walk into everywhere I'm bringing much more than we name and one of the things that I bring into every room is what did they mean to be worthy that if she could leave it feels like anybody could leave and I like that it's something I've had that sort of ...\nWith other people and like it'd be one where we were periods and we both have the same amount of power because that wasn't the first experience with my body right [laughter] so I wanted to just give language to that\nHow far do you think that that outlets actually goes I mean I I'm Out I've been out from most of my all your career if not all of my career\nBut I Know that there's you know there's this aspect of what I Believe is referred to as an implied attribute where it's kind of known but not experience so there's a difference between me saying Oh yes I'm active with the national lesbian or gay journalist association\nAs opposed to me showing up you know a picture of me at a bar with my shirt off making out with a guy in the corner like it's a whole different kind of being out because people are OK knowing it in the abstract but they don't want to know that you're actually like a gay person who does good things\nAnd that changes the conception do you find that there was a line in terms of identity versus full identification like okay you know\nLet's not say anything more about this let's not make them think any more about my that even they have to be\nYeah you know like I think we have to complicate this idea of like what it means to show up and gave the bike and there's not one way right that there is not to wait to be gay they're like\nThe ... pride parade is really really all that like yeah so like sometimes it is the way rainbow shoes right and sometimes it it may just like going on a date and like that and like those are both valid way to jump in and the identity that I Am right\nUh so so yeah there are definitely people who are frustrated me feel like I'm not gay enough in like\nThat I don't talk about gay issues publicly as possible and like he was one of the things too that it's like well how much of my life too I live in like other people can feel like it's real they felt like I Know that we know we're working with the research right now and trying to think about HIV testing that like one of the things that some new research suggests that\nIt's not that people when people get tested it's not they don't care about their health or that they're necessarily afraid of the result but that\nAh that they actually nervous about showing up at a facility in in cities that are that function in a small town and they're nervous about seeing somebody they went to high school with things like somebody's ... like that they actually are nervous about like well privacy really be private right and like how do you actually or how to use set up a testing mechanism that gets around that that to me it's fascinating\nAnd like so we don't quite work around that but like I've I don't feel like I Need to talk about every two seconds for people to be like they're actually cared about being gay right\nSo the other thing I think that there's some people who like a really homophobic but like me and that's now for that I don't want to be like a safe spot for your I hate\nYou also talk very frankly in the book about your bed for mayor of Baltimore your willingness to meet with President Obama and with the presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders you write that because of your willingness to engage quotes\nThere were calls from within the protest community and from without accusing me of political grandstanding and labeling the a sellout unquote I Wonder how you are finding your way forward in these new endeavors whether it's politics hosting a podcast so in a way you are part of a media so to speak\nAnd reconciling that was kind of the social justice activism work that you're still ... involved in is that challenging to kind of have a foot in both worlds as it were\nYou know it's like a both and drape that like you know it's interesting is that all those people who who commit thought for for quote participating in the system and those are the same people running for office today right those are the same people who like\nI tell everybody to vote who tell people not to vote in twenty sixteen who said that you're wasting your vote who stood up politics to matter and like why would you support I remember I support Hillary in Washington Post

about all of that fifth season a rough it let's talk about season five\nRight let's get into it [laughter] getting already a big amount of season five is spent poking fun at the idea of the arch Moore show runner himself it there's a line out actually something along the lines of television it's a collaborative medium where one person gets all the credit\nAnd yeah I have to say a when that line came up at the table read it got much bigger laugh and I was expecting from the crowd of people over there\nI mean is it a little surreal to be a show runner unimpressed to her about a season of your show where one of the characters his show runner who are I'm sure would kill to be unimpressed or talking about a ...\nA little bit it's it's strange and\nYou know one of the things we wanted to talk about when it putting the season together is this weird moment we're in now of of the tourist show runner which is really like a new development in the last ten years or so\nUm and it it strikes me as very odd because I I don't think that I'm a a a brilliant genius\nWho you know a touches a show and turned it into gold and it all just you know flows out of the pencil which is connected to my brain um ... it's a very collaborative process and we have people\nMaking it better every step of the way I have an amazing writing room\nThe cast brings so much the designs by at least they had all the uh director is bring so much to the episode the story board animators the editors um it it really it takes a village um\nSo it's odd but yes I Am doing all these interviews now talking about the show and talking about how I made the show because it's not how a TV show gets made at all and I think anyone\nWho represents that as how a TV show gets made is trying to sell something\nBut then what exactly does the white board in the writers' room look like when you've got the word play the slapstick the ponds and the ... falls a overlaid on some of the deep dark themes that runs throughout the season and the show also has a memory yeah on memory his his mistakes for him\nIt's a very I mean in a lot of ways I think we write the show like a drama but we're a room full of comedy writers who we can't help but make it funny\nUm but we really are mostly interested in you know what is the character arc of the season what are the themes we're looking to explore what are the consequences of these actions you know we we take it very seriously um\nYou know but then in the middle of that we we remember like All right and those guys are talking octopus or [laughter] you know we're we're exploring familial trauma here uh but also this woman is dating or a man that is clearly just a three small boys stacked on top of each other under trench coat like little rascals I'm so [laughter] this story\nIs quite serious ah but the stories themselves can be quite silly you know one way I think of it\nIs is retelling stories about real grounded characters in the crazy cartoon universe lots of this\nRetelling stories about real grounded characters in the crazy cartoon universe\nLots of animated shows have gotten made over the last Twenty years thanks to the success of The Simpsons largely but not shows as deep and as adult as Beau jak or who to whom do you think you owe your origins in television who do you see is your four\n[laughter] oh you mean by influencing yeah where do you mean literally the people who helped me have a television show\nNot I mean the shows that you watch or or even if you weren't that into them to shows that made it possible for a show like Bo jak to be such a hit with American Audi well I\nI think you know the obviously the the giants as The Simpsons and I think it would be disingenuous for me to claim that that show had had no influence on me\nOr my show or the success of my show you know when one of the best comments I got on the the first season a bow jak if someone said it felt like a season long version of a sad episode of the Simpson [noise] um but also when I was pitching the show I I really wanted it to exist\nOutside of the the bubble um\nOr the perceived bottle of animated TV you know I I said ah we're going to say we start season one you're gonna watch it and at first it's going to feel like a typical animated show like a a Simpsons or South Park but then over the course of the season as you realize what's happening it's going to feel more like a girls or even a Mad Men\nUm and and so I I wanted this to feel more like a drama the um and to really\nTake things seriously a in a way that people don't expect the animation too even though I think a lot of animated shows actually do take things very seriously\nUm but but but those shows were certainly influences as well\nAt one of the main attractions of your show for me are the amazing voice performances that you have oh yeah well our net as Beau jak Amy today are credible artist Carolyn that's sort of aging Hollywood manager producer cat uh Internet a lot of others to even have a Keith Olbermann in there at some here um\nSee them as one of the first people we cast [laughter]\nAnd I was cast her well as the newscaster well uh we we had in the script you um you know a guy or a Keith Olbermann whale type and are casting director Linda ... I think we can get Keith Olbermann to play this role and really and we call them like yeah sounds like fun\nUm and he's fantastic we keep bringing it back season after season\nAnd you know what am I a first memories of making the show and realizing how fun it was going to be was we had Keith on the phone from New York and we had him do all his lines um and then at the end we said we also get you making some whale noises\nAnd you know this is Keith Olbermann who I thought it was a very serious man uh goofing around going\n[noise] you know making whale noises I thought this would be a fun show I think well one of your other\nMain characters is Diane a Vietnamese American voiced by actress Allison ... who is phenomenal now you gave us late interview recently and also a Twitter thread which is which is the way you have to do with these days and you mentioned\nOne ramification of that choice casting Allison Aubrey is Diane that you tend to avoid referencing her Asian American this in the show now this season that's changed Diane does take a trip\nTo the Vietnam of her heritage and and talks a lot about how that affects her um how did her casting come about and how did you begin to have second thoughts about it\nUm we cast Alison ah in in the first season and we were about I'm a third of the way into the season when we asked to read them working a with a different actress\nUm who had to drop out of the show all of a sudden because another show she was on got picked up and there was a contractual issue so she couldn't be lead on our show any more um and so we really\nA contractual issue so she couldn't be lead on our show any more um and so we really scrambled and Alison came in and we thought she was amazing and you're going to a great job ever since um but more and more uh as I was looking around at at the cast and and thinking about\nYou know how how the show was put together and and and the makeup of the cast it started to dawn on me that\nEveryone in our house was white and our main cast and a lot of the recurring people were we were hiring were white as well and this wasn't an intentional thing uh that I was doing as a racist man um it was just I was not paying attention and we were passing these characters one at a time\nUh and I realized that oh this is going to start paying better attention to 'em and so you know since then we've tried due to cast a wider net and look particularly for for diverse voices or try to have more people of color on the show\nBut when it comes to Dianne specifically um you know I think there is a a real problem in this industry of casting white people in Asian roles\nAnd I was not a as aware of that when we first started the show as I Am now and so that's something that I Would do differently is casting a white person to play a prominent Asian character and you know as I said in these other interviews\nUm I think it's hurt the show because I think my own self consciousness has prevented us from telling Asian Stories I think because I guess I didn't want people to talk about this it's all like this is a mistake we made\nAnd if I can just you know avoid it or you know glide passed it then you know maybe this won't become an issue I just you know won't become the thing that I end up talking about an every interview and I I think that was a disservice to the character um because I I think it ended up\nYou know we we ended up treating her as just like a white character or as a race didn't matter\nAnd it's it's difficult in our show because in some ways race doesn't matter because there was also talking ... you know anti ... and giraffes walking around so it's hard to say how is an Asian American humans experience that different from a white American humans experience but\nI I think there are differences and I I'm more interested in exploring them now and I feel like\nThe uh avoidance of the issue was holding us back narrative way well instead of avoiding it then you took responsibility for it on your own initiative and and as I said in season five\nThey're online that citizens F.

decidedly low tech job but some productions refused to do without\nJoining us from NPR in New York is the owner of NYC cue cards while the fairest and he's worked three decades behind the scenes on shows including Saturday Night live while the fairest and welcome to one a\nAh thanks for having me Josh where it's ... it's great to be here how did you get into the cue cards business a while you know I went to uh Syracuse and I wanted to be a writer I majored in writing and moved to New York in a you know my brother was working at CERN it a lot of time as a receptionist\nAnd they knew that you kind of guy so he recommended me even though my printing was terrible and ah ah I got the job and I do know it just just get my foot in the door and to make writing connections\nAnd uh you know I did I did make somebody connections that I wrote for some cable shows but it was never enough to support myself so I kept under the cue cards and I got really good at doing cue cards very quickly\nAnd uh you know cut to twenty eight twenty nine years later I own my own company I've been doing it for that long and running a lotta shows so\nClearly this was not the kind of writing that you had in mind but what was it about doing the cue cards that you liked\nKnow I I don't know I think one especially on Saturday Night live the live aspect of it and being out there you know as close to the cameras as you can be without being on camera\nA and helping the actors and helping the guest stars or through the shows and through this hard show that they you know they'd probably a lot of them have never done live T before there was something very rewarding about that and um I didn't crack under pressure and with the changes and all the stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show notice\nThe changes and all that stress that was involved with that and that was something that they the show noticed and uh you know I rose up pretty quickly in the ranks\nTell us about your company what shows does your company do cue cards for\nUh the are four main shows that are that are that tape all year our Saturday Night live\nUm the Tonight Show Jimmy Fallon late night with Seth Meyers and then we do Conan on the west coast as well those are four main shows um and then we will do some reality shows we do a master we do all the project runaways that shoot and then we do to show any show that comes to the town of these cards you know work on that as well\nWhat kinds of people do well at this line of for the first thing we look for is neat printing\nNow my penmanship is fairly often um I think that was why when I was on a med school track years ago people were like yep we've seen your handwriting [laughter] so I Wonder exactly what you're looking for in terms of printing I as a cue cards I've seen are all written in all\nCaps yes correct It's you know it's it's a this is it's a it's block lettering it's all caps\nUm it's it's really about the spacing between ... between the letters and the word in a space in between the words and the space in between the sentences it's not something like I Can't just bring somebody else history and say okay start doing your guards it's almost like you know you need I Need to train that for like two or three weeks\nI'm just to get them there's so many different little things you have to learn um two or three weeks of training yeah it it 'cause you 'cause it's it's not it's you can't just say you can't just tell them all the rules right you know what I mean I Can't just say that if he has been okay these are all the rules you need to learn memorized these new things come up every time there's new like\nEye is capitalized only in certain words it's not capitalized than it during whereas where how to end the card a courage that on a period or ... or ... or a comma in if not that you know how to end it so that it slows the next car and just so many different rules where you can only learn it by by doing it and practicing it\nWe're speaking to Wally ... and the founder of NYC cue cards the exclusive cue card provider in New York\nOkay so let's say you're working for me for\nYou know the late night with Joshua Johnson right and I come out to do my opening monologue I've just hired your company and I said Wylie I'm really excited to be working for you guys let's start building this relationship tell me the kinds of things that you are going to want to know for me to figure out how to be a good cue card vendor for me\nAll right first thing I ask you how's your eyesight\nWhy near sighted or glasses okay so you were a glass as well you were losses in the show where you were contacts or you're not were either and I don't really like contacts hourglasses okay so you want your glasses so you can see fine I Want to have to if you didn't wear glasses and you want to wear contacts I could ... your letters bigger\nSo that you can see but that would also make less words in the card and it would make it harder for you to read to flow to the ... like if you're taught especially if you're telling jokes\nSo I Would recommend glasses or contacts for you if you know if you want to say you're gonna wear your glasses you'll be fine reading cards and then I Would just you know we were we were to have her son's Robert practiced with you if you've never read cue cards before that something you'd want to practice\nWhat's the main thing that I Need to think about if I'm reading cue cards from you\nOr look directly at the cue cards don't\nLook away because that'll that'll look like you're reading the cue cards\nHow do you mean it looks directly as well if you were doing a sketch they say you were doing a sketch with your band leader\nAnd I had cue cards near the bad leader and positioned in a way that you would want to play to those cue cards now if you were looking at the cue cards and then at the bandleader going back and forth between the part of the day later the audience would be like oh he's obviously reading something\nBut if you just played those cue cards it would look on camera like you were talking directly to that person I'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the cameras so yes\nI'm ... directly above the camera above the camera above the cameras so yeah so I'll I we were open depending on where you are in position to the camera I'll make the cards the right the lettering the right size so that you look directly at that card it looks like you're looking right into the camera\nShow your cue card holders are kind of part of the technical direction the the blocking of a scene in terms of figuring out where the performers need to look to look proper that's\nExactly right especially with Saturday Night live that's what I that's my main job but I'm there on Thursdays from Fridays that's all we do all day as block sketches\nAnd I'll be out there with one set of cards working with the actor's working with the host figuring out where I'm going to put the cars and I work with the director of the stage managers wild well kind of can for and I think I think I Need the cards here and then I'll ask the actors if they need an extra set somewhere else where I maybe didn't think of just want to make sure that they're covered where they're from comfortable\nSince you mentioned Saturday Night live what does a typical work week at SNL looked like for someone who's doing cue cards for that show do you just come in Saturday afternoon and scribble furiously unfilled eleven thirty five PM I Wish it were that a simple [laughter]\nNow we we start on Thursday restart rehearsal is on Thursday and Thursdays a light day\nSo the music the musical group ... for the first half of the day and then we'll ... we'll be in there about noon and will print well rehearsed maybe like three or four sketches and will only put one one set of each sketch because I have to figure out how many sets we need so there's no reason to print more\nAnd it it'll change from Thursday the sketches we do on Thursday we'll go through a rewrite session on Thursday night and most most of the time will be completely rewritten from Thursday and friday\nAnd then Fridays the St process except we do about eight or nine sketches same process reprint put that on friday we have to do we have to make copies we call it do being the cards so it makes sense and then we I mean the redo that we don't have the we don't have the luxury of waiting until Saturday to dupe the friday sketches because Saturday show day\nSo everything's print that I have about eight people there on friday just yet basically writing all day I have to find job I'm Out on the set blocking working with the actress having fun they're sitting underneath the bleachers from eleven o'clock to sometimes you know twelve or one o'clock in the morning just printing cards so long it's a long day for them\nWhat kind of person would want to take that kind of a job it doesn't sound like a very glamorous way to be near the TV business are you lower you mostly employing people who are looking for a foot in the door or do you have like veteran cue card writers working for ...\nThere's a little bit of both um mostly um\nPeople that are trying to get a footnote I encouraged that I I Try to tell them cue cards is not a career I I did make it a career for myself\nBut there's not much room if you want to do at great for your lives that's awesome but you should be looking to do something else I'm encouraging them I'm helping them I'm introduced and the people that want they\nThan in a career that they want to do mostly most of it's entertainment related but yeah you sit those long days or friday but that leaves the Saturday wherever they then they come out from behind the scenes and there are her sing with me because I Can't\nI Can't hold for sketches at one time you know four sets of cars at one time so I Need other people out there and then that's kind of the fun part\nOf it how close up to Showtime safe for Saturday Night live how close are you writing after Showtime we don't stop making changes usually until ... sometimes twelve thirty at night to afford it like while the show's going on so you could still be writing while you're alive or we are we definitely are", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day":
