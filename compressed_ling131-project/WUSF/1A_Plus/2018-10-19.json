I really appreciate markets all do you draw the connection between ah the president's remarks in Montana and what we've all been talking about the past ten days or so\nWell I'm feels gross to talk about politics in the middle of this but since the midterms are a couple weeks away let's be honest that's the lens through which uh\nEveryone is going to be thinking in discussing every major issue between now and then and I think what Jake and John ah are talking about the last two callers is you know actually can give\n'em a really good reflection of some of the divide in this country right now about why they should care about this issue how much they care about this issue and and\nAnd and what is it really mean a ... you know I mean the reasons why\nWhat happened to somebody who is a Saudi man living in the United states or with a contractual relationship from an American newspaper why should anybody care about that it's from a U.S perspective for two reasons number one\nIs the U.S getting played President Trump Jared Kushner have put all of us really almost all of their eggs into the Saudi bask in terms of reinvention they had to deal with Iran or who to do business with who to share power and intelligence with\nUh and uh it is this the right gambit and number two does the U.S still have I'm Still view itself as having a role in I'm trying to send ... trying to send the right signals about\nHuman rights around the world why should the u._s. do this why should the U.S get involved in other people's business well\nAh because to promote democratic ideals and to uh\nTo try to make 'em the rest of the world I'm the kind of place where it's also save to live and be a dissident express your views on to try to have order around the world and and maybe morality is too big a word but but some\nSense of appropriate global behavior okay so uh why should every American care about that more than the economy or a more than health care or more than the tax cut debate well they probably don't which is what President Trump is betting on when he\nTries to energize a crowded in Montana or about a domestic issue and he doesn't believe that uh it will will impact them negatively\nMean one guard was how important we think this is geopolitical spaces journalistic bases immoral to merge you people are going to vote on a hundred percent ... but at the same time for briefly I Want to get at the question of do you think there is a direct line in the rhetoric from what the president's\nSee I Want to get at the question of do you think there is a direct line in the rhetoric from what the president said about the congressmen who just before his election assaulted American reporter for the guardian and pleaded guilty to that I Believe misdemeanor assault\nA convicted on that are and what he's countenance singer was seemingly kind of hoping to tolerate happened from the hands of a a an allied from Saudi Arabia\nI'm not going to uh [noise]\nI'm just not in the position to make predictions about what the president's rhetoric the president's rhetoric in the United states uh it had caused this in any way or fuel in any way but I Will say that um\nWhen when the president does make remarks suggesting that violence towards journalist is okay American journalists are concerned uniformly not just about the implications that has in the United states but about the implications that has another country's\nI'm I wanted to play you know we should turn to them in terms of just coming up quick I Want to play a clip of what the president had to say uh recently here that the the tenor of what he has said in trying to rally Republican faithful and the base out at rallies in in sequence from Missouri West Virginia and Mississippi just in the past few weeks\nI'm not on the [noise] but I Am I\nMe I'm On the balance it out in twenty Eighteen because you're voting for me in twenty eight [noise]\nYou're voting for me but then again President Trump told the Associated Press and it makes sense of interview\nThis week he went uh be to blame if the Republicans were to lose the house in November Jack Beatty is Donald Trump on the ballot even if his name isn't there or is he not\nYou certainly is and he was right the first time I'm you know when you look at the election step back they're really two elections going on one who's in red states the senators and one swing districts the house members in the Senate it looks like the chance to Republican chances according to\nA five thirty eight are four and five of holding the Senate and maybe even gaining some seats\nAre the Democrats only one in five on the other hand you look at the house five and six chance that the Democrats will take the house one in six\nFor the for for the ... the Republicans holding on so that's quite remarkable for a sort of you know spread of two separate electric two ... two kinds of elections going on and the elections are happening around the issue

listener posting on the name Roger ... post uh\nUh that civility and the Democrats and the GOP is long gone the opposition is now the enemy hard to see during the it's a midterm election season what could bring us together uh another one speaking about the question of what we are expecting President Trump to do a notes\nSays it's worth noting the President Carter's disastrous legacy including a strong emphasis on human rights which in part led to the overthrow the shot in Iran and its evolution to the fifteenth century theocracy a as described\nThere a couple of listeners weighing in I wanted to turn to another element of the mid term elections which is the question of turnout and particularly turnout of Latino voters\nDemocrats talk about this a lot I think ah in Texas they'd been staking at the idea that bait or a rock would somehow benefit from that his\nHe is flew into a in Spanish appealing to Latino voters are uh are said to be even do a\nHis opponent Texas Senator Ted Cruz is of Cuban descent\nFrom nine to ... how important is a Latino turnout to Democrats in the how well are they doing it in trying to accomplish that\nLatino turnout was very very lowest twenty seven percent than twenty sixteen went up twenty percentage points um [noise]\nFew um has a pure research has panic trends came out this week with their what numbers on the you know a vote this year they they are saying that there's a record uh they they estimate twenty nine million eligible Latino voters but the key words\nUh they they estimate twenty nine million eligible Latino voters but the key word here is eligible not registered um it's it's been low in talking about Texas there's a five point four million\nEligible voters and Latino voters in Texas are ... probably needs that but you know it's sometimes it's really hard to to define a if\nCrew says uh appeal to two Latino Republicans in Texas this is a strong enough um interestingly for instance Univision just a interviewed a last week both candidates and\nAnd and ... did it as as oh she always does with Spanish language media didn't in Spanish or Ted Cruz didn't um he he never likes to talk in Spanish in public\nUh but I think it's very important to see what the what the turnout it was going to be traditionally it tends to be disappointing the national association of Latino elected officials which is an authority on on on the Latino vote as well\nWill come out next week was there a year I'm not yearly every two years um their their projection and they'll let you know vote we might get a clearer picture than but that this again and we'll we'll dependable hinge on on the turnout\nAh Fernando are there a couple of other races that you point to that in which do you think that's going to be particularly important\nWhile we have Florida a and I think Florida it's very interesting that much has been talked about um the influx of Puerto Ricans in Florida and we tend to think about it I think that conventional wisdom tends to think about Hurricane Maria\nAnd all the people who who left Florida may be temporarily and who have ... I'm Sorry I left the island and settled in Florida\nI'm temporarily all over the country as well but mainly in Florida particularly on the Orlando area there's a story that I saw this week that nearly seven eight thousand Puerto Ricans have registered in Florida\nOr the question is and we and as I said before I mistakenly we tend to think of these Puerto Ricans I'm moving to Florida just as a consequence of Hurricane Maria but no that's not the case\nThere's been a a population train and Puerto Rico for the last three years or more since a fiscal crisis on the island hit really hard and people have been leaving and many of them have been settling\nIn in in Florida so we'll see what the difference is going to be particularly in the ... and the race for governor\nI'm In South Florida it's there's a different dynamic you know the Latino bases well entrenched there there are been some changes of course demographic changes in some of those ... districts that are turning more democratic than\nThan the than the Cuban Americans who would tend to vote more Republican have wanted but there's I think still they have some safe seats in there but\nBut it's the key vote for the Puerto Ricans would make may make a difference in other parts of the state\nDuring an interview with CBS this morning on Wednesday former Obama administration official in San Antonio mayor who Leon Castro says he's concerned about Latino turnout in the mid term because numbers have shown that the rate is ... at what he said it's not what it should be\nI think what it's going to take the change that is that can't be done you know six months before an election or by anyone or to Canada if it's gonna take folks investing in a massive and sustained effort\nTo care for the animals registered and then to turn out to a vote a and until that happens I don't think that the numbers are going to move a lot\nMargaret television seems to be that almost every cycle we hear the importance of Latino voters and the idea there's gonna be a surge but that there is a even if there is greater registration there's not a huge edition of of Latino voters what's your sense of all this I was really struck by one of your callers\nVoters what's your sense of all this I was really struck by one of your callers earlier actually laughter in the middle of the question not to be disrespectful them but because it resonated with me so much he said he was so frustrated by the ... of\nDifferent narratives about what's really going on in the midterms and I think you know not everybody is asking the right questions which is it's a midterm year are\nThe Republicans who voted for Trump still as enthusiastic are they going to go out and vote for their\nCongressmen or will they turn you know what's the Latino vote going to be one about young voters typically\nIn the past is very low for young voters are they energize they say they're energized is actually going to turn out what about the non college women what about the college educated women and I you know I the the polling attempts to measure a snapshot in time but you could say something three weeks before an election and then just\nWake up that Tuesday Morning and say you know and that's what the term question has always been so these questions are really important in the president and many Republicans\nHave a I have at least been publicly talking again about believing that things are swinging in their favor that Republicans could hold the house and\nAnd I think some Republicans see this caravan of Hondurans are who have been moving up through Guatemala and Mexico as something that could actually help them a cap kind of a counterintuitive thought so we have a lot in play here but\nUh the question really does when it's all said and done come down to what individual people do um either for absentee voting or in terms of going to the polls that day\nI Want to actually play a clip of a couple of a Honduran migrants who spoke to CNN this week there's ... mayor and I'm Andrea I lay mine they spoke to CNN this week about why they're making that track from Honduras towards the United states\nThere's much corruption here in Honduras we want to work there is no we want land to plant bananas blamed teams being there isn't any brother we need to migrate to another country brother in the hospitals there was no security there is nothing or patients die brother\nWere heading to the United states we're going to arrive with Donald Trump he has to receive us\nYou heard there the voices of those migrants speaking through an interpreter is on on on CNN a Fernando ... uh this a caravan it's obviously intended to create a tension or what are the repercussions of it\nWell the repercussions can be many obviously we could have a second family separation policy as it was a suggested by the administration and reported last week that they are considering an ... in New policy in which in a way that they would give somewhat of a\nVoluntary separation option to these families wants or detained but this is mostly right now in the works we we still do not know the details of this but if I may give some some context to this care of and I think there are some politics involved I mean you interview I've seen many of the interviews of people that are coming up and there is a true need\nTheir people escaping their people looking for better jobs are people looking for safety people were being threatened um there's violence in the in the countries of the northern triangle which are an Honduras Guatemala and El

at leaders igniting transformation Milwaukee a nonprofit organization\nLed by use of color or that organizes young people around issues related to political power and social racial and economic justice ... welcomed on point\nHi David thank you for having me\nFirst let's start with you a a George ... is from Milwaukee himself but what struck you about ah our conversation today\nUm I think one of the biggest thing that struck me was him talking about star code switching and I find that often for me because I Do I Do live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin by go to a like by the school how out here in Franklin Wisconsin\nSo can we just take a moment and I'd like to unpack that a bit for those folks who might not know about code switching is basically a as I as I understand it you know basically switching how yet talking how you handle yourself if you're in different communities different neighborhoods how does it play out for you\nWell um so I went to in the air or not NPR but just pulling lucky because that's where I live ... but when I started as a freshman in high school I came over to Franklin high school and it was a whole new ballgame for me going from being around people all day who looked and taught just like me now coming here to people who look\nCompletely different and had different lingo and different things than I have\nSo I remember my freshman year I Would still talk like normal or I Would still use starting playing and people would not understand what I meant by saying words or I Will get feel\nDifferent for talking let property than they did so I kinda get started teaching myself that when I met or I talked property values proper English\nAnd when I go home I'm able to talk how I feel comfortable talking and use the slang that my family and friends I used to you\nKnow there's a scene in the movie a that goes that speaks directly to that a star Carter is played by the actor Amanda Stern bird uh she lives to live she shuttling between garden heights a reporter and mostly black neighborhood and Williamson which is an affluent mostly white a private prep school did she attends\nA in this scene as I start enters William since she explains that she also shuttles between two ... two different persona is\nDiamond heist in one world\nAnd I got to keep it separate\nAnd I got to keep it separate\nFor when I'm here I'm Sorry version to that means flipping is which in my brain willing to start that ... if a rapper would say if she doesn't even if for instance hey hey how are you in\nSlang makes them cool thing makes me but you know those kids who\nFaith can tell you is that what you're talking about\nYet that exactly what I'm afraid\nI Wonder ... you know a ... you read uh uh uh the book is well if I'm not mistaken um are these things that kind of play out in your own life where you you you have to think about how you handle yourself because with the fact you're African American\nYeah I'm specifically to like my own past experiences I used to live in a suburban I was younger and so the transition from when I moved away to the city and how\nEverybody speaks and how you have to act as a completely different and so because of the areas of where I work at I definitely have to experience the idea of code switching because um\nIt's like you because you are\nBlack saying these words and acting like this makes you appear as it makes you appear as less educated than somebody else when you're around these people even though we don't like intentionally mean to do it it just kind of happened subconsciously because you never want to be like labeled as something like that\nAnd so I resonate with star a lot because when I had to switch back and forth between both of my\nMostly white communities and mostly populated with well actually they are these the way I spoke to the way I talk the way I dress the way I act it was completely different sigh definitely can relate to the idea of code switching\n... how much like how much of an extra burden that walking around to having to send consciously about how you present yourself or is that kind of similar to you know how teenagers have to figure out who they are going to be anyway\nUm I think it's definitely an extra burden that we have because for black people it's this idea of a double identity that we always have to face\nThis now\nDimitrius you want to go in there for ... no I'm Sorry okay go ahead if we're getting ready to\nLead rate hives [laughter] I um I definitely think that\nIt's way more harder for black person to find themselves because we're always faced with having to fight so many negative stereotypes it's already approaching this is the first place so I think if you're somebody who doesn't grow up\nBeing educated on history of our people and\nLearn about how to really truly love yourself for being black and you're kind of just growing up in a world where if you're not hearing these things but you're hearing by people aren't educated they missed or that their head they're everywhere and blah blah blah blah blah it's kind of like so what do I have to conform I substitute it seemed like I can make it so I think\nCode switching is definitely a burden for a lot of black people because it's especially a lot of young black people because we're not\nFully aware of ourselves yet and so when we're faced on trying to be ourselves but then also face on trying to please others it does become an extra burden because most other people won't have to go through that because they're already the idea of perfection other people's eyes but we are to be trusted you have a different take on a\nUm I agree on that one Minnesota situations like\nWhen I have like a job interview or something oh put on a voice like not to be like a pill like a white voice ... but um [noise] do you get back on the back to\nThe shore of course I actually ... what I did want to ask you about a little bit was you know we heard from a maverick who's the father of a stark harder in the opening scene about how important was to be proud of being black and at the same time\nOr in the opening scene about how important was to be proud of being black and at the same time he offered that in the context of the talk the talk about how a young black kids are boys and girls need to to handle themselves when they were dealing with law enforcement officials Richard did you ever receive a version of the talk like that\nUm yes a pseudo talk like that when I was younger so how does lay out what was that like um it was just one night when me and my father really gonna catch in Oregon\nThey were just talking about driving and stuff and we got to the topic about police from the get pulled over and are we talking about like when the calls pull over like you always put his hands on the steering wheel Antonio I get older and like get a license to do that and like a few months back that happen like the cuts for those over and\nMy father put his hands on his third wheel so I've had my hands on dash or two it was kind of nervous 'cause like the videos and Messina saying lately on social media about like the police brutality and lights how graphic it can get\nA ... you know uh in Chicago obviously a there's a trial of the uh of the police officer who shot ... McDonald or he was found guilty that doesn't always happen or a police officer goes on trial for the shooting of want to start Carter's friends in in the movie the hatred given I'm not going to give away a plot point by saying how that plays out\nA but at the same time you know that was a big deal for what happened in Chicago how has received a you know in among your family and friends\nUm it was received very positively um ever since the entire thing happened with the ... so many Chicago activists and organizations had been doing so much work for the cause family for\nThose who are affected by police brutality and when they found out that Jason Van Dyke was going on trial and everything was happening we were just so scared that it was going to happen again\nEverybody's dealing with the same thing and and nobody complains that this week on Florida matters\nThat his Sunday Morning at seven thirty or right now at W.

a call from Tampa, Florida I'm Michael you're on the air\nYes sir um first of all hello and thanks for taking my call Yes sir I'm\nI'll get I'll give credit and and praise to the you for doing what they're doing but I'm uh fifty eight year old black man and he wants to know in America and I don't think at a ... matter of fact it seemed like it got worse the seventies to be honest with you\nWhat's gotten worse than Michael\n... the the the racial profiling and the tension between the races I mean look we got we got Donald Trump elected that's the the the attitude and the mentality of\nWhere the state of mind and you know the police force was created to keep the Jim Crow laws in check and everything and that mentality and psychological profile is still on the leaf off today\nThank you so much for your prospect Michael I appreciate it very much dimitrius downward you focus a lot in your group as I understand it and thinking about how to de escalate tensions with police there's\nThere's a line in in the movie where star Carter's a uncle who's on the police force basically ... he's in her corner but at certain point he says door you know police face a lot of dangerous circumstances and situations you've got to understand that\nHow do you approach thinking about uh how how you deal with police are in this day and age and and the challenges they face as well as the the challenges that that you might face\nUm I think there's a respect we need to respect from both both sides um when I was Thirteen I had to experience will stop and frisk and that put me to have a lot of fear and the next two years I always had like fair for police can you tell me about\nCan reach us can you tell me a little bit about what that incident with like oh it was like what happened\nIt was scary I was walking around my block and I'll go and build into building trying to find a friend and I know like these two policemen and following me\nGo and build into building trying to find a friend and I know like these two policemen and following me sort of started like kind of walking fast because that was kind of scary and um they called me around the corner and they started to check my and go to see if I had drugs or anything and\nI had twenty dollars because at my parents and having to pockets and I was just shaking the whole time and they say well you're scared I was like this never happened to me before so the next two years every time I caught like Cruz by me I always like shake up\nThough do yeah I mean it\nYou know look I Lived in New York and have for a while and and it's been part of the the background of New York is that this this debate on a policy level of ... you know among the people who make policies in laws about stop and frisk\n... you know is about this issue but it kind of takes away from the human element right like this are directed not only your night but but how you thought about yourself out in public\nYes and um I think I have a solution for that uh-huh I think there should be like police officers\nIn the same neighborhood for years so it is a growing relationships with them and just not have a new police or say every month or a week like we just started growing relationships because I noticed one police officer and she has the same idea and we're like we have a conversation sometimes and think\nThat that should happen they ship place police officers and the same neighborhood\nAnd there had been efforts to do that but it sounds as though it has been a ... you know taken root in a way that's been meaningful for you and your neighborhood majors yes do\nYou know there was an exclusive interview today that good morning America had with a Jeremiah Harvey he's a nine year old who was a falsely accused of sexual assault a I Believe in Brooklyn New York\nUh when his backpack brushed up against a woman in the corner store or the woman to reach a client is white she called the police and has since apologized but your mind and mother told good morning America that lake like dimitrius they can't shake the incident\nSo hard because I play the on my mind\nHow can I can think of things so you\nAre you concerned that this has permanently scarred Jeremiah yes I certainly yeah\nIt was devastating for him because even after walking away with pointing to you know patrol cars on Flatbush Avenue and saying money or they hear to take you away from us\nCaroline's how much a or is this idea of living while black uh uh uh we've heard instances where a man was stopped from entering his own home or apartment building in St Louis because a white resident there didn't trust him although he lived there as well how much does this affect kind of your your daily rhythms in your life\nI think it affects me heavily because it it creates this constant fear that you walk around and you carry it creates\nWhen you when you drive you look out of your near you see a police officer here and even though you're doing everything right you immediately think what am I doing wrong and I'm just to add I'm listening to the video and the incident with the little boy it very much reminding me of the situation where in the tail\nAnd how that affected him he and the tail had no idea what he had gone wrong and added to the little boy that it could happen to and\nNow he feels as if he did something wrong he feels as if he made a mistake or that you know something that is going to happen and that's actually a young age and now he's going to grow up and\nHad that carrying around and they did\nGrowing up black in living up living in this situation create a constant um amount of fear on you and a constant amount of worry anxiety and she got to carry around because you just never know what it's going to happen or what a ...\nCarry around because you just never know what it's going to happen or what a small move is gonna uh how ... what was going to affect you it affect your life in the long run so\nYou're in the movie the heat you give start ... as I said earlier played by among Lester stern bird is a ... attends a mostly white school called Williams and perhaps a after her friend ... was killed in a traffic stop by a police officer some students take the opportunity to ditch school and to go to a protest\nIn this clip that we'll hear star reviews her friend Haley who's played by Sabrina Carpenter\nI just don't think it's you know who he is the situation as we just get class to house part it's not just in his class it's a good cause also happened to be a really good ...\nReally don't want to hear messenger space that I knew\nTo your school how would you guys called book talk on the heat you give up what kinds of conversations or prompt with your white classmates that spark any any new thoughts\nUm actually I had two of them one of my freshman year and then one maybe last week the first one that I had with my freshman class actually did strike a conversation about what happened but it wasn't a I'm a growing conversation it was more so like my teacher talking and then\nPeople just kind of like one of the conversation to be over and then the one that I recently had um last week was kind of the same thing so none of them really sparked the major conversations um\nBased on what my teacher said to my classmates responding it just kind of made it awkward for me on my end because I noticed that as she was reading the book and talking about the situation everybody was kind of looking at me because I'm the only black student in the class and I'm In my school I've known for talking about\nActivism and police brutality so it just kind of both times kind of gave everyone kind of gave me the side I um it didn't really bring up any heavy conversation so\nTo tell you what would hope so you have for the movie theaters\nI really hope that after watching the movie people understand the frustration that we have because there's a lot of people in my school and a lot of people that I Know in general who um I have a best friend and she is really big on activism as well um and people\nLook at us and they tell us that we are over\nBeing over dramatic that police officers are good that the person who um was shot and killed shouldn't have done whatever they did um\nThat people now justifies a reason to die people tell us that were being over dramatic were that were over thinking it or we need to let it go but I really hope that after seeing this movie and actually seeing this happens ... seem to happen\nIn Sarasota Kenny G is it the ban wage low performing

I found a telling that the guests so they brought up\nA typically these would be people you know on presidential runs for big fundraisers and big events to rally behind candidates have been you know stormy Daniels' lawyer Michael Ozzie and Alec Baldwin and\nThey we haven't yet seen I mean typically the more traditional candidates would start arriving in preparation for twenty twenty after the midterms but\nWe've let people who've drawn the most attention of the people who've cast themselves as Trump antagonist and uh the coffers of the local Democratic Party would tell you that that's been good for them so you know the the midterms of up here at least in favor of both sort of an all against all on the question of Trump\nAnother politician who at one point was an antagonist of Donald Trump on the campaign trail was Republican Senator Ted Cruz of Texas He is running for his seat again this week the Democratic he debated his Democratic challenger Beto O'Rourke\nPeople are pretty closely watching this race because it could help decide which party controls the Senate because the margin of control is so tight\nTed Cruz's ahead in the polls at the moment but as we said the race is still pretty tight in a work came out swinging in the debate he even used President Trump's nickname for Ted Cruz from the twenty sixteen election calling him lying dead at what point at one point Franco or ... ... what sense do we have of how the candidates came out of that debate\n[noise] um you know I think it's it's this is one of the most fascinating races ... it's been the most fascinating race probably a throughout the terms and it's going to continue to be as it goes down to the wire um I mean\nThis was always going to be a long shot or for Beto O'Rourke he tried to come across early on he you know tried not to say too much about a cruise and Trump and you know he but he's been dropping in the polls and he's\nHe's had to take a new tack using this language of lion had um attacking him about saying that Cruz is only for Cruz pointing out how many communities he's visited in Iowa but not in Texas um it's been a major shift in tone for work\nBut it's also been something that clearly he's been uncomfortable with just yesterday during the town hall he said I'm he perhaps went a little bit too far in the heat of the moment and this is not necessarily something that he wants a you know kind of the tone that he wants to take in his campaign\nWhether it'll work uh we'll see but you know there's a lot of hope for better or some some hope is like if he can actually take this tackled that maybe he could be a twenty twenty candidate but that seems like a that seems like another ballgame\nYeah Alexander I was gonna ask you whether or not or what you read was on whether this could work I mean ... I Wonder if this debate gives us any more insight into whether\nIt rather progressive Democrat like a war has a chance in a state like Texas who's you know who's governor both senators you'll reliably conservative Republicans this this give us a sense of whether he moved the needle it'll\nMean broadly it we have to be careful not to over emphasized debates in the midterms typically you\nKnow not that many voters watch them sometimes undecided voters do but unless there's a major gas\nThey typically don't move the needle that significantly in right now I think the polling average shows the credits up by about seven points which\nOn election day of Texas that's the way it typically does it enough I also think\nAnd under covered aspect of this race is the fact that Texas dad's straight ticket voting you can go in ... for Republicans\nAnd the strength of the Republican Party overall the strength as Governor Greg Greg Abbott for instance who's running against Ed Ed Democrat that has been pulling in the thirties and seems to be enough to carry had Cruz over the finish line even if that are over arc\nHad been able to keep them to think of it\nJust wanna make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in ...\nBeen able to keep them to think of it\nI just wanna make sure we're clear on what you said Alexandra in Texas you can just mark a box of the top of the ... and says Republican and it automatically cows that boat dressed county for all the Republicans on the ticket\nYet you can basically do forever Republican all at once I'm this is the last election that there'll be doing straight ticket voting after that it won't be anything\nWill fundraising reports from the third quarter of the year we're due this week to the federal election commission they were on Monday and the results\nLook pretty good for Democrats and house races at least just in terms of the dollars and cents of Democrats are dominating fund raising in house seat races the challengers the Democratic challengers\nOutraged Ninety two Republican incumbents more than six the Democratic candidates raised more than a million dollars that quarter in the Senate Democrats are also out raising Republicans ... raised thirty eight million dollars in the third quarter Ted Cruz raised just over ten million dollars\nAccording to an analysis by five thirty eight the Democrats ability to outspend in Senate races has not correlated with a bump in the polls as it has in house races\nAlso glad to hear from some of you about the president on the campaign trail including in Texas Karen tweeted Trump is coming to Houston next Monday to rally for Ted Cruz Monday is also the first day for early voting in Texas\nLet's shift gears and had to Florida where the after effects of hurricane Michael continue to be felt and seen\nThe weather channel reports the death toll at at least thirty five people with fatalities spread from Florida all the way up to Virginia now those death toll figures are bad enough but Franco what's our sense of how the recovery effort is going particularly the effort to find people who've been missing\nYeah there are still people missing there still people who are trying to pick up their lives um you know I think\nThe town and Mexico beach has not report it given any numbers um of how many people are are missing 'em but there is talk of that it could likely be in the hundreds I mean this\nWas a massive storm I'm Talking about one of the biggest storms out of the top three or perhaps by some accounts that you know had made landfall that would make it bigger than Katrina\nThis has been a huge effort many people still do not thousands still don't have a phone service um and people are expecting asked film is sewn services restored and more roads are clear it and you're able to get more to people that they're expecting the death toll to continue to rise\nIn Alexander the other big issue is when people can actually start\nTo rebuild I mean it's it's fascinating and terrifying horrifying at the same time to look at some of the early drained camera pictures from where hurricane Michael came ashore from where it made landfall\nYou can almost tell which homes were built up to the latest building codes and which homes were not because of homes that were up to code words there and the homes that weren't were gone and I wonder what points the the ... the rebuilding effort is right now is there any ... is there any expectation on when people could start to rebuild\nThere is no vote for president in November that presidential politics are

week's top stories from across the country one a at W. A. M. U. dot war Josh Rogers let's talk New Hampshire for a little while there are two congressional races underway there are two districts in New Hampshire\nThe race in district one\nWill be historic kind of no matter who wins because either the Democrat Chris Pappas would become the state's first openly gay member of Congress\nHis Republican opponent Eddie Edwards would be the first black house member from New Hampshire tell us a bit more about the first congressional district as I understand that it's it's a swing district that Donald Trump carried in twenty sixteen\nRight absolutely trading him um partied a party for two thousand eight or the GOP winning and midterm years Democrats winning in presidential years is now held by Carol Shea Porter fairly liberal Democrat who's\nRetiring I'm In ... where do you have people who are running really within the mainstream of their parties are pappas has been serving in various\nElective offices for a long time he's in his late thirties he family owns a very popular restaurant in Manchester all from the start for presidential candidates\nHe um he comes from Manchester which is a town where the even the Democrats have historically been a little bit more conservative than in other parts of the state particularly on fiscal matters um Eddie Edwards is somebody who\nParticularly on fiscal matters um Eddie Edwards is somebody who has a background in law enforcement he was in the navy he at\nOne time a lead the states uh enforcement division of liquor commission in New Hampshire we have those big highway liquor stores liquor is controlled by the state uh I was a fairly big job he of ram enforcement division and he's been a police chief\nUm you know they're pretty much keeping to well within the norm to their party Eddie Edwards has you know embrace Donald Trump he every Giuliani up here campaigning with them [noise]\nUm and he's in some ways trying to cast Chris ... says you know part of some sort of resistance movement and saying we've obviously the nationally uh you know Chris Pappas as you know hardly a radical guy or you know family I'm Ron restaurant ah worked I worked for Joe Lieberman when he ran for president um\nAnd uh this race is one where the seat can go either way and ah both parties believe they have a shot\nThere's also a gubernatorial race underway feared the Republican governor governor ... new new\nFaces Democrat Molly Kelly she's one of the Fifteen women running for governor across the country which is an unprecedented number\nThe latest fundraising numbers that came out this week showed that Kelly the Democrat has raised some new new the incumbent Republican three to one uh ... brand of New York came to conquered on yesterday to helped campaign for Kelly\nThey met with employees of the Granite State candy shop and they discussed paid family leave from interested in where this issue sits in terms of all the issues New Hampshire voters are considering but here as part of what happened with your ...\nIt's going to help families the happier and healthier going to help people to be more productive at work and so it's a win win everywhere I go in that state I hear about the need for paid family medical leave and how important it is\nFor people to be able to have the choices in their life to be able to work hard where they're working but then to be able to spend time with the people they love the most when they're needed them out\n[noise] that was Molly Kelly you heard at the end senator Gillibrand was at the beginning tell us a bit more about Mali Kelly is is this paid family leave issue a big one for her based on her political background her personal background will\nIt's been a huge issue for her whether it is for voters is an interesting test me she's been running pretty much exclusively on this issue [noise] um it's a challenge of somebody covering the trait how many stories one can write about paid family leave my understanding as Democrats\nHave polling that suggests that Governor Sununu is vulnerable on this issue he was on the record supporting a paid family leave bill that didn't make it through the legislature in part because he came out against it\nAt the last minute or for fear that a payroll deduction amounted to an income tax which you know it was a real kind of fighting words here in New Hampshire where there's no income tax\nUm if the Democrats believe this is an issue that works for Mali Kelly by dint of her background at one point she was a single mother with three kids who work your way through college and that you know pursue new son of a governor brother of a U.S senator uh\nYou know doesn't understand the the stresses and strains that many working people face and you know it does get at New Hampshire has kind of a bifurcated economy uh\nUh you know boom times for people the upper income we have budget surpluses and tax collections are up but you know their wage growth for people at the lower end of the scale\nHas not been great and this is an issue that for Democrats they feel that it kind of hits a lot of boxes and may help mobilize women which are you know he constituent anywhere for particularly here in New Hampshire how close is this governor's race well I'm ... you know Sunni should when we do we have two year term\nWell I'm ... you know Sunni should when we do we have to your terms here no governor's been tossed after one term\nUh since two thousand four and prior to that it had been a century so it's pretty rare that a governor doesn't get a second term apps and being a disaster or a really tanking economy we don't have either of those\nUh here polling indicates puts a new news about by about ten and you know you mentioned the fundraising numbers and Molly ... has outrageous ... three to one in the most recent reporting period he does enter the final stretch of this race with a cash advantage although for an incumbent\nWith a nationally known name he's a pretty bad fundraiser he will freely admit he doesn't like to do it so\nYou know he's only got he's got four hundred thousand she's got two hundred thousand you know interest groups will will add to that in terms of advertising but\nThis is a race Democrats feel they have a chance to win if if a blue wave eventually when they think that ... a bite in her background by dint of being a woman is somebody who perhaps his best engineered to kind of ride away\nSpeaking of nationally known names Frank or don't use I Wonder what your senses of Senator Joe brand making this trip to help Mali Kelly ... is there is speculation about her future maybe twenty twenty\nThere's a lot of speculation about her future and twenty twenty [noise] um I think how much is a kind of resonate as as the big question I mean obviously a there's so many names being kicked around ah right now or that you know it I think time will tell but there there's no question that killed rented one of the people that\nThat people are talking about and certainly are watching very closely in every move\nOr that she makes 'em is being picked apart um you know analyzed a and looking for it how it could mean and how it could uh what impact that could have on twenty twenty\nLots to discuss with business and the economy this week including the U.S deficit we don't hear much about it these days but it's back in the news because of the Treasury Department revealed this week but the deficit has grown\nLast year it was about six hundred sixty six billion dollars not a significant number there at all six hundred sixty six billion\nThis week the Treasury Department revealed that the deficit has grown to seven hundred Seventy nine billion dollars it's a six year high end projection say it is on track by the end of this decade to hit a trillion dollars the deficit a trillion dollars\nNow Alexander some experts are pointing to the Trump Administration for being responsible for this particularly\nThe tax bill part of the sales pitch for the tax bill for the tax cuts is it by cutting taxes business what kind of unleash more productivity the economy would boom like never before and the resulting largest would more than make up for whatever we lost in tax revenue how's that working out so far\n... well we haven't seen that yet certainly an advantage Republicans are arguing that that's going to take 'em you know about a decade to even out do\nAt this rate although the economy is booming there's ... there's no way that it can make up for where our deficit is at at this point I'm it would sort of an open secret in Washington that the real plan that Republicans were kicking around with welfare reform\nUm to to cut down on the deficit and that conversation has started again on Capitol Hill\nI'm that obviously won't move forward until after the midterms but there is conversation about to get you know starting to work on\nA welfare reform bill that would cut some public benefits um like Medicare that kind of thing\nAnd and still going forward you know it's interesting they care or to see Republicans silence on that issue when they were previously the party of deficits but it's also an opportunity for them politically to push another priority of the Republican Party which again is welfare reform\nYeah I'm Glad you mentioned that because Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell blamed the rising deficit on public assistance programs in an interview with Bloomberg News on\nBut on public assistance programs in an interview with Bloomberg News on Tuesday what's going on with\nThat it's very disturbing and it's it's ruined by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular Medicare Social security and Medicaid that Seventy percent of what we spend every year subject we were just discussing the
