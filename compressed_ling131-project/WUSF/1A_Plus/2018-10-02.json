law school for them\nNow or I should know I watched the whole for um it was an about an hour and\nI Am now a I should know I watched the whole forum it was an about an hour and a half long and Brett Kavanaugh was named was not mentioned ones are neither by Justice Kagan or by the UCLA moderator of the law school dean Jennifer Munn you can\nBut I Want to play a bit for you both here anyway because I think it's as close as we are going to get to knowing what's inside the minds of justice is right now and there was this really interesting moment where demon who can ask Justice Kagan about the lessons that the justices had learned when they only had eight members on the bench after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia\nAnd Alina Kagan said the courses a real interest in preserving its institutional legitimacy and then she said this\nThe court strength as an institution of American governance depends on it having a certain kind of legitimacy on people's believing that\nIt is I'm not simply an extension of politics\nThat it is it's it's decision making has a kind of integrity to it that it's something different from what you find in the political branches\nSupport for on point

joined today by Stuart Taylor he's author and contributing editor for the national journal Dahlia Lithwick is also with us she'd court and law courts in a reporter for slate and host of the economic as pod cast as well\nAnd I want to just go through a kind of a little walk through a through history here in in terms of moments for different nominees where\nPolitics definitely came into play a first of all let's go back to Nineteen eighty seven here's then Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork in a press conference in October\nTwo days after the Senate Judiciary committee voted to have his nomination put before the full Senate with a recommendation knots to consent to the appointment\nAnd obviously a Robert Bork ended up not being a elevated to the high court and here he talks about the lasting effect of\nThe politics involved in his nomination\nMost serious and wires being injury and all of this is not for me nor is it to all of those who have stood vastly supported by nomination ... deeply grateful\nRather the damage to the ... the integrity of law and public service in this country\nRobert Bork in October Nineteen eighty seven fast forward than to October Nineteen Ninety One and here is then Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas addressing the Senate Judiciary committee about his confirmation hearings\nThose are certainly some national disgrace [noise] from my standpoint [noise] as a black American as far as I'm concerned it as a high tech lynching for upper the blacks\nWho in any way Jane suffering for themselves [noise] to do for themselves but I have different ideas that it is a message that unless you couch how to an old order this is what will happen to\nClarence Thomas in Nineteen Ninety One now move forward still to Merrick Garland who President Obama nominated and um we can't play any tape there because he never even got a hearing\nSo that takes us then to where we are now in two thousand Eighteen and just last week present a Brett Kavanaugh defended himself before the Senate Judiciary committee\nAre claiming that Democrats had politicize this process and developed quote a long series of false last minute smears to block his nomination\nThis whole week effort as very calculated and orchestrated political hair fueled with a parent pent up anger about President Trump and the two thousand sixteen election\nFear that has been unfairly stoked about my judicial record ranch on behalf of the coins and millions of dollars for money from outside left wing opposition groups\nDo it last week hoping ... you with us now yeah I'm here great\n... thank you so much so so let me just ask you hearing sort of those voices through history is what we heard last week with Brett Kavanaugh categorically different than the politics that came before in previous nominations\n[noise] I I you know I think it it was a I think that it it's a funny\nI you know I think it it was a I think that it it's a funny it's there's some perfect symmetry we started with Robert Bork what Robert Bork did at his hearing that was\nProbably tactically a mistake with the top two really\nIn Folsom clear and very very certain ways about his own views there's a reason that people stopped doing that after Bork a and learn to say I'm just a robot in a neutral umpire so in a sense what Robert Bork was being\nA barked over was in fact how he thought about judging how he thought about the constitution then when you fast forward to last week and judge Kavanaugh you have a very very strange almost the mirror image where\nSince then there's this long tradition of judges including judges by the way with\nVery very very extensive legal records um records of writings records of speeches and communications and records of\nTheir actual dot ... views standing up and saying but I'm also just a robot a I have no ... balls and strikes and in a weird way I think that Robert Bork with the last time we had anything close to a truthful\nScrutiny of someone's record now what we have is this funny pantomime where the nominee pretends that they actually have no use it all and nothing they wrote\nIn the past has any bearing and I think that sets up a what we saw this week which is you have a nominee who has a very very clear very coherent that channel record and he spent most of the hearing trying to get away from it now\nThat doesn't answer the question of whether Brett Kavanaugh did something really dramatically different when he started talking about dark money and the Clintons because I think\nThat's a given I've never seen anything like that but I think at least Bork was honest and he was when the Senate exercised it's advise and consent it did so knowing yeah that's gone\nWe'll Stuart Taylor I mean I guess the the question that that naturally raises itself here is is the court being undermined by what is fundamentally seen by many as a broken nomination and confirmation process the proceeds any justices elevation to the high court\nEmphatically yes and I've been watching it happen and get worse and worse and worse since before\nA judge Bork ... a year before a judge Bork Justice Scalia who was then a very controversial figure was confirmed like Ninety eight to zero I think maybe it was Ninety eight to to\nUh I think was zero I'm bored I don't understand why the Democrats didn't want him to get confirmed because his record shows that he was going to be bad for them and almost every issue and even then what I said earlier was troops\nAh everything you know they're they're deciding many of the most important political issues and the country you can hurt you it's almost impossible to be a neutral arbiter when that's what you're doing\nThe what the Democrats did was a Bork and and what made worker bird\nWas the smear him in every conceivable way except to sex life\nThey smeared him as a liar as a monster they portrayed him as a horrible person they took out advertising it was disgusting display you know that this was how they thought they could win now was Thomas was more complicated\nWith a cabin on who you know for all those all of the comments lately and understandable comments about his performance in front of the committee\nOr he's been on the bench for twelve years at the second highest court in the land arguably sitting along with Fifteen admirable judges including my law school friend Merrick Garland and we know what happened to him\nI have it on good authority and it's pretty public that every one of those judges or or at least almost every one of them including George Carlin I Believe\nJudges are or at least almost every one of them including George Carlin I Believe a Mars him in terms of judicial temperament as a level headed smart wonderful colleague\nWho uh you know who is much more conservative than most and some of them in some ways but he was an excellent tone yeah now that's not what he looks like the person was on TV the other day was totally out of character\nFor a cabin or in this process I think a drove them after\nA while and and and uh do you lift weights I mean we're we're creeping towards looking at Congress's role in all of this I mean there's the politics that play out between Democrats and Republicans\nIn those hearings themselves but also I mean after Harry Reid first you know wants to nuclear option or pursue nuclear button in two thousand Thirteen and then Mitch McConnell did it after that for Supreme Court nominees in two thousand Seventeen\nThat removed you know what was the most effective break in terms of bringing more controversial justices to uh you know to the nomination process right so I mean we have to be looking at the Senate and and its role here in creating this highly politicized environment for the court\nI I don't think there's any question I think that the fact that we're talking about what one two votes were talking about Jeff Flake and Susan Collins and the totality of this seed rests on one or two people's votes it it really I mean I couldn't agree more with Stewart that you know justices Ginsburg and Justice Scalia often\nUh say are set in ... case look this is to be Ninety eight nothing seems to be a Ninety four nothing enterprise because of the rule that everybody adhere to in the Senate was\nElections matter and if the president chooses someone who's fit we don't go after them because of perceived outcomes and that's clearly just gone I Would probably say that\nThe the holding of Merrick Garland seat open and in fact I Would say the running on the proposition right

the legitimacy the integrity and the public trust in the United States Supreme court and I'm joined today by Dahlia Lithwick Stuart Taylor and Christopher Schmidt and I want to play just a couple of clips here uh this is against this is from last week\nA and first of all you're going to hear Republican Senator Lindsey Graham I'm being asked by a reporter is uh the hearings that were held on Thursday could have an impact on Republicans vote on Brett Kavanaugh\nIf you can ignore everything and disrupt [noise] looking at allegation is thirty five years old\nThis uncertain time place date and no cooperation if that's enough for you God help us all as Republicans this happens to us it never happens to them but let me tell you my democratic friends if this is the new norm you better watch out for your nominates\nSenator Lindsey Graham last week at last week's confirmation hearing Senator Ben Sasse Republican from Nebraska said that all the recent quote hysteria is because the Supreme Court nominations have become so politicized\nWe have a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the Supreme Court an American lifestyle\nAre political commentary talks about the Supreme Court like there are people wearing red and blue jerseys that's a really dangerous thing and by the way if they have red and blue jerseys I Would welcome my colleagues to introduce the legislation that ends lifetime tenure for the judiciary\nBecause if they're just politicians than the people should have power and they shouldn't have lifetime appointments\nThat the Republican Ben Sasse last week this week before the break I had to interrupt you there so that we could take that break but you were talking about the fact that uh people are seeing politics in the nomination process but they don't actually get a chance to see in great detail the court doing its actual work and the consequences of that [noise]\nThat's right and in some sense I think senator Sasse put it better than I did um you know if you all you see is people in red and blue jerseys and the Senate turning it into a blood sport about getting a red or blue justice on it's a little bit hard to say the public isn't going to take that away with them\nUm and I think you know the only other thing I Would add is we've been talking about the public perception of the justices but I think it's probably\nWe've been talking about the public perception of the justices but I think it's probably worth just threading into the conversation that justice is only view of these things we know for instance that Clarence Thomas\nNever fully recovered from what he thinks we're done to him and his hearings we know that Sam Alito has said that he never quite forgiving forgotten how his hearings went down it's really hard to imagine that if Brett Kavanaugh's elevated to the court\nHe will look at some of the groups that are attacked him in anything resembling a an objective open minded way so there are real consequences not just for public perception of the justices but the justice is\nA perception of the public and that's something that I think we really do you have to factor\nIn conversation I'm going to get to some colors 'cause we've got folks who've been waiting patiently on the line but Christopher Schmidt I just want to ask you a quick question here because uh I mean it isn't there an evidence enough or perhaps ample evidence in um the justices own voting are just records in the decisions that they make\nThat perhaps uh I don't know if it's fair to say politics already plays a role in how the court operates but that one can wonder if that's true when we\nHad justices that are much more often than not um you know voting in line with the with what would be perceived a preferred vote of the president that ... that nominated then I put them on the court to begin with\nYeah this is absolutely true there's also nothing new we knew this before Brett Kavanaugh came on the scene\nAs a nominee for the Supreme Court politics play a role as always played a role in some sense and also say if you look at the American people's attitude toward the court most people are if you don't think that the court does not involve itself in politics and politics and play some or all in the court\nAnd people often times do have an ability to say yes there are politics at play here um but the court still has legitimacy even independent of that so it's not the idea that once people see it as in some ways a political institution automatically its legitimacy is lost and no longer people are going to follow it dictates\nWell let's go to college here finally and thank you everyone for were for waiting patiently on the line was go to Aaron who's calling from Detroit Michigan you're on the air Erin\nHi thank you for taking my call very interesting topic don't want to get to see from almost be through it first of all of the the point of course is has the legitimacy of integrity or public trust for the last\nTwo perception and if you think about what happened with a Obama not being able to appoint a adjusted to repeal replace ... because of Republican saying we will not let him do it\nThat politicized it in the public's eye now we know that the American public is probably the most uh propagandize uh easily manipulated a populist in modern history and so through the media and through a lot of other things they are a\nGiven a perception of what is and what is not but through the last several months Donald Trump and his a blatant disregard for for for the\nConstitution and Republicans with this don't down we're going to do this regardless because we're Republicans or we're gonna go against whatever Democrats saying that a lot of law\nI think the public trust has been shaken and I believe the integrity of the word is gone and I believe like one of the other uh uh statements were made that we need to put some kind of limits on terms now because this is simply a political position\nWell Aaron thank you for your call call Stuart Taylor hum at least one you know one thought there about from the from a member of the public about maybe it's time for term limits with\nWell I think term limits it's a wonderful idea\n... says well I think term limits as a wonderful idea I slept that for twenty or Thirty years\nOr maybe eleven years maybe Fifteen Years in and out of the problem is it'll never happen\nA because it would require is maybe a constitutional amendment to even getting it through Congress\nOr the the calculations by the political people who could decide whether to have term limits are are going to be who's going to be helped who's going to be heard who's gonna who's people or older\nYou know who's terms or later is again a helped on the red team of the blue team and they're always be a calculation where if one side thinks it's going to be a good thing for their team the other side will think it's going to be a bad thing and neither side is gonna care much about the herring merits of term limits which are good you know people shouldn't be sitting on the Supreme Court for forty years\nUm but that's what's good and I think that's what we're going to be seen from ... for a long time well\nLet's go to Troy who's calling from Iowa City Iowa you're on the air Troy\n... thank you very much uh I Will remind people Lindsey Graham supported Kagan\nFor Obama and the ah keep in mind that the ... the Supreme Court's role is to make the wrongs of the government against its people\nFixed so I think uh this is an injustice for uh the the nominee that was he's going through thank you very much\nTroy thank you for your call let's go to Joe who's calling from Tampa, Florida you're on the Joe\nI'm I guess what I figured that I called the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and the question was going up or go out when I realized that it was only up to a couple of justices weather and I got the right to marry or go\nOn and now I'm kind of thing that play out a gang where there's a lot of decisions I could come up and it's not even that it's a light left ideology it seems like it's more playing down to um the what the right is actually just a code word for religious so\nIt's a bunch of religious people on the right if you want to overturn roe even though that may be impossible by some standard\nThey still want to do it and they're willing to sacrifice anything to be able to give me get that chance when in reality there is no scientific reason to do it there is no scientific reason new ah prohibit a people are married

you for being a surprise guest this hour or ... let me let me turn back to you or was it disgusting it sounds like it was\nA ... a lot of things and survival of disgusting you know but I've learned you leave your prejudices behind you got to do whatever it takes and survival food is never going to ... nice and survival\nYou know like fluid Seventy Tice nice but it's about doing whatever it takes you know and and I'm definitely not one of these people who drinks pay for found there if you ... that night she met a few of them over the years and I kind of make a swift exit if I get Qunu by somebody tells me they do it for fun I don't\nThink in your book though how to stay alive ad on page twenty here you actually have this really great a diagram of below ground solar still is\nThat if you're in the desert I eat someplace like Western Australia a dig a hole in the ground but what a foot or so deep and if you have a piece of plastic you put plastic over that whole and some rocks around it\nAnd the stone in the middle so that I'm a water whatever water content in the soil around the the whole will actually condense a underneath the the plastic and drip into a cop and you say you stay here if you earn eight in the whole before setting up the still moisture New Years will condense into clean drinking water why didn't you know that\nThat's the thing is if you're really de hydrated drinking you'll pay when it's brown pay is not going to help you you're just into pure waste product\nSo if you can make a certainly still like this you have the you have the the resources to do that paying into the bit around that is gonna evaporate like you say condense and then you you're going to get flus out of that but\nIf you uh well hydrated when you find yourself stranded in survival situation for example you call it breaks down or whatever it is you know I knew what hydrated you don't want to be paying out those fluids because actually if your peers clear\nThat that can actually help ... so you want to be drinking that you want to be using in other ways maybe paying onto your clothes and wrapped around the head to Kuti ahead\nUm you know and he he's a little ... bunch of times I mean it was right she loves looking back on it because if it was a crew to guide you stink then a few days we moved on my teacher just wrapped around my neck you know on the head scarf the pay and [noise] you know but he said let's see if it's about whatever it tell you who's in it since you mentioned your crew I've\nAlways wondered I mean how ... your crew was there with you with their equipment and having to go through the same terrain as you are I mean how how how much do you ask them in terms of er of having a survival mindset or doing the things that you're even doing\nI'll tell you while they are they're incredible they really are there with me from day one it's a small team you know were real\nOf all they really are they're being with me from day one it's a small team\nYou know we're real kind of band of brothers and a foot of respect and admiration and everything you kind of thing can hype about them is true you know they always say hey bay you have these huge oh we're going to do everything you do the backwoods carrying a camera you know and it's a bit you know\nBe under no illusion they are incredible and they work the hardest and the the real unsung heroes and the whole story\nAll right well we're speaking with their grills he is host of running wild with their grills and of course man versus wild he's got a new book out called\nHow to

cat [noise]\n\nThis is um point I'm making a chocolate bar the we're talking this hour with Baird grills he's got a new book out at how to stay alive the ultimate survival guide for any situation and Barrett before the break we heard from college Steve who was former a navy special forces are here in the U.S and he'd he'd gone through the the Navy's really rigorous ear training a and he was talking about how\nUm as one of the toughest things for him was the mental challenge of the forty eight hour period that he had to spend in complete isolation and whether or not you've ever experienced a similar challenge or had gone out on one of these survival expeditions without a a a a camera crew and I I couldn't let you respond before the break but I wanted to give you a shot at that now [noise]\nYeah no festivals they respect feel service and a lot watched the ... to be\nA guy who rang in before us your by so right there the the bachelor for survival is won or lost in the mind I'm just see a training is something I went through likewise with part of the British special forces or it is long it is that you should it's tough\nAnd the time on your own ... I Would second what you said Steve ... it's it's hard but you need to kind of get into that mode focus okay we're into this you know however long it's gonna be just break it down into the daily tasks and I she found you get you get so busy\nSurviving you know use these job off the job and people kind of\nYou know often underestimate how big it is is a lone survivor to look up to yourself and\nAgain you know when we're now is the crew you know when we were filming stuff\nEverything is so much easier when you have an extra set of hands be needed you know putting up show to getting a fog and someone else to be needed just to put a foot still not what you'd do you know the ...\n... everything on the right to send my child at but it's all so busy you know I just remember that the training I went through to the days on All right it was just doing to a doctor and if you collect your father would repairing the setting snap as doing that\nAnd by the end it's like yeah yeah\nIt's all on your shoulders and then it's not meant to Saudi you got to keep yourself up beat you gotta keep thinking like you know\nI always say to people in survival situation is never letting your mind go into neutral there's always some yeah be doing to think about the planning and um and that's why it becomes very draining what the times on the road I I think it's three times harder than when you go one other buddy with you\nThere's one more thing that Steve had said that caught my attention and I just want to just get a quick response from your cars and actually got a lot of online questions and I kind of want to do a little lightning round with you but but there's something as Steve said that he ... he was man and he managed to snare a rabbit or to during his ear training and I was thinking he's really highly trained navy special forces a guy\nA and and so he managed to snare rabbit or two but I'm just wondering do you worry that people watching your shows for example come because you have to show the successes along with the challenges on television or at least survive survival situation do you ever wonder that people\nJay is on television or at least survive survival situation do you ever wonder that people come away thinking it's easier than it actually is\nYeah I think that's what I mean listen nobody is going to put on telly mace spending three hours trying to lie to five ... and the reality of a sudden in the old days on the ... wild shows\nYou know I spent hours and hours doing this or you know hours and hours studying ... and all of a say that she was going to make a Rudy boring program you know I ... guess edited down and for you know it's like a bit of music and ... got a fog guy but\nYou got to the reality of it it is it is hard work for sure yeah but I think one of the lessons of survival is embracing failure you know not be scared to fail and and it's just this is why I said right at the start of the show survivor of summed up three was never gave up as well what about that too nasty that spirit\nAnd you might have to go through multiple failures hours and days of\nOf getting something wrong before you get success and that's why the rules to we've got to that don't get that determine your next Saturday to the British and the brave the strongest well so let's do a lightning round a quick quick right here for by the way to wrap it for a few people\n[laughter] that's going to be not one do you love food team found in the ... yeah I I'm not seeing the seventies I we we run another survivor show called the island where we draw these people in the desert island to leave with nothing no camera crews joining than they have to fill my upbringing themselves that\nYou know we come back in months later and it's like ... the slight stream weight loss said and that is the reality of survival is yes you're starving UD hydrated your frighten you wet your cold and ... and you know and that's why it's ... it's it's very on glamorous as very on romantic Ohio reality of survival is great\nWell speaking of the the glamorous part of survival and do we just got so many questions here a lot of them coming in on social media I just want to do like a little lightning round plastic question in just a quick answer so we can get through\nA as many of them as we can hear okay so Brian wrestler from or on Facebook says I've often wondered after eating beetles and crustaceans in survival situation it's vital situations how miserable is bears intestinal track I mean does he sit there and say why could not be somewhere with some nice soft grubs to eat\nYour mind tests will track needs needs some attention yeah [laughter] I mean the desperately to hear about the failures number of things have eaten the end up with ... director and stuff and I saw um but\nOn the whole is you're not getting the land ... by the failures than you next time I got ... to ... that want to get\nIt right so I get Matt wanted to know how often as Barrett guessed wrong and ingest poisonous planter animal I guess that has happened according to what you just said\nBut not but also you got to be ... you I Need make big mistakes once and when it comes to you know poison things I've ... mushrooms and ... said you you got to really know you stuff and be careful and if the doubt there's no doubt darn each it right you know especially when it comes I see now with mushrooms\nYou know I I just we just I just don't even go near them now and the walks into many ones in different areas that look like so many things okay and then you know I mean look at that story from Alaska was at one side great film you know the end of the wind in the Alaska decided in the ... and I had a baby coming on our own ran to get it wrong ones out there\nAnd by the way if you have from folks have a right of Jon Krakauer original but it's amazing uh Tanya be asked any special advice pretending to women [noise]\nWell hey listen to what I've learned about ladies in the wild as they make incredible survivors enough taken so many running wild guess\nThat you know you think that the man the the the big Bush ... got the big muscles he's going to be great but actually in the little tweak of an actress of a girly thinks she's going to snap in the wild and she's also disliked made of steel\n... thinks she's going to snap in the wild and she's also dislike made of steel so survival is all about that in the spirit the outer muscles\nAnd I'll see an incredible her ekstrom fantastic ladies we've got some great ladies on a team who ... you know it's such an inspirational survivalists so they all living examples to survive is is all about spirit and ... the impulsivity [noise] um and actually some of them have the guns the guy with the\nYou know [laughter] ah that who was impressive to see his well All right one more a lightning round here question Sam Winston on Twitter or sorry on our website says there can you do your classic ... like when you accomplish a big Clyde thanks that's from Sam ...\nCome on let me give out team were on it we're moving on a ski guys they pose a stiff protein in we can do to\nGrill and his class thing how let's go to my silliness

heroes of the wilderness so much you can do everything you mentioned but also more you know the old days they used to use the reds and mix it with a charcoal from afar make glue outta that\nUh you know ... ... ... to ... uh there's so much you ... I spent a lot of time is moving through forests just chewing on the\nChewing on the needles good victim and see you know I mean you think of all of the\nClassic old wrong navy and the old days sending

of this so unremarkable so common because so many women have been through worse unquote\nOn unremarkable what made you think of what you've been through as unremarkable and what changed your mind\n[noise] you know for years and my friends and I have ten\nAnd colleagues as well just sharing stories swapping stories and you know in bars and and trips abroad of of our sexual assaults of our sexual harassment and just knowing him\nSalts of our sexual harassment and just knowing how many of my friends and have been through similar experiences somewhere on that spectrum I just you know as a journalist who I I never want to make it about me\nAnd so my instinct is to tell other people's stories and I'm hearing from some of my friends and colleagues\nDuring Dr Ford's testimony though I'm getting text messages about the kind of pain that they were in uh the pie TST it made me rethink my decision to to stay silent on my own experience can\nYou share with others to whatever extent you feel comfortable what happened to you\nSure so um it was over a decade ago I was in college and um you know I I was at a party with a boy at who I'd had a crush on I guess for a long time I think um we both had an interesting one another and\nWhen you drink a lot I was Twenty years old at the time um and he drink more than I did ah one thing led to another and we uh ended up back in his place um and we were having sex and that sex was consensual although I Would say that um it was\nA rougher frankly than I Would have expected it kind of took me by surprise\nAnd um you know suddenly all of a sudden we were actually having anal sex which I had not consented to 'em and it was very painful and I\nI'm asking to stop and I think eventually did I mean it felt like a lot longer for me at the time but frankly I'm you know I think frankly it was probably too drunk to kind of know what was going on is what what I thought at the time\nAnd you know afterwards I dated him and I think\nNow I Know that that's a very common experience but\nYou know at the time there was no nationwide conversation about these things so you really didn't realize how common that is and so I think I felt so much shame um in what had happened that I I just you know stayed silent about it until a couple of years later when I started talking to some friends\nAnd you know kind of realizing owning that experience for what it was um which which is really what helped me move on\nLast week professor Conan A democratic Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont asked professor forward what her strongest memory was of what she accuses judge Brett Kavanaugh having done to her as a teenager here is part of what professor Ford said\nIndelible in the hippocampus is the laughter ... laughter between the two [noise] and they're having fun at my expense\nProfessor can you explain for us from a neurological perspective what it is that certain aspects of assault stand out in people's memories ... perhaps by way of explaining what the hippocampus foods and what adults\n[noise] um they hit the campus is a part of the brain involved in memory and um [noise]\nDr Ford and her testimony talks about I'm being afraid she's gonna die or that he's going to kill her\nAnd the human brain has specific parts that are involved to encode fear and if you just think about it I'm\nI'm that's because fear especially in prehistoric times kept us alive um you don't want to see a lion and have to think oh is that dangerous or not should I run away you when people who can encode that fit that fear about lying and immediately react well escape and survive so I'm\nSimilarly and fear memories I'm like the memory of an assault um the\nFear memories I'm like the memory of an assault on\nThe brain becomes hyper focused on specific details so it's really common to remember perhaps the color of the person's eyes or sound or the Muzak or like Dr Ford says the laughter because that I'm even just hearing her talk about it really makes my heart touch you know it's really emotional um\nBut forget other details like\nUh the house you were in or the neighborhood or the street\nThose aren't those are irrelevant in the moment the assault is happening um so I Hope that sort of helps explain it but it is their brain operate\nThey've kind of feels like when you're you know the way she describes the way he described it it feels like that experience you have when you're like watching a scary movie or you know you walking through on that house you'll forget all the decor but that's the thing that leaked out at you the kind of forced your adrenalin to rise that's what in codes that great example yes\nNo more you said that a moment oatmeal Loren I beg your pardon Lawrence Taylor these moments than in code so intensely are there ways to weaken the power of them in the mind or did you just kind of have to deal with them those things kind of triggered those images that are super vivid how do you work through those or ten\nThere are many many ways to work through those I'm Talking about it and getting support whether that's a therapist or a ... community support group or an ... a an informal group of friends can be and getting validation talking to the right people can be incredibly helpful um\nWhat we do in our empowerment self defense classes\nAre is help people find their voice and find their physical power a talk therapy can accomplish a certain amount but um as professor can and will tell you\nThe trauma also lives in the cells of your body and um you need to have some kind of ... um release of that and some addict basically means so much is body so um\nWe we do role plays of practicing standing up for yourself or asking for what you want and we also do hitting and um that can be that can really move the trauma through an out your body you're not only reclaiming your power but you're also releasing whatever you've been through\nLeads to a few more of your stories Jennifer emailed my story involves a sexual predator who happened to be my boss ultimately I was raped on a business trip to get away I had to move to another state and begin my career again the cascade of consequences for each woman like me goes on for decades\nKicking emailed I'm Seventy two I told my best friend about her employees who sexually harassed me he asked me to show him my breasts while he's stroked himself asked disgusting questions you did not\nSaturday matinee tickets are at Florida Orchestra dot ORG\nThis is W.

toning we got many messages in our inbox as I said here's one more that came into us\nMy name is Linda and I'm calling from central Virginia forty two years ago I was raped by my brother and it was only last year\nThat I was able to acknowledge that and begin dealing with the fallout from\nI keep hearing people say well why on earth would she weighs thirty six years and it really happened it must be alive and I can tell you exactly why it doesn't matter that we were victims when we are raped\nWe feel wrong we feel shame and humiliation and embarrassments\nWe feel shame and humiliation and embarrassment and we don't want to admit it to ourselves let alone to anyone else if it was not a violent rape that left obvious marks it's easy to pretend it never happened and\nEmotionally it feels like the right thing to do\nBecause you're so scared at so hurt and so is shaped\nWe've thanks very much for sharing your story with us more geared love to get your reaction to that story particularly the shame the humiliation the embarrassment the comes\nAfter fit into it like that after the attack like that wow and it's powerful um\nYou know [laughter] so I spent many years in therapy and not necessarily certainly not just because of of my fault or it was one of the things that many that that I dealt with but\nI have been so struck by by the number of friends and colleagues and acquaintances who have reached out to me after I shared my story\nAnd you know sharing things they haven't told anyone before\nI was molested I was raped I you know it goes on and on and on and and I really am also a huge fan of Brian Brown and social research or you know that he's shame and vulnerability right and I I and I have become a huge believer that shame needs secrecy to survive\nI'm an oath huge part of the reason that I decided to share my story is selfish it's because I\nYou know I don't believe anymore or that the shame that I'd been carrying around should have ever been my own shame and so in telling my story you know I I was I feel a huge sense of relief I was able to to discharge that\nI'm into the public arena where I Believe it belongs\nOn and no longer hold on to that I feel\nFreer I feel lighter and hearing from others who haven't been able to kind of go there yet they don't have to write a piece of how they can share it with a friend\nOr family member but hearing for them I I Believe that I I did the right thing at least for me because I'm the thing that I'm most emotional about now is not my own experience it knowing how many of the people I Love and care about and know are in you know the kind of pain they're carrying around\nAnd that uh I guess for me that's where who I Am as a journalist meets who I Am and my experience as a human because I just it makes me very angry um and it it really\nWatching you know watching Brett Kavanaugh for me and for a lot of us was kind of the embodiment of that injustice and\nThat's that's where I think you know the the real power in and sharing our stories and power numbers comes from\nLawrence I just wanted to um that speak to what this\nWhat lives shared about her experience there are very\nHonorable powerful reasons not to tell\nI Am not in any way ever going to diminish someone who feels unable to tell or who makes the choice not to tell 'em that it can be internal reasons like lives shared it can be ex journal reasons like I might get taken away from my family or I might lose my job\nUm but they are all very real\nAt at the same time I'm One of the other things that live did not bring up is that\nHave more control over our own experiences and how we shape them and how we interpret them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we\nFor them if they're solely ours and we don't have other people telling us how we should behave\nSarah emailed I went to a small liberal arts college where sexual assault was rampant one day I met up with a friend and he gave me some vodka and I don't remember much else my next memory was me face down pants down with my quote unquote friend on\nTop of me still inside me I never thought of him that way never consented and barely have the strength to get him off of me when I tried to tell people what happened I was called a whore lucky because my rapist was apparently attractive to others and I was called a complainer\nAnd people wonder why survivors don't come forward\nPat emails when I was Thirteen Years old a podiatrist begin molesting me he was thirty one he told my mom he had some worked I could do for him if he checked patients in nursing homes he took me to pornographic movie theaters he taught me what a glory hole was\nHe had a friend of his implant and argued deep in me just went on for almost two years\nMore and let me speak with you for just a moment I Would love to get your reaction to a clip from White House adviser Kellyanne Conway who spoke this weekend about her own experiences with being assaulted listen\nI feel very empathetic frankly for ... a sexual assault sexual harassment\nAnd rent that [noise]\nI ... I don't expect and judge Kavanaugh or Jake Tapper or Jeff Flake or or ... to me how responsible for that little ... own conduct\nThat was Kellyanne Conway speaking to Jake Tapper on CNN learn what do you make it become\nWell first of all I'm Glad she came out as a survivor um you could feel the emotion in her voice with its aside or Kellyanne Conway we none of us have ever seen before um\n\nBut she seems to put the blame entirely on herself being responsible for your own conduct when we know that\nThe\nAggressor is the only person responds a little further harassment abuse or assault you can for where anything you want you can get his drunk as you want if there is not a rapist there you will not be raped I'm I'm Sorry that that she's\nCarrying that and it's a really common thing that a lot of people carry\nCarlos wrote on our Facebook page I Am a fifty year old male survivor of sexual assault\nBy a man who was my mother's boyfriend at the time to this day and it's difficult for me to trust any man aside from my brothers because of this I rarely hug any one and I'm ... extremely protective of my daughters professor Conan would you react to that I I Wonder what your thoughts are in terms of how\nThis might be playing out differently for male survivors of trauma versus women who have been traumatized\nThank you for bringing this up because um [noise] one of the things we haven't talked much about is that men are also victims of sexual abuse and assault um and that the effects on them I'm\nOf developing anxiety phobia he TST are similar to that that women experience after being assaulted\nAnd I think for men who are victims of sexual assault and if it's possible there's more stigma there is even more stigma in terms of being able to come out [noise]\nUm and um be heard um so I so in terms of how this is playing out I Wonder how men are feeling in term of do they feel and they identify with Dr Ford or they feel like their experiences are being\nJoined us ... from the CBC tonight at age this is Wu us after eighty nine point seven Tampa saint Petersburg Sarasota\nThey said there are no dumb question [noise] Neil DeGrasse Tyson says that's true and he's answering your questions about first space and more [noise]\nFrom W AMU and NPR in Washington is one and [noise]\nThey're on Joshua Johnson today on one a Neil DeGrasse Tyson he's one of the world's top public intellectuals explaining science in ways that are accessible and fun\nHis latest book accessory to war explores the link between astrophysics and the military we'll explore the book and frankly anything else you want to ask you specifically told us no question as to silly so wetter rip\nFirst an update on the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia the death toll could have been much lower if warning system was working\nWe'd love to hear from you so comments on our Facebook\nPage or tweet us ... won a\n\nLive from NPR News in Washington I'm Laurie London President Trump is again answering questions about Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh spoke to reporters just before departing the White House or Philadelphia\nI say that it's a very scary time for young men in America when you're busy\nIt's a very scary time for young men in America when you're going to be something that you may not be guilty of which is a very very very difficult time\nThe FBI meanwhile continues to investigate allegations of sexual assault and misconduct against Kavanaugh even as Republicans schedule a vote NPR's Windsor Johnston reports the agency is working toward a friday deadline to release the findings of its weeklong probe\nThe FBI has interviewed friend of both cats at all and his initial accuser Christine Blasey Ford\nThe agency has also spoken with a second woman who claims Kavanaugh exposed himself to her at a college party in the Nineteen eighties Democrat Chris Coons who sits on the Senate Judiciary committee said all I Need to brace for what ever come to light\nAgreeing that we should have a week for a Folsom but times and go prescribed FBI investigation we have to recognize raises the possibility of Kavanaugh being cleared and the possibility of Dr Ford being corroborated Senate\nRepublicans say vote town Kavanaugh's confirmation will come later this week Windsor Johnston NPR News\nThe Pentagon says it has detected a suspicious\nSubstance on to ... that arrived at its mail screening facility NPR's Greg Myre e has more on this investigation\nThe Pentagon says the envelopes were discovered on Monday at the building where all incoming letters and packages are checked the building is on the Pentagon grounds but not inside the Pentagon itself\nThe FBI says agents took control of the two letters on Tuesday Morning and the bureau is conducting a more detailed analysis\nNeither the Pentagon or the FBI has officially identified just suspicious substance all other male that arrived at the Pentagon facility on Monday is currently under quarantine Greg Myre ...

H. M. U. dot org let me start\nWith the book this alliance between astrophysics and military give us a sense of what that is in a nutshell and why it is as the title of your book suggests so unspoken\nYeah so so we already are familiar with the role that other scientists have played in warfare especially engineering you know somebody had to invent the catapult when that first showed up on the battlefield was an a symmetric weapon that would have been a symmetric in the military sense where\nYour opponent has something that you don't have and you're in deep trouble because of that difference\nAnd so that they call that an asymmetric advantage so engineers definitely and if you look at the notebook of of Leonardo da Vinci where yeah he did art but he also was a master mind that sort of military machines that could lay waste tier army\nSo and we know him as one of the greatest combinations of scientists engineer and an artist\nBut moving forward you think are the physicist as a person who builds the bomb right that was well known in the during the Cold War especially\nWe also know the cameras that you know wouldn't make chemicals like napalm and things like that going back to the first World War where they were you know flood the field with mustard gas\nAnd the biologist my weaponize anthrax for example the astrophysicist ... ... you may know such association because we just humbly suited mountaintops and wait for photons too arrived from across the galaxy and then we carefully takes a detector into the coffee lounges and debate what we saw\nSo that connection is not obvious and so when I say the unspoken alliance between astrophysics in the military it just never shows up but in fact astrophysicist and then the earlier days or ... have been fundamental to the growth of empires and the Gemini of nations\nIn particular the the need to navigate with precision around the world ... my my professional ancestors no new the night sky and to to know the night sky and on any level is to give you better advantage\nThe night sky and on any level is to give you better advantage for navigating or surface\nBecause the sky what's different depending on where you are on earth and things rise of different times and sat in different places\nAnd so if you knew this you can know where you're headed where you're coming from where we're the trade winds are where the hospitals are where the Friendly's are and all of this can be established and there's no end of examples where this kind of information was exploited for the game of the nation who had control over\nI should know we didn't have the conversation on this program for those who are more interested in this connection between science and the military\nAbout the origins of chemical weapons during World War one a good bit of that heritage traces right back here to American University which is the institution that owns WAMC which produces one egg you can find that conversation on line at the one eight ... board\nNew President Trump announced the creation of a space for the summer a six to branch of the military to focus on the militarization of space I guess it will be ... since the coast guard is technically part of the ... which is also the topic of your book\nGive us a sense of it went off it within a topic of the book give us a sense of what this space force would need to do have accomplish of whole aid to be in the best interest of the American people and I've humanity\nSo first of all just to to the space where there's not a new concept and ah it it surely been around even before I remembered mentioning it in two thousand and one in a commission I served on\nA authorized by the White House to study the future of the u._s. aerospace industry which at the time was had fallen they've fallen on hard times I lost a half a million jobs that his consolidation in the industry there's competition from Europe with\nAirbus and other places that were rising up like in Brazil has embraced Air Canada was making a regional jets so there was a concern that well what happens if we lose this industry the what impact would that have on our security on our transportation on our commerce\nYou order something from Amazon is on your steps the next morning some airplane delivered it they're\nRight or at least to the nearest airport [laughter] ... doorstep delivery by a airborne craft is still to come but\nWe would call them drones I guess but so so you you ... when you look at this problem you say All right uh what are you going to do about it and I said well might we separate the concerns of the air with the concerns of space because these are the same companies\nAerospace companies that that became a word right and if you separated out in the military you would then sort of tidy the budgeting for what the needs are and you wouldn't have to compete within under one umbrella for very different needs\nUm at the time on this commission there was a four star air force general\nAnd the air force and then now controls space activities of the military it's called the U.S air force space command and they said we think we got this we don't really need a space where it's separate from what's already happening so I was like a second guess the general but I was intrigued by that confidence that he had\nFast forward to today on the Trump announcement as well as the pants follow on announcement a bit if you just listen to it it sounded very very sort of macho look how big my biceps is as I speak\nThat was very we don't want to just be there and we want to we don't wanna just lead we want to dominate you know there's a lot of this kind of language and that spooked many people typically sort of peace next out there who say oh my gosh what will just me\nDo you think of that ad thing though I mean if the U.S has supremacy Gemini over space our aims\nThis has supremacy Gemini over space our aims you know as a western power might be a little more benevolent than say the aims of China or Russia or North Korea\nYeah sure I'm just saying one could have ... said exactly the same thing using slightly different words and it would have been less spooky to people who fear the future of what could happen if you quote militarized space as I was really referencing rhetoric not reality reality is\nA space for us what would that mean you would just take all the space activities that are already happening under the air force\nAnd slide them out under one umbrella once with a coherent umbrella\nAnd if you're going to do that uh I I Would throw in you know asteroid defense right why don't you you know put that in your portfolio while you're at it\nThat could be quite devastating to any place on earth where a bad asteroid strikes and then the limit it could render is all extinct\nAs one did sixty five million years ago with the dinosaurs and Seventy percent of all species of life on earth at the time that asteroid was only six miles across an earth is huge relative to that it's a matter of the energetic and what it does to the climate and the atmosphere\nAnd the long term survivor ability right of of of the ... that requires the sunlight to feed it so so space force would might include I by the way I Would also throw in on your clean up the debris it's up there while you're yes\nThe space debris problem but so so here's the distinction I Want to make which ... which I don't I haven't seen the press or the public recognize\nSpace is very hard and not particularly strategic\nTo make space and act the repository of weaponry\nHolding aside the fact that that would violate a treaty to which we are signature and today more than a hundred countries are signed\nFrom Nineteen sixty seven that it's a peaceful use of outer space treaty has a much longer name that I always forget right but those are those that that those are the essence words from the title and it's very beautiful treat it you feel like holding hands and singing kumbaya as you read it particularly at a time when there's the Cold War but space activities weren't right on the rise\nThat this week on Florida matters and we hope you'll tune in

I think really matters they want to know that you you really care and you're ... you're in it and your\nYour your spirit energy that is spilling out of you that all your whole body mind and soul is ready to be given onto this grand adventure\nThat we're all partake in in the exploration of space so I think if you convey that uh I don't know if it's a slam dunk but at least it's a um [noise]\nIt's a shot from inside the paint [laughter] want to stay on the basketball analogy\nJay tweeted which do you think will happen first transplanting a human brain into a machine chassis I eat a robot body are transplanting a human consciousness into a computer\n[noise] ah so first the human mind is really messed up we have a lot of evolutionary baggage that prevents us from making rational decisions because also reduce some great beauty\nIs that prevents us from making rational decisions as also we do some very beautiful things are art and music and the sort of thing to put a human brain into a\nRobotic chassis um when you could program the robotic chassis to have almost anything you really care about I don't see that as as as a thing that people will do and the other option was what to put put to to put our consciousness I live I think that'll happen either\nYeah well we don't really know what consciousness is\nAn evidence of that is how many books are still written on it there's evidence that usually you don't know what it is for example if you look on the shelf of books on gravity there's like three books we got grabbed me [laughter]\nWe're not still writing books on the lawn of the law obey gravity suck so um but it it sort of uploading all of your electro chemical impulses into some machine to mimic that\nTo mirror that maybe that comes along with consciousness we don't know but I see that happening long before we would take a brain and stick it in a in a machine by the way speaking of translating brain what I really want\nIs if we can't if we can't cure Alzheimer's and we can't cure a O. S.\nAt least find a way to transplant the brain of an outsider space and into the body of 'em are just starting to brain of an election patient into the body of an Alzheimer's patient and they get a full person out of that because one you you lose the body other you lose your your mind\nIs that this sounds very altered carbon you've been watching a lot of Netflix\nSavage [laughter] very Frankenstein to ... I just said if you had goals if you can't otherwise I I bet we'll find cures for both of those before we learn how to transplant of brain but I think about that all the time\nCertainly helps them certainly helps out on wants to know do you believe in aliens\nThat's not a matter of belief is there's there's no evidence for life off the earth yet but we haven't looked very far or very much I'm Jill Tarter is one of my favorite quotes from hers is if you you go to the ocean and you stick a class in and your scoop out some water and they analyze what it really carefully insect\nThere no whales in the ocean [laughter]\nNo you haven't looked so we've only taken a tiny scoop out of the galaxy in our search for life\nAre intelligent life uh for example uh um what we think of as intelligent life or any life at all in our backyard or on Mars and perhaps other places but anyone who studied the problem is\nIn no way doubts the strong likelihood that there's life elsewhere in the galaxy and the universe is possibly teeming with it\nAmy asked on our Facebook page will the human race ceased to exist in the next thousand years based on the current environmental trends now considering a possible impact from an asteroid or other cosmic influence\nWe're pretty sure that nothing extinction level is headed our way that would take us out in the next thousand years and we know that because\nThe more dangerous than asteroid is the bigger it is typically and the bigger it is the easier it is to detect so so ah I I Wish they were good about that it's possible that a comet could come from out of nowhere ... comments very long period comments\nThey sort of show up you know you don't have history for them and one could come in and take us out\nOr it would be really bad luck to you if that were the case but it I regardless you want a healthy space program that can deflect these things and so I'm all for\nBuilding you know protecting having insurance plan that you put a little bit of money in for a to protect you against a devastating saying that it would be very rare\nBut uh otherwise we could easily go a thousand years if we become wise shepherds of our power and over nature and heed the warnings are scientists\nA generation gives me hope for dealing with some of the problems are climate faces but what about you\nYeah I'm hopeful I'm realistically hopeful so but I'm ... I'm Sorry I'm [laughter]\nI'm cynically hopeful so here's how this works cynically hope yes so here so people don't act even when they're warned until it gets really bad and then they act\nSo all these this topic movies that show like look at Blade Runner right would ever get to that point this so this ... you know because we reach it or or or soil like green no because you reach a point where people say no this is to this is this I cannot tolerate any further out to eat people\nI don't want to eight people are so rare that a grid is too hot [laughter] [noise] right right do you so you so we have restoring forces in the world\nThat prevent swing too low in in this regard and these this topic story telling 'em it involves a trend that never stops and goes to rock bottom and I've ... I've seen people bounce back societies bounce back ... people in power bounce back\nSo how long you're going to deny science until it really interferes with your health and your wealth and he said oh my gosh I think I like science again and then you put the funds back in and so that's why I think we'll be okay\nJared submitted questions through our app won a vox pop\nYou think that human beings are physically incapable of understanding the fundamental nature of the universe if not what the timeline to solving taste something like dark matter\nTo question Jared ... so I think about that all the time I lose sleep on whether or slightly rephrase the question I lose sleep over whether the human mind is smart enough to actually understand the universe as it is\nAnd I worry that we may not be smart enough to even who what question to ask\nAnd this disturbs me because we know who defines humans as intelligent we do we do yeah who's to say that that is sufficient intelligence to figure out how the universe works\nSo so ah now dark matter dark energy the advantage to being modern human is that we can we can stand on the shoulders are those who came before us you don't have to invent calculus to solve the next problem somebody else did\nSo in a way we're assembling wrong by Ron a ladder of knowledge that looks over every next wall that we have confronted\nAnd so we were so maybe the sum of all the intelligence of all humans", "show_name": "1A Plus", "year": "2018", "city": "Tampa", "day": "02"}
